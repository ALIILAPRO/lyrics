		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  River's starting to bend
Water flows like the time
When it comes to end
Was it really your life
Every twist
Every turn
Every inch is predetermined

Somehow I knew
That Life will write itself out for you
Somehow I knew
Every crazy moment changed part of you
The fable made
In your head is a lie
A lie a lie a lie
A lie a lie

Purpose plays with your mind
A future always in flux
No fast forward or rewind
Just relying on luck
Every thought
Every word
Every choice a boon or burden

Somehow I knew
That Life will write itself out for you
Somehow I knew
Every crazy moment changed part of you
The fable made
In your head is a lie
A lie a lie a lie
A lie a lie

If you wait forever
For a sign or symbol
Prison of your own making
And the walls are mental
And the timeline
It's a damn lie
No one knows what I'm going to do
Can't foreshadow
It won't matter
Not to me and not to you

Somehow I knew
That Life will write itself out for you
Somehow I knew
Every crazy moment changed part of you
The fable made
In your head is a lie
A lie a lie a lie
A lie a lie
