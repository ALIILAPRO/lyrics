		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you cry
I'll stay with you till the morning light
'Cause girl, you know I'm just that kinda guy
And I hope that it's true

Baby, I can kiss you better
What exactly do you see in him?
I can kiss you better
What exactly do you see in him?

Don't say that I'm wrong
Try and explain that to my heart
'Cause I know you don't really like him anyway
Although you talk about him everyday
Close in his arms now
Girl, I'll treat you better

(Wait a minute, girl
Wait, wait a minute, girl
(Treat you better)
Wait a minute, girl
Wait, wait a minute
Figure you out, figure you out
Treat you better
Wait a minute
(Better) figure you out, I'll figure you out

What exactly do you see in him?
I can kiss you better
What exactly do you see in him?
Better
Kiss you better
Better
Kiss you better
Better
Treat you better
I can kiss you better
Treat you better
