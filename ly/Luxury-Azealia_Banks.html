		  Listen now
I'll hip you, hip you now
When I whistle, whistle owl
I'm gonna split you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow
Now I'm with you, with you now
I can't forget you, get you now

Hey, hi, hello, yo, what's up?
My, oh, me, oh boy. What's word, could I call ya?
Of late I've no one, I'm from New York
My, oh, mi amor
Who told you could, look so good?

Ooh, sire, lie next to me
So I can peek at ya before you wake
Ooh, my love, my luxury's right here if you want
You want to stay

Let me in your world
You know what I spy?
Spy you looking lonely, ya know boy that's why
I wanna be your lady
Your l-l-l-love, my l-u-x-u-r-,aye ya know what I would
If I could, if I could, if I could

Listen now
I'll hip you now
When I whistle, whistle owl
I'm gonna split you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow
Now I'm with you, with you now
I can't forget you, get you now

Uh, took a trip, took a boat, took three friends
This bitch said it's open season
Miss miss been alone and she been
Lookin for some gentlemen
I'm hoping he's been
Feeling when I fit up in the ropa
He can chill up in the villa for the whole damn weekend
Just coast with her, put your hands on her figure
Now you're gropin' her, gropin' her

Listen now
I'll hip you, hip you now
When I whistle, whistle owl
I'm gonna split you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow
Now I'm with you, with you now
I can't forget you, get you now

I swear
I'mma treat ya good babe
I'll keep up my hair
If you leave, ya know babe it'll be a nightmare
I'mma nick your name and keep you right here
Ooh yeah

Let me in your world
You know what I spy?
Spy you looking lonely, ya know boy that's why
I wanna be your lady
Your l-l-l-love, my l-u-x-u-r-,aye ya know what I would
If I could, if I could, if I could

Listen now
I'll hip you, hip you now
When I whistle, whistle owl
I'm gonna split you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow
Now I'm with you, with you now
I can't forget you, get you now
