		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run around take my soul
Soul
You cannot take me home
Home
Fuck it, take my rope
Rope
Fuck it, take my home
Home
I'm at the top of my level
I think i'm in love with the devil
Watch as they shake and they tremble
I feel all the warlocks assemble
Remember the demons get better
The tricky the clever
The visions embedded
I fall asleep in my dreams
I cannot see what it means
Flip up the tarot i'm feeling at ease
Man I hate myself
Think I might die today
I need another way
Bring me another day
Bitch I might hate myself
But I fucked your witch
But I leave her in a ditch
Can you feel my grip
With the knife I slit
Think I might lose my shit
Think I might lose my grip
Running running with the rebels
Rival to the scepter
Levitation left them
Hit them with the blessings
Encrypt a hidden message
Gothic triple 7's
Mental health has left em
Run around take my soul
Soul
You cannot take me home
Home
Fuck it, take my rope
Rope
Fuck it, take my home
Home
Run around take my soul
Soul
You cannot take me home
Home
Fuck it, take my rope
Rope
Fuck it, take my home
Home
