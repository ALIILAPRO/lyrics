		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get all the years where I was her friend (let's get all the mirrors in the bottom of the well)
I thought I lost my heartbeat (this is a piece of cake working with my hands)
This one is a page where I used too many colors (sixteen mirrors at the bottom of the well)
Roll it in a mirror, all my work will be discovered (this is a piece of cake working with my hands)

This one is a page where I (sixteen mirrors)
This one is a page where I (sixteen mirrors)
This one is a page where I (sixteen mirrors)
(Sixteen mirrors)
(Sixteen mirrors)
