		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
Yeah, yeah

I believe there's a time and a place
To let your mind drift and get out of this place
I believe there's a day and a place
That we will go to, and I know you want to share.

There's no secret to living (There's no secret to living)
Just keep on walking
There's no secret to dying (There's no secret to dying)
Just keep on flying.

I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
I'm gonna die in a space that don't hold my fame.
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls.

I believe there's a time when the cord of life
Should be cut, my friends (Cut the cord, my friend)
I believe there's a time when the cord can be cut
And this vision ends (Let this vision end).

But I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
And I'm gonna cry in a space that don't hold my fame.
Walking in the cold
Just keep on flying

There'll be a searchlight
On the mountain high

God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm a lonely soul.
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name.

God knows you are lonely souls
Lonely souls
Lonely souls
Lonely souls

I'm a lonely soul.
So long, little chapel
Pack up your light
Pack up your light

Say goodbye to the holy water life
Ohhh...
Ahhh...
