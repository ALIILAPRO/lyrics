		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh oh
Yeah yeah
Huh oh
Whoa whoa
Oh

I
I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall, I
I stand up
And then I'm OK
But then you print some shit that makes me want to scream

So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body

Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

My bones hurt from all the show hmm
But I don't feel the pain 'cause I'm a pro I
I sink in and then I'm okay eh,
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage eh

So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body

Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body!

You can't have my heart and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart (apart)
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party (ayy)

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Do what you want with me
What you want, Lady Gaga?
What you want with me, Christina?
Oh, what you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body (world, what you want with my body)
Do what you want with my body
