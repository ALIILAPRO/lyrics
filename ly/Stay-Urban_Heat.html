		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time and time and time again
I feel I'm fading away
From all that I knew and all that I could say.
Complicated reasons but I feel like I am out in the rain again.
Don't you know I'm losing hope if I'm losing my friend?
Don't you know I'm losing hope if I'm losing my friend?

Well I guess
If you want to stay
Who am I
To tell you not to feel that way?
Tell 'em all they're all better off.

Time and time and time again
You found yourself all alone
Without a sense of direction and no sense of a home.
Codependent, reaching out,
Reaching out my hand like a saint again.
Now the time is gone and lost and I am losing my friend.
Now the time is past and lost and I have lost it again.

Well I guess
If you want to stay
Who am I
To tell you not to feel that way?
Tell 'em all they're all better off.
