		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got motherfuckers actin funny
You an actor hunny
I get that bag of money and run
Im the type that make your man fall for me
Take a puff of the dutchie
Then take over the city you from
Uber XL don't have enough room to transport
The truck space required equals 44 jansports
I got motherfuckers actin funny
You an actor hunny
I get that bag of money and run

I was under the impression we were having fun
Keep your hands up this is rollercoaster 101
Every play is fourth and goal to me no I don't punt
Now I can make more than your mom and daddy in a month
And I don't show no love cause there ain't many that I trust
Money can't make me happy but to be honest it's a plus
All that goes up ends up falling
Into my lap I want all of it

Throw it in the bag
Give up everything you have to me
Throw it in the bag
Give up everything you have to me

I got motherfuckers actin funny
You an actor hunny
I get that bag of money and run
Im the type that make your man fall for me
Take a puff of the dutchie
Then take over the city you from
Uber XL don't have enough room to transport
The truck space required equals 44 jansports
I got motherfuckers actin funny
You an actor hunny
I get that bag of money and run

I got motherfuckers acting shady
I'm with dead presidents feeling like Patrick Swayze
If a bitch get out of line and start acting crazy
I'm a catch a misdemeanor here's my affidavit
Beep Beep
Who got the keys to the beamer
I'm not gay but I'm in love with Rosalia
I'm not phased when people switch up their demeanor
Everybody talks but I don't see much

Throw it in the bag
Give up everything you have to me
Throw it in the bag
Give up everything you have to me

I got motherfuckers actin funny
You an actor hunny
I get that bag of money and run
Im the type that make your man fall for me
Take a puff of the dutchie
Then take over the city you from
Uber XL don't have enough room to transport
The truck space required equals 44 jansports
I got motherfuckers actin funny
You an actor hunny
I get that bag of money and run
