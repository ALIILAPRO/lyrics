		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was like heaven
But I've been
Lost in what you said

Wish you would listen
You're killing
The dreams we always had

We don't deserve this
It's just too bad
Your change in purpose
For what we had

You make me nervous
Don't understand
Why you're changing

Can we just talk it over
Before we turn this corner
Don't look back
think we're just getting older
So can we talk this over

Is this how you see us
Broken in pieces
A torn up photograph

We don't deserve this
It's just too bad
Your change in purpose
For what we had

You make me nervous
Don't understand
Why you're changing

Can we just talk it over
Before we turn this corner
Don't look back
think we're just getting older
So can we talk this over

Can we talk this over
Can we talk this over
Can we talk this over
Can we talk this over
