		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone (love is gone)

Love is gone
Love is gone

Love is gone
I feel so hurt inside
Love is gone
Feel so hurt inside
Got to find a reason

What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone
(Love is gone)

What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone (now that the love)
(Now that the love is gone)

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone
(Love is gone)

(Love is gone)
(Love is gone)

Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason (love is gone)
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason to hold on (love is gone)
