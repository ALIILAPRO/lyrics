		<p>
		  You can skip this intro
I-I have a low attention span too
so don't worry about it 
(I love you David) yeah, yes
I think the thing about cartoon characters is like
You can imagine how they would look
Like you can just choose how they would look. you know? (yeah)

She look like Marceline when she pop a bean and she rock with me
I pull up to the scene, she's a fiend, strawberry ice-cream
Meet me at the tree and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah I am, but it don't matter 'cause you look like

Marceline when she pop a bean and she rock with me
I pull up to the scene, she's a fiend, strawberry ice-cream
Meet me at the tree and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah I am, but it don't matter 'cause I see you in my dreams

Play guitar (Jimi Hendrix)
Shawty really got it all (she does)
I won't stall (no way)
be there at the crack of dawn (time)
I'm a man now (goatee), now she wanna fall
Say she want my love, but she don't know who to call (who to call)
If I shoot my shot, then I better not miss (damn)
Shawty mentioned that she likes roses and gifts (she does)
I know that's a lie 'cause when I tried she got pissed (quarrel)
Go outside you're looking pale
I'm sorry I didn't mean it (I'm sorry)

I feel like Adventure Time
Like when I was younger
After watching some of the episodes
I always got, like
Had like a existential crisis and stuff like that
Like it's a good show, but it's definitely kinda depressing (yeah)

She look like Marceline when she pop a bean and she rock with me
I pull up to the scene, she's a fiend, strawberry ice-cream
Meet me at the tree and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah I am, but it don't matter 'cause you look like

Marceline when she pop a bean and she rock with me
I pull up to the scene, she's a fiend, strawberry ice-cream
Meet me at the tree and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah I am, but it don't matter 'cause I see you in my dreams
