		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better run and hide, baby, I know where you were last night
So I'm lightin' up the sky, settin' fire to your paradise
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi

You better run and hide, baby, I know where you were last night
So I'm lightin' up the sky, settin' fire to your paradise
You better run and hide, baby, I know where you were last night
So I'm lightin' up the sky, settin' fire to your paradise
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi

Gotta say I'm sorry and that liquor made me
Your momma never tell you how to treat a lady?
By this time tomorrow you gon' really hate me
Bet you wish you never play-ayed me
You took her in our bed, you got no respect
What did you expect? Now I burned this house down
To the left, I'm on to the next
I'ma get my sweet revenge

Tell me how you lie so easily?
You've been messin' with her, don't mess with me
Tell me how you lie so easily?
You've been messin' with her, don't mess with me

You better run and hide, baby, I know where you were last night
So I'm lightin' up the sky, settin' fire to your paradise
You better run and hide, baby, I know where you were last night
So I'm lightin' up the sky, settin' fire to your paradise
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi (you got no alibi)
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi (hmm, no, no)
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi 
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi 
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi (you got no alibi)
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi (oh, no)
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi 
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no alibi (you ain't go no alibi)
