		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah

What up, what up with you, boy?
What up with acting so coy?
I'm reading you like a book
I can tell how you feel
You wanna love me so good
Come in the mood like you should
If you want more than a look
Better prove how you feel

Like, all night, all night, all night long
All night long, I know what you want
All my, all my, all my love
All my love, I know what you want
Sorry, my mistake
If you think you're meant for me
Sorry, what can I say?

I didn't do it on purpose
I guess I got what you need
But if you're gonna make it worth it
Work it for me
I didn't do it on purpose
I guess you like what you see
But if you're gonna make it worth it
Work it for me

Oh, yeah
No, no
Oh, yeah
No, no
Oh, yeah

So what you gonna do now?
You took the words outta your mouth
You got your eyes on my lips
Beggin' to pull me in
I woke up looking this good
But I didn't do it for you
You want your hands on my hips
Why don't you pull me in?

Like, all night, all night, all night long
All night long, I know what you want
All my, all my, all my love
All my love, I know what you want
Sorry, my mistake
If you think you're meant for me
Sorry, what can I say?
(I didn't do it on-)

I didn't do it on purpose
I guess I got what you need
But if you're gonna make it worth it
Work it for me
I didn't do it on purpose
I guess you like what you see
But if you're gonna make it worth it
Work it for me

Oh, yeah
I didn't do it on purpose
No, no
Oh, yeah
No, no
Oh, yeah
