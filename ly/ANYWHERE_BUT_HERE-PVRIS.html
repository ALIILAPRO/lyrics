		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels so sad in the summer
We're goin' under
Pull up the covers
Sounds like car crashin' thunder
Losin' a lover
Your mother, your brother

I want, I want you to take me
Anywhere but here
I want, I want you to take me
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here

Smells like jasmine and clover
Blood rushin' over
And over and over
Now we drop our composure
Drunken or sober
Just take me home 'cause
I need you now

I want, I want you to take me
Anywhere but here
I want, I want you to take me
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here

Tell me lies
Soothe my soul
Say my name
Take me home

I want, I want you to take me
Anywhere but here
I want, I want you to take me
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here

(Anywhere but here)
