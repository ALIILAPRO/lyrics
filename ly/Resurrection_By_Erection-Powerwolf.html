		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When purgatory's waiting
The girl immaculate
The highest of commandments dictates to copulate
No grave is animated, you're buried all alone
So let her work a wonder
And wake your flesh and bone

Resurrection by erection
Raise your phallus to the sky and you never die
It's resurrection by erection
Raise your bone up to the sky and you never gonna die
Hallelujah, resurrection

The funeral is calling
The mortuary blow
Between my legs I'm waking
I rise from down below
Why do you think, believer
God gave you carnal lust?
So pray to get a hard-on
Before we turn to dust

Resurrection by erection
Raise your phallus to the sky and you never die
It's resurrection by erection
When you wake up from the dead and the angels give a head
Hallelujah, resurrection

Resurrection (ooh, ha)
Resurrection (ooh, ha)
Resurrection

Now I want my resurrection
All my life for resurrection
All I want is resurrection now
Oh, ha, resurrection now

The devil and the maiden
Prepare for going wild
The new messiah calling
The purgatory child
Before my flesh is fading
The virgin has a turn
The third of days we're climbing the point of no return

The resurrection by erection (resurrection by erection)
Raise your phallus to the sky and you never die
It's resurrection by erection (resurrection by erection)
Raise your bone up to the sky and you never gonna die
Hallelujah, resurrection
