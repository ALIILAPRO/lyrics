		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop, 'cause you're killing me
You brought me back and made me feel free
Rowdy waves and your energy
You pulled me fragile from the wreckage
Well, I got so lost here
Machine assisted, I disappear
To a dream, you don't wanna hear
How I got caught up in nowhere again (oh)

It feels like I've been silent running (silent running)
Through the infinite pages, I've scrolled out
Searching for a new world
Waits on the sunrise

I'm silent running
Run, run, running (oh-ohh-oh), run, run, running
Run, run, running, run, run, running (I'll be, oh)
Run, run, running (back to you), run, run, running (back to you)
I'm silent running 
Run, run, running (oh-oh-ohh)
(Oh-ohh)
(Ohh-oh-ohh-oh-ohh-oh-oh-ohh)

Stop, or you'll make me cry (make me cry)
I think it's time that I decide (I decide)
What I've done when I trip and fly (trip and fly)
The wave is taking me (taking me)
There's no way out of here (no way out)
In the labyrinth I disappear (no one here)
To the dark fleet that got me here (underground)
I got caught up in no where again

It feels like I've been silent running (silent)
Through the infinite pages, I scroll out
Searching for a new world (trip and fly)
Waits on the sunrise
I'm silent running

Here we go
Searching for gold
You make me feel so alive (I'll never be)
Demons here (I'll never see)
That I had (I'll never sigh)
Truth be told (too far to sigh)

(Ohh-ohh-oh) I'm silent running 
(No way out)
(I'll be) back to you, back to you 
I'm silent running
Run, run, running (ohh-oh-oh), run, run, running 
Run, run, running (back to you), run, run, running
Run, run, running (back to you), run, run, running (back to you)
Run, run, running, run, running

Make me cry (memories and triumph)
I decide (this is the season of madness)
Trip and fly (trip and fly), taken
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh
Ooh-oh-ooh
