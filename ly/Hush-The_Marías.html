		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't act so special
What I do is not for you
Forget about it
You made this mess
I'll knock at your door
Don't you ignore
Or forget about it

(Every night) got you runnin' in circles, I know
(Touchin' me) get your paws off my Dolce cologne
(Back it up) off my throne 'cause you know you wanna
(Make me) walk away and forget about it

Hush
(Forget about it)
Hush

Don't think you've made it
Under my skin
Could never get in
Forget about it
Don't talk so much
Your tongue is burning up
I've had enough
Forget about it

(Every night) got you runnin' in circles, I know
(Touchin' me) get your paws off my Dolce cologne
(Back it up) off my throne 'cause you know you wanna
(Make me) walk away and forget about it

Falling in my den
Full of lions, full of breath
Take the muzzle from their heads
I'm a sucker for revenge
I see you falling in my den
Full of lions, full of breath
I take the muzzle from their heads
I'm a sucker for revenge

Don't act so special
Don't act so good
Forget about it

(Every night) got you runnin' in circles, I know
(Touchin' me) get your paws off my Dolce cologne
(Back it up) off my throne 'cause you know you wanna
(Make me) walk away and forget about it

Hush
(You gotta keep it hush)
Hush
(You gotta keep it hush)
Hush
