		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, camo shorts and Bubba Kush
Yeah, we can talk, she rather fuss
This and that, 'bout such and such, man
Damn, where is the fuckin' trust?
I'm tired of the hoop and hollerin'
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the islands
Uh, then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches, yeah
I told her mind her fuckin' business
Shit, she probably out here fuckin' niggas
I'm fuckin' her friends, now her friends ain't even fuckin' wit her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off, she ain't even spellin' shit right
I text her back and tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night

Yeah, I'm single make her have to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single and I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

Uh, dreads braided to the back
I'm chillin' but my swag on full attack, haha
And my girl actin' like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home, she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man, I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, polo draws
Now make me take this polo off
Girl, you can get broken off
Yeah, I'll fuck you for an hour then I'll smoke it off
Swimmin' trunks and bathin' suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man, somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night

Yeah, I'm single make her have to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single and I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

Uh, now she got on her fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double breast
Uh, and he been fussin' all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F baby sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up, she say she just playin'
Then I falls in that pussy like quicksand
Uh, hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hangin' like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's 'bout to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single and we both lyin'
We both wrong but it feel right
Put your hands up if you're single for the night

Uh, yeah, I'm single make her have to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single and I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight, yeah

If you're single, put your hands up (uh)
If you're single (uh) put your hands up (uh)
If you're single (uh) put your, if you're single tonight

I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight, yeah
Haha, uh
Let me cut my phone back on, man
Sorry baby, but I gotta go back home, yeah
It's morning (it's morning)
