		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cry, cry for you
Just like you knew I wouldn't do
Cry, cry for you
Just like a song in the last light

Should I leave it all away
Not like the kindness that you gave
That's why it never seems the same
Behind your eyes

I stood behind when no one asked me
And took you home after the fight
I drove my car into city lights
Drove down the road that I am on

Cry, cry for you
That's what you think I want to be
Cry, cry for you
An empty heart that sees me through 

Cry, cry for you
Just like you knew I wouldn't do
Cry cry for you
Just like a song in the last light 

Cry, cry for you
Just like you knew I wouldn't do
