		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you had it all would it be enough?
Can you find your way and still be lost?
I write songs about being someone else
That say "Fuck the world" but not "I need help"

Yeah, everybody tells me it's alright
Everybody tells me I'll be fine
Everything is not o'fucking kay
Oh, but they can't tell me why
I put the picture on the shelf
Leave the memory behind
But the truth is I can't say goodbye

So I made friends with all my demons
Let 'em sink their teeth in
Got used to the feeling of letting it go
So give me something to believe in
Or throw me in the deep end
It all feels the same with your eyes closed
So you can throw me in the
Deep end (deep)
Deep end (deep end)
Deep end (deep)
Deep end

On the same old path again, from where I'm at to where I've been
I'd drift away and you'd pull me in, but the waves are deep
And I'm wearing thin, yeah
I caught myself in a lie
Guess I'm just calling to say you were right
I carry the weight of the world in my head
And it keeps me up at night

And everybody tells me it's alright
Everybody tells me I'll be fine
Everything is not o'fucking kay
Out of all the times that I've tried
I find the air is thin and I'm against the wind
With each mountain left that I climb
But the truth is I can't say goodbye

So I made friends with all my demons
Let 'em sink their teeth in
Got used to the feeling of letting it go
So give me something to believe in
Or throw me in the deep end
It all feels the same with your eyes closed
So you can throw me in the
Deep end (deep)
Deep end (deep end)
Deep end (deep)

'Cause everything is changin', memories are fadin'
Tell me that I'm fucked up
I wanna hear you say it (say it)
All my fears are slowly rearranging
Pushed them all aside but
I can feel them waiting

'Cause everything is changin'
Memories are fadin'
Tell me that I'm fucked up
I wanna hear you say it
All my fears are slowly rearranging
Pushed them all aside but
I can feel 'em waiting

So I made friends with all my demons
Let 'em sink their teeth in
Got used to the feeling of letting it go
So give me something to believe in
Or throw me in the deep end
It all feels the same with your eyes closed
So you can throw me in the
Deep end (deep)
Deep end (deep end)
Deep end (deep)
Deep end

It all feels the same with your eyes closed
