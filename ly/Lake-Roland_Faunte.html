		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm alive in a lake
With no audible sound
Something like everyone I've ever known is around me
And it looks like I've let them all down, somehow
With everything known
They had nothing to say
So I spoke
Remember the first time that you all heard my name
Was it a blessing or a curse
Has it been worse for that day and they said
No
They said we don't blame you for those worms in your head
And then this sound so forgiving said
Oh now you know, now you know, now you know
How
Hell
Hell
Looks like earth to some, all of them worth enough
That they should be
Held
And they should hold
And then like a bird
Light as my breath
My body was lifted and my eyes were shut closed
After singing these thoughts that had never been spoken of
And then like a home, was rebuilt in my head
Everything melted and just in that moment
They told me it's over but nothing is broken so
Stay
We are outside of time
So if life is so boring you can
Fade
Out of the most harmful wound
When life just goes on around you that feels like
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
