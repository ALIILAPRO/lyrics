		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said I go to work I don't ever wanna stall shit
Put it em on alert, making racks in my apartment
Put em in a hearse lately Im feeling impaulsive
Dent the universe like I'm on some Logan Paul shit

When I turned single momma told me need to watch these chicks
All they see is money they gone want my kids
Only see my future as a safety net
When I blow up and I glow up they gone want these checks

All she wanna do is send me snapchats
All I wanna know is if it claps back
Saw her on the gram I had to add that
Saw her in the city had to tap that

It's amazing what some clout will do
Once I'm done with rapping ima sell my shoes
Start a record label fund my own YouTube
And bring it all together write my own damn news

What you mean gotta dollar and a dream what else
19 I've been building up a team what else
And I've been paying rent everyday I need to pay up
I've been in the paint getting every single lay up
Ima go hard I won't ever take a day off

Beast I just flew in from the west side
Shorty in my seat to my right that's a wet ride
Know me in the streets but I grew up on the cape side
Footy getting leaked of the beat of my next line

I got off a tour I decided I didn't like that shit
All this clean money got me filthy rich
All the scene wanted was a nice ass Bitch
Shorty call me papi when she sends those vids

All she wanna know is if she look good
I just wanna know if she cook good
Need a freestyle call up west wood
Ima stay a float like some driftwood

And she asked how I got my tan
Half black half white man girl I am that man
Glass of whiskey and some rubbers that's on my night stand
Bend her over on the stage what I call mic stands

What you mean gotta dollar and a dream what else
19 I've been building up a team what else
And I've been paying rent everyday I need to pay up
I've been in the paint getting every single lay up
Ima go hard I won't ever take a day off
