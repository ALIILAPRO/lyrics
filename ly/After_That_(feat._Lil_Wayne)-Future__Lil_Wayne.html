		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You heard me? (You heard me?)
Know what come after that M
Another M, nigga, a billion
808 Mafia

I got them young niggas tweaking like where them drugs at? (What's comin' after that?)
I make them old head niggas go get they plug back
You whipping up in the foreign, them hoes love that (skrrt)
You stack the racks on them stacks and commas come after that (turn up, you gon' come after that)
Yeah, you took a few shots, but you know what come after that (you gon' come after that)
I smell that mula, that fetti, I'm coming after that (you gon' come after that)
Same for my Bimmer and Benz, see what come after that (you gon' come after that)
I'm living this life of sin, what's coming after that? (Woo, woo)

One whip whipped up (skrrt)
Ten whips came after that (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Two bitches came up (come here)
Seven bitches came after that (turn up)
Rich niggas in this building (yeah)
Rich niggas come after that (big bands)
I know you had that bitch, but I'ma dog that pussy after that
Fuck nigga, say somethin'
When I step in, jackers come after that
White gold come after that (wow)
Got Audemars coming after that (wow)
Presidentials coming after that (wow)
Vvss coming after that
Got so much money, almost gave myself a rack attack
Og coming after that (whoa)
Good kush, lean coming after that (drank)
First class my flight, nigga (flight)
You know what else coming after that
Private jets coming after that (yee)
Rockstar my whole status (hee)
Clearport, no TSA
Lil Mexico my juggin' place

I got them young niggas tweaking like where them drugs at? (What's comin' after that?)
I make them old head niggas go get they plug back
You whipping up in the foreign, them hoes love that (skrrt)
You stack the racks on them stacks and commas come after that (turn up, you gon' come after that)
Yeah, you took a few shots, but you know what come after that (you gon' come after that)
I smell that mula, that fetti, I'm coming after that (you gon' come after that)
Same for my Bimmer and Benz, see what come after that (you gon' come after that)
I'm living this life of sin, what's coming after that? (Woo, woo)

Talk shit, get bapped for that
She suck my dick, we don't kiss after that
Got to watch my own back, fuck around and get stabbed in that
Hollygrove my habitat, wish I could bring Rabbit back
Hundred shots come after that, call a ho a ho and a rat a rat
I said a hundred shots come after that, it ain't looking good like cataracts
I'ma buy me a Cadillac 'cause I don't see where I'm lacking at
Them feds tryna throw me in the box, I'm like fuck that, throw Jack in that
I'ma get that pussy wet, her other nigga just dampen that
He buy shit, he pamper that
She tap out when I'm tapping that
Tryna get as high as me, nigga, then where the fuck is your scaffold at?
Niggas flip facts like acrobats
I click-clack, what comes after that? Tunechi

I got them young niggas tweaking like where them drugs at? (What's comin' after that?)
I make them old head niggas go get they plug back
You whipping up in the foreign, them hoes love that (skrrt)
You stack the racks on them stacks and commas come after that (Young Mula, baby)
Yeah, you took a few shots, but you know what come after that (you gon' come after that)
I smell that mula, that fetti, I'm coming after that (you gon' come after that)
Same for my Bimmer and Benz, see what come after that (you gon' come after that)
I'm living this life of sin, what's coming after that? (Woo, woo)

After that
