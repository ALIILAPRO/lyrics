		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This isn't over till we talk in the light
Said I was sober but you knew that I lied
You grip the wheel, maybe I'd like to try
I'll flip it over with you and me inside

I won't atone for debts I paid for in full
Hang up my shame on display for you (for you)
I'm not the same and you don't get to decide
Who gets replaced, who gets to live and to die

So what do you want from me? So what do you want?
So what do you want from me? So what do you want?
So what do you want from me? So what do you want?
So what do you want from me? So what do you want?

So what do you want from me? So what do you want?
So what do you want from me? So what do you want? Oh

So what do you want?
