		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fragilely, fragilely I'm surrounding
The horse lies naked in the shed
Evergreen anodyne Decompounding
Flies draw sugar from his head
His eyes are blueberries, video screens
Minneapolis schemes and dried flowers
From books half read
The juice of dark cherries cover his chin
The dog walks in and the crow lies in his jaw like lead
Everything eats and is eaten, time is fed

Early evening, the pink green swallows
The spherical miracle dream
Sleepily Venus sings and hollows
The stationed headlight of a plane
You are as far from me as memory 
With fixtures fracture invariably
The juice of dark cherries cover my skin
Six years and no baby
Everything eats and is eaten

Ingydar, bears a scar like a meteor
Crystalline amber guilds her cheek
Tambourine of the beach leaf leader
To the raven playing hide and seek
Dying blueberries, figurines and the angel
Leans at the head of the bed
The juice of dark cherries cover her chin
The dog walks in and the crows lies in his smile like lead

Everything eats and is eaten, time is fed
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
