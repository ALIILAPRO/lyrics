		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

You and I go hard
At each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough
We keep throwing things and slamming the door
You and I get so
Damn dysfunctional, we start keeping score
You and I get sick
Yeah, I know that we can't do this no more, ayy

But baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go, ooh
Got you stuck on my body, on my body
Like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid
Crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you "no"
But my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "stop"
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up
In the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up
Feeling satisfied but guilty as hell, ayy

But baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you (making me love you)
And yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go, ooh (let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body
Like a tattoo (like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid
Crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die (yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (oh-oh)
And I know I said it a million times (yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah)

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoa, yeah
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah

And baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body
Like a tattoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I cross my heart and I hope to die (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (oh, oh-oh-oh)
And I know I said it a million times
(Oh, I said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah, baby, give me one more night)

So I cross my heart and I hope to die (yeah, yeah, yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know I said it a million times (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah, yeah)

I don't know, whatever
