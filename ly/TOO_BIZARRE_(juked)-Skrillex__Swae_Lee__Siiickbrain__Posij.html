		  Never be the same once I catch flame (flame)
Hater tried to play me like a lame (lame)
Well, we just came to rampage
I just want to break the stage (stage)
Everyone go insane (go!)
Everybody go insane (sane)
Rock-star hall of fame
Now there going to know your name

(Guess what?)

This is too bizarre (bizarre)
But I like things how they are (they are)
Yeah, this is too bizarre (bizarre)
But I love things how they are (they are)
My mega superstar (star)
Baby, we don't have to talk (to talk)
Ooh, ah, 'cause you're drifting off
Yeah, you just keep drifting off

Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting

Yeah, you just keep drifting off

(Guess what?)

Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz

Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz (my)

Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz

This is too bizarre (bizarre)
But I like things how they are (they are)
Yeah, this is too bizarre (bizarre)
But I love things how they are (they are)
My mega superstar (star)
Baby, we don't have to talk (to talk)
Ooh, ah, 'cause you're drifting off
Yeah, you just keep drifting off

Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting
Just keep drifting

Yeah, you just keep drifting off

(Guess what?)

Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz

Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz, my

Ah, 'cause you're 
Ooh, ah, 'cause you're drifting off
Ooh, ah, 'cause you're drifting off
Ooh, ah, 'cause you're drifting off

Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz
Pull up in that benz, my

(Guess what?)
