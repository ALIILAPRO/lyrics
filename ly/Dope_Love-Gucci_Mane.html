		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, can't stop, can't stop, yeah
What's up? what's up?
What's up? what's up?
Yeah

Yeah, comin' fresh out that Pyrex pot
Black Air Force 2's and the White Sox
Fitted on my forehead, try me, go head
I'll bring out the polka dots, put Guame on your forehead

Yeah, it's the new king of everything
And bitches don't say no to me, I'm like a wedding ring
Maybe it's how I pour that Patron
Maybe it's how I smell a pair of Silver Cologne

Maybe it's how I write shit when I'm in the zone
And I'm sick of blow jobs, bitch, leave me alone
And tell Dr. Dre to pick up a phone
Before I climb through his window like ?Nigga, I'm Home?

Runnin' the rock like OJ, nigga it's a throwback
Fuck a Aston Martin, show me where the stove at
Get a jar, some baking soda, nigga hold that
The world is my grandma's kitchen, time to cook crack

The dope boys in the building
What's up? The dope boys
What's up? The dope boys

What's up? The dope boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The dope boys
What's up? The dope boys

What's up? The dope boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The dope boys
What's up? The dope boys

What's up? The dope boys in the building
What's up? The dope boys
What's up? The dope boys
Yeah, the dope boys in the building

You couldn't smell that crack
Comin' out that motherfucking Porsche truck
I stop traffic with them rims that I'm sittin' on
Them ain't high beams, bitch, my wrist is on
The same shit that Ludacris is on
Disturbing the peace if my stash missing stones

Yeah, count that work like a paycheck
Niggas couldn't play The Game in a tape-deck
A boss never touch work if it ain't taped yet
That's how you get fucked, I practice safe sex

And I take ya boy Curtis bitch, with my tongue
Lick, lick, lick like Shawna and have her sprung
Show her my inner-condom and have her sprung
And put it all in her stomach and just, uh

What's up? The dope boys in the building
What's up? The dope boys
What's up? The dope boys

What's up? The dope boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The dope boys
What's up? The dope boys

What's up? The dope boys in the building
(New York, what's up?)
The dope boys
(LA, what's up?)
The dope boys
(Chi-Town, what's up?)

The dope boys in the building
Detroit, What's up?
(ATL, what's up?)
The dope boys
(MIA, what's up?)
The dope boys in the building
Yeah, what's up?

So roll that coke, white carpet to the hood
It's the dope boys reunion, the dress code's strictly
White tee, Air Force 1's and some Dickies
I'm from the city where the skinny niggas die
Only birds and Nextels chirp in the sky

And we ride for the letters on our fitted cap
Niggas, hit the stash, get a strap, and go get it back
That's for the gangstas, the hustlas, the ballas
From Downtown LA to Uptown Harlem

And D-Boy money ain't rain and it's stormin'
So stop the music when the Champagne pouring
And hold them glasses high, yeah
And when a nigga ask you, why? You tell 'em

The dope boys in the building
What's up? The dope boys
What's up? The dope boys

What's up? The dope boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The dope boys
I'm back, The dope boys

I'm back, the dope boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The dope boys
Nigga, what's up? The dope boys
Motherfucker, what's up?

The dope boys in the building
Tell 'em I'm back, the dope boys
?Cause I'm back, the dope boys
It's a wrap, The dope boys in the building

The dope boys
The dope boys
The dope boys in the building

The dope boys
The dope boys
Yeah, what's up? What's up?
Hahaha, yeah, the king is back
