		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Plan B like candy
Hands always cold from the nicotine
Put your whole life in the backseat 
Here comes the rapture for this Long Island heart that bleeds

How's anyone else gonna love you, if you don't love you too?
I'll figure it out, but for the moment just use me like you do
Yeah, cause we were born to lose

Yeah, we were born to lose, to lose, to lose 
We were born to lose, to lose, to lose
We were born to lose 

Feel like my whole life is counting down to something 
But then I woke up I guess it's really nothing 

Lost in such a hopeless town
Filled with deadbeat dropouts and fucking clowns
White trash overflowing out of filthy mouths
Go talk to Jesus let him tell you that there's no way out

How's anyone else gonna love you, if you don't love you too?
I'll figure it out, but for the moment just use me like you do
Yeah, cause we were born to lose

Yeah, we were born to lose, to lose, to lose 
We were born to lose, to lose, to lose

Feel like my whole life is counting down to something 
But then I woke up I guess it's really nothing 

Feel like my whole life is counting down to something 
But then I woke up I guess it's really nothing 

Feel like my whole life is counting down to something 
But then I woke up 

We were born to lose 
So use me like you do 
Cause we were born to lose 
We were born to lose 
We were born to lose 

Feel like my whole life is counting down to something 
But then I woke up I guess it's really nothing 

Feel like my whole life is counting down to something 
But then I woke up
