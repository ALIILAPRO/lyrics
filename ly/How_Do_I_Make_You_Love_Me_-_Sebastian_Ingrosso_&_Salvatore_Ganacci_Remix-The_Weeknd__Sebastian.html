		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And I can hear the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine

How do I make you love me?
I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And how do I make you love me?
I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine

I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And I can hear the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And I can hear the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And I can hear the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine

And
And

How do I make you love me?
I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And how do I make you love me?
I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And I'll teach you how to shine
And how do I make you love me?

And
And
And
