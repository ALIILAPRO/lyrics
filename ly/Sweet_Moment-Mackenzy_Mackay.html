		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1: 
 
From the neck 
I’ll be licking that down
With a face 
Looking like u might pounce
Any second 
I been thinking bout it loads out loud
Can I Kiss you on the hips
Show you tricks with the mouth
I just wanna see you for a sweet moment
Yes I been away and now I’m back I’m all in
And your bed wouldn’t stop calling
My name. 
 
Pre chorus: 
 
never could be too late
Lay down
I go down and you shake
Your legs are trembling
You rain, you doused me
You came and you found these
 
Chorus:
 
Ways 
Just To show me how much you like it
And Waves
Crashing upon all over my lips
Say
Oh would you look what the time is
Silence is so far away
 
Verse 2:
 
Never will I get used
To how you make me feel
Much too nice and it seeems Fake
Yeah you got this head way over these heels
Got me So high on you I can barely see straight
 
Now we on the bed sheets
All wet so sweaty 
Like yes please 
Breath on my skin so heavy
I’m dreaming how can I
Be awake?
 
Pre chorus 2:
 
never could be too late
Lay down
I go down and you shake
Your legs are trembling
You rain, you doused me
You came and you found these
 
Chorus 2:
 
Ways 
Just To show me how much you like it
And Waves
Crashing upon all over my lips
Say
Oh would you look what the time is
Silence is so far away
All these ways 
Just To show me how much you like it
And Waves
Crashing upon all over my lips
Say
Oh would you look what the time is
Silence is so far away
 
Verse 3: 
 
So far away from being quiet I know
And the Silence is miles from here I’ll slow this
Time as I ride the waves you can’t hold in
The sight from my point of view is soo
golden 
 
Soaking me 
Drench me with sweetness
Volume increasing, you feel it
Oh you’re quite a tease when your
Looking this appealing
 
All these sweet moments
