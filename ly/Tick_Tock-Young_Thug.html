		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, Spider (slime)

Yeah, okay, shit, I just woke up in a Animal
I just woke up in a Lambo'
Flawless baguettes and the orange Richard
I just had bust down a cantaloupe
Niggas want beef, and I'm tryna be vegan
But fuck it, bae, bring a can of smoke
I can't see niggas in the glasses store (swear)
Slidin' in the coupe in the back
Smoke out the bag, too big for a sack
Do you see her baby hair goin' down her back?
Shawty look just like a two-year-old brat (goddamn)
Just like a record, get scratched 
Y'all niggas rats, dispatch (dispatch)
I got four Blacks, Kit-Kat (ooh)
Dick in her back, I'm dad
"Player, where you from?"
Talk 'bout the trenches, I came out the trenches
I came from the roaches, I came from the riches 
I'm from where they call you a rat if you snitchin' (woo)
I came from the same damn street as the pimpin'
I'm raised by them junkies, we sleep with them bitches
Young nigga came from nothin', he'll give up his kidney
But Saint Laurent still tryna cease-and-desist it, woo
Niggas say, "How do you keep up with millions?"
My nigga, I'm straight out the trenches, woo
Niggas say let go they bitches, we treatin' them right
And we grantin' they wishes, woo
I was a Capo in my hood way 'fore a plaque or a mention (woo)
He can get hit with the 'stension (woo)
Shot for the folk, but I missed it (yeah)

Tick tock, tick tock, ten shots to your side like tick tock (tick tock)
When I bow down to my bitch, it come with a big rock (big rock)
Do you wan' know how it is (what?), when you a big dawg? (Yeah)
You might gotta take the assist (and what?), let your dawg get the big shot (woo)
Tick tock, tick tock, ten shots to your side like tick tock (tick tock, tick tock)
When I bow down to my bitch, it come with a big rock
Do you wan' know how it is (what?), When you a big dawg? (Yeah)
You might gotta take the assist (and what?), let your dawg get the big shot

Yeah, she put the L in "love" (yeah)
Yeah, I put the L in "lust" (yeah)
I put the T in "trust" (yeah)
I always trust my guts (hah)
I've just been shittin' with no flush, yeah
Poppin' my shit, say, "Church," yeah
Kickin' my pimpin', no crutch, yeah (crutch)
Bad ass bitch, and she Dutch (hey)
I made me some mills, that's a must (uh-huh)
We not overseas, why rush? (Uh-huh)
She tried to play it hard, lil' slut (on what?)
I hit that lil' bitch, now I'm clutch (clutch)
Got Versace on top of my nuts (woo)
Put Cavalli on an old ass slut (slut)
Shoot a video, no cut (cut)
Gucci stroller for the kids, so what? (Yeah)

Tick tock, tick tock, ten shots to your side like tick tock (tick tock)
When I bow down to my bitch, it come with a big rock (big rock)
Do you wan' know how it is (and what?), when you a big dawg? (Yeah)
You might gotta take the assist (what?), let your dawg get the big shot (woo)
Tick tock, tick tock, ten shots to your side like tick tock (tick tock, tick tock)
When I bow down to my bitch, it come with a big rock
Do you wan' know how it is (what?), when you a big dawg? (Yeah)
You might gotta take the assist (and what?), Let your dawg get the big shot
