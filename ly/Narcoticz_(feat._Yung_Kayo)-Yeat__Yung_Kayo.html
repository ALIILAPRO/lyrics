		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Noddin' off the Percs, I swear I love it
I'ma geek up, baby, tell me who doesn't
No, don't lie about the money comin' in
We see it all, yeah, you did not double (uh, uh)
Fuck 12, yeah, we always in trouble
Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, let's go

Good college
She got good brain, she got good knowledge (yeah)
Yeah, close one eye, I'm illuminati (illuminati)
We been movin' dope, movin' narcotics (yeah)
Yeah, take a lot of Percs, I been out my body
I take more Xans, yeah, narcotics (narcotics)
Pour another deuce, yeah, narcotics (narcotics)
Bad bitches, yeah, and they all hotties (all hotties)
Big bodies, hydraulics (hydraulics)
Big Tonka, stretch 'em out
Put 'em up, get 'em gone (yeah)
Take a Perc (yeah), feelin' gone (yeah)
Whole world gettin' smacked
Yeah, y'all get smacked
And the drank just like some craft (craft)
We don't talk about it like that

Big slow on prescription meds
I just pulled up with the Christian, yes
Told the bitch she get the new Herm√®s
I don't know nobody, I'm stressed
Four months I was on the X (on the X)
If you don't know about it, don't guess
Her head go back, PEZ, yeah
Pulled it out, bust on her head, yeah
I just pulled up on her, yeah, yeah
I just pull up on her, yeah, yeah
Juggin' out, we hit 'em hard for money
Comin' out, we hear them all comin'

They said that they is not scared, they runnin'
I don't got time to talk, I just make money
Y'all jokes, I find a lot of y'all funny (ha)
Snot nose, pull up on them, they do bunny
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I'm not your twizz, lil' bitch, I'm not your buddy
Uh-uh, uh-uh, say it again, not your kid, not your Cudi

Noddin' off the Percs, I swear I love it (swear I love it)
I'ma geek up, baby, tell me who doesn't
No, don't lie about the money comin' in
We see it all, yeah, you did not double (uh)
You don't fit inside this squad or this bubble
Fuck 12, yeah, we always in trouble
Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, let's go

Good college
She got good brain, she got good knowledge (yeah)
Yeah, close one eye, I'm illuminati (illuminati)
We been movin' dope, movin' narcotics (yeah)
Yeah, take a lot of Percs, I been out my body
I take more Xans, yeah, narcotics (narcotics)
Pour another deuce, yeah, narcotics (narcotics)
Bad bitches, yeah, and they all hotties (all hotties)
Big bodies, hydraulics
Big Tonka, stretch 'em out
Put 'em up, get 'em gone
Take a Perc, feelin' gone
Whole world gettin' smacked (smacked)
Yeah, y'all get smacked (smacked)
And the drank just like some craft (craft)
We don't talk about it like that

You can get smacked with this TEC
Most of these niggas go tit for tat
I run through bitches, they trends, I'm into that
I posted in the hills, do you know where I'm livin' at, ha
Told her to hand me my med' box
You hang with narcissists, I want the narcotics
I got a hot head but swear that I'm cold hearted (hey)
Touch one my brothers, I swear I'ma die 'bout it
Don't get in that SUV 'cause you can't hide 'bout it
I got me a bigger, I roll with a wide body
She tryna get close but my eyes goin' farsighted
And everythin' we been through, it's been a hard time (time)
Hop out a four-door, I know you not into that
That boy got an old gun, it's a gen three
Bitches checkin' in my room before checkin' me
Told her to Perc' me up, y'all niggas fentanyl
Had a hundred K in my backpack and I spend it all
I'd rather not go in the BM then spend it all
My plug dropped the P's and I get it gone (get it gone)
Get it gone (get it gone)

They said that they is not scared, they runnin'
I don't got time to talk, I just make money
Y'all jokes, I find a lot of y'all funny (ah)
Snot nose, pull up on them, they do bunny
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I'm not your twizz, lil' bitch, I'm not your buddy
Uh-uh, uh-uh, say it again, not your kid, not your cuddy

Noddin' off the Percs, I swear I love it
I'ma geek up, baby, tell me who doesn't
No, don't lie about the money comin' in
We see it all, yeah, you did not double (uh)
You don't fit inside this squad or this bubble
Fuck 12, yeah, we always in trouble
Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, let's go
