		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The drinks are flowing, just like the river
Then she keeps going
The whole night ends with a blur
She's got no limit, she thinks she's so tough
Can't walk a straight line
The end of the night, she's rough

Her dress whispers reckless
That night starts now
And she slips on her necklace

Josey, don't you worry
It's just a phase you're going through
Some day you'll know just what to do
Josey, it's alright
Slap the hand that just keeps pouring
It doesn't matter, just do something

She's ready to roll, tonight is different
She'll start it off slow
To keep herself in check
Oh no, oh no, it's two for one
She starts the show now
From this moment on, she's done

Her dress whispers reckless
That night starts now
And she slips on her necklace

Josey, don't you worry
It's just a phase you're going through
Some day you'll know just what to do
Josey, it's alright
Slap the hand that just keeps pouring
It doesn't matter, just do something

The party is tonight
And she thinks they're playing her song
The party is tonight
And it's playing all night long

Josey, don't you worry
It's just a phase you're going through
Some day you'll know just what to do
Josey, it's alright
Slap the hand that just keeps pouring
It doesn't matter, just do something
