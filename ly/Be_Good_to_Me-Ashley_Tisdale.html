		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you be good to me?
Be good, be good, be good, be good, be good
Can you be good to me?

Every day it's getting worse
You do the same things and it hurts
I don't know if I should cry
All I know is that I'm trying

I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you
But you make it so hard to do

What's the point of making plans?
You break all the ones we have
I don't know where we went wrong
'Cause we used to be so strong

I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you
So why can't you be
Be good to me?

I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need

Somebody to be, somebody to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Can you be good to me, good to me?
Please!

I used to think I had it all
Then one day we hit a wall
I had hoped you were the one
That was my dream, where has it gone?

I wanted to be with you
Forever, just me and you
So why can't you be
Be good to me?

I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need

Somebody to be, somebody to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Can you be good to me, good to me?
Please!

Where do I go from here?
You've gotten under my skin
And I don't know how
To get out of this place that I'm in

I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need

Somebody to be, somebody to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Can you be good to me, good to me?
Please!

I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need

Somebody to be, someone to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Can you be good to me, good to me?
Please!

Be good, be good, be good, be good
Can you be good to me?
Be good, be good, be good, be good
Can you be good to me, good to me
Please!
