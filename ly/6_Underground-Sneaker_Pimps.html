		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me down
6 underground
The ground beneath your feet
Laid out low
Nothing to go
Nowhere a way to meet

I've got a head full of drought
Down here
So far off of losing out
Round here
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace

Calm me down
Bring it round
Too way high off your street
I can see
Like nothing else
In me
You're better than I wannabe
Don't think 'cos I understand
I care,
Don't think 'cos I'm talking
We're friends
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace

Talk me down
Safe and sound,
Too strung up to sleep
Wear me out
Scream and shout
Swear my time's never cheap
I fake my life like I've lived
Too much,
I take whatever you're given, not enough

Overground, watch this
Space, I'm open
I fake my life like I've lived
Too much,
I take whatever you're given, not enough
Overground, watch this
Space, I'm open
To falling
From grace.
