		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aw shit, get your towels ready it's about to go down (shorty, yeah)
Everybody in the place hit the fucking deck (shorty, yeah)
But stay on your motherfucking toes
We running this, let's go

I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat) I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
Everybody look at me
'Cause I'm sailing on a boat (sailing on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat) I'm on a boat
Take a good hard look at the motherfucking boat (boat, yeah)

I'm on a boat motherfucker take a look at me
Straight floatin' on a boat on the deep blue sea
Busting five knots, wind whipping out my coat
You can't stop me motherfucker cause I'm on a boat

Take a picture, trick (trick) I'm on a boat, bitch (bitch)
We drinking Santana champ, 'cause it's so crisp (crisp)
I got my swim trunks and my flippie-floppies
I'm flipping burgers, you at Kinko's, straight flipping copies

I'm riding on a dolphin, doing flips and shit
The dolphin's splashing, getting everybody all wet
But this ain't Sea World, this is real as it gets
I'm on a boat, motherfucker, don't you ever forget

I'm on a boat and, it's going fast and
I got a nautical themed Pashmina Afghan
I'm the king of the world on a boat like Leo
If you're on the shore, then you're sure not me-oh

Get the fuck up, this boat is real!

Fuck land, I'm on a boat, motherfucker (motherfucker)
Fuck trees, I climb buoys, motherfucker (motherfucker)
I'm on the deck with my boys, motherfucker (yeah)
This boat engine make noise, motherfucker

Hey ma, if you could see me now (see me now)
Arms spread wide on the starboard bow (starboard bow)
Gonna fly this boat to the moon somehow (moon somehow)
Like Kevin Garnett, anything is possible

Yeah, never thought I'd be on a boat (let's go)
It's a big blue watery road (yeah)
Poseidon look at me, oh (all hands on deck)

Never thought I'd see the day
When a big boat coming my way
Believe me when I say, I fucked a mermaid

I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat
Everybody look at me 'cause I'm sailing on a boat (whoa)
I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat
Take a good hard look at the motherfuckin' boat (shorty, shorty, yeah)
