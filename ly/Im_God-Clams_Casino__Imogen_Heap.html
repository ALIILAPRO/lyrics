		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did you know?
It's what I've always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down, please?

It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths

It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths

It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what
I think
Bite tongue, deep breaths
