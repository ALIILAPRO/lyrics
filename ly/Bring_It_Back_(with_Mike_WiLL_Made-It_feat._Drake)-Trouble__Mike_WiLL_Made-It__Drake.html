		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let do it
Money man
Go get your money man, go get that
Go for that shit now, go get your money man
Mike Will Made-it bitch

Ounces in my motherfucking pantry
Diamonds on a young nigga, dancing
Just dropped some bank rolls on some glasses
Just dropped your bitch off, man that hoe so nasty
Huh, all about that paper, can't miss a beat
Yeah, I'ma get some cho-cho, one thing 'bout me
Yeah, gas up all that old shit, miss me with that
I could put you frontline, just bring it back

Bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Don't wanna have to chase you down 'bout no stack
'Cause I will blow you back, bring it back, this hoe here throw it back

Yeah, tryna show me that she 'bout it
'Bout it, 'bout it, yeah, shawty 'bout it, 'bout it, yeah
Take the charger, bad lil shawty say she 'bout it
I gotta come for you, you shot at my lil' partner though
The loud wild off the gate, don't need your molly
As a git, you scraped the candy, Mr. Charlie
Nowadays I ride a foreign by Mr. Charlie
I got the game down now, sorry Mr. Charlie
Ayy, she say you so motherfucking hood
But you ain't no motherfucking good
Might be right, gift and a curse, I take it all this blessing
Know you fucking with a real one though, no question
Partna you gon' get spent doin' all that flexing
So many of us shooting you straight, ain't no pressure
Hating on that man won't do you no blessing
Tryna teach a young nigga flexing
Wanna go to war, but you ain't got no money
Worry 'bout these hoes and you ain't got no money
Mike Will Made-It
Big Trouble, baby

Ounces in my motherfucking pantry
Diamonds on a young nigga, dancing
Just dropped some bank rolls on some glasses
Just dropped your bitch off, man that hoe so nasty
Huh, all about that paper, can't miss a beat
Yeah, I'ma get some cho-cho, one thing 'bout me
Yeah, gas up all that old shit, miss me with that
I could put you frontline, just bring it back

Bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Don't wanna have to chase you down 'bout no stack
'Cause I will blow you back, bring it back, it's on here, throw it back

Yeah, I don't play no games boy, I'm at your head
All about the family, niggas took the pledge
Now you gotta own up to that shit you said
You can't push us to the edge, Trouble from the edge
Hit the gas and we outta there
Do it for the Six because we started there
I got a girl that used to ride around with 'Pac an' them
I gotta get it, you came from my lil partner then
Yeah, Richard Mille, heavy on the watch
Extra million just to see the Maybach drop
Crest white smile on my face
Once I get to snapping ain't nobody safe
Reality gon' hit ya or we gon' hit ya
Either way if they was with ya, they going with ya
Mike WiLL Made-It
Me and Big Trouble baby

Ounces in my motherfucking pantry
Diamonds on a young nigga, dancing
Just dropped some bank rolls on some glasses
Just dropped your bitch off, man that hoe so nasty
Huh, all about that paper, can't miss a beat
Yeah, I'ma get some cho-cho, one thing 'bout me
Yeah, gas up all that old shit, miss me with that
I could put you frontline, just bring it back

Bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Don't wanna have to chase you down 'bout no stack
'Cause I will blow you back, bring it back, it's on here, throw it back
