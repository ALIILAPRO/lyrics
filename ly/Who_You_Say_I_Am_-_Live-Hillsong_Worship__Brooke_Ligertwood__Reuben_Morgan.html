		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me?
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh, His love for me
Oh, His love for me

Who the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes, I am

Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes, He died for me

Who the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes, I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes, I am

I am chosen
Not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me
Not against me
I am who You say I am

I am chosen
Not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me
Not against me
I am who You say I am
I am who You say I am

Who the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes, I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes, I am

In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes, I am
