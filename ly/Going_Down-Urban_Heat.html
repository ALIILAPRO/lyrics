		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At noon the guests arrive.
It's time to leave port. Everyone's dressed to the nines.
Well, they say that we've run aground.
It's all pouring in and they can't seem to get it down.

We're all going down.
Together we go down.
And there's only one way I've found to keep us from going...

In the hull below the deck
anything flows. Have you gotten your fix yet?
So tell me, tell me, tell me what you got.
We're going nowhere and I'm the one pouring the shots.

We're all going down.
Together we go down.
And there's only one way I've found to keep us from going...

Together we go down.
