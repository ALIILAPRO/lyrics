		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frozen in the place I hide 
Not afraid to paint my sky 
With some who say I've lost my mind 
Brother try and hope to find 

You were always so far away 
I know that pain
So don't you run away like you used to do 

Roses in a vase of white 
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves 
That fall because my hand is pulling them hard as I can 

You were always so far away 
I know that pain 
And I won't run away like I used to do 

Pictures in a box at home 
Yellowing and green with mold 
So I can barely see your face 
Wonder how that color taste 

You were always so far away 
I know the way 
So don't you run away like you used to do 
Like you used to do
