We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it but we're tryin' to fight it

More war in Afghanistan
Cubs go all the way again
Obama, Spielberg

Michael Phelps, Y2K
Boris Johnson, Brexit
Kanye West and Taylor Swift
Stranger Things, Tiger King
Ever Given, Suez

We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it but we're tryin' to fight it

Sandy Hook, Columbine
Sandra Bland and Tamir Rice
ISIS, LeBron James
Shinzo Abe blown away
Meghan Markle, George Floyd

Michael Jordan, 45
Woodstock '99
Keaton Batman, Bush v. Gore
I can't take it anymore

We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it but we're tryin' to fight it

Elon Musk, Kaepernick
Texas failed electric grid
Jeff Bezos, climate change
White rhino goes extinct
Great Pacific garbage patch
Tom DeLonge and aliens
Mars rover, Avatar
Self-driving electric cars
SSRIs
Prince and The Queen die
World Trade, second plane
What else do I have to say?

We didn't start the fire (we didn't start it up)
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire (we didn't start it up)
But when we are gone, it will still go on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
We didn't start the fire (fire)
It was always burning since the world's been turning
