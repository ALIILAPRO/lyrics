		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe you're better off with her
I think she's better for you
I forgot how great it felt to be us
Guess I got carried away

I had to use you to make me feel strong
But I don't care about that now
I see a tower built out of my mistakes
And it all comes crashing down

Is there something I can do?
Is there something I can do?
Is there something I can do?
Can I make it up to you?
