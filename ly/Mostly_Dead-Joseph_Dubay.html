		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate the way he talks to you
So over confident
Going bald by thirty-two 
Oh what a manly-man
He's so above the law
Well I'll Paint my nails 
And I'll break his jaw 

Tell me that I'm just a ghost
I don't think that I can make it 
Any worse than I've made it 
Tell me who you love the most 
I don't think that I can fake it 
Any worse than I'm faking it now
The things we said 
Are all in my head 
My blood runs red
But I'm mostly dead (Oh mostly dead)

I've been trying real hard to impress you
But that's not an issue now
When you take me up to your bedroom
Feeling like I won this round
Your mama hates me 
And your sister thinks I'm reckless
But I know baby
That my hand's your favorite necklace 

Tell me that I'm just a ghost
I don't think that I can make it 
Any worse than I've made it 
Tell me who you love the most 
I don't think that I can fake it 
Any worse than I'm faking it now
The things we said 
Are all in my head 
My blood runs red
But I'm mostly dead

Darling, I'm so drained but I can't 
Fall asleep tonight 
I can't comprehend this bed I'm in
Without you by my side 
I get so afraid that all I'll ever do
Is haunt you
God it makes me weak to think
How bad I fucking want you

Tell me am I just a ghost
I don't think that I can make it 
Any worse than I've made it 

Tell me who I love the most 
I don't think that I can fake it 
Any worse than I'm faking it now
The things we said 
Are all in my head 
My blood runs red
But I'm mostly dead
Tell me that I'm just a ghost
I don't think that I can make it 
Any worse than I've made it 
Tell me who I love the most 
I don't think that I can fake it 
Any worse than I'm faking it now
The things we said 
Are all in my head 
My blood runs red
But I'm mostly (Mostly)  
Mostly (Mostly) 
Dead
