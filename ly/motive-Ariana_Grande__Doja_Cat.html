		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Murda, Murda)

Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna turn me on
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna make me yours

'Cause I see you trying
Subliminally trying 
To see if I'm gon' be the one that's in your arms
I admit it's exciting
Parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on

Baby, tell me what's your motive?
What's your motive? What's your motive?
So tell me what's your motive?
What's your motive? What's your motive?

I could call bullshit out from a mile away (don't say)
You'll want me if you can
Keep coming back for me
Might have to curve you 
If you just can't talk straight (just say)
Say what you mean, 'cause you might get it

'Cause I see you trying
Subliminally trying 
To see if I'm gon' be the one that's in your arms
I admit it's exciting
Parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on

Tell me what's your motive?
What's your motive? What's your motive? (Uh)
So tell me what's your motive?
What's your motive? What's your motive?

(Yah, yah, ayy)
You treat me like gold baby
Now you wanna spoil me
Did you want a trophy?
Or you wanna sport me, baby?
Want me on your neck 'cause you wanted respect
'Cause you're fighting some war, baby
Well I had to bring the fists out
Had to put a wall up
But don't trust phonies, baby
You gotta tell me what's your motive, baby

'Cause you got your candy on your arm
No need to sugarcoat a lie
Say what you want 
I needed a real bonafide G
Can you promise me
You'll bring it all tonight
'Cause I need you to be wise
Tell me everything that's on your mind

Baby, tell me what's your motive?
What's your motive? What's your motive?
What's your motive? What's your motive? (uh)
So tell me what's your motive? (yeah, tell me, baby)
What's your motive? What's your motive?
What's your motive? (yeah, ayy)
