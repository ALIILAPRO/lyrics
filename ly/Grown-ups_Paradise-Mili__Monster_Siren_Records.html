		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you recall?
We couldn't wait to become adults
We dreamed
We grew
And now we are stuck

In a grown-up's hellish paradise
I'm down on my knees, carrying our sins
In order to be heard
In order to be heard
Must I deliver loud and clear in sound waves of violence?

Plastic mini trucks, dollies
We were so easily satisfied and happy
Even if I break your favorite teddy bear
A "sorry" could fix everything

When did it change? When did we forget?
Why is it now so hard to forgive?
Do we advance, never stopping our steps
Because we are scared to look back on what we did?

Do you recall?
Back when a smile was more than enough
To make us friends
Do you recall?
We couldn't wait to become adults
We dreamed
We grew
And now we are stuck

In a grown-up's hellish paradise
I'm down on my knees, carrying our sins
Pretending you're still here
Pretending you're still here
As my confidence disappeared, I clung onto your silence

Even if tricycles become battleships, finger guns become real
We are still lost

Where's our tomorrow?
Where does our future go?
Does our hope have to be sown upon somebody's sorrow?

Truth is, I know as long as we live
Our ideals dye rivers scarlet
Firing shots in the name of justice
Declaring love we can only reminisce
As cruelty becomes heroic
I'm on your ark
Answer me, my sinking ship
Where's our tomorrow?
Where does our future go?
Does our hope have to be sown upon somebody's sorrow?
