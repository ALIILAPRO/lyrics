Uh
Now you niggas know I talk nothin' but cash shit, know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

Run up them racks like I wanna
Count up them racks with GunWunna (count up them racks with GunWunna)
Carats, I'on't want no more pointers
Clarity V's, I see water (clarity V's, I see water)
Talk that cash shit like I wanna
Talk that cash shit like I wanna (hold on)

Uh, stones in my teeth, I don't talk for free
I don't care to speak, I'ma be brief (I'ma be brief)
Goyard the brief, I got a freak
She havin' C, we wanna see (we wanna see)
How many M's? (Many M's) 
Smokin' grams, I smoke out the P, she with the P (yeah)
I'ma prevail (prevail), parasail I float through the sea, yacht overseas
Count up, then stack some more hundreds (more hundreds)
Geeked up, I don't wanna go under (geeked up, I don't wanna go under)
They know I can come make it thunder (they know I can come make it thunder)
Can't see me like young Stevie Wonder (can't see me)
I drip like a sweat in the sauna (the sauna)
I swear, I can't wait for the summer (I swear, I can't wait for the summer)
Pop out, when I drip, it's a puddle (a puddle)
You know ain't no need to be subtle (nah)

Run up them racks like I wanna (wanna)
Count up them racks with GunWunna (Wunna)
Carats, I'on't want no more pointers (carats, I'on't want no more pointers)
Clarity V's, I see water (clarity V's, I see water)
Talk the cash shit like I wanna (huh, hold on)
Talk the cash shit like I wanna (huh, huh, hold on)

Uh, stand on ten toes, heart gettin' cold
I don't suppose, far from a ho (far from a ho)
Watchin' 'em close, I'm 'cross the globe
You niggas broke, energy low
I don't really care though (nah)
Out the barrel, man, free my bro Jeffro
Back to business, it's way more dinero (way more dinero)
Goddamn it, I started with zero, ain't have a hero
I think I'm spoiled, I see nobody (nah)
I don't give no fuck how you go 'bout it (how you go 'bout it)
Pull up, pull off in a big body (skrrt)
Got a few bitches with new bodies (with new bodies)
Take the top off, let the smoke out it (yeah)
Count up that cash in a new Audi (new Audi)
Tint is so dark, I can't see out it (can't see out it)
Might hit them racks, had to re-route it (had to re-route it)

Run up them racks like I wanna (wanna)
Count up them racks with GunWunna (Wunna)
Carats, I'on't want no more pointers (carats, I'on't want no more pointers)
Clarity V's, I see water (clarity V's, I see water)
Talk the cash shit like I wanna (huh, hold on)
Talk the cash shit like I wanna
