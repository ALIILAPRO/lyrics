		  Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of the mother and her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around

Sweet girl, your love is all around

My heart starts boom, my arms feel weak
My head is exploding every day of the week
Can't eat, can't sleep 'cause your body so sweet
Put your hands to my heart, can you feel the beat?
You the wonderful girl with that sexual healing
When I wanna hold your hand then I get this feeling
You're the only one, feel so proud
Sweet, sweet girl your love is all around

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of the mother and her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around

I'm dancin', and I feel like flyin'
Then I see this girl, she is crying
I take her in my arms, it's like a dream
The most beautiful girl in the world I've seen
Look up to me, I see it in your eyes
The moment of truth, no more lies
It's love, love at the first sight
Like heaven on earth with shining bright

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of the mother and her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around

Sweet girl, your love is all around

My heart starts boom, my arms feel weak
My head is exploding every day of the week
Can't eat, can't sleep 'cause your body so sweet
Put your hands to my heart, can you feel the beat?
You the wonderful girl with that sexual healing
When I wanna hold your hand then I get this feeling
You're the only one, feel so proud
Sweet, sweet girl your love is all around

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of the mother and her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of the mother and her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
