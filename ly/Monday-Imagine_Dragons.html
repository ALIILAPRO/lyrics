		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're down on your luck
I take the reigns, baby, turn it up
When you're faced to the floor
I turn the dial, turn it up, more
I'm there for you
Will you be there for me, too? Ooh

I believe (I believe) in a god (in a god)
I'm pound-for-pound, baby, turn it on
A million calls will never be, I never get enough of you
I never get enough of you

You are my Monday, you're the best day of the week
So underrated and a brand new start
Don't care what all the kids say
You've got the key to my heart
Ooh

When you call (when you call) on the phone (on the phone)
I never let you hear the dial tone
I believe (I believe) in your touch (in your touch)
I know I can be a little much
I'm there for you
Will you be there for me too? Ooh

You are my Monday (you are my Monday)
You're the best day of the week (best day of the week)
So underrated (so underrated)
And a brand new start (brand new start)
Don't care what all the kids say
You've got the key to my heart
Ooh

You can be the one that I've been waiting all my life for
You could be the key to lead me up into the highest rung
Give me loving, keep me going 'til the midnight hour
Bring me up, lift me up to your rainbow top
Your rainbow top

My Monday, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Monday, my, my Monday
My Monday
My Monday, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
