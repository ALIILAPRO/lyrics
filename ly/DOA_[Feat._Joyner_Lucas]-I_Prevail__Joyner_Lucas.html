		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On our knees, we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival

I close my eyes and contemplate on why I chose to be great
I found myself tryin' to escape from where I'm 'posed to be safe
Or maybe I should pray like I'm supposed to be saved
Sometimes I feel like gettin' even but I chose to behave
I'm mentally locked in a prison and I need bail
But the internet'll kill me quicker than the streets will
And if that shit doesn't kill me then the police will
Or maybe all the refills, or the e pills, or the lean will
I wish I was more flourished
I wish I had more courage
I feel like there's more purpose
And maybe it's all worth it
I wanna keep on learnin'
But I couldn't be more nervous
When I keep lookin' for answers and I gotta keep on searchin'
The tables keep on turnin'
Tryna call up to Jesus, but the phone keep on ringin'
I think I need more service
The calls seem more urgent
And all I see is more murders
The soldiers keep on servin'
I wonder if it's all worth it, I wonder

On our knees, we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival
In this mess we made
Fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival

I can't breathe
Got my head on the guillotine
Slipknot around my neck, come and take a seat
Watch 'em bury me down 'til I'm six feet deep
In the underground
Dead is the land of the free
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take, though it's killin' me
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take

On our knees, we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival
In this mess we made
Fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival

I can't breathe

Am I not worth saving?
Am I not worth saving?

On our knees, we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival
In this mess we made
Fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain
Dead on arrival (yeah)
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival

Dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
