		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spilled the ink across the page 
Trying to spell your name
So I fold it up and I flick it out
Paper aeroplane
It won't fly the seven seas to you
'Cause it didn't leave my room
But it awaits the hands of someone else
The garbage man

Gotta say mmh, mhm
Gotta say mmh, mhm

So he opens it up and reads it out 
To all his friends
Amongst the crowd a heart will break 
And a heart will mend
Walks on home tired from work
The letter falls from his hand
He reaches out only to catch the sky
It's gone with the wind

Gotta say mmh, mhm
Gotta say mmh, mhm

Go

Said I spilled the ink across the land
Trying to spell your name
Up and down there it goes
Paper aeroplane
It hasn't flown the seven seas to you
But it's on its way
It goes through the hands
Then to someone else
To find you girl

Gotta say mmh, mhm
Gotta say mmh, mhm
Gotta say mmh
