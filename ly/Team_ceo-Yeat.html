		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's 2093 on 'em
It's 2093 when ya
When ya live like me then it's 2093, then I hope that you see it, huh
I made every God cry (yeah, yeah)
Do you live a lot? Do you live a lie? (Yeah, yeah)
I know what happens when you die
Do you know what happens when you die?
I could see the future with one eye
I'ma live it up, I got one life
I got way too much money, I don't care 'bout the price (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I die tryin', I don't try dyin' (whoa, whoa)
Yeah, might of tried once (whoa, whoa)
Way too many X pills, yeah, for one album (whoa, whoa)
Yeah, I'ma futuristic Al Capone (whoa, whoa)
Don't try to talk to me, send ya home (whoa, whoa)

They might not get this shit at first (whoa, whoa)
It's like fittin' all that Porsche up inside a purse (whoa, whoa)
Is it a blessin' or curse? I just did it first (whoa, whoa)
I could ruin ya life, make it a lot worse (whoa, whoa)
We been doin' shit that you never heard of (whoa, whoa)
I got new shit, I invent a word (whoa, whoa)
I been livin' life that you never heard of (whoa, whoa)
I got billion dollar money, live inside a turtle (whoa, whoa)
That mean you can't get in (whoa, whoa)
That mean you can't fit in with the (whoa, whoa)
Goats of this motherfuckin' shit (whoa, whoa)
Yeah, I done heard a lot of shit, yeah (whoa, whoa)
I heard it from my fuckin' spaceship, huh (whoa, whoa)
You thinkin' all that shit, but you don't say shit, huh (whoa, whoa)
How you sayin' all that shit, but you ain't said shit? (Uh, uh)
How you doin' all this shit, but you ain't try yet? (Uh, uh)
How you make a lot of money, but you ain't die yet? (Uh, uh)
You ain't live like us, you ain't flyin' (uh, uh)

It's 2093 on 'em (yeah)
It's 2093 when ya (yeah)
