		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walkin' by faith
Id my footsteps further from faith, I sit from the lake
Yeah, too much of blush, man, it pays no mistake
Walkin' by faith
Id my footsteps further from faith, I sit from the lake
Yeah, too much of blush, man, it pays no mistake
Too much of blush, man, I'm walkin' by faith
Walkin' by, walkin' by, walkin' by

Yeah, Fear of God on my soles as I walk in
They can tell I be gluin' these verses
Gotta stand on my word like a sermon
Take it way further back than apartments
Family feud over pettiest arguments
Love is pain and most people can't handle it
Where's the real shit without the entanglement?
Feel like they hidin' me, that's what they angle is
Quietest in the room just say, fuck all the quiet shit
Ain't no fear when your momma work overnights
Plenty time for our silence, let's choose wrong or right
Ain't no fear when you done in your last fifty
I was thinkin' this shit could get cold as ice
Bring me back to the freezing Wyoming nights
Guess the fly on the wall finally found the light
Always rappin' about God, without meaning to
Know the feelin' is in me, it's spiritual
How the hell do I rap on a Westside Gunn song, we just takin' back spiritual
I know the spotlight is big for the two of us
Know the spotlight is big for the two of us
Three of us, four of us, six, seven, eight, a hundred
And then you pray for me
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

Walkin' by faith (the fear on you)
Id my footsteps further from faith, I sit from the lake
Yeah, too much of blush, man, it pays no mistake
Walkin' by faith
Id my footsteps further from faith, I sit from the lake
Yeah, too much of blush, man, it pays no mistake
Too much of -, walkin' by faith
Walkin', walkin', walkin' by

You know what I'm sayin'?
And then you pray for me
You know what I'm sayin'? Pray for the world
And then they'll forgive me
