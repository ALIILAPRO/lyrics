		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night is gone
Now we're alone
I feel your body near mine
We just have to dance one more time
Your face turned down
I can't deny
This feeling with you is a fate
I don't care if the hour is late at all

Let us dance just a little bit more
Even if the band walks out the door
And all the others go
Let's pretend that the music's on
Even if we're dancing all alone
And the night is gone

Just for a while
I saw your smile
I know I've sang in your ear
«God it's good to be near»
Your hand in mine
So warm and fine
If only this moment would stay
If only the band was to play some more

Let us dance just a little bit more
Even if the band walks out the door
And all the others go
Let's pretend that the music's on
Even if we're dancing all alone
And the night is gone.
