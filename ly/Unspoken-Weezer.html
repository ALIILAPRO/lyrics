		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every morning, every day,
I am hopin' for a chance to get away
In the evening, every night,
I am dreamin' of a chance to make it right
Every chance that I get I am placin' a bet on the sun in the sky

[Chorus]
And if you take this away from me
I'll never forgive you can't you see
Our life will be broken
Our hate will be unspoken

I can feel those metal chains
And they're holding back the hope that keeps me sane
I can fight back, yes I can
'Cause I'm strong enough to show you I'm a man
And I hate what you do, when your poison seeps through 
And you're laughin' at me

[Chorus]

Every chance that I get I am placin' a bet 
On the sun in the sky as it sets out of sight
And I hate what you do when your poison seeps through 
And you're laughing at me

[Chorus]
