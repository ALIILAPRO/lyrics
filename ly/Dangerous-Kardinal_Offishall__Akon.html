		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me
From across the room, I can see it
And can't stop myself from lookin'
And noticin' you, noticin' me
Watch out, I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

Whoa! And yeah, that's her
The big dog tryna get her little kitty to purr
Ex-man lookin' at me like I'm Lucifer
'Cause he knows I will deal with the case, yes sir
If I was the last man on Earth
I would only take that girl, end of search
She give a new definition to the word curve
Got chicks in the strip club envyin' her
Body's like weapons of mass eruptions
Sit a glass on that fat obstruction
Tongue game give a new type seduction
I'm tryna give that girl somethin', Jah

Girl, I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me
From across the room, I can see it
And can't stop myself from lookin'
And noticin' you, noticin' me
Watch out, I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Whoa! Bad to the bone
Everything locked like a two-three zone
I wanted to make my black snake moan
Talk a likkle bit, then take that home (word)
She bad and she know the deal
That sweater can't hide what she wanna conceal
I mean, Meagan Good and Halle Berry
Put together, ain't close to the dribby I see
No, no, no disrespect
But this gyal deh pon another level, cut the check (uh)
Tell King mag, stop the press
Say K, can I get a witness?

Girl, I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me
From across the room, I can see it
And can't stop myself from lookin'
And noticin' you, noticin' me
Watch out, I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

I see you got that fire
By the way that you're walkin' (walkin')
From left to right I watched her go down
Girl, I just want it right now
Don't wanna do no talkin' (talkin')
Shorty's so right I need to slow down

Figure eight, good body shape (yeah)
When she on the dance floor, gyal dem irate
When she do her ting, man can't walk straight
That biscuit fi soak up everyting' on her plate
Bad heels like Jessica P
I'm tryna give homegirl Sex in the City-titty
Itty bitty waistline, moves with the baseline
One likkle punch, I'm fine, Jah

Girl, I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me
From across the room, I can see it
And can't stop myself from lookin'
And noticin' you, noticin' me
Watch out, I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah
