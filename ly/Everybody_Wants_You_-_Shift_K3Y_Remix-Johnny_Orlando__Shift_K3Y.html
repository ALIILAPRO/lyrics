		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been tryna fake it
Can't take another minute
I look at them look at you
Wonder who you're gonna choose
You're the main attraction
The second that you walked in
Every drink is bought for you
I know that means a lot to you

And I wish that you would look at me
The way you're looking at your own reflection (your reflection)
Now everybody's watching you
And I can tell you're loving the attention, hah

You and I both know
They wanna take you home
Don't know what I'm gon' do, na-na-na
'Cause everybody wants you, na-na-na
We're running out of time
So if I'm on your mind
Tell me what you're gon' do, na-na-na
'Cause everybody wants you, na-na-na

I know that it's selfish
The way that I get jealous
Everytime they talk to you (talk to you)
I know they gonna fall for you
Been doing all the same shit (same shit)
Sticking to the rules, you don't take risks, ha
Doing what you're supposed to do
I'm just tryna get close to you (to you)

And I wish that you would look at me
The way you're looking at your own reflection (your reflection)
Now everybody's watching you
And I can tell you're loving the attention (na-na)

You and I both know
They wanna take you home
Don't know what I'm gon' do, na-na-na
'Cause everybody wants you, na-na-na
We're running out of time
So if I'm on your mind
Tell me what you're gon' do, na-na-na
'Cause everybody wants you, na-na-na

They want you, yeah
Everybody wants you, na-na-na

You and I both know
I'll probably let you go
I've been holding on too long, na-na
Now everybody wants you, na-na-na
I see you grab your coat
And you're not alone
I've been holding on too long, na-na
Everybody wants you, na-na-na

You and I both know (you and I both know)
They wanna take you home (they wanna take you home)
Don't know what I'm gon' do, na-na-na
'Cause everybody wants you, na-na-na
We're running out of time (ooh)
So if I'm on your mind
Tell me what you're gon' do, na-na-na
'Cause everybody wants you, na-na-na (yeah)
They want, want you
