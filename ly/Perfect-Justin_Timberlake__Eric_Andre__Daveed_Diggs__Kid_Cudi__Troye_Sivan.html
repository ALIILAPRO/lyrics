Da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da (Brozone)
Da-da-da, da-da-da

Well, there she goes
On the floor, let's do this, no more talkin' (no more talkin'), huh-uh
Did anybody notice?
The energy just shifted when we dropped in
Ooh, let it drop in (let it drop in), ooh
I don't flex, but I might
Groove about to take flight
'Cause the night is young and the music's on
And we got love on sight

The sky was the limit
Now, the stars where we're livin'
It's the vibe and we're in it
It'll blow your mind

It's so perfect, perfect, perfect
A hundred percent
Put us together you know what you'll get
Yeah, it's so perfect, perfect, perfect
Harmony's so cold
And you'll never, ever wanna let it go
Ooh

They keep on watchin' us, watchin' us
We don't pay them no mind (we don't pay them no mind, no mind, no mind)
There ain't no stoppin', no stoppin' us
We ain't pressin' rewind (rewind, rewind)

And the sky was the limit
Now, the stars where we're livin'
It's the vibe when we're in it
It'll blow your mind

It's so perfect, perfect, perfect
A hundred percent
Put us together you know what you'll get
Yeah, it's so perfect, perfect, perfect
Harmony's so cold
And you'll never, ever wanna let it go
Don't let it go

I don't flex but I might
Groove about to take flight
'Cause the night is young and the music's on
And we got love on sight
Yeah, I don't flex but I will
I ain't lack the skills
'Cause when I do my dance, you put up your hands
Yeah, you can't buy these thrills

And it's so perfect, perfect, perfect
A hundred percent
Put us together you know what you'll get
Yeah, it's so perfect, perfect, perfect
Harmony's so cold
And you'll never, ever wanna let it go (go)
Ooh
Perfect, perfect, perfect
