		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're not going home tonight
We just wanna rave forever
Memories in my heart I
Know that will I always treasure

I know it
You know it
That we are meant together
We're not going home tonight
Never

Ready, attack
Techno is back!

We're not going home tonight
We just wanna rave forever
We're not going home tonight
Never

Techno is back!
Yeah!
Yah!

Are you ready?

Dirty beats, automatic
Super high, never static
Hear my voice
Bring the noise
Ready, attack
Techno is back!

We're not going home tonight
We just wanna rave forever
Memories in my heart I
Know that will I always treasure

I know it
You know it
That we are meant together
We're not going home tonight
Never

Not going home tonight

It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock
Ready, attack
Techno is back!

Rough!
Massive!

We're not going home tonight
We just wanna rave forever
We're not going home tonight
Never
