		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember how we lit up the room?
And how you felt 
Before you met all my different moods?
But now I drive you mad 
When I hit you with the truth
Oh-oh, oh

Don't let your mind 
Think it's someone else
Someone else
I need to do something for myself, oh-oh

Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Why won't you put down your phone 
And look me in the eye?
Got all dressed up for you
But you seem so occupied
Maybe space is all it takes
It's time to fix us

Don't let your mind 
Think it's someone else
Someone else
I need to do something for myself, oh-oh

Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up, ah

First I kissed you
Then I got mad at you
'Cause I wish I'd
Be happy without you
If I ditch you
Then maybe you would understand
Then maybe you would understand

I need to do something for myself, oh-oh-oh

Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up, ah
