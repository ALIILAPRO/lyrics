		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lie lie lie lie you liar
You lie lie lie, tell me why
Tell me why, why d'you have to lie
Should've realized that you
Should've told the truth
Should've realized you know what I'll do

You're in suspension you're a liar

Now I wanna know, now-now I wanna known why
You never look me in the face
Broke a confidence just to please your ego
Should've realized you know what I know

You're in suspension you're a liar

I know where you go everybody you know
I know everything that you do or say
So when you tell lies I always be in your way
I'm nobody's fool and I know all 'cause I know
What I know

You're in suspension you're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar

Lie lie lie lie lie lie liar
Lie lie lie lie you liar lie lie lie
I think you're funny you're funny ha ha
I don't need it don't need your blah blah
Should've realized I don't know what you are

You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're lie liar lie
