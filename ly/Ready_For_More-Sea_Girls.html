		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't remember
The last thing you said
Advice I forget
I don't remember
The tip of your tongue
The back of your head

In the blink of an eye, it all just slips away
'Cause we're two years on and it feels like a day
And I keep on saying, "Yes," but it's bad for my brain
And I'm numb on the outside but I still feel the pain

You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more

Things I forget now
Like learning to drive
First time getting high
Things we were promised
Best time of your life
How shit if that's right

In the blink of an eye, it all just slips away
'Cause I heard you moved on, and I'm in the same place
And I keep on saying, "Yes," but it's bad for my brain
And I'm numb on the outside but I still feel the pain

You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more

Yeah
Why would you bother?
Why do you care?
Yeah, why would you bother?
Get out of my hair
I'm just getting started
It's true that I'm there
This isn't end
You ain't seen nothin' yet

You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more
You better get, you better get
You better get ready for more

I don't remember (you better get ready for more)
No, I don't remember (you better get ready for more)
I don't remember (you better get ready for more)
I don't remember
The last thing you said
