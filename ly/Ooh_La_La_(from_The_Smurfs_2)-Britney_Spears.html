		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't have to look like a movie star
Ooh I think you're good just the way you are (hey)
Tell me if you could would you up and run away, with me? (Hey)

You don't have to roll like a millionaire
Baby I would go with you anywhere
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, we'll see

You know can nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'till we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you got

Ooh my, my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la, la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la, la

You don't have to wear no designer clothes
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free

You know can nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'till we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you got

Ooh my, my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la, la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la, la

(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)

(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)

(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)

(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)
(Be my ooh la, la)

Ooh my, my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye

Ooh my, my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la, la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la, la

Baby come with me and be my ooh la, la
So baby come with me and be my ooh la, la
