		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got dosed by you, and
Closer than most to you, and
What am I supposed to do?
Take it away
I never had it anyway
Take it away
And everything will be okay

In you, a star is born, and
You cut a perfect form, and
Someone forever warm
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

Show love with no remorse, and
Climb on to your seahorse, and
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I knew that it would be with you
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

I got dosed by you, and
Closer than most to you, and
What am I supposed to do?
Take it away, I never had it anyway
Take it away, and everything will be okay

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
