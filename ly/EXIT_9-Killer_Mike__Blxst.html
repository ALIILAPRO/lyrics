		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh-oh-oh

Whip my sixty-nine-five 'Burb from the curb
I done had to work it like a square and had to serve
I'm listenin' to Big and Dre, and crumblin' on erb
I'm pushin' down MLK with a quarter-pound of herb
Passin' through the temp', I say a prayer for fallen soldiers
Rest in peace to Bruce and may God be with DG Yola
God bless the dead, that's for Boonk, that's for Zeke
And God protected livin', that's for me and that's what's sweet
We done made it up from shorties (yeah)
Drinkin' forties, livin' lawless (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Today shiftin' the flame, diamond flawless and I fault this (yeah, yeah)
Thank the Lord, I ain't a junkie, ain't an alcoholic (oh-oh-oh-oh)
The pride of Atlanta, Michael Render steady ballin'

Let's bring out the champagne, roll up an airplane
Life is a rare thing (life is a rare thing)
We rise, we fall, even went back, so what?
I find a way I can maintain, yeah
She MLK, like my memory lane
Ain't no feelin' insane, hope you feelin' my pain
I put my blood, sweat, and tears in the game
Ain't no feelin' insane, hope you feelin' my pain

I remember them days, makin' minimum wage
I was tryna maintain, look how far I done came
Pop champagne for the pain, no campaginin' for chains
All the profits we made, bigger things on the way

Hoppin' over hurdles, into my Chevy converter (yeah)
Swerve around them haters that don't wish to see me further (oh)
My campaign for champagne could've ended with my murder
Miss Betty say, "If you ain't saved in Jesus name, it's worser"
I had to be my own boss, not somebody else's worker
I know the prayer she prayed for me still serve as my preserver
I know some of my actions, they was taxin' and I heard her (oh-oh-oh)
But Lord, if she listenin', please let her know I heard her (yeah)

Let's bring out the champagne, roll up an airplane
Life is a rare thing (life is a rare thing)
We rise, we fall, even went back, so what?
I find a way, I can maintain, yeah
She MLK, like my memory lane
Ain't no feelin' insane, hope you feelin' my pain
I put my blood, sweat, and tears in the game
Ain't no feelin' insane, hope you feelin' my pain
