		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's like nothing ever works
And it only seems to hurt
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel

We've been chasing old ideas
It's a lonely way to live
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel

How I feel
Oh, baby

It's like nothing ever works
And it only seems to hurt
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel

We've been chasing old ideas
It's a lonely way to live
Show me how you feel

I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling

I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling

Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel

I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling

I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling

Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
