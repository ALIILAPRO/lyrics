		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh, ooh, oh no
I see everybody around but it feels like we're in private
I know you want me so bad 'cause you just can't seem to hide it
The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music
When we're together
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment we can lose it 
I hope you're ready

As long as I see the strobe lights
I'm dancing all night long
When we're together baby
I'm feeling all right
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it
All night long (all night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long (all night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it 
All night long (all night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long (all night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it

Tonight the admission is free
Now we're shuttin' the club down
We're moving now to the streets
All we got left is love now

Feel my troubles fading to the rhythm of your heart beat
When we're together
Everything just comes together, baby
Every motion calls your name, baby, once you start me
And I hope you're ready

As long as I see the strobe lights
I'm dancing all night long
When we're together baby
I'm feeling all right
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it
All night long (all night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long (all night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it 
All night long (all night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long (all night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it

And you made me forget all my worries
Helped me put the past behind
Around us this world's in a hurry
While we stand still in time

The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music
When we're together
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment we can lose it 
And I hope you're ready

As long as I see the strobe lights
I'm dancing all night long
When we're together baby
I'm feeling all right
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it
All night long (all night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long (all night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it 
All night long (all night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long (all night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it

It's only you and me together
And this feeling's so strong
Wish I could stay like this forever
All night long (all night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long (all night, night, night, night)
Said, all night long
Yeah
