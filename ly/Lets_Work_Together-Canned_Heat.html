		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Together we'll stand, divided we'll fall
Come on now people, let's get on the ball and work together
Come on, come on let's work together, now, now people
Because together we will stand, every boy, every girl, and a man 

Before when things go wrong, as they sometimes will
And the road you travel, it stays all uphill
Let's work together, come on, come on, let's work together, ah
You know together we will stand, every boy, girl, woman, and a man 

Oh well now, two or three minutes, two or three hours
What does it matter now, in this life of ours
Let's work together, come on, come on
Let's work together, now, now people
Because together we will stand, every boy, every woman, and a man 
Oh, come on

Oh come on, let's work together

Oh well now, make someone happy, make someone smile
Let's all work together and make life worthwhile
Let's work together, come on, come on
Let's work together, now, now people
Because together we will stand, every boy, girl, woman, and a man
Ah, yeah

Well now, together we will stand, every boy, girl, woman, and a man
Ah, yeah
