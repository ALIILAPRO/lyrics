		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Under the white light)
Once in a lifetime, watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while
Under the white light
Once in a lifetime, watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while
Under the white light (Dolla $ign)

Once in a lifetime (time)
Baby, it's the right time (time)
I'll put on the red light
Told you it was on, on site (on site)
You had on that sundress
Never fail to impress ('press)
We had the best sex
We made love all night (all night)

(Under the white light)
Once in a lifetime (once in a lifetime), watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while (don't change your mind)
Under the white light
Once in a lifetime, watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while
Under the white light

(Yeah)
Come with me, take my hand
Follow me, follow me
To a place, a place where we
Can be free
Follow me

Once in a lifetime, watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while
Under the white light
Once in a lifetime, watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while
Under the white light
Once in a lifetime, watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while
Your under the white light

Once in a lifetime (once in a lifetime), watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while (don't change your mind)
Under the white light
Once in a lifetime
Watching the skyline
Don't change your mind while

Once in a lifetime
Girl, gon' live it up
Don't you let nobody tell you different
Once in a lifetime
You'll have it your way
Don't you let nobody tell you nothing
Ooh, yeah
