		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Evening
Coming through the crowd
I hold my head high
Straining

Out here
dissonance surrounds
I hold my head high
I see the wings behind your back

Burned all the maps to reach you
Watching distant names
I saw danger
And then I felt the pressure

Downfall
This is our time
The setting sun over all I ever had

So when did you come to think
That you would tell me that I have no one
And when do you think that you
Will give back the things that you owe me

Burned all the maps to reach you
Watching distant names
I saw danger
And then I felt the pressure

So when did you come to think
That you would tell me that I have no one
And when do you think that you
Will give back the things that you owe me

So when did you come to think
That you would tell me that I have no one
And when do you think that you
Will give back the things that you owe me
