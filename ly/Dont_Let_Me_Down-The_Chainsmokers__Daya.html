		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crashin', hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reachin' out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

I need ya, I need ya, I need ya right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losin' my mind now
It's in my head, darlin', I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

Runnin' out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

I need ya, I need ya, I need ya right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losin' my mind now
It's in my head, darlin', I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

Ooh, I think I'm losin' my mind now, yeah
Ooh, I think I'm losin' my mind now, yeah

I need ya, I need ya, I need ya right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losin' my mind now
It's in my head, darlin', I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh no
So don't let me down
Don't let me down, no
Don't let me down 
Don't let me down, down, down
