		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like

Me on top of you
Touch you like I do
No, you'll never forget

When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like

When I'm gone

Thought it would be easy
Easy to forget me
Let go of the memories
Now your bed is empty
You're waking up sweating
I'm still in your wild dreams

Late nights
Callin' me, callin' me
Do anything to keep me close
Well, you should know it's gonna be, gonna be
So hard for you to let me go

When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like

Me on top of you
Touch you like I do
No, you'll never forget

When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like me

When I'm gone

When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're moving on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like

When I'm gone
