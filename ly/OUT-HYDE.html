		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not afraid of standing out
A hundred demons messing with my head again
I won't pretend, I won't back down
I'm not afraid of standing out

I tried to face them
They got me going insane
I tried to race them
But I can't keep them at bay
The same old play list
That keeps on making me prey
So I go, I go, I go

Well, I don't want to stop and see
The critic of the day
So I'm just gonna let them be
They're getting in my way
It feels like Armageddon
But without the catchy name
It's plain to see, plain to see
I won't let them fuck with me

I'm not afraid of standing out
A hundred demons messing with my head again
I won't pretend, I won't back down
I'm not afraid of standing out

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

I tried to face them
They got me going insane
I tried to race them
But I can't keep them at bay
The same old play list
That keeps on making me prey
So I go, I go, I go

Well, I don't want to stop and see
The critic of the day
So I'm just gonna let them be
They're getting in my way
It feels like Armageddon
But without the catchy name
It's plain to see, plain to see
I won't let them fuck with me

I'm not afraid of standing out
A hundred demons messing with my head again
I won't pretend, I won't back down
I'm not afraid of standing out

(Prey, prey)
I'm not afraid of standing out
(Hey, hey)
I'm not afraid of standing out

Well I don't want to stop and see
The critic of the day
So I'm just gonna let them be
They're getting in my way
It feels like Armageddon
But without the catchy name
It's plain to see, plain to see
I won't let them fuck with me

I'm not afraid of standing out
A hundred demons messing with my head again
I won't pretend, I won't back down
I'm not afraid of standing out

No hiding now, it's all I know
So many voices telling me it's time to go
I won't pretend, I won't back down
I'm not afraid, of standing out

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
