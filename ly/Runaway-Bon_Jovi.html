		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the street where you live
Girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint
A touch of sable in their eyes

(All your life) all your life all you've asked
When's your daddy gonna talk to you?
But you were living in another world
Trying to get your message through

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Take a line line every night
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets
Calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone
'Cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows
Left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights
At night on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind
It's only love she hoped to find

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes (seen it in your eyes)
What was going around your head

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
