		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ooh

You been picking my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here, even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this, girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's okay
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Ooh, 'Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted, got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got, the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good (it feels so good)
It feels so good (it feels so good)
It feels so good (it feels so good)
It feels so good (oh yeah)

I ain't scared of the fall
(The fall) I ain't scared of the fall
(The fall) I ain't scared of the fall
(The fall) I ain't scared of the fall
(The fall) I've felt the ground before
(The fall) I've felt the ground before
(The fall) I've felt the ground before
(The fall) I've felt the ground before
'Cause I ain't scared of the fall

Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live and what I did
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes, I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
'Bout to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friend's name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B-C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you don't gotta ask who's next, who's next

This ain't nothing, but it's all I need (it's all I need)
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel (ooh)
And it feels so good (it feels so good)
It feels so good (it feels so good)
It feels so good (it feels so good)
It feels so good (oh yeah)

(The fall) and I ain't scared of the fall
(The fall) and I ain't scared of the fall
(The fall) and I ain't scared of the fall
(The fall) I've felt the ground before
(The fall) I've felt the ground before
(The fall) I've felt the ground before
(The fall) the fall
(The fall) and I ain't scared of the fall, oh yeah
Woah, whoa, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh yeah
XO, XO
XO, XO, XO
