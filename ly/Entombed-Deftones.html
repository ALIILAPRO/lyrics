		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the day you arrived
I've remained by your side
In chains, entombed

Placed inside
Safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all I see

On the day you arrived
I became your device
To name and soothe

Placed inside
Safe and sound
Shades and colors are all I see
Shapes of colors are all I feel

From the day you arrived
I have stayed by your side

Placed inside
Safe and sound
Shades of colors are all I see
Shapes of colors are all I feel

Placed inside, 
Safe and sound
Shades of colors are all I see
Safe inside
