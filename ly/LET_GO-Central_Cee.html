		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Well, you only need the light) when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow (Nastylgia)
Only know you love her when you let her go
Alright

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the roads when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
You said that pussy mine, so why'd you let it go?
You're such a ho

I loved you until you try to get in my head
And that's why I lost respect
You're doin' the most to get my attention, baby, I'm not impressed, uh
I changed my bedsheets, but I still smell your flesh
I don't know how we got in this mess
I rarely get this in depth
This girl made me question love
This girl made me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feelin' depressed and stuff
Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us
The last time that we fucked was fucked, the way you got up, got dressed and cut
Look, I thought that we could have been
Maybe, I was too optimistic
Tell me what you need, I'll provide everything
Baby, you don't know what you're missin'
Our chemistry fucked like quantum physics, physics
Feelin' your energy, feelin' your spirit
If this is the end, I need one more visit
They're showin' me love, but I still feel empty
I need somethin' a lot more fulfillin', uh
Move out of London town then move to a rural village
You made me delete that pic off my phone
But I close my eyes, still see that image
Won't chase it, my heart ain't in it, it's finished
Too far gone can't fix it, bitch, this damage is done

(Well, you only need the light) when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
Only know you love her when you let her go
Alright

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the roads when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
You said that pussy mine, so why'd you let it go?
You're such a ho

I called four times on a private caller, I feel like a creep, uh
I know there's plenty of fish in the sea, but I fucked those girls, got you in my mind
When you fucked those guys, did you wish they were me?
Turn 'em around and I put them in doggy, I don't even fuck them in missionary
There's no intimacy and additionally, it's obligatory
When I fucked that opp thot
I don't even take my socks off and I don't even know why I did it
As soon as I'm finished, I'm gettin' 'em dropped off
And what makes it worse, I know that she's tellin' her friends that I chopped her
I don't know what you're doin' when we're not together
It's drivin' me mad, 'cause I can't even stop ya
Typed in your bank details and sent you a bag, I'm rich like, bitch, unblock me
Make it quick, can you do that promptly?
If you won't give me your love for free, I'll buy it
Just tell me how much it'll cost me
Your new man ain't got nothin' on me
Fuck your annual wage, I can make that monthly, huh, alright

(Well, you only need the light) when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow 
Only know you love her when you let her go
Alright

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the roads when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
You said that pussy mine, so why'd you let it go?
You're such a ho
