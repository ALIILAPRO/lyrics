		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live it up, go on live it up
I was on the ground but you got me movin' up, yeah, yeah
Movin' up, flyin' up above
Sun ain't never hidin' baby, you're the one that's got me slidin'
All day, right through the roof like we were Pompeii
We're servin' waves just like an entree
That's on the way
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Got me feelin' like a high tide, three-six-five
With the coast held down, on both sides
I'm on a life high, first class flight
Wavin' back to old pastimes
Seems like a landslide just slipped my mind
All that's left is what feels right
With the high tide
Got me feelin' like a high tide
Aye, paint it like I'm Picasso and spread it like avocado
You gotta know you're a star and I'm feelin' like Aristotle
No cap like it was a bottle, push start to throttle
Ask me what I've been doin, livin' like no tomorrow, mm-hmm
Never back to the way it was
Movin' how we should, more life, more love, mm-hmm
Take me back to the heights I see
And the rest we'll leave
Got me feelin' like a high tide, three-six-five
With the coast held down, on both sides
I'm on a life high, first class flight
Wavin' back to old pastimes
Seems like a landslide just slipped my mind
All that's left is what feels right
With the high tide
Got me feelin' like a high tide
Live it up, go on live it up
I was on the ground but you got me movin' up, yeah, yeah
Movin' up, flyin' up above
Sun ain't never hidin' baby, you're the one that's got me slidin'
Live it up, go on live it up
I was on the ground but you got me movin' up, yeah, yeah
Movin' up, flyin' up above
Sun ain't never hidin' baby, you're the one that's got me slidin'
Got me feelin' like a high tide, three-six-five
With the coast held down, on both sides
I'm on a life high, first class flight
Wavin' back to old pastimes
Seems like a landslide just slipped my mind
All that's left is what feels right
With the high tide
Got me feelin' like a high tide
