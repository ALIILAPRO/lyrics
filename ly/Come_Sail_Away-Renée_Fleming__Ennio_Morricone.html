		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In an upstairs room in Blackpool
By the side of a northern sea
The army had my father
And my mother was having me

Military Madness was killing my country
Solitary Sadness comes over me
After the school was over and I moved
To the other side

I found a different country but I never
Lost my pride
Military Madness was killing the country
Solitary sadness creeps over me

And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope that The Man discovers
What's driving the people wild

Military madness is killing your country
So much sadness, between you and me
War, War, War, War, War, War
