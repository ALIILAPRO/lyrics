		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look at you and my blood boils hot, I feel my temperature rise
I want it all, give me what you got, there's hunger in your eyes
I'm getting closer, baby, hear me breathe (ah-ah-ah)
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and you'll never leave

Feel my heat takin' you higher, burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire, angel fly, Heaven's on fire

I got a fever ragin' in my heart, you make me shiver and shake
Baby, don't stop, take it to the top, eat it like a piece of cake
You're comin' closer, I can hear you breathe (ah-ah-ah)
You drive me crazy when you start to tease
You could bring the devil to his knees

Feel my heat takin' you higher, burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire, angel fly, Heaven's on fire

Oh-oh, Heaven's on fire
Oh-oh, Heaven's on fire
Oh-oh

I'm getting closer, baby, hear me breathe (ah-ah-ah)
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and you'll never leave

Feel my heat takin' you higher, burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire, angel fly, Heaven's on fire

Feel my heat takin' you higher, burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire, angel fly, Heaven's on fire

Feel my heat takin' you higher, burn with me, Heaven's on fire
