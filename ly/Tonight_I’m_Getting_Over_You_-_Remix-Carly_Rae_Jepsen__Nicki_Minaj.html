		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the remix, Carly!

I want to smash your fears, and get drunken off your tears
Don't share your smile with anyone else but me
I want to touch your heart, I want to crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies

We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying, to get me through
I keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you, over you, over you

Stuck in a real bad dream, oh man it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night and I just hold my pillow tight
He won't love me back, no, it's not you and I

We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying, to get me through
I keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you

Tonight I'm getting over.
Meditate and do my yo-ger
Then I pull up to the club in a Rover
A Celine bag on my shoulder
I said rr', cock that; Revolver
Rr' rr' that's that nostal-ger
I said I'm number one, I'm a son a gun, and runner up is what they called ya
Ain't trying to be mean but, I am the queen, yuh
Ain't fuckin' with no fuck boys!
Get me get me, should've got me then
Cause I would wear 4 real and you would rock pretend
Yo, can I get another dose of my oxygen
Cause I been breathin' all this motherfuckin' toxin in! (Tonight I'm getting over you)

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you, over you, over you

We're not lovers, but more than friends (Tonight I'm getting over you)
Put a flame to every single word you ever said (Tonight I'm getting over you)
No more crying, to get me through (Pretty gang, Rich Gang, Young Money)
I keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new (Nicki Minaj, I see you Carly)
Tonight I'm getting over you (Let's get it)
