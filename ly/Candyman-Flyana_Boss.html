(Ooh, ooh-la-la-la)

He my little sweetheart, little gumdrop
He keep it gushy-gushy, and it won't stop
He my little nutter butter, I call him lollipop
I lick his laffy taffy, yeah, and then we swap
He my little sweetheart, little gumdrop
He keep it gushy-gushy, and it won't stop
He my little playboy, I'm drippin' honeydew
I got a sugar rush when he come through (ooh-oh)

Make my cookie crumble (mm), hope he don't fumble (ah)
I like-like that he could brag, but he stay on the humble (okay)
He climb my mountains and we take a tumble (tumble)
Tastin' my skittles, I'm quick and he's nimble (nom, nom, nom)
He my little sweetheart (mm), my-my sugar daddy (okay)
Put the cream in my coffee just to keep me happy
Twix, we side by side (ooh), never switch, ride or die (yeah)
That's my honey bunch (okay), my sugar pie

He my little sweetheart, little gumdrop
He keep it gushy-gushy, and it won't stop
He my little nutter butter, I call him lollipop
I lick his laffy taffy, yeah, and then we swap
He my little sweetheart, little gumdrop
He keep it gushy-gushy, and it won't stop
He my little playboy, I'm drippin' honeydew
I got a sugar rush when he come through (yeah)

Tablespoon of love (okay) and a whole cup of lust (yeah)
