		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many girls in here, where do I begin? (Ohh)
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in (ohh)
Then she said, I'm here with my friends (ohh)
She got me thinking and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo-ooh)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
So go get them, we can all be friends (woo-ooh)

Hey, bring it on, baby, all your friends
You're the shit and I love that body (body)
You wanna ball, let's mix it
I swear you're good, I won't tell nobody ('body)
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it's all women invited ('vited)
Hair do's and nails, that Louis, Chanel all up in the party
(Need some help) president's in my wallet
(Freak yourself) no rules I'm 'bout it
(Play the ref) blow the whistle for the hotties
(Catch my breath) ha, I got it
Shawty, it's never too much, can't be doing too much
Ten to one of me, I can handle that love
Bottles in my reach, we can all get buzz
Holla 'cause I'm free to whatever, it's no rush

So many boys in here, where do I begin? (Ohh)
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in (ohh)
Then he said, "I'm here with my friends" (ohh)
He got to thinking and that's when he said

Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo-ooh)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
So go get them, we can all be friends (woo-ooh) (uh, yo)

It's PB, PB, who's Peabo Bryson?
Two years ago I renewed my license
Anyway, why'd I start my verse like that?
You can suck a dick or you can suck on a ballsack
No, no I don't endorse that, pause that, abort that
Just the other day me go a London, saw that
Kids inna di street, paparazzi, all that
Hey, hey, what can I say?
Day, da-da-day, da-da-day-day-day
Coming through the club all the girls in the back of me
This ain't football, why the fuck they tryna tackle me?
Really, I peeped dude at the bar like really
Looking like he wanna good time like really
Said he got a friend for my homegirl Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly

So many girls in here, where do I begin? (Ohh)
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in (ohh)
Then she said, I'm here with my friends (ohh)
She got me thinking and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo-ooh)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
So go get them, we can all be friends (woo-ooh)

Day, day, day-da-day-day
Day, da-da-day, da-da-day-day-day
Day, day, day-da-day-day
Day, da-da-day, da-da-day-day-day

Yo, where my girls at, uh, mmh, uh
Yo, where my girls that's tryna ge-get this jumpin'
Jumpin', jumpin'

So many girls in here, where do I begin? (Ohh)
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in (ohh)
Then she said, I'm here with my friends (ohh)
She got me thinking and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo-ooh)
Where them girls at, girls at? (Woo)
So go get them, we can all be friends (woo-ooh)
