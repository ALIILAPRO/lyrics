		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are so many fucking reasons why
This world is fucked
And the people are fucked
And our lives our fucked
Go

Come on

This world is fucked
The people are fucked
Our lives are fucked
You all fucking know it


Paint the world black with all its greed
Death awaits humanities final plead
This pain rolls of my tounge
Numbed by the hand on my mouth and i just want to bring the world together to feel this pain
Burn this earth to feell their complaints
Best before: Death
I want to kill this breed
I want to kill

Best before: Death

There are so many fucking reasons why
This world is fucked
And the people are fucked
And our lives our fucked
We all fucking know it that
This world is fucked
Abd the people are fucked
And our lives are fucked

We all fucking know it that we’re fucked

Watch me slither within the echoes of the past
Contemplate my death as the only option
Should I kill em or my fucking self?
That’s the question
Snakes choke the color dry

Open up wide let me see whatchu got in there
Infesting parasites breathing in this rotting air

There are so many fucking reasons why
This world is fucked
And the people are fucked
And our lives our fucked
We all fucking know it that
This world is fucked
And the people are fucked
And our lives our fucked

World is fucked
People are fucked
Lives are fucked

You all fucking know it that we’re fucked

This world is so fucked
Those people are fucked
And your lives are fucked motherfuckers

This world is…
The people are…
Our lives are…
Oh this world is…
These people are…
And our lives are…

Best Before: Death
