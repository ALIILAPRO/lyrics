		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a certain little girl,
That's on my mind
No doubt about it,
She look so fine
She's the best girl that I've ever had
Sometimes for sure make me feel so bad

Na, na, na...... 

Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin'my name now
Hush, hush, she broke my heart
But I love her just the same now
Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin' my name now
Hush, hush, I need her love and I'm now not
To blame now

I've got her early in the morning
I've got her late in the evening
Oh, I wanna never need it now
Oh, gotta, gotta have it
Gotta have it now

She's got lovin' like quick sand
Only took one touch of her hand
Blow my mind and I meant so deep
I can't eat all
I can't sleep

Na, na, na......

Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin' my name now
Hush, hush, she broke my heart
But I lover her just the same now
Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin' my name now
Hush, hush, I need her love and I'm now not
To blame now
