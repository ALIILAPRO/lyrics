		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we'd rise to the height of our halo

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there
Not like you

Ignorant siblings at the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy
Spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see

But enough about the collective Judas 
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated
Your little piece of the divine

And this little light of mine
A gift you passed onto me
I'm gonna let it shine
To guide you safely on your way
Your way home

Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down? 
Without you to guide them all to Zion? 
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun? 
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
You are the light and the way that they'll only read about
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
You're going home

You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fist at the gates saying
"I have come home now
Fetch me the Spirit, the Son, and the Father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
It's time now
My time now
Give me my
Give me my wings"

(Give me my)
(Give me my)

Give me my
Give me my
Give me my 
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my wings

You are the light, the way
That they will only read about

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers
You were my witness
My eyes, my evidence
Judith Marie, unconditional one

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion
Should you see your maker's face tonight
Look him in the eye 
Look him in the eye, and tell him
"I never lived a lie, never took a life
But surely saved one
Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home"
