		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you
I just wanna praise you
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (ha)
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you (yeah)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (ha)
I just wanna praise you
I just wanna praise you
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (ha)
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you (yeah)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you (what you wanna do?)
I just wanna praise you (ha)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (ha, come on)
And I'm gonna praise you (praise you)
I'm gonna praise you (ha)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you (what you wanna do?)
I just wanna praise you (ha)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (ha)
And I'm gonna praise you (just wanna praise you)
I'm gonna praise you (just wanna praise you)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you (what you gonna do?)
I just wanna praise you (ha)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (woo)
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you (ha)

In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break free
'Cause you see, I have been down for so long
Feel like all hope is gone
But as I lift my hands, I understand
That I should praise you through my circumstance

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (so I can dance)
I just wanna praise you (just wanna praise you)
I just wanna praise you (just wanna praise you)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise you (whoa, whoa)
I'm gonna praise you (uh, uh, uh)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (so I can dance)
I just wanna praise you (just wanna praise you)
I just wanna praise you (just wanna praise you)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise you (whoa, whoa)
I'm gonna praise you (uh, uh, uh)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you (what you gon' do?)
I just wanna praise you (ha, uh)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (ha, come on)
And I'm gonna praise you (praise you)
I'm gonna praise you (ha, yeah)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (so I can dance)
I just wanna praise you (just wanna praise you)
I just wanna praise you (just wanna praise you) (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (ha)
And I'm gonna praise you (what you gon' do?)
I'm gonna praise you (ha)

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna praise you
I just wanna praise you (ha)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (uh)
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you (ha)
