		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The two of us need to listen
I feel the beat if I understand

If our understanding is mutual
I'm comfortable
And you're comfortable
And if I'm not mistaken
I'm not alone
You're not alone
And I'm not alone

If our understanding is mutual
I'm comfortable
And you're comfortable
And if I'm not mistaken
I'm not alone
You're not alone
And I'm not alone

If you hear me now, hear me through
Understand I fought with you
Apologize (apologize)

If you hear me now
Hear me through
Understand I fought with you
But we got defined (we got defined)

If you hear me now, hear me through
Understand
I fought with you
But we got defined
And understanding what's with me and you

If our understanding is mutual
I'm comfortable
And you're comfortable

And if I'm not mistaken
I'm not alone
You're not alone
And I'm not alone

If you hear me now, hear me through
Understand I fought with you
Apologize

If you hear me now, hear me through
Understand I fought with you
But we got defined

If our understanding is mutual
I'm comfortable and you're comfortable
And if I'm not mistaken
I'm not alone
You're not alone
And I'm not alone

If I'm not mistaken
I'm not alone 
And you're not alone
