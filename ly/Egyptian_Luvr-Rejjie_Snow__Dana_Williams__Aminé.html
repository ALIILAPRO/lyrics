		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love
Love

Just let go of sorrow
Like there's no tomorrow
'Cause tonight might be your last
So stay up till sunrise (sunrise)
Wipe the tears from your eyes (your eyes)
Leave it in the past

The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past

Breakdance and boogie, my love
This is 1971
I crave that brain and that flesh
Cups of tea and gums that bleed red
Say you wrap the plastic in white
Say you single all of my life
Blackest skin, disfigure my crimes
Credit cards and losing my mind
Piece-by-piece, they stitched me
Ain't no love, I'm still banging out Whitney
I can't cry for those who ain't with me
I can't pray so Lord, please forgive me (so)
Pink like pussy, extra pushy
Hands up off me, she's so lovely
Fame and fortune, all those habits
Pink and white, them panties matching

I want you to stay forever
I want you to stay forever
I want you to stay forever
I want you to stay forever

The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past

Ring, ring, I'm tryna get my old thing back
But baby always wanna bring up shit from the past (yeah)
Whoa-oh, our options are limitless
Putting in effort for the effort, it's too effortless
Whoa, fuck checks, see the necklace
Gold hit her lips every time that I'm hitting it
Huh, I told her "baby, I'm sorry
But if you think we got problems then baby, watch Maury"
Yeah, that's why you gotta smell the roses
We parted ways like she cheated with Moses
That's fucked up but a lot of things are
In Hollywood but I never see stars
Do anything for ya, that's love
Go anywhere for ya, that's love
Might even kill for ya, that's love
And if you're still tripping, that's drugs

Just let go of sorrow
Like there's no tomorrow
'Cause tonight might be your last
So stay up 'til sunrise (sunrise)
Wipe the tears from your eyes (your eyes)
Leave it in the past

The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past

Extra white, she's so extra white
My appetite, I lost appetite
It's paradise, we in paradise
So extra bright, it's so extra bright, so
I break the beat and I scratch it
She be like cancer, she be like dancing
Straight to my mattress, I was on smashing
I was on abra, she was cadabring
No free smoke when your bae is gone
Why love when it's free and it does no harm?
New phone, who's this? And my life's on charge
Two shows, pay rent, get a girl, get a job
Belly of the beast, when I walk in the streets
All I see is fake love, insecurity
Two months, seven days, oh, when you first came
Walked in, Off-White, all pink, okay

The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
