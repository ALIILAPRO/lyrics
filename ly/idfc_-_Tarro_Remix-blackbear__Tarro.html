		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Tell me pretty lies)
(Look me in the face)
(Tell me that you love me)
(Love me, love me, love me)
(Love me, love me, love me)

Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care, at all

You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care, at all

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared

I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care, at all, oh

(All, oh)
(All, oh)

Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care, at all

You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words, slurring all your words
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care, at all (at all)

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared

I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care, at all, oh

(All, oh)
(All, oh)

(I don't fucking care)
(I don't fucking care)
(I don't fucking care)
(I don't fucking care)
