		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He came your way, and when he had to go
There were roses growing in the snow
Silently, you'll go through the
Shadow of your soul
And you know that it was like
This before we had to go

You will never see these lights
Glowing in your nights
Until you feel this way with every moon
It is as though you're getting
Closer to your soul

And then you'll go alone, and with no fear
Then you will know that it was like
This before he had to go
And you will find that you were blind
Until you saw these lights
Glowing in your nights

He came your way, and when he had to go
There were roses growing in the snow
Silently you'll go through the
Shadow of your soul
But you know that it was like
This before he had to go

You will never see these lights
Glowing in your nights if you don't know
And there are roses growing in the snow
