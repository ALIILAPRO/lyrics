		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Short cut to a quick buck is working all the time
Renting out your mind
And saving every dime
Because when ten of those combine 
They cross a sacred line
And go from pocket change
To a gold mine

She said she'd be down to hangout
With her parents out of town she was hoping I'm around
For a party at her vacant place
I said I'd come showed up and felt out of place
So I headed home
That's when she text my phone and ask me where
I was and when I said I was gone
She broke my spine
And in that pain
I realized that every dime I'd ever saved 
Wasn't worth anything

What's the drive in being alive when you don't know who you are?
What's the fun in getting drunk if you can't take it too far?
Yeah my friends are saying I've been wasting all my weekends contemplating
If it's me or the booze that really gets wasted I don't even taste it
When I'm throwing back shots as if its a race then
So quickly chase them

Without a mouth I'm so down
My hometown only makes me feel alone 
And just when I

Hometown girls are my greatest fear
So in a couple days I'll be off to college for another year
Thinking "I'm getting away by hitting the road
Somehow she make it to all of my shows now where can I go?"

Girl it's a simple matter
Put your painted finger on my tongue
So I can taste the lacquer
And relive each door that you have touched

And then she split my lips
And for three whole days
I tried to speak but everyone agreed they couldn't hear a word I'd say

What's the drive in being alive when you don't know who you are?
What's the fun in getting drunk if you cant take it too far?
I'm singing oh I don't know 
Take me anywhere but home

Without a mouth I'm so down
But my hometown only makes me feel alone
Then just when I, I, I, I think I'm in the clear 
She hook her hair behind her ears and says I'm going down
She said "baby it's okay to feel the way you do if you keep it to yourself"

Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips but 
It sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue
Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips 
But it sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue
Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips 
I said "life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips"
I said "life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips"

Without a mouth I'm so down
My hometown only makes me feel alone 
Then just when I, I, I, I think I'm in the clear 
She hook her hair behind her ears
Says "babe are you aware
Of who I am?"
