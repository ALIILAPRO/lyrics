		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Oh, baby I apologize for it

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I have traveled the world, there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (what's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mhm

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, everyday don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
