		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She used to be an iron horse
Twenty years ago
Used to bring the mail to me
Through the ice and snow
I've sat alone and watched her
Steaming through the night
Ninety tons of thunder
Lighting up the sky

She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky

Speeding, sparks like lightning
Engine working hard
Furnace on the foot plate
Shining in the night
Iron striking metal
The sound of racing steel
It's all I ever want to hear
It's music to my ears

She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky

She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky

Ninety tons of thunder
Lighting up the sky
Steaming red hot pistons
See the wheels flash by
Hear the whistle blowing
Streaking down the track
If I ever had my way
I'd bring the princess back one day

She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky
(sky, sky, sky)
