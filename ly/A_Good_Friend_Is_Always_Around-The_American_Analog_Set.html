		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hopes pretending. It's timber on the fire
Embers free the cinders
And send them ever higher
I dreamed I saw you
When you're old and tired
Afraid to move your hands
And expose the wires

We can't be caught and
Can't stay here with
Heat close by and
You're insides spilled

And do your friends know the way to go
When they leave your hands
The chamber's empty glow
It's a lonely ending
When your heart's grown cold
The kid is bored pretending
Now you'll never grow old

We can't be caught and
Can't stay here while
Guilt sets in with
Night's cool chill
