		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's two AM, girl, are you up yet?
And she like boy you know you fucked up
We can never go back
And she move different, acting suspect
And she think I can be her hero
I can never be that

At all, 'cause I get stabbed in the back
I tried my best to clear my head but I can never do tha-a-a-at
At all, I can't go back to the past
And I don't wanna be the bad guy but I think I might have to
I'm stuck like a statue
You said, "I don't see you"
And yet I'm looking right at you
You're done with the attitude
I'm not even mad at you
She said I'm her hero
I know she don't think that's true

Took a step back, what does it look like from the outside?
And to be honest I don't wanna learn 'bout your last guy
I tried my best but I still end up on my last life
There's never gonna be a right time

And you can blame me if you want but you know
That there won't ever be a next time
I take an Uber, take the next flight
I won't be nothing like the next guy

At all, 'cause I get stabbed in the back
I tried my best to clear my head but I can never do tha-a-a-at
At all, I can't go back to the past
And I don't wanna be the bad guy but I think I might have to
I'm stuck like a statue
You said, "I don't see you"
And yet I'm looking right at you
You're done with the attitude
I'm not even mad at you
She said I'm her hero
I know she don't think that's true
