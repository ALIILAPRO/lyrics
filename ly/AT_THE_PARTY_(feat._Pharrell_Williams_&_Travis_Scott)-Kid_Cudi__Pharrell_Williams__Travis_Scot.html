		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)

We was just there at the party, she was drinkin' prolly
She serious not sorry
That's when she just hit it hardly, started feelin' godly
Near death, mmh, out of body (uh-huh)
We was just there at the party (yeah)
We was just there at the party
We was just there at the party, she was drinkin' prolly
She serious not sorry
That's when she just hit it hardly, started feelin' godly
Near death, mmh, out of body
We was just there at the party
We was just there at the party

Got it sewn up (up)
Just a nigga creepin' on dub (dub), tequila in my cup (up)
Drink it all, never get enough (no)
Bottle, gotta raise it on up (up), nights in my leather
Niggas gon' learn the four letters (yeah)
Walk in, not many better, members of the rage (yeah)
Now I just flip another page
Then I'm out in Paris with my bae, shit is not the same (yeah)
Nigga never plan (shh)
Walked in, I failed and I crumbled, knew I was a broken man (shh)
Bleed in the scene, I can achieve
What I dream, full steam on a hundo, always think of Virgil
I was always hit with the no-no
Gave no fucks, on the normal (uh), yes, I'm different (uh)
Everybody wanna talk shizzit
'Til they get punched in the lizzip (bitch)
You's a punk-bizzitch (huh)
I don't give a fuck what they say
Keep the city roots (Aroo, who), anybody else got loose
When I get it in, tripped on shrooms
And I'm screamin' out, "Fuck them"
Runnin' with the troops (fuck, yeah)
I'm a top-notch nigga you ain't ever seen (yeah)
You ain't happy with your life, you need to make a dream (ooh)
Off a movie set, dawg, it's another scene (yeah)
'Cause the, uh, so good, she don't wanna leave (ooh)
Just a lover in the night life (yeah)
Baby, love me, better get it, that's a stick, right? (Ooh)
Said she wanna swim in night vibes (yeah)
I can put you on, ma, dealin' with a kin' (yeah)

We was just there at the party, she was drinkin' prolly
She serious not sorry
That's when she just hit it hardly, started feelin' godly
Near death, mmh, out of body
We was just there at the party (where you at, nigga?)
We was just there at the party
We was just there at the party, she was drinkin' prolly
She serious not sorry
That's when she just hit it hardly, started feelin' godly
Near death, mmh, out of body
We was just there at the party (let's go)
We was just there at the party (Trav, woo)

I was just there at the function, had the shit bumpin'
Vivienne Westwood with the buttons (yeah)
I went no limit with the budget
P and the Cudi, had the hoes heavy on the money
Took her right down to the dungeon
Wildin' in the night, we ain't leavin' out 'til it's sunny (it's lit)
Heavy outside, how it's lookin' (ooh), baby not a rookie (ooh)
Hit the backdoor when they book me
Just need you to remember four letters
It's fake and the love (love)
That's why the rage live forever (ever)
Hot in a Comme de sweater, baby, cool me off
She gon' get a top, yeah, you dig it?
Switch on the Glock like a widget
I was in the party, told them brin' it back when they get it
Stars in my Rolls and my fitted
I be blowin' loud, you be lovin' mid, yeah, admit it
I need a bish that can dance (yeah)
Good with her hands, and know the plans in advance (yeah)
And she cummin' fast like a cheetah
But she not a cheetah
'Cause I'ma have to run from a cheetah (skrrt, skrrt)
Lockin' up the heart in a freezer (skrrt)
Gotta keep it cold, he cold, he cold (cold)
Cacti, mix it with tequila
Take it all at once, I'ma have to leave with a- (man)

We was just there at the party, she was drinkin' prolly
She serious not sorry
That's when she just hit it hardly, started feelin' godly
Near death, mmh, out of body
We was just there at the party
We was just there at the party
We was just there at the party, she was drinkin' prolly
She serious not sorry
That's when she just hit it hardly, started feelin' godly
Near death, mmh, out of body
We was just there at the party
We was just there at the party
