		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm driving too fast in my Lincoln town car and I think I just might flip it over
I've been in a rage and I'm headed your way with the devil on my fucking shoulder
Getting so high that I think I might die and I couldn't give a shit about it
Uppin all night it's a clear damn sky but my head is still super clouded

I've been drinking while I'm driving down the highway
Haven't blinked in like a minute yeah it's quite strange
I've been thinking 'bout all of the things I might say
Or might do to ya

Once I pull this trigger off
You'll be begging me to stop (yeah, yeah)
Tarantino killing love
I couldn't really give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

Telling you I won't slow down, won't slow down
Girl you gotta know right now, there's no way out
I'ma pull the trigger off
And I'ma let these bullets talk (yeah, yeah)

I've been outside for a long damn time
And I figured how this might go down
All these late nights I could tell the you're inside
You forgot to turn your lights all out
Kicking in the door while you're crying on the floor
Go ahead and put the phone right down
Who you tryna call it's a quarter past 4
Can't nobody hear you scream right now

I've been drinking while I'm driving down the highway
Haven't blinked in like a minute yeah it's quite strange
I've been thinking 'bout all of the things I might say
Or might do to ya

Once I pull this trigger off
You'll be begging me to stop (yeah, yeah)
Tarantino killing love
I couldn't really give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

Telling you I won't slow down, won't slow down
Girl you gotta know right now, there's no way out
I'ma pull the trigger off
And I'ma let these bullets talk (yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (uh)
See I'm not trying to hurt you
But I don't have a choice right now
If this is what it's come to
Then I'ma let it all rain down

Once I pull this trigger off
You'll be begging me to stop (yeah, yeah)
Tarantino killing love
I couldn't really give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

Telling you I won't slow down, won't slow down
Girl you gotta know right now, there's no way out
I'ma pull the trigger off
And I'ma let these bullets talk (yeah, yeah)

Yeah yeah

See patience is a virtue
And I'm all out of time right now, if I'ma send it all through
Then I sure wanna make it count
