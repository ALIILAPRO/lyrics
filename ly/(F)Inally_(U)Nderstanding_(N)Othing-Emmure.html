		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go.
Once again.
It's time to get dumb with the realness.
Always they have hated.
They have doubted.
They have given up on me.
So I'm asking if you're out there, anyone that's listening.
It's our time.
It's our place.
What we love is what we know.
If you're still with me after all these years.
Talking shit but you're checking out.
The same old shit.
Talking shit but you're checking out.
You go hard but not like this.
Bitch I get stupid.
Kill that shit.
