		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my sin and you got your sorrow
They're born from the din and come out at night
And they claim a debt on the rising of morrow
And only our love can suffice
Yes, only our love can suffice

I'm a recluse and you, you love people
You say there's no excuse for hiding away 
Though there's common sense in being a heathen 
Only your love makes me stray 
Yes, only your love makes me stray

And I'm trying to find good reason
Not to end up in denial
And then I realize you've been standing there a while
Wearing nothing but your love

I got my words and you got your feelings
You're such a flirt and I'm such a fool
Guess you know the cards since you are the dealer
Well, baby, will our love rule?
Is it true that our love will rule?

'Cause I'm trying to find my reason
But I end up in despair
And then I notice you doing that thing with your hair
And I got nothing on my mind but love
I got nothing on my mind but love
