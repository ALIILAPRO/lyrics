		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh) yeah (yeah, yeah)
You know, if I had a chance to do it all over again (oh, oh)
I wouldn't change shit (oh, oh)
(DA got that dope)
I'm screamin' out, "No regrets"

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, "No regrets")
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low
The 'Vette look like a storm (screamin' out, "No regrets")
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm

Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (woo)
Tin brain, probably fucked in the membrane
Slim Shade, minds in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame
(Screamin' out, "No regrets")
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put an end to me yet
(I'm screamin' out, "No regrets")

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, "No regrets")
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low
The 'Vette look like a storm
(Screamin' out, "No regrets")
Yeah, no apologies, I ain't takin' shit back
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost

Yeah
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the killshot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt
Should've never made a response to the disdain for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to "Arose" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill
(I'm screamin' out, "No regrets") Can't do it, nah

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, "No regrets")
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low
The 'Vette look like a storm (screamin' out, "No regrets")
No regrets though, no white flags either
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm
