		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Yeah, you're almost there, your time is up
Yeah, I know you're scared, don't press your luck
You're stressed enough, yeah, you're blessed so much
Man, I thank God, he keep blessin' us
Better luck, better luck next time (wait)
If we love, it's gon' be our best time (hey)
Tell me your feelings, I'll confess mine (wait)
Say you miss me, put you on the next flight (wait, wait)
Is you mad? (uh-uh-uh)
That's my bad (uh-uh-uh)
Watch my back (uh-uh-uh)
That's my task (uh-uh-uh)
Where I've been
Can't go back (uh-uh-uh)
Just got rich
Let's do math (uh-uh-uh, wait)
Pockets lit, yeah, my pockets lit
Just like scholarships, I learned how to get rich
I might change my name, all these counterfeits
She gon' scream my name like she throwin' fits
They throw shade, I get bread, I get lit, lit-lit-lit
Temper tantrums, they'll say it, just like lil' kids
I was broke, prayin' to the Lord, forgive me for my sins
All my enemies, fuck you mean? Trynna be my friends

Loner, loner, loner, loner (ay, alone, ay, alone)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (ay, alone, ay, alone)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (ay, alone, ay, alone)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (ay, alone, ay, alone)

It's just me and I'm alone again (damn)
Spendin' all my money on my own again (damn)
It's just me and I'm alone again (damn)
Spendin' all my money on my own again (damn, uh)
Wishin' we was home again, yeah
But now you be at home with him, yeah

Loner, loner, loner, loner (now you be at home, yeah, with him)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (now you be at home, yeah, with him)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (now you be at home, yeah, with him)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (now you be at home, yeah, with him)
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?) loner
Loner, loner, loner, loner (now you be at home, yeah, with him)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (damn, I wish you was right here)
Loner, loner, loner, loner (now you be at home, yeah, with him)
(Damn, damn, damn)

The number one rated mixtape of all time
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Damn, Pi'erre, where'd you find this?
