		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See a new boy in town
He trying to call me
But he dey move so funny
Gangster cunny o
I can't lie he fine
And he shoe always shine
But me I call calvary
Cover myself with blood of Jesus

Them no fit sight us
I face my front and close my eyes
Close my eyes and sleep off
I'm watching my TikTok
I face my front and close my eyes
Close my eyes, ah

I know you feeling me too
I know you want to consume me
I know you want to spend some cash
All I ask another to give me
See as I dey watch you like Disney
Me, I don't want to close my eyes
Cover myself with the blood of Jesus

See a new boy in town
He trying to call me
But he dey move so funny
Gangster cunny o
I can't lie he fine
And he shoe always shine
But me I call calvary
Cover myself with blood of Jesus

Them no fit sight us
I face my front and close my eyes
Close my eyes and sleep off
I'm watching my TikTok
I face my front and close my eyes
Close my eyes, ah
