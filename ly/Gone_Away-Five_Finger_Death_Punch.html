		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe in another life
I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal, it's so unfair

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away

Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
Black roses and Hail Mary's
I can't bring back what's taken from me

I reach to the sky
And call out your name
Oh please let me trade
I would

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it stings
Yeah, it stings now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away

Gone away
Gone away
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Ooh
Yeah ooh

I reach to the sky
And call out your name
Oh please let me trade
I would

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven is so far away

And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it stings
Yeah, it stings now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away
Gone away
Gone away
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh

And it feels, and it feels like
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away
