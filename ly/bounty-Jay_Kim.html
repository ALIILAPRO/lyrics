		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fucked around and told you all the things that I loved
Don't you know me better than the person I was
Won't you go around and tell your friends that I suck
Trying to write it over but you know me better
And I called, you showed no effort
Swear to god you were in my bedroom
That night must've been a mirage
A movie in my head that I stumbled on
But I don't wanna think about it now
Somebody take my brain and cut it out
Cus honestly if we just stayed apart
There'd be a little more of me and less of you around
But I don't wanna think about it now
Somebody take my brain and cut it out
Cus honestly if we just stayed apart
There'd be a little more of me and less of you around
Around me, baby put it around me
I could be a billionaire just put up a bounty
Trip to the Midwest and California surroundings
Don't want all that shit that come with being a crowned king
I left all my family and my feelings at home
Staring at a screen pretending I'm in control
Told all of my friends I'm back to being alone
Showing off my endgame it don't got any holes in it
But I don't wanna think about it now
Somebody take my brain and cut it out
Cus honestly if we just stayed apart
There'd be a little more of me and less of you around
But I don't wanna think about it now
Somebody take my brain and cut it out
Cus honestly if we just stayed apart
There'd be a little more of me and less of you around
Been down, I been a little bit down
I eat all my feelings so they don't hit the ground
Picture this I'm working on a energy cloud
Shield myself from everything that you're putting out
All the other kids they don't look just like me
Rounding up my efforts, set it up times three
Counting down the minutes every time I breathe
Wishfully hoping, I don't wanna think about it now
I know that I could do it all better
I'm burning up a hole in my sweater
I'm growing up and I been so anxious
Cus what if I can't keep it together
But I don't wanna think about it now
Somebody take my brain and cut it out
Cus honestly if we just stayed apart
There'd be a little more of me and less of you around
But I don't wanna think about it now
Somebody take my brain and cut it out
Cus honestly if we just stayed apart
There'd be a little more of me and less of you around
