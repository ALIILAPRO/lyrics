		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
You used to lift me up
Now you get me down

If I was to walk away
From you my love
Could I laugh again?
If I walk away from you
And leave my love
Could I laugh again? (Again, again)

You're killing me again
Am I still in your head?
You used to light me up
Now you shut me down

If I was to walk away
From you my love
Could I laugh again?
If I walk away from you
And leave my love
Could I laugh again?

I'm losing you again
Like getting me inside
I used to lift you up
Now I get you down

Without your love
You're tearing me apart
With you close by
You're crushing me inside

Without your love
You're tearing me apart
Without your love
I'm doused in madness
Can't lose this sadness

Can't lose this sadness
Can't lose this sadness

You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
Without your love (you used to lift me up)
You're crushing me inside (now you get me down)

With you close by
I'm doused in madness
Can't lose this sadness

It's ripping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know why

It's ripping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why

Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love

It's tearing me apart
