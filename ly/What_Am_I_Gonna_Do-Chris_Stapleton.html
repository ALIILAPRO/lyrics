		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What am I gonna do
When I get over you?
What am I gonna be
When you're just a memory?
What am I gonna drink
When I don't have to think
About what I'm gonna do without you?

Been drinking everything on that shelf
Feels like I'm killing myself
You're gone and it hurts like hell
Wishing I was anybody else

What am I gonna do
When I get over you?
What am I gonna be
When you're just a memory?
What am I gonna drink
When I don't have to think
About what I'm gonna do without you?

Jukebox with a neon glow
Keeps playing That's The Way Love Goes
Time keeps ticking on by so slow
They say it'll heal ya but I hope it don't though

What am I gonna do
When I get over you?
What am I gonna be
When you're just a memory?
What am I gonna drink
When I don't have to think
About what I'm gonna do without you?
