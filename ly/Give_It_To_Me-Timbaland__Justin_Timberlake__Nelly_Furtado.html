		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it going, is it going, is it going, is it going?
I don't know what you're looking for
Oh, yeah, boy, come on

I'm the type of girl that'll look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as it comes, if you don't know why I'm fly
I seen ya try to switch it up, but, girl, you ain't that dope
I'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mami, si mami
Amnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
Love my ass, and my abs in the video called Promiscuous
My style is re-dic-dic-diculous, 'ulous, 'ulous

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

When Timbo is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple grand
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-i-a way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your song gonna top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fan
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling?
I don't think you came in clear
When you're sitting on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV, just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
Now if se-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run would never be over, not at least until we say 

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Oh yeah, improve
Oh yeah, improve
Oh yeah, improve
Oh yeah, improve
Oh yeah, improve
Oh yeah, improve
Oh yeah, improve
Oh yeah, improve

(If, you, see, us, in, the-)
Club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
