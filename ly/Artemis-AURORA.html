		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What will you do when she drinks the sea?
Drown her in sorrow or let her be free?
When she's upset, all of her heart is cold (ah-ah-ah)
What will you do when she eats the moon?
Make her return it or give her a spoon?
When she is full, all of her heart is warm (ah-ah-ah)

The mother made us a savage daughter
Who never begs for forgiveness
I always wondered why they all came back for more

What will you do when she takes your throne?
Beg for her power or throw her a bone?
All that she has traded for love is yours (ah-ah-ah)
What will you do when she takes off her clothes?
Beg for her body or touch her soul?
When you're alone dreaming of her you sigh (ah-ah-ah)

The mother made us a savage daughter
Who never begs for forgiveness
I always wondered why they all came back for more

The gods have made us a virgin hunter
Who in the storm becomes stillness
I always wondered why they all came back for more
Came back for more
