		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're down, you think it's done
The world around makes you numb
I'll be there for you
I promise you

It's not the last of us
No, I won't give you up
Until my heart stops
Baby, it's not the last of us
'Cause you're all I'm living for
Even if love is war
Come on, take your best shot
Baby, it's not the last of us

I will fight
For your love, I would kill, I would die
Even if we run out of time
Baby, it's not the last of us
Hold the line
Let the shadows fall behind
We can crash, we can light up the night
Baby, it's not the last of us

Baby, it's not the last of us

When you're down, you think it's done
The world around makes you numb
I'll be there for you
I promise you

It's not the last of us
No, I won't give you up
Until my heart stops
Baby, it's not the last of us

I will fight
For your love, I would kill, I would die
Even if we run out of time
Baby, it's not the last of us
Hold the line
Let the shadows fall behind
We can crash, we can light up the night
Baby, it's not the last of us

Baby, it's not the last of us

Hold the line
Let the shadows fall behind
We can crash, we can light up the night
Baby, it's not the last of us
