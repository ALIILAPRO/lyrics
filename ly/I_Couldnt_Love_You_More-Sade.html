		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't love you more
If time was running out
I couldn't love you more
Oh, right now, baby

Oh, right now, baby

Take me by the hand, come on
Be my darling, be the one
I wouldn't want to lay or ever love with another
If everyone in the world
Could give me what I wanted
I wouldn't want for more than I have, hey yeah
I couldn't love you more if I tried

Couldn't love you more, boy
Couldn't love you more, boy

'Cause darling, I'm on your side
I really am on your side
My love, I'm on your side
Oh, right now, baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I couldn't love you more, boy
Stay exactly how you are, yeah, yeah
I couldn't love you more, boy
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more, boy
Stay exactly how you are, yeah, yeah
I couldn't love you more, boy
Couldn't love you more

If everyone in the world (on your side)
Would give me their treasure (on your side)
I would not want for more (on your side)
Than I have right now (oh, right now, baby)
