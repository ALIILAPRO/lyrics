		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down

See, I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

One, two, three, one two, three, drink
One, two, three, one two, three, drink
One, two, three, one two, three, drink

Throw 'em back, till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

One, two, three, one two, three, drink
One, two, three, one two, three, drink
One, two, three, one two, three, drink

Throw 'em back till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
Oh, I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

And I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
As I'm just holding on for tonight
No I'm I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
As I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
