		  Him

Here I am different in this normal world
Why did you tease me, made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly, please just go away

Him
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
Him
Why you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay

As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away

I can see it's hard to find
Him
This blessing in disguise
Why you treat me this way?
Him
Made the hate stay

Faget
Faget
Faget

Here I am, different in this normal world
Why did you tease me, made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly, please just go away

Him
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
Why you treat me this way?
Him
Made the hate stay

Faget
You'll see

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day, son
You faget, get away, we don't want none

I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way every day
Who gives a fuck, right now I got something to say
To all the people that think I'm strange
And I should be out here locked up in a cage

You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty boy feeling like I'm enslaved
To a world that never appreciated shit
Y'all can suck my dick and fucking like it

He had my gun but he had the body mighty any say
He had my gun but he had the body mighty anyway
He had my gun but he had the body mighty, going to say
He had my gun but he had the body mighty anyway

He had my gun but he had the body mighty any say
He had my gun but he had the body mighty going away
He had my gun but he had the body mighty, going to say
He had my gun but he had the body mighty anyway

I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world

All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?

All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?

All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life

I'm just a faget (faget)
I'm just a faget (faget)
I'm just a faget (faget)
I'm a faget (faget)

I'm not a faget (or am I?) (faget)
I'm not a faget (or am I?) (faget)
I'm not a faget (or am I?) (faget)
You motherfucking queers
