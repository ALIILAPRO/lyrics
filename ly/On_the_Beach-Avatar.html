		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I throw myself into the ocean
To the tune of all the sirens
It's the error of the ages
And the best is yet to come, babe
The best is yet to come

The best is yet to come

Watch the light across the sky tonight
People gather on the beach to see
Look at me, look at you
Lucky us, we made it
Saw it through to the end

All the nights I spend here staring
Through the window at the winds
To try to hear the ancient voices
But I know we're all alone, babe
We are all alone

We are all alone

Watch the light across the sky tonight
People gather on the beach to see
Look at me, look at you
Lucky us, we made it
Saw it through to the end

Look at me
Look at you
Look at you
Lucky us, we made it
Look at me
Look at you
Look at you
Lucky us, we made it

Watch the light across the sky tonight
People gather on the beach to see
Look at me, look at you
Lucky us, we made it
Saw it through to the end
