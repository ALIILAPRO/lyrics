		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been feeling kinda lonely
Maybe I need someone to hold me
I don’t wanna bother
But what are you doing tonight?
Always feel best when I’m next to you
Sipping wine
Getting high doing nothing with you
Soon as you walk in the room
You make me feel alright

Slingshot take me from the bottom to the top
Girl, you make me feel wow
Happy is when you’re around
You make me feel alright
Oh my my, life is better higher
Close to the light
Oh the world shines brighter
Feel a little lighter

I feel like I could just float away
Whenever you’re with mе my worries fade
(fade away)
You got mе high and I ain't coming down
Overcomplicating seems to get the best of me
Sometimes but you make me feel alright

Slingshot take me from the bottom to the top
Girl, you make me feel wow
Happy is when you’re around
You make me feel alright
Oh my my, life is better higher
Close to the light
Oh the world shines brighter
Feel a little lighter

Oh this way I’ve never felt before
Hands to the sky, good vibes in store
I’ll sing out loud, I don’t wanna come down
Don’t wanna lose this feeling I’ve found
Oh this way I've never felt before
Hands to the sky, good vibes in store
I’ll sing out loud, I don’t wanna come down
Don’t wanna lose this feeling I’ve found

Slingshot take me from the bottom to the top
Girl, you make me feel wow
Happy is when you’re around
Oh my my, life is better higher
Close to the light
Oh the world shines brighter
Feel a little lighter
