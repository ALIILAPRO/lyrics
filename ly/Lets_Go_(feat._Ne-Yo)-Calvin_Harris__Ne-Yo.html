		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go
Make no excuses now, I'm talking here and now, I'm talking here and now
Let's go!
Your time is running out, I'm talking here and now, I'm talking here and now
It's not about what you've done, it's about what you doing
It's all about where you going, no matter where you've been, let's go!

Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go! (hey it's now or never oh oh)
Let's go! (tomorrow's good, tonight is better)
Oh, oh let's go!

There is no better time, I'm talking here and now, I'm talking here and now
Let's go!
Right now is where you shine, I'm talking here and now, I'm talking here and now
It's not about what you've done, it's about what you doing
It's all about where you going, no matter where you've been, let's go!

Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go! (hey it's now or never oh, oh)
Let's go! (tomorrow's good, tonight is better, oh oh)

Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight, tonight let's go!

Let's go!
Ooh let's go!(hey it's now or never oh, oh)
Let's go! (tomorrow's good, tonight is better, oh oh)
Ohh, let's go!
