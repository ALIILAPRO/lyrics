		  Well now, Chief
I can see that you're a man of integrity
Thank you
But ask yourself this

Have you got a sweet tooth?
I do
A hunger that you have to feed
Have you got a sweet tooth?
I do
Well, we've got everything you need (mm)
Don't give me that conscience nonsense
It's simply quid pro quo
So, a hundred of your favorites
Sorry, I'm afraid it's no

Promised the wife I'd cut down on chocolate
You know, I gotta get in shape for the policeman's ball, so

But think about your sweet tooth
I do
I've had it since I was a boy
A naughty little sweet tooth
It's true
The only thing that brings you joy
Don't look at your waistline
It's fine (come on)
Who needs to see their toes?
So, seven hundred boxes?
That's a lotta chocolates (mm-hmm)
No

Well, come on, let's give it the big sale

Have you got a sweet tooth?
Me too (fellas)
Have you got the hots for chocs? (I do, really, yeah)
Do you think the candy's dandy? (Oh, yeah)
Well, we've got lots and lots and lots
And lots and lots and lots (why am I singing?)

If the wife's complaining
Body shaming
It's amazing what a tailor can conceal
Keep your wretched chocolates
Eighteen hundred boxes?
Oh, deal
