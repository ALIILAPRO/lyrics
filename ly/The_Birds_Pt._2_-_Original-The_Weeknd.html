		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, with a nigga like me
Whoa, with a nigga like me

She said please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her
She begged me, she gave me all her pills
Now her back hurts, ooh, she lost control

Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby, got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long before she falls out of love, yeah

Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
Just a bird

I tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you
But you never let me miss you
I thought I told you
I'm not him, I'm not him
Look at what you did, nobody forced your hand
And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I begged, I begged

Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long, before she falls out of love, yeah

Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss (ooh, oh, whoa)
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her (if she only knew)
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
(Just a bird)
Just a bird
