		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, you know what it is, what it is
When we do what we do
Uh, yeah

Look
If good girls get down on the floor
Tell me, how low will a bad girl go?
She probably pick it up, drop it down real slow
Look at that: she's upside down on the pole
That's when I grab the knot throw it up in the sky
Let it come down slow, watch it all fly
Front to the back
Then side to the side
Can we head back to my crib for the night?

That's how it goes down
All night long
She whispers in my ear, says she loves my song
This is why I'm hot
She got it on her phone
Top ring download, number one ring tone
I'm in my zone
Tell me, what's good, what it be?
Can't say I'm what ya want
I got what ya need
All night, it's all right
We can dance, but ya gotta keep it up a lil' somethin'

Like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Baby, do you want it?
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this

Girl, tell me if you want it like this
If you want to, you can back it up
You say you like it rough; won't you let me smack it up?
Calm on you a**; that's if you let me touch
I don't care 'bout your breast
You can be an A-cup
I know what I like
And, baby, that's below the waist
I'm a baller, baby; I'll hold us safe
I got about ten lawyers to blow the case
So we don't gotta worry 'bout those who hate

I'm like the 2007 Nino
Dropped a few G's
I'm a shaped like Gino
Homey, don't act like you know what I mean
Oh, see, I'm the freshest m********* on the screen, oh
Back of the club
All night long
Grand Monea
Pop a case till the dawn
Shorty says she love it when I let her call me Sean
So if you really down, baby, we can get it on

Like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Baby, do you want it?
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this
Now break it down

Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Say what, say what, say what, say what
Say what, say what, say what, say what

Gimme that all of that 
Break it down
Girl, shake it up now; drop it to the ground
Girl, you're way too hot
Go a little lower
Now, baby, beat it up, like Rocky Balboa
Yeah, that's what I said
Shorty, go 'head
Show me what ya got
Here's a little more bread
You know how I shine
A hundred on the wrist
If you like what you see
Then ya gotta keep it up a lil' something

Like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Baby, do you want it?
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this
