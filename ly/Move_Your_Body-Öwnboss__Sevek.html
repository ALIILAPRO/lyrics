		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The time is now and I'm here to stay
Come with me, baby, it's time to play
I took a vow, so I'll be okay
Come with me, baby, I'm yours today

Move your feet, step up to the beat
Got the urge to move your body
Move your feet, step up to the beat
Got the urge to move your body

The time is now and I'm here to stay
Come with me, baby, it's time to play
I took a vow, so I'll be okay
Come with me, baby, I'm yours today

Move your feet, step up to the beat
Got the urge to move your body
Move your feet, step up to the beat
Got the urge to move your body
