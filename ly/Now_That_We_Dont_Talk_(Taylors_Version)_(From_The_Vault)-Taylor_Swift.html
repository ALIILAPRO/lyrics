		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You went to a party
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea
Don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though
On the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're tryin' lives on
I miss the old ways
You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot be your friend
So I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with
Truth is I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended

So I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left ('til I left)
I cannot be your friend
So I pay the price of what I lost (of what I lost)
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off
Now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it was to be
Now that we don't talk
