		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven's got my back
I should leave today
Miracles don't last
And we won't if we stay

I've been dancin' in the dark, and you've been dancin' in the light
Yeah, you hate me in the mornin', but you love me every night
And I wish I could've kept you, but the world got in the way
And I know we ain't together, but I wanna run away

Run away with you
I wanna run away with you
Wanna run away, run away with you
I wanna run away with you
Maybe if we made it far enough
We could find a place to just be us
I wanna run away with you

You come over late
Make me scream your name then you run away
You said you would stay, kinda wish you would
Don't know what you want
No, I hate your mum, always under my
You said you would stay, God, I'm losing my shit

I've been dancin' in the dark, and you've been dancin' in the light
Yeah, you hate me in the mornin', but you love me every night
And I wish I could've kept you, but the world got in the way
And I know we ain't together, but I wanna run away

Run away with you
I wanna run away with you
Wanna run away, run away with you
I wanna run away with you
Maybe if we made it far enough
We could find a place to just be us
I wanna run away with you

I've been dancin' in the dark, and you've been dancin' in the light
Yeah, you hate me in the mornin', but you love me every night
And I wish I could've kept you, but the world got in the way
And I know we ain't together, but I wanna run away
Run away with you
