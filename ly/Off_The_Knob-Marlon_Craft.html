		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  4 am and I’m twisted off the Knob
Creek that is, piece of this
What you don’t want, bet you both front
You and that weak-ass team you with
I be in my mind where it’s bleak as shit
I’m down on my town on some Bleecker shit
It seem these days we don’t dream of shit
If it ain’t some get rich schemin’ shit

I’ma reach the riches, I don’t fiend for it
But I fiend for love, even more for lust
Always ready to bust me some cheeks and shit
But I’m super cuffed, my predicament
I’ma need a min', when I walk in the spot
I be nervous and hot, let me brеathe a bit
I’ma ask your name but know y’all is lame
And еverybody know that I
Hate cheese and shit
Stuck in the crib, my recent shit
Tryna find peace and shit
But I don’t have a choice 'cause
I ain’t tryna get people sick
On some decent shit
While y’all outside wildin’
I think you afraid just to
Sit inside wit yourself
For a while and, yo, I need admit
I been forced to face up to a lot of habit's
That I built from sadness that I need to quit
I can feel the cold outside, yeah
Sittin' in this empty space, yeah
I won’t fill it up with lies, no
I don’t gotta run their race, yeah
Livin' in abundant waste, yeah
I been in a one-way chase
Tryin’ to outrun my fate
And I don’t even know it's face
What you call a guilty pleasure
That you don’t feel guilty 'bout?
Think you call that a good night
Cravin' one, it’s been weeks without
Tallyin' these numbers
How you quantify a peace amount?
Maybe I don’t need to count

5 am and I’m twisted off the Knob
Creek, that is, piece of this
What you don’t want, bet you both front
You and that weak-ass team you with
I be in my mind where it’s bleak as shit
I’m down on my town on some Bleecker shit
Seem these days we don’t dream of shit
If it ain’t some get rich schemin’ shit
