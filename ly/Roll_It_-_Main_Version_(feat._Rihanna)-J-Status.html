		  Roll
Roll it, girl, roll it, girl

Control it, girl, roll it, girl

Roll (you know me love di way you work that body)
Roll it, girl, roll it, girl
Roll (gyal, you don't stop once you get started)
Control it, girl, roll it, girl 

Lose yourself and whine your waistline (baby, take your time) 
Grind your body to the bassline (make me lose my mind) 
Shake that thing your mama gave you (it's too big to hide) 
It's a blessing that she made you (girl, me nah go lie) 
Dip it fast and dip it slow (any way you like) 
Don't hold back, just let it go (baby, it's alright) 

Roll
Roll it, girl, roll it, girl
Roll
Control it, girl, roll it, girl 
Roll (you know me love di way you work that body)
Roll it, girl, roll it, girl
Roll (gyal, you don't stop once you get started)
Control it, girl, roll it, girl 

So you say that you want me to roll it 
Tell me, boy, now can you control it? 
I bring the fire, you bring the heat 
Don't hold back, baby, give it to me 
It ain't so easy to please me, ya know 
Boy put it on me and then we can roll (yeah)

Brand new style come fi done di place up 
All of my girl come whine yuh waste up
