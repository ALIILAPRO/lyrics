		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took you down to the little place by the river
I'm going down down, down down, down
Let you play with my heart like it's nothing but water
Falling down down, down down

Oh oh

Someone help me, it's moving faster then ever
A second chance is another way to remember
I'm going down down, down down, down
I'm going down down, down down

Oh oh

And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to this

Silence is when our time is forgotten
It's movements you won't last
I'm going down down, down down, down
I'm going down down, down down

Oh oh

And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to this
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to this
