		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pulled up to a palace in old town
Twenty minutes from Bali, oh yeah
Got a feeling that it's about to go down
Party people wanna party so I say

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
I'mma love you, love you, love you long time
So gimme, gimme the way that I like it

Everybody all stay when the night ends
We can do it all again when the sun's up
You know I really wanna be that one you wind in
You know you really wanna give me your love

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
I'mma love you, love you, love you long time
So gimme, gimme the way that I like it

Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy 'cause
I need you, need you, need you
Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy
Gotta gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme that love
(Give me, give me that)

Gimme that
Gimme, gimme that

Hang out with my girls in Nevada
Caliente we'll be looking for fun
No rush but just don't make it harder
We both know that you really wanna

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
I'mma love you, love you, love you long time
So gimme, gimme the way that I like it

Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy 'cause
I need you, need you, need you
Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy
Gotta gimme, gimme, gimme that love
(Give me, give me that)

Gimme that
Gimme, gimme that

We can do it, the way I like it
(Gimme, gimme the way I like it)
We can do it, the way I like it
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme that
(Gimme, gimme that)

Gimme that
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme that
