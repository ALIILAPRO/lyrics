		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you tell me that you love me every night
When you tell me everything will be alright
When you tell me that the sky could fall
But you'd still be there through it all
I know there's something else that's on your mind

Because you don't even look me in the eyes
When you tell me
Oh, you don't even believe the lies
That you sell me
I know that you're leaving, so just say, "Goodbye"
I don't need a reason, I won't be surprised
When you tell me that you need to find yourself
Or you tell me that you've found someone else, oh

You say you're better off because of me
That a part of your heart'll always love me
But a Band-Aid on a bullet hole doesn't help
Gonna hurt like hell

If you don't even look me in the eyes
When you tell me
Oh, you don't even believe the lies
That you sell me
I know that you're leaving, so just say, "Goodbye"
I don't need a reason, I won't be surprised
If you don't even look me in the eyes
When you tell me

Can you tell me?
Ooh

Oh, you don't even look me in the eyes
When you tell me
Oh, you don't even believe the lies
That you're selling me, yeah
I know that you're leaving, (that you?) say, "Goodbye"
I don't need a reason, I won't be surprised
But I need you to look me in the eyes
When you tell me

When you tell me
