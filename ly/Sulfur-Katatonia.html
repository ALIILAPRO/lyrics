		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm drawing back time
To feel things once again
As when I had found them

I saw you grow older
Saw myself grow older too
But not as much as you
If I only knew

I had sulfur in my heart
But not enough strength to give it a spark
I didn't know when to start
When we were bright or when we were dark
I had a wind in my chest
Blew as hard as it ever could
I could have written books for you
If I only knew

I held my head down I know
And you walked around in circles
I'm sure you already knew
If I only knew it too

So much I want to ask you
You have no time to let me do so
There is no light in my pathway
You must tell me where to go
