		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a pill and go to sleep
I'm chasing witches in the street
I'm the last page in your book
Can't write a song, only do hooks
Watching horses in the fields
The dragon rests in agony
When I'm afraid, I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time
When I'm afraid, I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time

Isolation caved in
I adore you
The sound of your skin

So many lies that I've found
Blood, Heaven, I stick to the ground
So many times I realized
What I seek for is right in front of my eyes
I'm alone in a hole in the ground
A theater of dogs is still around
My furniture has come alive
I'm dancing with a candlestick tonight
Flying kites, raven outside my window
Smiles with fright

Isolation caved in
I adore you
The sound of your skin
Isolation caved in
I adore you
The sound of your skin
Isolation caved in
I adore you
The sound of your skin
