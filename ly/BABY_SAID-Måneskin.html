		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's your thoughts about religion?
Are you close to your mother?
Tell me 'bout your dream vacation
And all of your ex lovers
Tell me now
What's that look on your face?
She puts her hand on my lips, begging 
"Please, end this conversation"

Baby said
"When you're talking, I go dead"
"Shut your mouth, give me your head" (uh-uh-uh-uh)
I know you really want to
Baby said
"Let me taste your silhouette"
"You can talk between my legs" (uh-uh-uh-uh)
I know you really want to

Tell me, what's your favorite color?
And all of your ambitions
I'm not afraid of you being vulgar
But why are you so vicious?
Tell me now
"What's that look on your face?"
She puts her hand on my lips, begging
"Please, end this conversation"

Baby said
"When you're talking, I go dead"
"Shut your mouth, give me your head" (uh-uh-uh-uh)
I know you really want to
Baby said
"Let me taste your silhouette"
"You can talk between my legs" (uh-uh-uh-uh)
I know you really want to

I was running and running and running and running and running after you 
I was running and running and running and running and running after you
I was crying and loving while you were just coming and howling at the moon
Yeah, you were running and running and running away from this conversation

Baby said
"When you're talking, I go dead"
"Shut your mouth, give me your head" (uh-uh-uh-uh)
I know you really want to
Baby said
"Let me taste your silhouette"
"You can talk between my legs" (uh-uh-uh-uh)
I know you really want to (ow!)

I wish she didn't, but my baby said
I wish she didn't, but my baby said
I wish she didn't, but my baby said
I wish she didn't, but my baby said
