		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Far from home, getting close
And the music takes us further out into the unknown
In the dark, in the zone
I just texted you my address, save my name in your phone

(Ah)
Go left at the light, then pull over on the right, ah
(Ah)
So come take a bite in the middle of the night

My neck, to die for
My legs, to die for
This ah-ah sex, to die for
I want someone who thinks I'm to die
My taste, to die for
My waist, to die for
This boom-boom bass, to die for
I want someone who thinks I'm to die for

I want someone who thinks I'm to die for

I'm that girl you don't wanna lose
Cutthroat from my head to my shoes
One look and I'm already your muse
Hold on to me tight when I move
Grip right, lock eyes on you
Not for life, just tonight is my mood
Be bad, boy, I want you to
Bad boy, I want you too

(Ah)
Go left at the light, then pull over on the right, ah
(Ah)
So come take a bite in the middle of the night

My neck, (yeah) to die for
My legs, (yeah) to die for
This ah-ah sex, to die for
I want someone who thinks I'm to die
My taste, to die for
My waist, to die for
This boom-boom bass, to die for
I want someone who thinks I'm to die for

Yeah, yeah
Uh-huh
I want someone who thinks I'm to die for
