		  Mona Lisa, ayy
Mona Lisa

Love is when you try to place it out your mind
But you can't turn the radio down
And you can't think of anyone else
And love is when you try to make it out alive
But you can't turn the radio down
And you can't think of anyone else

Uh-huh, look
I can see your face in Parisian paintings, the Mona Lisa
I can hear your voice in the streets and the TV stations, and the polices
I can feel the strains on my wrist, I don't need these bracelets
Of all the things that she keeps in cages
Uh-huh, I'm her leastest favorite, uh-huh, and she said

I was 'bout to give you all of me on all the weekends
And all I wanted was apologies and all of your bed, uh
Over my heels and fallin' on my head
But all of my feels were already dead
And if I could rewind it for you
If you could remind me of
What I felt before I fell for your idea of love out here

Love is when you try to place it out your mind
But you can't turn the radio down
And you can't think of anyone else
And love is when you try to make it out alive
But you can't turn the radio down
And you can't think of anyone else

Uh, Mona Lisa, oh
Yeah, Mona Lisa, ayy
Mona Lisa, uh, yeah
Yeah, Mona Lisa, oh
Mona Li-uh-uh
Uh, Mona Lisa, oh, yeah

I know you like your space and distance
Yeah, you don't take admissions
They told you not to date musicians
Yeah, but can't make you listen
Stick to the ones who let you make
All the decisions and look the other way (all the)
And you already know what your mother'll say (all the)
And you already know I'm a number away

I was 'bout to give you all of me on all the weekends
And all I wanted was apologies and all of your bed, uh
Over my heels and fallin' on my head
But all of my feels were already dead
And if I could rewind it for you
If you could remind me of
What I felt before I fell for your idea of love out here

Love is when you try to place it out your mind
But you can't turn the radio down
And you can't think of anyone else
And love is when you try to make it out alive
But you can't turn the radio down
And you can't think of anyone else

Uh, Mona Lisa, oh
Yeah, Mona Lisa, ayy
Mona Lisa, uh, yeah
Yeah, Mona Lisa, oh
Mona Li-uh-uh
Uh, Mona Lisa, oh, yeah
