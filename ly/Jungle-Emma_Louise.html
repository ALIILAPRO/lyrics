		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a dark room we fight, make up for our love
I've been thinking, thinking 'bout you, 'bout us
And we're moving slow, our hearts beat so fast
I've been dreaming, dreaming 'bout you, 'bout us

Hey, hey, hey, hey
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh

I was speaking soft, see the pain in your eyes
I've been feeling, feeling for you, my love
And our bodies are tired, our shadows will dance
I've been aching, aching for you, my love

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh

My love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me, I have trouble
Understanding myself, understanding myself
And my love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me, I have trouble
Understanding myself, understanding myself

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, (my head is a jungle)
Oh, (my head is a jungle)
Oh, (my head is a jungle)
Oh
