		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna slide in the Wraith
When that bitch saw that body, she unfucked and bended her booty
I'm ridin' that coupe, that motherfucker shoot
And then boom, and then boom, and then bang
I just pulled up in the end of the 24/7, that big body crank, yeah
Bitch, I'm as high as a crane, I'm as hot as a flame
Don't fuck with the gang, bitch, yeah
I'm ridin' in the six, big body, big body boolin', hit my, yeah
I just fucked on that lil' bitch
She suckin' my dick and she callin' him daddy, yeah
I just pulled up in that big body Tonka
Lil' bitch, you best know what I'm havin', racks
Yeah, big old banks, big old bench
You want Actavis stuffed in the grass
I pull up, an arm and a limb, I pull up, an arm and a hand
Pull an arm and a hand, pull up with arm and a hand

They givin' the shoes the blam, the big body bang
Bullet like planes in the sky, know that I'm high, bitch, I'm fly
I'm swervin' and they wanna slide
We fuckin' ride in the motherfuckin'
Yeah, I could do it all night, do it from top to the bottom, I'll do it
I got the gun with the lock, I got some crank in my sock
Bitch, when the hell did I flop? Bitch, when the hell did I stop?
You know every time that I drop, all of you motherfuckers watch (yeah)
So I'ma call this song "Watch," call this song "Sit back and watch"
Bitch, I got plenty of rock, bitch, I got baguettes on watch
I've just been stretchin' my cup up, I've just been sippin' on Wock'
I don't even feel like drop, she ripped that Tee and her top
I don't even feel like drop, she ripped that Tee and her top (ah)

I wanna slide in the Wraith
When that bitch saw that body, she unfucked and bended her booty
I'm ridin' that coupe, that motherfucker shoot
And then boom, and then boom, and then bang
I just pulled up in the end of the 24/7, that big body crank, yeah
Bitch, I'm as high as a crane, I'm as hot as a flame
Don't fuck with the gang, bitch, yeah
I'm ridin' in the six, big body, big body boolin', hit my, yeah
I just fucked on that lil' bitch
She suckin' my dick and she callin' him daddy, yeah
I just pulled up in that big body Tonka
Lil' bitch, you best know what I'm havin', racks
Yeah, big old banks, big old bench
You want Actavis stuffed in the grass
I pull up, an arm and a limb, I pull up, an arm and a hand
Pull an arm and a hand, pull up with arm and a hand
