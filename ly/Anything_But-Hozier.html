		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  C'mere to me, I wish I was a may fly on the River Tay
I'd fit all my joys and my pleasures in one perfect day
I wish I was the sunlight just sitting on The Mississippi
I'd settle for a shopping trolley in The Liffey
In a shot I'd swap my body for a body of water
Worry the cliff side top as a wave crashing over
I'd lower the world in a flood
Or better yet I'd cause a drought
If I was a rip tide, I wouldn't take you out

I don't wanna be anything, yeah
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do anything if you'd hear me say

Go look another way
Look another way

Look, I wanna be loud
So loud, I'm talking seismic
I wanna be soft as a single stone in a rainstick
I wanna be the thunder of a hundred thousand hooves moving quick
If I was a stampede, you wouldn't get a kick

I wanna be the shadow when my bright future's behind me
I wanna be the last thing anybody ever sees
I hear he touches your hand and then you fly away together
If I had his job, you would live forever

I don't wanna be anything, yeah
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
I would do anything if you'd hear me say

Go look another way
Look another way

I don't wanna be anything, hey
(I don't wanna be anything)
But I would do anything (go look another way)
I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
(I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be)
Don't wanna be anything, I
Don't wanna be anything

(I don't wanna be anything, hey)
Go look another way
(I don't wanna be anything, I don't wanna be anything, be anything)
Look another way
