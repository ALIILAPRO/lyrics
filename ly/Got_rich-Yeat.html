		  (Wake up, F1lthy)
I just pulled up in the Tonka
I done got rich, yeah, the X got a whole lot stronger
I done got rich, yeah, bitch, I blew up like Osama, yeah
I done got rich, yeah, been too turnt all damn summer
I can't even trust myself, yeah, how can I trust you? Yeah
I just walk in YSL, yeah, and I bought me like five shoes
I'm already up at the top with no maximum, don't got a limit, yeah
I would just ride around, GLE AMG 43, windows tinted

Not no quarantine, yeah, we outside, yeah, we outside
Yeah, not no pork and beans, we got rice
My bitch 'bout to pull up on me to suck my dick, 'bout to get me right
I don't like wasting time so much, my watches filled with ice
Yeah, y'all be standing, I got a Lamb' truck
I can't stand them, yeah, I heard enough
Yeah, took a cranky in the Lamb', whole left side is scuffed, yeah
I get cranky in the AM, need to Perky up
They been wonderin' why they ain't made it, they not turnt enough
Got the blick on my side, keep it super tucked
I ran up an M, bitch, I'm super up
My bitch just started drinkin' lean, she got a stupid gut
Yeah, I just been fuckin' my money up
I spent twenty bands today and I made back forty of 'em
We don't be doin' no lil' shit, that's why I got the big body truck
I don't be on no chill shit, I really be on that turn it up

(Wake up, F1lthy)
I just pulled up in the Tonka

I done got rich, yeah, bitch, I blew up like Osama, yeah
I done got rich, yeah, been too turnt all damn summer
I can't even trust myself, yeah, how can I trust you? Yeah
