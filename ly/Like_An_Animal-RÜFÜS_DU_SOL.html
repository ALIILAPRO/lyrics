		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long have I been on a hunt for you?
No sound, of anything that I can do
But I don't mind, I don't mind
'Cause there's nothing left to lose
For the first time, the first time
I'm calling out for you!

Like an animal, I still got love for you
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home for you
Like an animal, I still got love for you
Hear me calling love, I'm calling out for you
Like an animal, I still got love for you
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home for you

First light washing up against the shore
Sweet love, you're the one that I adore
And I don't mind, I don't mind
If I'm running after you
It's been a long time, a long time
But know I got the love for you

Like an animal, I still got love for you
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home for you
Like an animal, I still got love for you
Hear me calling love, I'm calling out for you
Like an animal, I still got love for you
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home for you
