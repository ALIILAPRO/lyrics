		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye aye aye
Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye aye aye
Mmmm
Aye
She get a mood swing outta everybody
But it ain't everybody girl it's your body
Causing this drama
Fucking your commas
So I ain't gone lie yeah it's your fault
You you're OG you you're own boss
Prolly don't even wanna listen to your own daddy
But you'll get nasty
Yeah you'll get nasty
Back and forth we go
Like a merry-go
I just wanna help you see no evil
But it's in your brain and your thoughts can't reload
And he fucked you so you don't fuck with people
I just want you free so you can go and get better
Put it all on me and let me
Fuck you better
Your toxicity outta control I don't know where we gone go
But I know all this is over
I face the truth too
I've been here you've been to
And I've found my issue
That's your issue
You just don't think
I know that you hate me too
But that's old news
And get out your feelings
You young girl go get it
You young girl go live it
And we got drinks in the building
You know you get free in the building
Blowing tree in the building
A couple friends in the building
Won't you get high as me in the building
Won't you come outside with me girl it's chilly
Won't you come outside with me girl it's chilly
Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye aye aye
Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye aye aye
Mmmm
Aye
She get a mood swing outta everybody
But it ain't everybody girl it's your body
Causing this drama
Fucking your commas
So I ain't gone lie yeah it's your fault
You you're OG you you're own boss
Prolly don't even wanna listen to your own daddy
But you'll get nasty
Yeah you'll get nasty
