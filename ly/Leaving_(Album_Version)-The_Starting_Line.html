		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't leave me without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye

You and I, cold February night
It's been a half an hour 
Taking sweet time saying our goodbyes 
One minute more, go!! 

The best day of my life is all thanks to you 
Precious remembrance saved for rainy days on February 
Few scenes from my life where moments mean more to me 
Than our fine nights, 
I remember like yesterday, the time of my life 

Please don't leave me without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me without saying goodbye 
Without saying goodbye
Lets travel back in time

Two-twelve-ninety nine at the stroke of midnight 
Holding you tight, your body and mine, in February 
Few scenes from my life where moments mean more to me 
Than our fine nights, 
I remember like yesterday, the time of my life 

Please don't leave me without saying goodbye 
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me without saying goodbye 
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me without saying goodbye 
Without saying goodbye
Please don't leave me without saying goodbye 
Without saying goodbye
Lets travel back in time
