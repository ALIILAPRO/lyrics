		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting all night to get closer
And you already know I got it for ya
You know the vibes, know the vibes
Put it on ya
If we're moving too fast, we can slow up
Baby, this far from mediocre
You know the vibes, know the vibes

You and me, here in this room
Imagining things we could do
Won't tell no lies, no lies to you
I need you here, I need you here
Mind running wild, we touching slow
Just say the word, I'm ready to go
Anticipation plays after four
I need you now

Baby, I'ma get you right now, baby yeah 
When I touch you tell me how it feels
Trust me, I'ma make it feel surreal
Baby, mine you're mine
I'ma do all the things
Type of things that happen in your dreams
Girl, you're right where you need to be
Just don't keep me

Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting all night to get closer
And you already know I got it for ya
You know the vibes, know the vibes
Put it on ya
If we're moving too fast, we can slow up
Baby, this far from mediocre
You got the vibes, got the vibes

You're falling too fast, too fast

Baby, I'ma get you right now, baby yeah
When I touch you tell me how it feels
Trust me, I'ma make it feel surreal
Baby, mine you're mine
I'ma do all the things
Type of things that happen in your dreams
Girl, you're right where you need to be
Just don't keep me

Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting all night to get closer
Yeah, you already know I got it for ya
You know the vibes, know the vibes
Put it on ya
If we're moving too fast, we can slow up
Baby, this far from mediocre
You got the vibes, got the vibes
