		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop right now and listen to
What I have always wanted to
Say to you
I remember long ago
When I was young and you were not as old
As now

Life was easy to believe in
And that is why I've swallowed every single word
You've pushed into my mouth
And made me spit them out
As if they were mine

If you're the one who knows it all
Why have you never bothered to know how I feel?
Why don't you ever call me?
Why don't you ever ask me how are you today?

When, when other people ask me
"I say, I'm fine, thank you
But I can't talk right now
I'm waiting for another call"
To hear, "No matter what
I love you so"
