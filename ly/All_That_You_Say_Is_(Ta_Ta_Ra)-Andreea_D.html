		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love memories of a liar
It feels we're like water and fire 
Inside 

You were the air I was breathing
Now it's so cold I am freezin'
Tonight 

Please get out of my head
Get out of my mind
Our love is so gone 

Better to leave me and hate me
Staying is killing me slowly
Tonight 

All That You Say Is
Ta Ta Ra...Ta Ta Ra Ra Ra Ra 
Ta Ta Ra....

You are the one that can save me
But all that you do is to brake me
Slow 

Can't live my life on a maybe
You got me feelin' so empty
So cold 

Please get out of my head
Get out of my mind
Our love is so gone 

Better to leave me and hate me
Staying is killing me slowly
Tonight
