		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every street in this city
Is the same to me
Everyone's got a place to be
But there's no room for me

Am I to blame?
When the guilt and the shame hang over me
Like a dark cloud,
That chases you down in the pouring rain.

It's so hard to find someone
Who cares about you,
But it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

It's not what it seems
When you're not on the scene
There's a chill in the air
But there's people like me
That nobody sees so nobody cares

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who can keep it together
When you've come undone?
Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?

I swear this time it won't turn out
The same 'cause now I've got myself to blame
And you'll know where we end up
On the streets that is easy enough
To find someone who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who can keep it together
When you've come undone?
Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?
