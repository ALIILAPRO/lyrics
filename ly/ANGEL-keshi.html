		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I
Just wanted to believe
That maybe you'd be good to me
I'm just misunderstood, you see

You
Never had a clue
All the days that I spent loving you
Who am I supposed to give 'em to?

I let you in
Again and again
So tell me, baby

What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you

I'm
Bidding you farewell
You'd never stand a chance in hell
They've got another clientele

You're
Treading at the shore
I bet you've never drowned before
And someone that you'd do it for

I let you in
Again and again
So tell me, baby

What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you
