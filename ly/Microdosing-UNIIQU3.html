		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing my love
You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing
My love, love
You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing my love
You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing
My love, love

Yooo
So you wanna get a dose of me ?
You wanna feel the bliss
When you're close to me
Took a tab and tripped
Kissed on my lips
Drown in it
Fall into my abyss
The sticky icky wet wet
Dripping havin rich sex
Laced down , latex
Blowin backs
Breakin necks
Every time we fuck
I be feining for the next flex
I want ya I don't need ya
So don't take it out of context
You want me, I want you
So let's get it
I need you all In
Point blank period
The cups in my hand
Baby you fillin it
Taking my love
cnd microdosing it
Late nights
Cold sweats
Damn we got the sheets wet
Once u cum you know I'm pressin for a reset
I cin't something you could reject
Ohh
But this Pussy finna be kept

You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing my love
You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing
My love, love

You said you need a little bit of L.O.V.E
So take a taste and micro dose me
Boy buckle up let's ride
Put your key up inside, let's slide
When you look into my eyes
You know what deal is
Fuckin uniiqu3
Means you fuckin with the realest
Might buttheads
But it don't gotta be this bevis
Vibes too strong
cin't no keeping it a secret
You don't want my love
Then leave it
I need that energy
Say it like you mean it
Pussy got em feinin
Chargin me with treason
Cuff me baby
I ain't trendy for the season
I wanna trust you
But I got my reasons
I wanna fuck you
Cause I need some pleasin
I wanna do a lot
So let me ease in
Love is all you got
cnd you need it

You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing my love
You want me
Come take a dose of this drug
Stop microdosing my love
Stop microdosing
My love, love
