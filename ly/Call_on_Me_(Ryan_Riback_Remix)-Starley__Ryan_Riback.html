		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're low and your knees can't rise
You feel helpless and you're looking to the sky
Some people would say to accept their fate
Well, if this is fate then we'll find a way to cheat

'Cause, oh, we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, if the answer isn't fair

You know you can call on me when you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down

You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down

When you're weary and the road is dark
And I'll guide you with the beating of my heart
And if the calvary and the help don't come
Well, then we'll find a way to dodge a smoking gun

'Cause, oh, we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, if the answer isn't fair then call on me

You know you can call on me when you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down

So know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down

Call on me, call on me, call on me
(Call on me) when you're, you need someone (just call on me)
You need somebody to cling to (call on me)
When you, you need someone (just call on me)
You need somebody to dry your tears (call on me)
When you, you need someone (you can call me)
You need somebody to cling to (just call on me)

Just call on me, love, on me
(Call on me, just call on me, call on me)
(Just call on me, call on me, just call on me)
(Call on me, just call on me)
