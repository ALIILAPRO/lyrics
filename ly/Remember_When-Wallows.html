		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought I saw your shadow under the door
Just a trick of the light I've seen before
I can never tell what's real anymore
Anymore, anymore

I remember when we ran from the pool
All the decorations up in your room
And I couldn't find the right words to use
But I knew that you knew

It seems so long, it seems so long
The moments that stay, they turn out all wrong
When I look around, you're gone

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

All the places I return to
All the faces that remind you

I can still see you at the place I know
When I close my eyes
Do you remember when we felt like the only two alive?
Don't let me be one of the people that seek
A lost romance
Would you go and do it all over again? 
Given the chance

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
