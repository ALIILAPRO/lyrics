		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think you gotta keep me iced? You don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz? I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss
Think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
Doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (baby)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

A thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Then you can win my heart, don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
