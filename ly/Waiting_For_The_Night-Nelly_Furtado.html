		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I know you're outside
In here it's warm and dry
Got feelings that I've got to try expressing
Like a language that I share with you
Let's talk in the special way we do
Don't wanna be anywhere else but here with you
Feels so good

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself at all
I can't hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself from falling
So I'm waiting for the night

Baby I know it's late
We've got decisions to make
Think of what we could create together
And with you, I am never afraid
To play with the highest stakes
Nobody could break my rapture

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind (blow my mind)
And I can't help, help myself at all
I can't hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind (yeah yeah)
And I can't help, help myself from falling
So I'm waiting for the night

I can't control it in the night, night, night
It's when I've got you on my mind, mind, mind
'Cause you're the twinkle in my eye, eye, eye
I gotta get you in my life, life, life
Can't think of nothing worse than being lonely
I think you're the right choice, my one and only
We're running out of time, so baby hold me
Days go by

Day and night, day and night (day and night)
You blow my mind, blow my mind (you blow my mind)
And I can't help, help myself at all (can't help myself at all)
I can't hold back 
Day and night, day and night (day and night)
You blow my mind, blow my mind (blow my mind)
And I can't help, help myself from falling (I can't help myself)
So I'm waiting for the night

I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
So I'm waiting for the night
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
So I'm waiting for the night

Yeah, I really wanna see you 
I really wanna see you tonight, ah
Yeah, I really wanna see you 
I really wanna see you tonight, ah

Don't keep me waiting waiting, don't keep me waiting for the night
(Don't keep me waiting waiting, waiting for the night)
Don't keep me waiting waiting, don't keep me waiting for the night
(Don't keep me waiting waiting, waiting for the night)
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the night

Oh man, that's rock and roar
