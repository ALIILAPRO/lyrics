		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've gotta feel the vibe

Holding out for you in the crowds
Boy, I need it now
(Woah)
So play me what you know I wanna hear
And I'll show you how
(Woah)

I've waited so long to have you with me
All too soon the morning's gone

(You've gotta feel the vibe)
You've got to let yourself go till the morning comes
'Cause I don't wanna think about it
Got to let go till the morning comes
(You've gotta feel the vibe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Standing in your ivory towel
Don't you know what you give
(Woah)
I was reaching out for you now you're here
You change the way that I live
(Woah)

I've waited so long and now you're with me
All too soon the morning's gone

(You've gotta feel the vibe)
You've got to let yourself go till the morning comes
'Cause I don't wanna think about it
Got to let go til the morning comes
(Woah)
Yeah, yeah

Let yourself go til the morning comes
'Cause I don't wanna think about it
Got to let go til the morning comes
(You've gotta feel the vibe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You're coming my way, we're moving in time
You're lifting me up now I feel your vibe, ooh, ooh, oh yeah
We're starting to sweat, we're moving in time
You're lifting me up now I feel your vibe, way, yeah

You've got to let yourself go till the morning comes
'Cause I don't wanna think about it
Got to let go til the morning comes
(Woah)

You've got to let yourself go til the morning comes
'Cause I don't wanna think about it
Got to let go til the morning comes
(You've gotta feel the vibe)
Hey, yeah, yeah
