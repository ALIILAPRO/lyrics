		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gimme that funk, mmm (mmm)
Funk (funk), mmm (mmm)
Yo, gimme that funk (funk)
Oh yeah, baby, gimme that funk
Sho' nuff, that funk (funk)

Yo, yo
Beware of the dogs, off the chain
Fuck your whips, at the club, we piss in the parking lanes
Blow it up ten frames so you see it wide
If your broad ain't fucking, she don't need to ride (beat it)
She can crawl in the trunk with her knees inside
By the spare, she hungry, I'll feed her fries
'Cause I'm a dog nigga (roof), shot-call nigga
My shotgun talk with a lecture hall scripture
Applaud, bitch, shake that ass
I get you drunk and high and duct tape that ass fast
Then leave you on your daddy front lawn (ding-dong)
With your hair all fucked up, with one pump on
Get stomped on, I take the money and run
I'm a dog, shit I fuck right in front of your son
If you ain't got Missy and Meth
Want me to spit the hot shit for you? Nigga, write your check

When you come home from work, I'm gon' make you do more work
Pour some wine in the cup, sip-sippin' on sizzurp
Oh, now we gon' make love to an end, yeah
Slide, wanna take a ride?
When you with me, oh so right, tell them boys, "not tonight"
Say you chilling wit' your bitch
And this is one you don't wanna miss
Uh, 'cause this love right here is on fire (fire)
Slide, wanna take a ride? (I love)

I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turning me on (turning me on)
You keep me growling like a dog in heat
Hey, woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks (I love, yeah)
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turning me on (turning me on)
You keep me growling like a dog in heat
Hey, woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks (uh, uh)

You on the block, laying low, from the cops laying low
When you done, let me know, 'cause my love make you be like, "whoa"
Uh, 'cause I got your mind in the trenches
Slide, let's take a ride
Baby, come give me some
Hey woadie, ain't no other one
Can shine on my life and make me want to stay the night
Mmm, 'cause you put butterflies in my stomach
Slide, baby, won't you slide? (I love)

I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turning me on (turning me on)
You keep me growling like a dog in heat
Hey, woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks (I love, yeah)
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turning me on (turning me on)
You keep me growling like a dog in heat
Hey, woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks (uh, uh)

Yo, yo, I wanna gangsta boogie with my gangsta bitch
Love it when the pussy talk back thanks to dick
All my dogs (roof), playing the wall, get at these broads
You ain't got no ass at all, we ain't fucking wit' y'all
I'm not your smooth lovin', see me at Casbah thuggin'
Hands where your Stove Top be stuffing
Never catch Tical hand-cuffin', I'm in your party puffin'
Smelling like that Wu-Tang production
Cousin tried to tell me pussy come a dime a dozen (uh)
And when it come around I'll beat it down like percussion
Missy come and get me, I'm bout to call Doc
We can all meet up at Peanut's, I heard it was the spot
Somebody roll the weed up, push the car lighter, kick your feet up
Saturday Night, who got the fever?
Brought the flavor of Indonesia
Puff, puff, give-type procedures
And this joint bumping out your speakers (I love)

I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turning me on (turning me on)
You keep me growling like a dog in heat
Hey, woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks (I love, yeah)
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turning me on (turning me on)
You keep me growling like a dog in heat
Hey, woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks

I'm gonna take you high to the top (hey)
And let your body not reject me, babe
I'm gon' make you really love me
I'm gonna make you scream, "don't stop" (ayy)
But you must first respect this lady (uh)
You must respect this lady (uh)
