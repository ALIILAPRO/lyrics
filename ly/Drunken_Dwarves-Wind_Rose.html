		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One mug filled with mead til the morning
Too much for an elf
Two more mugs full of mead til the morning
Add more from the shelf

There's three mugs filled with mead til the morning
Long since I was born
Four more mugs full of mead til the morning
Worthy of a dwarf

Nobody is welcome
in a tavern full of drunken dwarves
No respect for human,
dragons, trolls, or pointy ears!
If you want to die, stay as long as you're alive
We'll bring chaos to the tavern
til the dawn has come

Nobody is welcome
in a tavern full of drunken dwarves
No respect for human
dragons, trolls, and pointy ears!
If you want to run, do it faster than my axe 

Don't you dare mess with a hall
full of drunken dwarves!

May you hear us sing along, from the forest
To the tavern's hall, until we fall
Alchemy and magic forge the night
into a hearth of stone
In the tavern's hall, until we fall

With five mugs full of mead til the morning
Someone starts to crawl
Six more mugs full of mead til the morning
Everybody falls

Seven mugs full of mead til the morning
Right or even wrong
With eight more mugs of mead til the morning
We will start the brawl!

May you hear us sing along, from the forest
To the tavern's hall, until we fall
Our blood is boiling fast
like mead poured on the table
In the tavern's hall, until we fall
