		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nigga, me and Pluto in this bitch like 7 in the morning, nigga
No sleep nigga
Still been sippin' all night, nigga
Money drip
Wheezy outta here

She give me top in the Tesla
I'ma invest in the extra
I'm getting money, power, hoes, clothes, nigga et cetera
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I take Perkies to fight all my demons
It don't help that my bitch is a demon

Came up in the hallway
Serving J yeah, yeah
Money coming every way
My bitch'll pay, yeah, yeah
80/20, mine off top
I'm fuckin her face, yeah yeah
Man you tripping, I'm spilling the sauce
It dripping over, yeah yeah

Spend a check on that pussy
I got designer all over my hoodie
Yo' nigga ain't real, yo' nigga a pussy
Look, there he go
He get a few shots, bow
Out the draco

Blue cheese stuck to my jeans, yeah yeah
Double I'm geeked off lean, yeah yeah
Baped up, lookin' like king, yeah yeah
Bad bitch pulling up my sleeve, yeah yeah
Northside Gucci my feet, yeah yeah
Haven't been to sleep in a week, yeah yeah
Bite down on my teeth
You smell codeine when I pee, yeah yeah

Sipping on red lean
Gun got a red beam
No niggas from the red team
They go brazy
Pull up in that new ting
I was fucking on new ting
Bad bitch with a tongue ring

Came up in the hallway
Serving J yeah, yeah
Money coming every way
My bitch'll pay yeah, yeah
80/20, mine off top
I'm fuckin her face, yeah yeah
Man you tripping, I'm spilling the sauce
It dripping over, yeah yeah

Pour me a four and another, I love it (sip, sip, sip)
It's me and Hendrix in the club
Wondering if we gonna take your bitch
We already got 5, we was gonna make her 6
I didn't eat today, but I took the Perc'
And I pray to god, it won't make me sick

Pour me some drugs in the cup, no rush like sip, sip, sip
Ain't got enough fingers for all these rings on drip, drip, drip
Turn them lil niggas to fiends, all they wanna do is bust clips
Keep a Mac-11 with a beam
I'm Gucci, don't slip
Gold in your face yeah, yeah, yeah
Flooded out baguettes, yeah, yeah

Came up in the hallway
Serving J yeah, yeah
Money coming every way
My bitch'll pay, yeah, yeah
80/20, mine off top
I'm fuckin her face, yeah yeah

She give me top in the Tesla
I'ma invest in the extra
I'm getting money, power, hoes, clothes, nigga et cetera
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I take Perkies to fight all my demons
It don't help that my bitch is a devil
