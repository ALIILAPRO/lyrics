		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the club I'm high
To get you off my mind

I try to get my mind off you
But it is harder than you think
You're on repeat the whole day through
So in the night I go to drink

In the club I'm high
To get you off my mind
But no matter who I see
There is one thing that is true
I tried a million times
But no matter who I see, oh
None of them is like you

In the club I'm high
To get you off my mind
None of them is like

In the club I'm high
But no matter who I see, yeah
None of them is like you

None of them is like

In the club I'm high
To get you off my mind
I'm in the club high
To get you off my mind

I know I'm better off alone
So tell me why it feels so wrong
When I try to kiss another guy
Yeah, that shit makes me wanna cry

In the club I'm high
To get you off my mind
None of them is like
In the club I'm high

But no matter who I see, yeah
None of them is like you

None of them is like

In the club I'm high
To get you off my mind
I'm in the club high
To get you off my mind
