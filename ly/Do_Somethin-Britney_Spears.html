		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you feel this
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so

Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like

Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like

What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why don't you just move along?

I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Now you're all in my grill
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rocks on what's real
Baby bump bump
But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
I can roll if you can
Don't be a punk punk

What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why don't you just move along?

I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Na na na na na na na
Uh
Na na na na na na na na na

I see you lookin' over here
Can't you tell I'm havin' fun
If you care like I know
You would stop
Starrin' at us
And get your own space
And do somethin'

I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Fuck
Do somethin'
Ow
Why don't you do somethin'?
