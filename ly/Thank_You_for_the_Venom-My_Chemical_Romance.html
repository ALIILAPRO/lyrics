		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal 
And you never had a chance 
Love it, or leave it, you can't understand 
A pretty face, but you do so carry on
And on
And on 

I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me 
I'm just the way that the doctor made me, on
And on
And on
And on 
Love is the red of the rose on your coffin door 
What's life like, bleeding on the floor 
The floor
The floor 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
Give me a reason to believe 

So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will 

Preach all you want but who's gonna save me? 
I keep a gun on the book you gave me, hallelujah, lock and load 
Black is the kiss, the touch of the serpent sun 
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one,
And one, 
And one, 
And one 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
Give me a reason to believe 

So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
You want to follow something 
Give me a better cause to lead 
Just give me what I need 
Give me a reason to believe 

So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will 

So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will
