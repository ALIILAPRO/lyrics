		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think my friend said, "I hear footsteps."
I wore my black and white dress to the
Birthday massacre, birthday massacre, birthday
I wore my black and white dress

I think my friend said, "Stick it in the back of her head."
I think my friend said, "Two of them are sisters."
"I'm a murder tramp, birthday boy", I think I said
"I'm gonna bash them in, bash them in", I think he said

Then we wished them all a happy birthday
We kissed them all goodnight. Now he chases me to my room,
Chases me to my room, chases me
In my black and red dress

I think my friend said, "Don't forget the video."
I think my friend said, "Don't forget to smile."
"You're a murder tramp, murder tramp", I think he said
"You're a murder boy, birthday boy", I think I said
