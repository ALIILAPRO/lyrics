		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I've heard her say goodbye before
But not like she just said it
And yeah, I've seen her slam the door
But not like she just did it
She's got her mind made up
And she made it clear
And that's how it looks from here

'Cause now I'm standing on the front porch
Watching those taillights fade into red dirt dust
And now I'm standing in the mess that I made
She's got all of her things in the back packed up
She's good as gone and she's moving on
Didn't look one time in the review mirror
At least that's how it looks from here

Well, I called her up, iy didn't ring
And she didn't wanna hear it
With every mile she's burning down
The chance to turn around's disappeared
Her skies are blue she's outta tears
At least that's how it looks from here

'Cause now I'm standing on the front porch
Watching those taillights fade into red dirt dust
And now I'm standing in the mess that I made
She's got all of her things in the back packed up
She's good as gone and she's moving on
Didn't look one time in the review mirror
At least that's how it looks from here

The bed looks cold, the house looks empty
It looks like she won't even miss me

Now I'm standing on the front porch
Watching those taillights fade into red dirt dust
And now I'm standing in the mess that I made
She's got all of her things in the back packed up
She's good as gone and she's moving on
Didn't look one time in the review mirror
At least that's how it looks from here
Yeah, that's how it looks from here
