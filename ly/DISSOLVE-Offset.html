		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When a whole pill dissolve
Girl, tell me who you gon' call (who you callin'?)
I'm ready to give my all to you (my all to you)
Yeah, let's do it
All to your face, it's yours (it's yours)
You ain't gotta share at all (at all)
Girl, I belong to you (to you, to you)

You had my back when them niggas had turned on me (turn)
Somethin' I never forget
I like my bitch a go getter, go earn somethin' (earn somethin')
Stay by me when I wasn't lit (lit)
I had to clean up her business to show the bitch she could be rich (business)
I had to cut off the bitches, get money and stay on my shit
Niggas gettin' money, you could tell
Still tryna get you out your shell
Written on your face, you can't tell
Crazy how you hide it so well
Tell me secrets, I'll never tell
Let's have a bite and move around the world
Still a little sweet ol' girl
Trips, trips
Travel through your mind, trips
Trips, trips
Travel through your mind, trips (let's go)

When a whole pill dissolve
Girl, tell me who you gon' call (who you callin'?)
I'm ready to give my all to you (my all to you)
Yeah, let's do it
All to your face, it's yours (it's yours)
You ain't gotta share at all (at all)
Girl, I belong to you (to you, to you)

Spendin' them racks, I do it (spendin' them racks)
I let it blow, fo' sho' (blow)
I give her a fifty, go handle your business
I got a few shows on the road (got a fewshows)
I seen her little message, I couldn't reply
I know it's been burnin' her soul (I couldn't)
She holdin' me tight, throughout the night
She told me the world is cold (it's cold)
She know I'm a player, I bought her Chanel
I'm showin' her how this shit goes (I'm showin' her how this shit goes)
Yeah, I'm showin' her how this shit goes (let's go)
We choppin' it up, I bought her some roses
We cool in the back of the Rolls (cool)
I went to the jeweler, then bought her the Cuban
And told her she deserve to glow
Ooh, she's swept off her toes (ooh)
Got blues, where you wanna go? (Blues)
I refuse to let my bitch go (refuse, let's roll)
Niggas be frauds, them niggas ain't fuckin' with me
Bitch, knock it off
I got you outta that loft and showed you a new luxury
Thanks to the boss (boss)

When a whole pill dissolve
Girl, tell me who you gon' call (who you callin'?)
I'm ready to give my all to you (my all to you)
Yeah, let's do it
All to your face, it's yours (it's yours)
You ain't gotta share at all (at all)
Girl, I belong to you (to you, to you)
