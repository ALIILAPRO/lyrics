		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't help the way I feel about You
I can't help the way I feel about You
I don't wanna listen to a love Song
You a wife wife not a buss down
Remember when you found me In the lost and found
Excuse my French but
How the fuck you turn my life Around
You are my addiction
My cold heart never thought Love existed
You came through
We connected on some real shit
Talkin bout you got me in my Feelings
I don't wanna listen to a love Song
You a wife wife not a buss down
Remember when you found me In the lost and found
Excuse my French but how the Fuck you turn my life around

Yeahhh me and my baby
You the only one I fuck with as Of lately
That ain't no little girl that's a Grown lady
Whenever she call me I answer
Because she relate to me
She know that I got it but she Wanna offer to pay for me
I told her about everything
I'm talking about A to Z
She must be Destiney's Child the Way that she cater to me
I haven't felt like this in awhile You feel my vacancy

I don't wanna listen to a love Song
You a wife wife not a bust down
Remember when you found me
In the lost and found
Excuse my French but
How the fuck you turn my life Around

You know I can't sleep I'm an Insomniac
I need you kissin on my face
And rubbin on my back
I need to talk to you
Cause I've been goin through Some shit
And you the only one who i
Really connect with
Yeah, FaceTime that pussy
I don't want no text message
Early in the mornin I'ma eat you For breakfast
Told me that you loved me
Then you showed me you meant It
Fell in love with your drive
Fell in love with your Momentum
Yeah, I'm addicted to your Wisdom
And your friendship
I think it's sexy cause you
Don't be tryin to fit in
With them lame bitches who Ain't doin shit

I don't wanna listen to a love Song
You a wife wife not a bust down
Remember when you found me In the lost and found
Excuse my French but
How the fuck you turn my life Around
You are my addiction
My cold heart never thought Love existed
You came through
We connected on some real shit
Talkin bout you got me in my Feelings
Got me in my feelings
Got me in my... uh, uh
Got me in my feelings
