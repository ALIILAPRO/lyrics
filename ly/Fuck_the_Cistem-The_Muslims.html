		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why are men such fucking trash
You hinge on dominance to last
You chase the money to catch the ass
I’ll pay for dinner, nigga
I’ll hold the door, you cracka
So fuck the system
Fuck these cisdudes
They are useless
It is proof that men are trash.
So fuck the system
Fuck these cisdudes
They are useless
It is proof that men are trash
We’ll reproduce without your ass — and that’s scary!!
Why don’t you admit that you hate women
Reject your compliments — and you get violent
You say that you’re the good guy — we don’t buy it
I don’t trust you in close space
I don’t trust you in no space
So fuck the system
Fuck these cisdudes
They are useless
It is proof that men are trash
So fuck the system
Fuck these cisdudes
They are useless
It is proof that men are trash
We’ll reproduce without your ass — and that’s scary!!
So fuck the system
Fuck these cisdudes
They are useless
It is proof that men are trash
So fuck the system
Fuck these cisdudes
They are useless
It is proof that men are trash
We’ll reproduce without your ass
I say me too - and it’s fuckin sad
I’ve gotta prove that shit to you
Though I’m sure you had a clue
There are predators in your crew — and that’s scary!
