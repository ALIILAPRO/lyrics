		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pass the Glock, look at the clock
Thinkin' of a murder plot
Skeemask got the nine millimeter headed for a nigga's stash spot
Loadin' the clip, watch me drip, now the nine is on my hip
Bitch-ass nigga talkin' that shit, still got his wig split

One, two, three, go

Pass the Glock, look at the clock
Thinkin' of a murder plot
Skeemask got the nine millimeter headed for a nigga's stash spot
Loadin' the clip, watch me drip, now the nine is on my hip
Bitch-ass nigga talkin' that shit, still got his wig split

Pass the Glock, look at the clock
Thinkin' of a murder plot
Pass the Glock, look at the clock
Thinkin' of a murder plot

Everybody- go

Pass the Glock, look at the clock
Thinkin' of a murder plot
Skeemask got the nine millimeter headed for a nigga's stash spot
Loadin' the clip, watch me drip, now the nine is on my hip
Bitch ass nigga talkin' that shit, still got his wig split

Pass the Glock, look at the clock
Thinkin' of a murder plot
Pass the Glock, look at the clock
Thinkin' of a murder-

Thinkin' of a murder plot
