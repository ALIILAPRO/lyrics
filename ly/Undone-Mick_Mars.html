		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thoughts pounding in my head
The harsh regrets of all that I have broken
Our frail hearts lay torn apart
Shattered by the words we left unspoken
The pain is flowing through my veins
Like a knife right through my soul

I fall to the darkness
Scarred by the choice I made
Dammed by a distant fire
That never fades away
I beg for forgiveness
Pray to the rising sun
Grasping for one last breath
As I slowly start to come Undone

The emptiness creeps up inside
Drowning out the love that we once tasted
Despite the hurt I tell myself
The everything we shared was never wasted
The pain is proof of my surrender
Like a knife right through my soul


Ravaged from the winter cold

Frozen in the night
Breathing in the sorrow of goodbye
