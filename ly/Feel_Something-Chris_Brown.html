		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to feel something (feel something)
I need to feel something
I need to feel something (feel something), yeah
I need to feel something, woah-ooh, woah

'Cause damn, it's so good
And damn, you're so bad (bad)
I hit it so good (oh)
I'll make it talk back
You tell me it's mine (oh)
You know I like that
I'm reading your signs
Until you climax

I need to feel something (feel something, oh)
I need to feel something (oh)
I need to feel something, yeah (yeah)
I need to feel something (feel something, oh), woah-woah

I just think it's funny that you on the same page
You usually call me, act like you don't know me
Somethin' changed
I just think it's funny that you don't feel pain
You're so numb to pain
Love has changed, but
Something's strange (I remember)
I remember all them times, baby (oh)
Baby, undress, I'm talkin' rough sex
I'm gon' stretch you
You call me names they wouldn't know me as
I pull your hair back (hair back)
You start to act bad, oh

'Cause damn, it's so good (so good)
And damn, you're so bad (so bad)
I hit it so good (so good)
I'll make it talk back
You tell me it's mine (mine, oh, mine)
You know I like that
I'm reading your signs
Until you climax

I need to feel something (feel something)
I need to feel something (I need to feel)
I need to feel something (feel something), yeah
I need to feel something, woah-woah

Oh-oh-oh
You're in charge, girl, I need that (oh-oh)
I need to, I need to feel something (oh-oh)
Oh-oh
I just wanna feel something
I just wanna, I just wanna feel some'
Feel some, feel something

I need to feel something (something)
I need to feel something (something)
I need to feel something, yeah (something, yeah)
I need to feel something (something)
