		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I got no excuses

Ay, yeah, they asked me where I learned to do this
Self-taught, checkin' things off my to-do list
Treat my temper like my family, I ain't tryna lose it
Say a little, do a lot, woo, no excuses
Ay, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no excuses
Woo, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no

Yeah, yo, this industry is so confusin'
Hard to tell who's really with me or who's tryna use me
If I told you I respect you, I ain't say it loosely
I don't throw those words around, it's just not how I do this, ay
Yeah, I know I can be a nuisance
Ain't afraid to admit it if I think the shoe fits
People ask me where I been, I been writin' new hits
Had to make my own plans, I don't need your two-cents, ay
Yeah, I don't wanna hear excuses
I just like to make moves and make improvements
I just like to break rules, maybe start some new trends
Live the life that I choose, cuttin' off the loose ends, ah

Yeah, they asked me where I learned to do this
Self-taught, checkin' things off my to-do list
Treat my temper like my family, I ain't tryna lose it
Say a little, do a lot, woo, no excuses
Ay, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no excuses
Woo, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no

Yeah, here's a couple things that I'm confused with
I just did a interview, the guy was pretty clueless
You don't have to know the album names or all my music
But at least try to find out who you in the room with
Ay, I like facts, I don't like assumin'
Take a shot behind my back, I'ma catch the bullets
Why the game lookin' at me like I'm just a tourist?
They should know I'm here to stay, this verse is gettin' borin', twisted
Mind of a lyricist, listen while I experiment
Visualize it's imperative, big suprises and scary tricks
It is time, yes, we're here again, sit in silence, don't care for it
Criticizin' my character isn't wise, so beware of it
Forget what you're tellin' me, do what I gotta' man
I got the remedy, one of kind, man they never selected me
I don't fit in with the room of celebrities
I wanna know when they bring out my legacy
There was never nobody that ever could mention me
Sayin' that I wasn't makin' the rap
And doin' it cleverly, did what I had to
And gave them my everything

Yeah, yeah, they asked me where I learned to do this
Self-taught, checkin' things off my to-do list
Treat my temper like my family, I ain't tryna lose it
Say a little, do a lot, woo, no excuses

Yeah, yo, they asked me where I learned to do this
Self-taught, checkin' things off my to-do list
Treat my temper like my family, I ain't tryna lose it
Say a little, do a lot, woo, no excuses
Ay, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no excuses
Woo, yeah, I got no excuses, yeah, yo, I got no

Yeah, I got no
I got no excuses
I got no excuses
