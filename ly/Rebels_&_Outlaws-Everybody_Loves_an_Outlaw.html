		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rebels & Outlaws
Wild ones you can't have
Why do the good girls
Go for the bad?

Why you gotta come around looking like that
How'm I gonna fight it when I can't hold back
Bad reputation
Everytime
Why you gotta go and get me all worked up
Don't you know you give me that addiction I love
Know I know better
But why even try

Rebels & Outlaws
Wild ones you can't have
Why do the good girls
Go for the bad?
Downright seduction
Just can't get enough
Rebels & Outlaws
Dangerous to love
But we do it anyway
Oh, we do it anyway

You know every girl wanna get a James Dean
Motorcycle leather jacket lookin at me
Why do we do it
Everytime
Maybe it's the way they get whatever they want
Maybe it's the way they make it so damn hot
Feel like an angel
With the devil inside

Rebels & Outlaws
Wild ones you can't have
Why do the good girls
Go for the bad?
Downright seduction
Just can't get enough
Rebels & Outlaws
Dangerous to love
But we do it anyway
Oh, we do it anyway

You can tell me that tell me that they'll be breakin my heart
But it's too good it's too good you know I never can stop
And I know I should know better but I want what he's got tonight
You can tell me that tell me that I will take it too far
But it's too good it's too good here in the back of my car
And I know I should know better but we'll never get caught tonight

Rebels & Outlaws
Wild ones you can't have
Why do the good girls
Go for the bad?
Downright seduction
Just can't get enough
Rebels & Outlaws
Dangerous to love
But we do it anyway
Oh, we do it anyway
Oh, we do it anyway
Oh, we do it anyway
We do it anyway
