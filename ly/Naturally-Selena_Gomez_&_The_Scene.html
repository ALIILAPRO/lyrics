		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mmm yeah, it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
What you do so naturally

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay bay baby

You have a way of moving me
Your force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally (you know it does)
It comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
What you do, so naturally

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay bay baby

When we collide, sparks fly
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away

(You are) You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay baby

Naturally, naturally, naturally
Everything baby comes naturally
Naturally, naturally, naturally
Bay bay baby
