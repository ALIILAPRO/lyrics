		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red sky bleedin' from my eye
Tides risin' up to new highs
I turn my back to the wind
Slowly driftin' away
I hear the night sing (welcome to your new)
Welcome to your new

It's fourth and inches, I'm sendin' a blitz
Live on the toilet, I stay on my shit
You say we opps, but you stay on my dick
My shooter a rapper, I sent him a hit
They be on Twitter like, "When he gon' miss?"
Say I fell off, but I fell in his bitch
Fuck your white flag, I ain't tellin' 'em shit
I play it cool and hand brodie the blick
Blick out yo' stu' just to show you I'm rich
Now you can't drop no more music 'cause shit
How you jump right on that song and then snitch?
Nigga, you sassy and wrong as a bitch
Say the wrong thing and get put on that list
This is a warning 'cause Savage don't diss
Better thank me that your ass still exist
'Cause Jesus can't save you from what's in this stick
She don't look good without makeup, I'm stiff
Don't fuck with rappers 'cause most of 'em snitch
Diamonds gon' cover my neck and my fist
Watch on my leg 'cause I ran out of wrists
Draco brown like a Hershey
Hang out the window and blow 'em a kiss
Hang out the window and wave at his bitch
Gun smoke, I take it far when I'm pissed

Under cover of the darkness (red sky bleedin')
Sunlight moves, awakening (red sky bleedin')
One that stares while one's asleep (red sky bleedin')
Before that's done, it's waking

Don't give a fuck, I'ma rock with my twin
Niggas freeze up when it's time to go spin
Speak on the dead, then we boxin' you in
Send you to heaven, they kill you again
We killed his buddy, he buckin' again
If they revive 'em, we bust him again
Pistol so big, ain't no tuckin' it in
I got in trouble for tellin' on friends
Rip out your tongue if you talkin' too much
You gon' get chopped out talkin' to us
Bullet-proof truck 'cause I know they could touch me
Bury the K and it still shoot rusty
Fuck my opps, niggas broke and they musty
All my exes still wanna fuck me
Eliantte on me, this is not lucky
Fry me a nigga like I'm from Kentucky
Remember when pops used to front me
When I see rappers, I do not see rappers, my nigga, I really see lunch meat
Three-hundred black on the seat and the Glock on my hip
Ain't no way you could punch me
You ain't really gang, you a flunkie
Send your ass to the store like you auntie, pussy

Under cover of the darkness (red sky bleedin')
Sunlight moves, awakening (red sky bleedin')
One that stares while one's asleep (red sky bleedin')
Before that's done, it's waking

This is really happening
Is this is really happening?
