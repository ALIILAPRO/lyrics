		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go

Expect the worst of everyone I meet
Count the clock 'cause I can't fuckin' sleep
Shootin' pain like a heart attack
Call my friends, I might not make it back

The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
Something's gotta give

I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head

It's got me scared, scared of the unknown
Unknown numbers been blowin' up my phone
I'm hearin' footsteps outside of my house
I'm afraid someone's tryna take me out

The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
Can I fuckin' live?

I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head

I'm still in your head
I'm still in your head
I am your breaking point

You can't run, you can't hide
I'll be there when you close your eyes at night
I'm always watching you

The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
My time is wearin' thin

I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb (time bomb) tickin' in your head (in your head)
Paranoia cloudin' your judgement (your judgement)
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head

Oh
