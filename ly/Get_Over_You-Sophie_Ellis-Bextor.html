		  Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah

Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah

You think you've got your way
But baby there's a catch
Don't need your foul play
Now you have met your match

You think you're in control
But that won't last that long
You thought you wore the crown
Honey, you were wrong

You had me taken in
But now I've found you out
And I won't go through that again

You've always had to win
You'll have to go without
You don't know where to stop

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Think you're Mr. Know-it-all

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Goodbye Mr. Know-it-all

Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah

I let you have your say
You never compromised
Complaining everyday
About everything in sight

I've let you stay a while
Now I am getting bored
No substance in your style
And you're not the man
You thought that you were

You had me taken in
But now I've found you out
And I won't go through that again

You've always had to win
You'll have to go without
You don't know where to stop

Oh, get over you

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Think you're Mr. Know-it-all

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Goodbye Mr. Know-it-all

(I'll get over you)
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah

You think you've got your way
But baby there's a catch
Don't need your foul play
Now you have met your match

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Think you're Mr. Know-it-all

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Goodbye Mr. Know-it-all

(I'll get over you)
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
(I'll get over you)
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah

(I'll get over you)
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
(I'll get over you)
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
