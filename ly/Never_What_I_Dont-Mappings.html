		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want my past to stop following me around
Like a shadow that the noon-sun won't chase away
"I'd like to walk all over you"
Instead, I drag it all around
Everywhere I go you follow me
I can never get away
Everywhere I go you follow me
I can never get away
If I stop just for a second and look behind me
You'll always be there, haunting all my steps
I just can't get rid of you
I'll wash my hands of you in the shore because
I don't want you around anymore
I wanna do what I want, do what I love
Never what I don't
I don't want you around anymore
I wanna do what I want, do what I love
Never what I don't
I don't want you around anymore
I wanna do what I want, do what I love
Never what I don't
I don't want you around anymore
Everywhere I go you follow me
I can never get away
Everywhere I go you follow me
I can never get away
I don't want you around anymore
I don't want you around anymore
I don't want you around anymore
I don't want you around anymore
I don't want you around anymore
I don't want you around anymore
I don't want you around anymore
I don't want you around anymore
