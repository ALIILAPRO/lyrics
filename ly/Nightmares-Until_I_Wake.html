		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never loved you and I never cared
I'm gone forever, I won't be there

I'm at my peak and I'm losing my sanity
Nightmares start to become my reality
That's where I see you that's when you say

I never loved you and I never cared
I'm gone forever, I won't be there
Now all that's left is just a memory
You turn your back on me
You won't miss me when I'm gone

I keep you locked inside my head
You are the monster at my bed
I don't know how much more my mind can take
My thoughts have turned against me
If I'm awake then why can't I speak?
Your face invades my sleep
In twisted memories
I panic, anxiety, it's got a hold of me
A gun's the remedy, so pull the trigger now

I never loved you and I never cared
I'm gone forever, I won't be there
Now all that's left is just a memory
You turn your back on me
You won't miss me when I'm gone

That's where I see you that's when I say

You never loved me and you never cared
You're gone forever, you won't be there
Now all that's left is just a memory
You turn your back on me
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
