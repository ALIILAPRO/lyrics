		  (Let me feel you)

It's been about a month and twenty days
And were going 'round and 'round playing silly games
Now your saying, slow it down, not right now
Then you wink at me and walk away

Now, let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you

(Ride it) we are all alone
(Ride it) just loose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) baby let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you

MoVida was the club on Saturday
Your acting like a diva saying you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be your feisty style
Raised that brow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now when you order a Mohita at the bar
Reapplying lippy 'cause it came off from the glass
The DJ plays your favorite song
Kanyes on
Now your backing in from me to dance
Mm, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me close
You close your eyes girl
Whispering, telling me we gotta go
Won't you take me home I wanna

(Ride it) we are all alone
(Ride it) just loose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) baby let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you

Everything was right until her phone began to ring
She takes it to the corner, that's when I start wondering
I can hear her shouting, banging her fist against the door
Yelling "Yo, it's over, I can't take it anymore"
Then I walk away, and acting I want to go chill
I ain't trying to get caught up in a mess for real
But she came around and backed me up against the wall
She said I know you heard, but I'll make you forget it all

Baby let me feel you

(Ride it) we are all alone
(Ride it) just loose control
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) baby let me feel you
(Ride it) turn the lights down low
(Ride it) from head to toe
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul
(Ride it, ride it) let me feel you
