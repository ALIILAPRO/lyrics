		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Action bronson in the building we gunna
Get right into it man we need towooo
You know everybody that comes up
Here gotta gotta rock it imma rap

Yo queens shit outdoors men shit
She bent over in a mirror taking pictures
Crew a bunch of dykes and
Some Puerto Rican strippers
From Ridgewood she did her thing
Just like a bitch should
But in the morning started burning
I can't piss good i cleared that up though
Diver’s scallops, sear ‘em
Seven grams of fuzzy in the
Palm’ll be the serum the Rocketeer
Out in Switzerland we poppin’ there
Mulatto babiеs cause you know
That im a chocolatier
Haze galorе, Asian on the carpet
From the land not from the market
Blunts rolled consecutively
Who every really thought this motha
Fucka destined to be?
This type of style on the mic
Get razzled, dazzled stretch you like pilate
Penetrate your flower then I dip karate
The shotty Hollywood
I gave the bitch a nosejob
And fuck a new Benz I'd
Rather cop the old Saab
Velour down short set paired
With the cream joints
Wine, I always swirl it and smell it
Make an esteemed choice
My cheese sauce always known to
Keep a fiend moist
I swear my words’ll have me
Hopping out the green Royce
Rolls and blunted, crispy chicken
Aged cheddar bonnie got a block of cheese
No it ain't feta yo
The semi-soft flow master with the hemi talk
I swear my words have me

Yo queens shit yo yo
