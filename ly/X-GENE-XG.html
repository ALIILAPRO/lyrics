		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, XG
Born with the X-gene
Beta testing
New chapter
Go hard effortlessly
Alpha to omega level
Set it off
There ain't no limit or gimmicks
We go beyond and keep it a hundred

Love it or hate it
Whether you alienate it planet invaded
All day n everyday we slayin' it
Gladiator mind they not entertained yet

Mutated DNA wooh
Fresh out the Xtraordinary womb
Intergalactical tactical flow
Goin' ballistic n outta this world

Cosmic stunt
Fear who? None
Pack of seven equal one

They wanna know if it's a hit or a miss
Shoot for the stars and we land on they heads
Don't mess with the technique you know its flawless
We locked and loaded on all our targets

XG
Yeah, we born with the X-gene
New chapter next scene
Go hard effortlessly
Come test me

XG
Yeah, we born with the X-gene
New chapter next scene
Go hard effortlessly
Don't test me

Reach for the stars when you follow the light
Take me to the other side
Levitate up to the sky
(Synchronizing)

Howling the start
From where we are
Endlessly shining the dark
Shining the dark
