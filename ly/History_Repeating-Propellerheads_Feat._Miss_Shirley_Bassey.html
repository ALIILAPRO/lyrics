		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The word is about, there's something evolving,
Whatever may come, the world keeps revolving...
They say the next big thing is here,
That the revolution's near,

But to me it seems quite clear
That's it's all just a little bit of history repeating.
The newspapers shout a new style is growing,
But it don't know if it's coming or going,

There is fashion, there is fad
Some is good, some is bad
And the joke rather sad,
That it's all just a little bit of History repeating.

And I've seen it before
And I'll see it again
Yes I've seen it before
Just little bits of history repeating

Some people don't dance, if they don't know who's singing,
Why ask your head, it's your hips that are swinging
Life's for us to enjoy
Woman, man, girl and boy,
Feel the pain, feel the joy
Aside set the little bits of history repeating

Just little bits of history repeating
And I've seen it before
And I'l see it again
Yes I've seen it before
Just little bits of history repeating
