		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, it makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I'm right? (Ooh, why?)
You never accept defeat and let it slide (why? Why?)
I have no voice if I don't speak my mind (why?) 
My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
'Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to (uh)
