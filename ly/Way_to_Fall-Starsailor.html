		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Son 
You've got a way to fall 
They'll tell you where to go 
But they won't know 
Son 
You'd better take it all 
They'll tell you what they know
But they won't show 
Oh 
I've got something in my throat 
I need to be alone 
While I suffer 
Son 
You've got a way to kill 
They're picking on you still 
But they don't know 
Son 
You'd better wait to shine 
They'll tell you what is yours 
But they'll take mine 
Oh 
I've got something in my throat 
I need to be alone 
While I suffer 
Oh 
There's a hole inside my boat 
And I need stay afloat 
For the summer 
Long 
Oh 
I've got something in my throat 
I need to be alone 
While I suffer 
Oh 
There's a hole inside my boat 
And I need stay afloat 
For the summer 
Son 
You've got to wait to fall 
They'll tell you where to go 
But they won't know
