		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, it's 50
One shot, one kill, what's the deal?
Yeah, what's the deal?

Listen, lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, 'cause when it rains it pours
End up wet up, 'cause when it rains it pours
It usually goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours

Ain't nothin' changed, niggas doin' the same ol' shit
Them new hollow tips in them same ol' clips
In the projects, niggas fuck with the same ol' chicks
And somehow, they still think they game so sick
Now from the rip, niggas know I'm 'bout my grip
I don't trick, man, I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I say, "I don't need you bitch"
Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'mma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga?
She just mad, 'cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow somethin', I say hell naw
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
So keep yo' mind on yo' money and don't trust no bitch
Keke hit high notes when them pigs came
But her ass kinda fat, so niggas treat her the same
This is real

Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, 'cause when it rains it pours
End up wet up, 'cause when it rains it pours
It usually goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours

There was blood stains on my stoop when Akbar got shot
When homicide outside, nigga I'm not
This the third time them niggas done circled the block
It's money out now, yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga on a direct sale
They say, "tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail"
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta Dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And say what's up to the Sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
The number spot full of niggas tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
Two Ace to the Deuce, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull ups in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck

Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, 'cause when it rains it pours
End up wet up, 'cause when it rains it pours
It usually goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours
