		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's making you cry every time
You give your love to me this way
Saying you'd wait for me to stay
I know it hurts you

But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

Maybe I'd change for you someday
But I can't help the way I feel
Wish I was good, wish that I could
Give you my love now

But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry
