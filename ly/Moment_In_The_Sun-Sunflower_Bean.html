		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wished for things I thought I loved
I reached for stars, they set me up
They do, they do
Oh, they do
It's raining gold, the sky is black
Our summer's gone, I'll live with that
I do, I do
Oh, I do

Everything I've dreamed about is coming on
Trade it for a moment in the sun
All that other noise is just a waste of time
You're the only music on my mind
I don't need money, I don't need to be cool
I'd trade it for a moment in the sun with you

Winter, spring, summer, fall
A moment's fine but I wanna feel them all
I wanna feel them all

Everything I've dreamed about is coming on
Trade it for a moment in the sun
All that other noise is just a waste of time
You're the only music on my mind
I don't need money, I don't need to be cool
I'd trade it for a moment in the sun with you
With you
With you
With you

Everything I've dreamed about is coming on
Trade it for a moment in the sun
All that other noise is just a waste of time
You're the only music on my mind
I don't need money, I don't need to be cool
I'd trade it for a moment in the sun with you
I don't need money, I don't need to be cool
I'd trade it for a moment in the sun with you
