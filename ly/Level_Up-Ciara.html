		  Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

Them old mistakes are gone, I won't do them no more
That's old news, there's new news, I done did that before
I turned nothing to something, my comeback on one hunnid'
Less talking, more action, you just gon' CiCi coming
I just keep elevating, no losses, just upgrading
My lessons, made blessings, I turned that into money
Thank God I never settled, this view is so much better
I'm chilling, I'm winning, like on another level

Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I see greater
Nothing I'm afraid of
And I can have it all

Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

Fake friends get dropped like weight
Team love, don't want no hate
I'm grindin', I'm shinin'
Up, up, up on my way
Thank God I never settled
This view is so much better
I'm chilling, I'm winning
Like on another level

Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I see greater
Nothing I'm afraid of
And I can have it all

Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

All this oh so level, on another level
Elevate your level, le-le-le-level
Graduate your level, there's no one on it
Nah, nah, nah (ay)
All this oh so level, on another level
Elevate your level, le-le-le-level
Graduate your level, there's no one on it
Nah, nah, nah (ay)

Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me, so yummy, all this oh so yummy
You know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy (uh!)
