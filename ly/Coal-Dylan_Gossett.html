		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I remember what you told me
Said drinkin' was unholy
So Lord, can you point me to the creek
And I still keep it with me
Tucked under all the memories
Your voice echoin' throughout those trees

And through unfavored weather
And holes in the leather
These boots still covered in tar
Well, I'm prayin' to the Heavens
And hopin' for them sevens
But hope only gets a man so far

When this game of life plays heavy on my heart
And love is tough, but loneliness is twice as hard
And I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go
And they say pressure makes diamonds
How the hell am I still coal?

Now I've seen Heaven without dyin'
Met the Devil without tryin'
And they both seem to want to talk to me
But I'm all out of luck now
And my dreams aren't worth a buck
How it's tough tryin' to land on my feet

When this game of life plays heavy on my heart
And love is tough, but loneliness is twice as hard
And I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go
They say pressure makes diamonds
How the hell am I still coal?

And every day is gettin' colder, since that day in October
When you told me it was over, so I left
'Cause if you need me, well, I told ya
I'm on the better side of sober
Tryin' to find a four-leaf clover
To get me out of this mess

This game of life plays heavy on my heart
And love is tough, but loneliness is twice as hard
And I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go
And they say pressure makes diamonds
How the hell
This game of life plays heavy on my heart
And love is tough, but loneliness is twice as hard
And I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go
And they say pressure makes diamonds
How the hell am I still coal?
