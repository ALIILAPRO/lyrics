		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling something that I can't explain
Think it's a wound I still entertain
I'd do anything to numb the flame
I guess I'm just on fire these days
I can't see straight, I can't see me
There's too much hurt caught in between
Wish I could be what I know I am
This moment's hijacked my plans

I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling, I'm feeling with you
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too

Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling, I'm feeling with you
I'm not having fun tonight

You love the paparazzi, love the fame
Even though you know it causes me pain
I feel like I'm in a prison hell
Stick my hands through the steels bars and yell

What happens now
I'm not okay
And if I scream, you walk away
When I'm sad, you just wanna play
I've had enough
Why do I stay?

I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling, I'm feeling with you
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too

Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling, I'm feeling with you
I'm not having fun tonight

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I'm not having fun tonight
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I'm not having fun tonight

Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe, its time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling, I'm feeling with you
I'm not having fun tonight
