		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night
I got too high, it was the
Last time
That I said goodbye to my love
And she's like
Don't you give up on my heart
Girl I try, I try
I was just high so I called you again
You and your girls having fun out in France
Bottle of henny to kill off my past
I knew all along that this shit wouldn't last
I remember when we fucked in a Benz
I remember when we fucked in a Benz
The one that I bought you
Don't know if I told you that

You give euphoria
You give euphoria to me
You give euphoria
You give euphoria to me
I ain't ignoring ya
Girl I was struggling to breathe
You give euphoria
You give euphoria to me
Euphoria (No no no)
Oh no, euphoria
Flight next week for my baby
Bad lil bitch tryna save me
Pull up to the spot all wavy
You can't be my wife, no lady
Everywhere I go they try save me
I'm too far gone it's crazy
Girl you can't let me go, can't save me

Girl how could you get up and just leave me?
Tonight is the night that you see me
You know that this shit don't come easy
And she won't let me go cause she needs me
What's the reason for this cause you still

You give euphoria
You give euphoria to me
You give euphoria
You give euphoria to me
I ain't ignoring ya
Girl I was struggling to breathe
You give euphoria
You give euphoria to me
Euphoria (No no no)
Oh no, euphoria
