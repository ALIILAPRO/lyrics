		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm run, yeah, oh yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind

It's funny how I got just exactly what I want
I'll try to have fun some other time
I thought money was enough, it's just a temporary rush
I'll try to go find some other high

Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
But I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road

So much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind

I'm sorry that I'm not there to give you what you want
I'll think about us some other time
And I'm sorry that I can't be the perfect type of man
I'll think about us some other time

Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road

I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind

I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
