		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might be the villain
In somebody else's story
But that's fine

My methods are controversial
But at least it keeps them all in line, in line

I don't need your roses, I like men on their knees
Praying up to their god, seeing visions of me

I'm a cult leader, mind reader
Heart eater, fear feeder
Say I'm your favorite preacher
If I wasn't a narcissist
I wouldn't like me either

I'm your cult leader, best believer
She's a keeper, grim reaper
Looking for my cheerleaders
If it's between love and money
I'd rather have neither

So charming, it's alarming
I'm hurting everybody that I know

Lead the masses, from the ashes
I want power and I think it shows

I don't need your roses, I like men on their knees
Praying up to their god, seeing visions of me

I'm a cult leader, mind reader
Heart eater, fear feeder
Say I'm your favorite preacher
If I wasn't a narcissist
I wouldn't like me either

I'm your cult leader, best believer
She's a keeper, grim reaper
Looking for my cheerleaders
If it's between love and money
I'd rather have neither

I wanna be a leader, leader, leader, oh
Leader, leader, leader, oh
Leader, leader, leader, oh
Leader, leader, leader, oh

Leader, keeper
Best believe her
You ain't ever seen them
Do it quite like me
