		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say what you need to say
Make it clear, make it great
'Cause it's not too late
And there's no mistake when you shine
Shake it for me anyway
Now we crash the gate to investigate
Your fate

Pleasure to meet you, got so much more
To offer the world, see what's in store
Stay all day
Someone to love, that's my boy chip chop
Open the doors and we never close shop
Stay all day

Take what you need to take to forsake
Make it for me anyway
When we fill the void that is Pink As Floyd
To destroy records that we file away
Now we'll clean the slate as we calculate
Your fate

Pleasure to meet you, got so much more
To offer the world, see what's in store
Stay all day
Someone to love, that's my boy chip chop
Open the doors and we never close shop
Stay all day

And you shine, as you redefine your time
Just another time of day
Do you feel the spark when you play the part?
Superstar fake it for me anyway
Time to tell them all without hem or haw
No applause tell them how to generate

How to raise the bar, how to keep it hard
Be alive make it for me anyway
If you care at all you will bare it all
You will grind shake it for me anyway

Born to play the part, dying for your art
'Cause it's time take it for me anyway
You will clear the air with a single stare
Your fate
