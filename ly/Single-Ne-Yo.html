		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody in the club right now
Tell the DJ to turn it loud
Baby girl this your favorite song,
This for girls who got their on car,
This for girls who got their on crib,
This for girls who got their on shh,

If you came here by yourself tonight
Cause he wouldn't pick up the phone
He was supposed to bring u here tonight
Couldn't find him so you came alone

It don't matter cause your here now
And the music your enjoying
So for the next couple minutes
Baby I'ma be your boyfriend

Pretty mama if your single, single
(You don't gotta be alone tonight)
So while the DJ play this single, single
(Just pretend that I'm your man tonight)

So you don't gotta be alone
(I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Girl I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Baby ill be your boyfriend)
Be your boyfriend til the song goes off
So you don't gotta be alone
(I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Girl I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Baby I'll be your boyfriend)
Be your boyfriend til the song goes off

He don't tell you that your beautiful (beautiful)
Let me tell it to you to the beat
He don't tell you that he loves you girl (loves you girl)
Let me sing it in a harmony
Let my song get you higher (higher)
We never have to come back down (no no)
And if then you should miss me (miss me)
Just tell the DJ run it back now

Pretty mama if your single, single
(You don't gotta be alone tonight)
So while the DJ play this single, single
(Just pretend that I'm your man tonight)

So you don't gotta be alone
(I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Girl I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Baby ill be your boyfriend)
Be your boyfriend til the song goes off
So you don't gotta be alone
(I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Girl I'll be your boyfriend)
So you don't gotta be alone
(Baby I'll be your boyfriend)
Be your boyfriend til the song goes off

Be your boyfriend till the song goes off
Be your boyfriend till this song goes off
