		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been away
Searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas
Fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in hell
Where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes

Walked many roads
To witness ancient idols
And found the great gates of fire

Had many storms
Questioned my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise

The hangman searching
For bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night 
Final plight

Live again
All roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escape the hell
Of capitulated mortals
And drink the blood of a king
A desert rain
Has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems

Live again
all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

My story ends
Not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world
Through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is
I've been told
So I go

Live again
All roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
