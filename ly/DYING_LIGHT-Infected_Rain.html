		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're all fading away

We are just fading away, we are just fading away
Like memories of yesterday
You are fading away, we are just fading away
Like memories of yesterday

We try to hold on to our past
But, it's slipping away so fast
We try to make a lasting mark
But, in the end we are just a spark

Like leaves falling from the tree
We crumble and fall inevitably
Like leaves falling from the tree
We crumble and fall inevitably

We are just fading away, we are just fading away
Like memories of yesterday
You are fading away, we are just fading away
Like memories of yesterday

Like a candle in the wind
Flickering, fading in the end
Like a ship lost at sea
We are drifting away, can't you see?
Can't you see?

We all are fading away
Just like fading, dying light

Wrinkles on our face
A sign of our grace
Holding on to our past so tight
Like a fading, dying light

Like leaves falling from the tree
We crumble and fall inevitably
Like leaves falling from the tree
We crumble and fall inevitably

Wrinkles on our face
To see the other side of the moon
A sign of our grace
Becoming part of our tomb
Holding on to our past so tight
Losing its bloom
Like a fading, dying light
Our impending doom

We are decaying
While hoping to see the other side of the moon
We are decaying
Our bodies become apart of our tomb
We are decaying
Like a rose losing its bloom
We are decaying
In the darkness of our impending doom

We all are fading away
Just like memories of yesterday
We all are to our past so tight
Like a fading, dying light

We are just fading away
Like memories of yesterday
Yeah, we're fading away
Like memories of yesterday
