		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder
You wanted me sadder
Fishtail what's the matter, like that

Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
Not that smart but I've got things to say
Palm trees in black and white
I like to watch them sway
You're so funny, I wish I could skinny-dip inside your mind
Lately I've been thinkin' about how things used to be
Swingin' in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
Almost Victorian with you, you can talk to me
But lately, I can't see

(You wanted me sadder)
Baby (you wanted me sadder)
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you
Don't you see it?
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, babe
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder

Dancing there in the hot, hot sun
I know that we've got problems
I plan to address them another day
Palm trees in black and white
I see in technicolor
Maybe I'll take my glasses off
So I stop painting red flags green
Lately I've been sunning in the L.A. River bed
Wearing nothin' but the summer bruises on my knees
I like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
But lately, I can't see

(You wanted me sadder)
Baby (you wanted me sadder)
(You wanted me sadder)
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you
Don't just say it
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, see
Baby, if you care, then (don't you dare say)
Baby, don't you dare say (that you'll braid my hair, babe)
That you really care
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair
When you get home tonight
If you don't really care
Yeah, don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair, babe
If don't really care, see
That you'll braid my hair
If you're not coming home to me
Mm-mm

You want someone sadder
Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
I'm not that smart
But I've got things to say
