		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn meets the dew
And the tide rises
Did you realize
No one can see inside your view?
Did you realize
For why this sight belongs to you?

Oh
Just set aside your fears of life
With this sole desire
Done it warning
Done it now
It ain't real
On this side
Done it warning
Done it now
It ain't real
On this side

Done it warning
Done it now
It ain't real
Done it waring
Done it now
This ain't real
On this side

Oh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn meets the dew
And the tide rises
Did you realize
No one can see inside your view?
Did you realize
For why this sight belongs to you?
