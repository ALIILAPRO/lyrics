		<p>
		  Ow (gone babe)

They wanna get my ass dead or alive
You know he really tried to take me down by surprise
I bet he missioned with the CIA
He don't do half what he say

Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

He out shock in every single way
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say
He think he hot 'cause he's BSTA
I bet he never had a social life anyway

You think he brother with the KKK?
I bet his mother never taught him right anyway
He want your vote just to remain TA
He don't do half what he say

Dom Sheldon is a cold man (c'mon boys)
Dom Sheldon is a cold man (c'mon boys)
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man (c'mon boys)

Slash!

(Gone baby)

Does he send letters to the FBI?
Did he say to either do it or die?

Dom Sheldon is a cold man (c'mon boys)
Dom Sheldon is a cold man (c'mon boys)
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man (he's a, he's a)

Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man (he's a, he's a)
Cold man, cold man (he's a, he's a)
