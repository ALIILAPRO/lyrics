		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges I like 'em rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me
I'm a lush
Stop you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know (Know)
I'm checking you
So hot, so hot
Wonder if you know
You're on my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)
And yep I notice you
I know it's you
Choose it, you don't wanna lose it
You're my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)

And when you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)
I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

Hey listen baby
Turn up the fader
Tryna to make you understand
You're on my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)

On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can handle that
Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan

I don't think you know (Know)
I'm checking you
So hot, so hot
Wonder if you know
You're on my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)
And yep I notice you
I know it's you
Choose it, you don't wanna lose it
You're my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)

And when you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)
I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

Hey listen baby
Turn up the fader
Tryna to make you understand
You're on my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)

On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

I got my eye on you
And I can't let you get away

Hey baby
Whether it's now or later
I've got you
You can't shake me
Cause I got you on my radar
Whether you like it or not
It ain't gonna stop
Cause I got you on my radar
(I got you)
Cause I got you on my radar

I'm checking you
So hot, so hot
You're on my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)
And yep I notice you
I know it's you
Choose it, you don't wanna lose it
You're my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)

And when you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)
I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

Hey listen baby
Turn up the fader
Tryna to make you understand
You're on my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)

On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
