		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mind's a videotape rewinding our mistakes
Could do it all again but better
Cold nights I lie awake and watch you slip away
Then crawl into your favorite sweater

If I could just play pretend, if I could just disappear
You think you would miss me then? Oh-oh
'Cause I'm at a loss for words, lower me down into the earth
See if you cry when I hit the dirt

I wanna play hide and seek
I wanna see how far you'd go to find me
Baby, you feel so weak and this love is one-sided
If you don't wanna stay, don't stay for me

We take it day by day, we're numb now to the pain
The love we used to have has weathered
Just need another wave of hope to hit my veins
Keep holding onto daily treasure

If I could just go to sleep, live in a lucid dream
Away from reality, oh-oh
We will be back at the start, treat me like I'm a work of art
Keeping me safe when I fall apart

Oh, I wanna play hide and seek
I wanna see how far you'd go to find me
Baby, you feel so weak and this love is one-sided
If you don't wanna stay, don't stay for me

I wanna play hide and seek
I wanna see how far you'd go to find me
Baby, you feel so weak and this love is one-sided
If you don't wanna stay, don't stay for me

Can we play a little game?
Come and find me, oh, come and find me
Can we play just a little game?
Come and find me, oh, come and find me

Hide and seek (don't stay, don't stay)
I wanna see how far you go to find me (don't stay, don't stay)
Baby, you feel so weak (don't stay, don't stay)
And there's else inside, if you don't wanna stay (don't stay, don't stay)
Don't stay for me, oh-oh-oh

(Don't stay, don't stay
Don't stay, don't stay)

If I hide, will you find me?
If I hide, will you find me?
