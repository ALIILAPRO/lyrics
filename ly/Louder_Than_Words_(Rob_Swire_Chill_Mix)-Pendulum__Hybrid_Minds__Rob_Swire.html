		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't whisper, don't make a sound
No movement for miles around
Cold bodies, ready to go
Maybe better the devil you know

And you got me higher than her, higher than her (higher, higher)
And you're speaking louder than words, louder than words (higher, higher)
And you got me higher than her, higher than her (higher, higher)
And you're speaking louder than words, louder than words (higher)

Find another way to shut this down
In another place, I'd help you
Feed him to the lions, we'll go without
Panic to the nines, I know you
No time left to pretend
I didn't wanna see 'til the end
Leave this motion underground
When I wake, I'm coming home

And you got me higher than her, higher than her (higher, higher)
And you're speaking louder than words, louder than words (higher, higher)
And you got me higher than her, higher than her (higher, higher)
And you're speaking louder than words, louder than words (higher)

Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words

Too heartless to lose yourself
Tearing at the seams to feel it
Fake it to the point you oversell
Save it 'til the night is creeping
No time left to pretend
I didn't wanna see till the end
Leave this motion underground
When I wake, I'm coming home

And you got me higher than her, higher than her (higher, higher)
And you're speaking louder than words, louder than words (higher, higher)
And you got me higher than her, higher than her (higher, higher)
And you're speaking louder than words, louder than words (higher)
