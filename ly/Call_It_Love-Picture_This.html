		<p>
		  (Call it love)

What are you saying?
Why don't we run away tonight instead of staying
Lost in lust
'Cause the future is fading
And I wanna give it all to you tonight, my baby
Dance in dusk

Maybe I'm way over my head
Maybe our memories forget
All about us when we're gone
But right now, we're holding on

Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe I'm crazy after all
But I'm just tryna find a way to make it happen

I've got a way of letting out secrets
When I'm feeling down and I'm drinking up
Oh, my love
And you are the name that I am out preaching
Right when the darkness comes and I'm feeling stuck
You light me up

And I'd love to call it love
I'd love to call it love
I'd love to call it love
Oh, I would love to, love to, love to

Call it a daydream
Call it a celebration of the hearts we're saving
From our touch
'Cause I am a native
Of the embrace you give to me
I wanna save it
For myself

'Cause maybe you do, maybe you don't
Maybe I'm crazy after all
But I'm just tryna find a way to make it better

I've got a way of letting out secrets
When I'm feeling down and I'm drinking up
Oh, my love
And you are the name that I am out preaching
Right when the darkness comes and I'm feeling stuck
You light me up

And I'd love to call it love
I'd love to call it love
I'd love to call it love
Oh, I would love to, love to, love to

Call it love
I'd love to call it love
I'd love to call it love
Oh, I would love to, love to, love to call you

All mine, mine, mine
All day and all night
All mine
Oh, I would love to, love to, love to call you
All mine, mine, mine
All day and all night
All mine
Oh, I would love to, love to, love to call it love

I'd love to call it love
I'd love to call it love
Oh, I would love to, love to, love to call it love
