		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, if I didn't, darling, I'm sorry
Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms
Oh, when you needed me?
Now I realize that you need love too
And I'll spend my life making up to you

Oh, I forgot to be your lover 
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

Have I taken the time to share with you
All the burdens that lovers bare?
And have I done the little simple things to show you
Just how much I care?
Oh, I've been workin' for you, doin' all I can
And work all the time didn't make me a man

Oh, I forgot to be your lover 
And I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you somehow, baby

I forgot to be your lover
Gonna make it up to you somehow
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, baby
I forgot to be your lover
