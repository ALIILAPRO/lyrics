		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mind runs away to you
With a thought I hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered to
But I know where it wants to be

I'm waiting patiently
Though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
And I wanted you to know that

You're the one, designed for me
A distant stranger, that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up, and make it to me
And make it to me

So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to share
So much to get off my chest

I'm waiting patiently
Though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
And I wanted you to know that

You're the one, designed for me
A distant stranger, that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up, and make it to me

Make it to me
And make it to me
Make it to me
