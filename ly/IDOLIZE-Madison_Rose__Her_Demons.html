		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Read it again and I'm blacking out
Fairytales ain't really checkin' out
About how you're coming to save me
So, I guess I gotta go ahead and save myself
Let's give it some full exposure
I don't need any more closure
And if you come back after what you did
I'm gonna have to go reach for the holster

I was born a legend, I'll die with gold in my mouth
Roses cover our skin, I got thorns for a crown
I don't need the king's horses to put me together again
Roses cover our skin, do you feel the change comin'?

Find us where dreams meet the sky
Look at us, idolize
We see all, your hand in mine
Look at us, idolize
Idolize
Idolize
Idolize
Idolize

Karma's comin', yeah, it's back in style
You can run, the hide is futile
No time for conversation, complication
Had your chance and now we're going buck wild
This crown may be heavy, but pressure makes diamonds
Yeah, look at me shining
And doing it all in my own perfect timing

Do you see the thunder? Do you feel the bang?
Do you hear the colors? Can you smell the change?
Do you see the future? May not know my name
But you know a legend when you see their face

Find us where dreams meet the sky
Look at us, idolize
We see all, your hand in mine
Look at us, idolize
Idolize
Idolize, yeah
Idolize
Idolize, yeah

Idolize, idol, I
Id√¥le, I
