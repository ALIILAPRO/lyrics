		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aren't you tired of this shit like
Damn
You keep on
Treating me like
You don't care
Do you care about me
What's up with us
What are we doing
You never had love for me like you claim
Please don't come around cuz you come with pain
You gon do the most just to get your way
You act like a child
All your childish ways
Wish I could go back
Just to curve your ass
Shoulda took you out
Like I take the trash
You seek to control
You seek to possess
Never thought that you
Would do me like this
Callin me out my name
Damn
Treating me like loose change
What
You must think I'm insane
No
Cuz you don't do a damn thing for me
And you know that I'll go
Yeah, I can leave you alone
Yeah
But you cannot say the same
Cuz you're
Miserable without me
Yeah
You went through a lot
And I had yo back
Now I'm looking back
I'm a fool for that
You get on your feet
And forget my ass
Getting back with me
You don't stand a chance
Now I'm looking at you all I do is laugh
Like how I waste my time with his crazy ass
You did not know nothing sat and taught yo ass
Took you under my wing
But you out the nest
Wouldn't you believe you had me this stressed
Wouldn't you believe you had me depressed
Put you in the past
Ian looking back
Boy you needa pray
Yo head not on straight
Bye
You are such a damn shame
Momma, look what you raised
Look what you made
He do not do nothing
Right
He is just a blank space
Where somebody else should be
Where somebody else should be
He do not mean nothing to me
He do not mean nothing to me
Ian looking back
