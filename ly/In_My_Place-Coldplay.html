		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it

And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?

Sing it, please, please, please
Come back, come sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me
Come back and sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah, oh yeah
