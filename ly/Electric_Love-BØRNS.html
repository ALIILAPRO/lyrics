		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Candy
She's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste

And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it

All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love
Electric love

Drowning
You make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me
Hold me deep beneath your weight

And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder and louder
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it

All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love
Electric love

Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me

Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it

And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love
Baby, you're electric
