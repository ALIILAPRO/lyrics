		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I'm in a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
It's just like a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
I'm caught in a chase scene
With someone I can't see
They're coming to find me
They're coming to find me

Ominous, I can hear my heart beat through my chest
Darkness, I can feel the breathing on my neck

And in a state of panic I'll lash out
Manage to get out, leave everyone behind
And I can hear the screams as they cry out
Shouting their lungs out, I don't dare look behind

I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
If just for a time I am free
If just for a time I am me

'Cause I'm in a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
It's just like a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
The penultimate scene, a moment of reprieve
The music swells as if to tell me

That I'm in a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
It's just like a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
I'm at my finale, the darkness surrounds me
It's all temporary
It's all temporary

'Cause I'm in a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
It's just like a sla-sla-sla-sla-slasher
I'm caught in a chase scene
With someone I can't see
They're coming to find me
They're coming to find me
