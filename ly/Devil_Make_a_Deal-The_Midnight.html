		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once there was a man with good intentions
And some people at home he forgot to mention
She was looking for a friend and he was willing to listen
Once there was a man with good intentions

And nobody has to know
It's alright, it's alright to let go
And nobody has to see
What's between you and me
Is you and me (is you and me)
(Is you and me)

Once there was a girl who thought she needed to be saved
By a white knight on a white horse in a white cape
Maybe he's taken but you'll take him anyway
Once there was a girl who thought she needed to be saved

And nobody has to know
It's alright, it's alright to let go
And nobody has to see
What's between you and me
Is you and me (is you and me)
(Is you and me)

I don't want to change your mind
But I don't wanna go home tonight
Tell me no or I'm coming over
Let the devil make a deal with the angel on your shoulder

(Is you and me)
