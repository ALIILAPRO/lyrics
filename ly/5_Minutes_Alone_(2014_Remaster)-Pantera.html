		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you had your mind all made up
You group of pitiful liars.
Before I woke to face the day
Your master plan transpired

Something told me
This job had more than meets the eye
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole

You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom

Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation
I ask you, please just give us

5 minutes alone

Just give us
5 minutes alone

I read your eyes, your mind was made up
You took me for a fool
You used complexion of my skin
For a counter-rascist tool
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past
Taken advantage of
Because you know where I've come from
My past

You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom

Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar alone
You cry for compensation
I ask you, please just give us

5 minutes alone

Just give us
5 minutes alone

Like points of broken glass

Oh, five minutes
Alone
Just give us
Yeah

Last stop

I ask you, please just give us

5 minutes alone

Just give us
5 minutes alone

I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please just give us
I ask you, please (please)
I ask you, please
I ask you, please
I beg you, please
I beg you, please
I beg you, please

5 minutes alone

Just give us
5 minutes alone
5 minutes alone
5 minutes alone
