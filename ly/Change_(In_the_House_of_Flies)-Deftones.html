		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You're on fire

Yeah, I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
And you feel so alive
I have watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

Yeah, I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

It's like you never had wings
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

I look at the cross
Then I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I have watched you change

How you feel alive
You feel alive
You feel alive
I've watched you change
It's like you never had wings

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

You've changed
You've changed
You've changed
Into a fly
