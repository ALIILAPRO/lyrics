		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm drivin' out on the highway
White powdered Lamborghini 
My dead girlfriend in the back seat
Dressed in a red bikini 

Yeah, I got problems 
Yeah, I'm gonna solve them

Cocaine Runaway
Running all through the night 
and into the day
My Cocaine Runaway 
Maybe I'll catch you one day

Out on the edge of town
Flashing lights in the mirror
Baby it's not long now
Yeah I can hear the call of the river 
 
Yeah, I got problems 
Yeah, it's all or nothing 

Cocaine Runaway
Running all through the night 
and into the day
My Cocaine Runaway 
Maybe I'll catch you one day

Cocaine Runaway
Running all through the night 
and into the day
My Cocaine Runaway 
Maybe I'll catch you one day

Cocaine Runaway
Running all through the night 
and into the day
My Cocaine Runaway 
Maybe I'll catch you one day
