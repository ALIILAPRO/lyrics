		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes in life you go a long way alone
And the people you find, they tend to come and go
And I made my share of mistakes and I still find a way to go on
But I done a few things right, at least this much I know

The day that I met you, it was forever
The day that I met you, it was forever

I feel I was chasing, chasing a dream that I'd never know
And most of my life, I was looking for trouble
Baby, I was broken down, I was shipwrecked, I was low
And you came into my life when I had nowhere to go

The day that I met you, it was forever
The day that I met you, it was forever

They say that you know it when it comes your way
And you won't let it, you won't let it get away

The day that I met you, it was forever
The day that I met you, it was forever

The day that I met you, it was forever
The day that I met you, it was forever

The day that I met you
It was forever
The day that I met you
It was forever
