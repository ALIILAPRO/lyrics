		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sittin' at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by applyin' booze
The talk was small when they talked at all
They both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
But they were old enough to talk it out and keep it loose
She said you dont look like my type but I guess you'll do
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
He said I'll even tell you that I love you if you want me too
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous

When they left the bar they got in his car and they drove away
He drove to the Family Inn 
She didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for
And then he went to the desk and made his request while she waited outside
He came back with the key and she said, "Give it to me and I'll unlock the door"
She kept saying, "I've never really done this kind of thing before, have you?"

Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
And he said, "Yes I have but only a time or two"

Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
Third rate romance low rent rendezvous
