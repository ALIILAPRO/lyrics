		<p>
		  Ayy, okay, ooh, okay, uh
Nice guys always finish last, should've known that
Gave you my heart and you fucked around and broke that
So sad
Pretty girls'll hurt you so bad (so bad)

Girl you played me, did me so shady
Got me in my feelings, I can't trust lately
You so lame, took me as a game
Say guys are dogs, well, all girls the same
Karma, where you at? You better have my back (my back)
'Cause you know damn well I didn't deserve that
Oh, I'm finna lose it, got me lookin' stupid (yeah)
From now on I'ma be ruthless

Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Mmh

Thought I was in love (in love)
Got me thinkin' to myself I wasn't enough (enough)
I remember late nights all alone (whoa)
Waitin' by my phone just to see your name with a ringtone (whoa)
But you, never called (whoa)
You ain't ever cared (cared)
Told me that you love me you were never there (never there)
What did I do to deserve this treatment? (Whoa)
Never thought you'd be the one that I caught cheatin'

Why you do this to me? (Whoa)
We had so much history
Now all I know is misery (whoa)
Girl, look what you did to me (to me)

Why you do this to me?
We had so much history
Now all I know is misery
Girl, look what you did to me

Girl, you played me, did me so shady
Got me in my feelings, I can't trust lately
You so lame, took me as a game
Say guys are dogs, well, all girls the same
Karma, where you at? You better have my back
'Cause you know damn well I didn't deserve that (whoa)
Oh, I finna lose it, got me lookin' stupid
From now on I'ma be ruthless

Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Mmh

Wish I knew (I knew)
One day I pray you feel the pain I do (I do)
Never fall in love with a girl like you again (hey)
I learned my lesson, you ain't see a blessing, yeah
I ain't even stressin', I'ma take your best friend
I'ma do you how you did me
Because of all the lies and all those other guys
You make it hard to believe (to believe)

Why you do this to me?
We had so much history (history)
Now all I know is misery (misery)
Girl, look what you did to me

Why you do this to me? (to me?)
We had so much history (history)
Now all I know is misery
Girl, look what you did to me

Girl, you played me, did me so shady
Got me in my feelings, I can't trust lately
You so lame, took me as a game
Say guys are dogs, well, all girls the same
Karma, where you at? You better have my back (my back)
'Cause you know damn well I didn't deserve that (whoa)
Oh, I'm finna lose it, got me lookin' stupid (yeah)
From now on I'ma be ruthless

Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Mmh

Nice guys always finish last, should've known that
Gave you my heart and you fucked around and broke that
So sad, pretty girls'll hurt you so bad (so bad)
