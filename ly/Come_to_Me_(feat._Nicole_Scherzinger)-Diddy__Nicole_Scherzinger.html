		<p>
		  Come to me, I can be, what you need, ooh baby
It's Bad Boy, bitch
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it (It feels good to be back, I missed ya)
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And I roll with the sounds of B-B-E
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it (You know what time it is, report to the dance floor)
It's bad boy, bitch (Talk to 'em)

See you out the corner of my eye
Leaning on the wall, looking fly
I want you to come be with me
You're the only one I wanna talk to
But I don't wanna rush

I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me that you wanna know me

You know who it is, I'm back in the building
Security strapped, still stacking a million
It's doubt with the stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it but willing to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats
I buck clean about in a Phantom
The people go screaming like an opera anthem
I did it before, do it again
I got it to blow, got it to spin
Lies before, cool as the wind
Got hits go back like juice and gin, yea
Shine the best and diamond necklace
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know I'm the ish, they wanna get next
That's why she had to fit 'cause she wanted to get next

I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me that you wanna know me

Anywhere I appear, they all stop and stare
Admire your body language, speaking loud and clear like (I want you to come be with me)
She be waiting, anticipating for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me coming on like (I'm here, when will you make your move?)
She digging my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the Boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall till my aura called
I make miracles like I walk on water
What you want, mama, order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped the whole bag
Where you at, girl?

I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me that you wanna know me

I'm here right now, can't wait no more, no
You were the one who stole my heart
Can't you see the wait is over?
I need you to come closer
Please believe is getting stormy
You really got me hot

I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha
Come to me? I can be what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me, it's Bad Boy bitch (Do it, do it, do it, do it)
