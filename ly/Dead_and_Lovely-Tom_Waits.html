		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was a middle class girl
She was in over her head
She thought she would stand up in the deep end

He had a bullet proof smile
He had money to burn
She thought she had the moon in her pocket

But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and lovely now

I've always been told to remember this
Don't let a fool kiss you
Never marry for love

He was hard to impress
He knew everyone's secrets
He wore her on his arm just like jewelry

He never gave but he got
He kept her on a leash
He's not the kind of wheel you fall asleep at

But now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now

Come closer, look deeper
You've fallen fast
Just like a plane on a stormy sea

She made up someone to be
She made up somewhere to be from
This is one business in the world where that's no problem at all

Everything that is left
They will only plow under
Soon every one you knew will be gone

And now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now

But now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now

I've always been told to remember this
Don't let a kiss fool you
Never marry for love

Everything has its price
Everything has its place
What's more romantic then dying in the moonlight?

Now they're all watching the sea
What's lost can never be broken
Her roots were sweet but they were so shallow

And now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now

And now she's dead
Forever dead
And she's so dead and lovely now
