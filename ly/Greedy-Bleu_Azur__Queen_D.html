		  He said, "Are you serious? I've tried, but I can't figure out
I've been next to you all night and still don't know what you're about
You keep ta- (Ta-ta-), talkin', but not much comin' out your mouth
Can't you tell that I want you?", I say, yeah
I would want myself
Baby, please believe me
I'll put you through hell
Just to know me, yeah, yeah
So sure of yourself
Baby, don't get greedy
That shit won't end well
No, it won't end well
(Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, woo)
I see you eyein' me down, but you'll never know much past my name
Or how I'm runnin' this room around and that I'm still half your age
Yeah, you're loo- (Loo-loo-), lookin' at me like I'm some sweet escape
Obvious that you want me, but I said

I would want myself
Baby, please believe me
I'll put you through hell
Just to know me, yeah, yeah
So sure of yourself
Baby, don't get greedy
That shit won't end well
No, it won't end well
He said, "I'm just curious, is this for real or just an act?
Can't tell if you love or hate me, never met someone like that
Drive me so (So, so) crazy, did you know you got that effect?"
I said, "Lemme check," yeah
I would want myself
Baby, please believe me
I'll put you through hell
Just to know me, yeah, yeah
So sure of yourself
Baby, don't get greedy
That shit won't end well
No, it won't end well
(I would want myself)
(I would want myself)
I would want myself
(I would want myself)
(I would want myself)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh)
