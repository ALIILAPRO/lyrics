		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a friend of a friend
And I'd like to get to know you too
And see what you are going through
I'm not just after sex i want to bask in the
Delight that is your womanhood
And call your name, Alice

I read the program by the light on my phone
But all I could think about was
Being with you alone yeah, yeah
And all the players in the orchestra
Pit were playing perfectly fine
But I just didn't get it yeah, yeah

Then you dropped your flowers on the ground
Some day I know that you will come around
No hate, I know it is what it is deep down
I know you're just a friend of a friend

I'm just a friend of a friend
And I'd like to be all over you
Sometimes it's hard to know what I should do
Sweetheart of Sigma Chi
You make me wish I was a Catholic
With only just a year or two to live

I read the program by the light on my phone
But all I could think about was
Being with you alone yeah, yeah
And all the players in the orchestra
Pit were playing perfectly fine
But I just didn't get it yeah, yeah

Then you dropped your flowers on the ground
Some day I know that you will come around
No hate, I know it is what it is deep down
I know you're just a friend of a friend


I read the program by the light on my phone
But all I could think about was
Being with you alone yeah, yeah
And all the players in the orchestra
Pit were playing perfectly fine
But I just didn't get it yeah, yeah

Then you dropped your flowers on the ground
Some day I know that you will come around
No hate, I know it is what it is deep down
I know you're just a friend of a friend
