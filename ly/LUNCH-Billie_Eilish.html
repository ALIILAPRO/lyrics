		<p>
		  Oh, mm-mm

I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair

Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothes on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowed, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh

Oh, I just wanna get her off, oh
Oh
Oh, oh
Oh

She's takin' pictures in the mirror
Oh my God, her skin's so clear
Tell her, "Bring that over here"
You need a seat? I'll volunteer
Now she's smilin' ear to ear
She's the headlights, I'm the deer

I've said it all before, but I'll say it again
I'm interested in more than just bein' your friend
I don't wanna break it, just want it to bend
Do you know how to bend?

I could eat that girl for lunch
She dances on my tongue
I know it's just a hunch
But she might be the one

I could
Eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she
Tastes like she might be the one
I could
I could
Eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she
Yeah, she
Tastes like she might be the one
