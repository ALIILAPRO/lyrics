		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got my fingers crossed that you don't double cross me 'cause I
Don't need these barriers scaring me like they did the last time
Fingers crossed that you don't scar me for life
That you don't kill the stars in my eyes
'Cause I really, really want you and I

Forgive me baby if I'm a little cautious
My ex made me a little too nauseous
Thought she was an antidote, but she's toxic
Now my mind is a mess, it's a mosh pit

Say that you've been hurt like that
You've been through hell and back
You won't do me like that
I want to believe it

I've got my fingers crossed that you don't double cross me 'cause I
Don't need these barriers scaring me like they did the last time
Fingers crossed that you don't scar me for life
That you don't kill the stars in my eyes
'Cause I really, really want you and I

Baby, I've been letting my perception of love via exes break me
And it's been like, drinking swill
I'm taking all my baggage to the landfill
'Cause I don't want another scenario where we find love
But we're so bruised that we let it go
There's potential to be palpable
Can we save all of our reservations for date nights

Say (say) you've had it just as bad (as bad)
You've been through hell and back (and back)
Say you won't do me like that
I want to believe it

I've got my fingers crossed that you don't double cross me 'cause I
Don't need these barriers scaring me like they did the last time
Fingers crossed that you don't scar me for life (you don't)
That you don't kill the stars in my eyes (in my eyes)
'Cause I really, really want you and I (I really want this with you)
Fingers crossed that you don't scar me for life
That you don't run away in the night
'Cause I really, really want you and I

La da-da-da da
La da-da-da da
