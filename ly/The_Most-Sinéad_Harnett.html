		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah-yeah, we went from amazing to a maze
Yeah, I settle for ways that was a phase (ah, yeah-yeah)
If a spade is a spade, it's what it is
I was hoping for something that don't exist

You had me wishing you could mean what you say
But you're so good at games
It's calculated when you claim you will change
But you just stay the same

I swear that

Boy, you do the most and then you love me bad
Hot and then your cold, but I don't move like that
Why do you play with my mind just to drive me mad?
Boy, you do the most and then you love me bad

Love me bad
Love me bad, oh
Love me bad
Love me bad, oh no

Why you so aggravated on the phone?
If I'm so hard to be with, be alone (ah, yeah-yeah)
You're projecting your insecurities
Everything's all about you, don't put it on me

You had me wishing you could mean what you say
But you're so good at games
It's calculated when you claim you will change
But you just stay the same

I swear that

Boy, you do the most and then you love me bad
Hot and then your cold, but I don't move like that
Why do you play with my mind just to drive me mad?
Boy, you do the most and then you love me bad

Love me bad
Love me bad, oh
Love me bad
Love me bad, oh no

You can go, you can go, you can go
Yes, I'll go, yes, I'll go, I'll go
You can go, you can go, you can go
Go, go
