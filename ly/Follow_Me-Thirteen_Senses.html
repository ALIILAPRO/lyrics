		<p>
		  Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think

I didn't show up today
I only disappeared
A missing detail of how I should feel
The memory has been erased
If you really want to escape
You don't belong here

Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think

Turn the lights out and be on your own
Outside your window their be watching you now
The memory has been erased
They were ordering you all to kill

Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think

I, I find it in the air
I saw it in the air
It sounds
It sounded like it's there
You fall around the air

Follow me
And I will take you in
Finally
You get to see what we think
