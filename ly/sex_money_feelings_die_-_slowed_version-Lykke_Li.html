		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Baby, don't you cry)
And I'ma make you feel right
(Baby, don't you cry)
Don't you know I'm always by your side?
(Ladies on my right)
And I will look for you like every time
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
(Sex, money, feelings, die)

When I get there have it nice and wet
Can't stay long, got a flight to catch
Great sex always ends with check
No feelings here, I don't care who's next
My tongue go from your ear to neck
If I don't call, don't get upset
Down play like I would send a jet
When I lie, it feels right

Late night
Call you in the late night
Trade love for one night
Two pills and a red wine
Talk offline, no, I don't mind
The words that you don't say
No love when you hold me
No callin' the next day, it's a one way, no
And now the sun is up, I'm comin' down
(Nobody nowhere, I'm nobody nowhere)
We just blow it up, blow it out

(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Ladies on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die)

Oh, I'm afraid of the sunlight
I don't care to be alright
Two lines, one time
Every night, every weekend, weeknight
Oh, my, lights off when I wake up
Tears under my makeup
Your lips will stay shut
When we wake up, break up

I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up, I'm so fucked up, all I want is you
No, I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up, I'm so fucked up

(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Ladies on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die)

Fucked her then I said I love her
(All night, all night, all night)
To be honest, by the time she wake I'll have another number
Taking drugs to heal my sorrow
(All night, all night, all night)
Yeah yeah

(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Ladies on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die)

Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Baby, don't you cry
(Sex, money, feelings, die)
Ladies on my right
(Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die)
