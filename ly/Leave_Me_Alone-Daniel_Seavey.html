		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stab my back through my sweater
Give me pleasure and pain
Heart attack when I see ya
When I think of your name

Too much liquor in my system
Now I'm takin' her home

She kissed me and I tasted you again
Pictured you naked in my bed, whoa
I kicked you out my place, but you ain't left
No, you're still livin' in my head, leave me alone

Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Tell me lies, say you hate me
Say it, baby
Go on (go on, go on)
Your last words were you'd never be movin' on
But I'm not the guy that you want
Oh, it's time to give it up

Too much liquor in my system
Now I'm takin' her home, ohh
Too much liquor (too much liquor) 
In my system (in my system)
'Cause I can't be alone (alone)

She kissed me and I tasted you again (again)
Pictured you naked in my bed, whoa
I kicked you out my place, but you ain't left
No, you're still livin' in my head, leave me alone

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Alone
Alone
