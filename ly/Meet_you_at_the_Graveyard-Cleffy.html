		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will meet you at the graveyard
Where you lay down
Where you stay now
Faced up, cold heart, no longer by my side now
Wish we were together now
I don't know when I will see you

I will meet you at the graveyard
Where you lay down
Where you stay now
Faced up, cold heart, no longer by my side now
Wish we were together now
I don't know when I will see you

You were undecided
Between life and past tense
You lost your battle, life was hell
But I was always here, how can't you tell
Oh, I thought we'd be together 'til life was over
But you left too soon, now I'm no longer sober
My rock, my friend, we always said, we'd live this life until we made it to the end
So why aren't you right next to me, you took your life, like fuck you left me bleeding

I will meet you at the graveyard
Where you lay down
Where you stay now
Faced up, cold heart, no longer by my side now
Wish we were together now
I don't know when I will see you

I will meet you at the graveyard
Where you lay down
Where you stay now
Faced up, cold heart, no longer by my side now
Wish we were together now
I don't know when I will see you

It doesn't make sense to me
You're gone, no, I can't believe
They say you live inside me but to me, you're still gone you see
This can't be real life, you were only like 23
I'm asking questions to my God like will we ever meet again
Left me in pain
Was all our plans in vain?
Our memories to make
I can see them slowly fading
You basically erased me
So how do you expect me to ever be happy?
My rock, my friend, we always said we'd live this life until we made it to the end
So why aren't you right next to me, you took your life, like fuck you left me bleeding

I will meet you at the graveyard
Where you lay down
Where you stay now
Faced up, cold heart, no longer by my side now
Wish we were together now
I don't know when I will see you
