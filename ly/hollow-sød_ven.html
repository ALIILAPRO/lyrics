		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hollow
Carve the words from your tongue
Fall on your misfortune
Don't speak
Shadow 
In the shape of what I once was
A whisper I could once trust
Pulled from me
 
Who
Who's to blame a promise
Spoke when it was honest
Then broken the same
Oh, All I ever wanted
Was to crawl into your arctic
And hold you unscathed

Hollow
Hold the air in your lungs
Innocence is undone 
Slowly

Who
Who's to blame a promise
Spoke when it was honest
Then broken the same
Oh, All I ever wanted
Was to crawl into your arctic
And hold you unscathed

Swallow 
The secrets you've been guarding
Time will leave you starving
And hollow
