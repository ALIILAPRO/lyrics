		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think the kids are in trouble
I do not know what all the troubles are for
Give them ice for their fevers
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
Live on coffee and flowers
And try not to wonder what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep

Now we'll leave the Silver City
'Cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City
'Cause all the silver girls
Everything means everything

It's a Hollywood summer
You'll never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything
We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together until our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone

Now we'll leave the Silver City
'Cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City
To all the silver girls
Everything means everything

I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil

I'm a confident liar
Have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be
I try to be more romantic
I want to believe in everything you believe
If I was less than amazing
I do not know what all the troubles are for
Fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore

Now we'll leave the Silver City
'Cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City
To all the silver girls
Everything means everything

I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
I was afraid
I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
