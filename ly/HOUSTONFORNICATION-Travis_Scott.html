		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might need me some ventilation
A little vacation, Houstonfornication
Mind redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
Float around town do that on the daily

How I'm supposed to feel safe, twelve live adjacent (twelve)
Yeah, crib built like a prison where that bitch is gated (yah)
Yeah, spendin' all my time up there gettin' faded (it's lit)
Yeah, handin' out the E! to the Entertainment (alright)
Yeah-you know on this side it's poppin' and it's dangerous (pop it, pop it)
Ridin' through the clouds we goin' through the vapors (phew, phew)
I'm just tryna get the paper, stayin' out the papers
It ain't easily done, it ain't easy (yeah)
Pop a seal like it's Chris, make it look Breezy (it's lit)
Wedding bands on my fist, it is freezing (straight up)
Throw the bands get a kiss, then she leave me
I just want the peace, it's still Lambo' over Mercedes (yeah)
Just built the Astroworld playground to play with my baby, yuh (my baby)
Had a few pop singers, anyone could be yo' mama (yeah)
Had some real conversations with my nigga, Bill, about congress yeah (straight up)
We at the fest, come and link, per-request (yeah, alright)
Send the pin, drop it in, GPS (yeah yeah)
Seein' flashes, oh, no-no, that's my neck (yeah, it's lit)
I've been livin' paranoid, watch yo' step (yeah yeah)

Ain't never freein' up and never let y'all, man
We always forgive, but don't forget easily (oh, no)
Cut my phone off so they can never reach me
Life is just a maze, goin' through my phases (yeah)
I might need me some ventilation
A little vacation, Houstonfornication
Mind redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
If it rise on the East, land on the West
We gon' make that shit pop, bust it for a check
Call the plays, link the squad, we gon' make it cash

Yeah, nobody can press me but the press
Nobody can check me when it's chess (ah, nah, for real)
They comin' at my neck like Gillette (Gillette)
I'm out the cash, that's the butterfly effect
I've been locked in for so long, I done got dreads
Took the girl off the network then up the net
Iced out watches for the gang, Patek the set
Had to move up off my block, it took finesse, yeah
Just keep droppin' them bombs, you should probably save your breath, yeah
We ain't gone play the steel, why you tryna funk the flex, yeah
All my dogs in my will, they gon' ride through 'til the death, yeah
Elevator up the hill we ain't never take the steps, yeah (yeah, yeah)

Ain't never freein' up and never let y'all, man
We always forgive, but don't forget easily (oh, no)
Cut my phone off so they can never reach me
Life is just a maze, goin' through my phases (yeah)
I might need me some ventilation
A little vacation, Houstonfornication
Mind redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
If it rise on the East, land on the West
We gon' make that shit pop, bust it for a check
Call the plays, link the squad, we gon' make it cash
