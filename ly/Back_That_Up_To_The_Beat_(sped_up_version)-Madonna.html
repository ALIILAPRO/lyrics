		  Leave them ready for
Move to the beat of the
Sway to the rhythm of
Waving around like a

Back that up to the beat
Back that up to the beat
Bang that drum to the beat
Back that up to the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it

Keep on shining your
I'm getting ready for
Let this party go
I'll be back until
Leave them ready for
Move to the beat of the
Sway to the rhythm of
Waving around like a

Back that up to the beat
Back that up to the beat
Bang that drum to the beat
Back that up to the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it

I'll be drinking Krug Rosé and sometimes Lemon Drops
I'll be wearing diamond grills and Louboutin's a lot
Sometimes I can be extreme but I'm never gonna stop
Keep this party going, we'll be dancing 'til we drop

You're my metaphor
Guess I'm running the
I'll keep dreaming of
They'll remember us
Means I'm ready for (fun)
Move to the beat beat of the (drum)
Sway to the beat rhythm of (one)
Waving around like a

Back that up to the beat
Back that up to the beat
Bang that drum to the beat
Back that up to the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it

I'll be drinking Krug Rosé and sometimes Lemon Drops
I'll be wearing diamond grills and Louboutin's a lot
Sometimes I can be extreme but I'm never gonna stop
Keep this party going, we'll be dancing 'til we

Drop (drop, drop)
Drop (drop, drop)

Ra-ta-ta-ta thunga-munga
Ra-ta-ta-ta thunga-munga
Ra-ta-ta-ta thunga-munga
Ra-ta-ta-ta thunga-munga

Bang that drum to the beat
Back that up to the beat
Bang that drum to the beat
Back that up to the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it

Do it, do it
Do it, do it
