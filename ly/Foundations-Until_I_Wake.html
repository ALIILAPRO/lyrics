		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You didn't think I would find out
But it's written on your face
Casting stones from a glass house
And it's about to break
I've got you right where I want now
And you've got nothing left to say
Why don't you shut your fucking mouth

You're done now your words are poison to me
Just get out save the apology

It's time I recuse myself from this
There's no foundation to build where trust
Has never existed and never will

Who do you think you are?
You're fooling everyone, but not me

Oh how the tides have turned
Your last mistake
Another bridge you've burned
You've sealed your fate
One strike is all it takes
My first mistake is that I trust a snake

It's time I recuse myself from this
There's no foundation to build where trust
Has never existed and never will

Should I forgive you? I guess
Could I forgive you? I guess

I've tried to put my faith in
You way too many times
I tear myself apart for you
While you get by with another excuse
Another lie
So it's time I recuse myself from this
There's no foundation to build where
Trust has never existed, it never will

I forgive you but I'll never forget
