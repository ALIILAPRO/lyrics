		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where is the fever?
Where is the heat we've been dreaming of?
We used to know
Where has it gone?
Don't have the answer
And I shouldn't bleed like a piece of burning made of sorrow
Where has it gone?

Give us the power
Don't stand against us
We won't break much longer
If you keep ruining us

Just something to see you
To be the last
The last man on Earth
The one that's at my door
To be with you in the end
The end is no gain
You'll be the last
The last of us
The moment you live for
Don't even know where you stand

Who will be the killer?
Where is the one who will have the guts do it right?
To wipe them out
Someone who pulls the trigger
Someone who fights at the gates of Heaven
Someone who knows
Where is the wrong

Give us the power
Don't stand against us
We won't break much longer
If you keep ruining us

Just something to see you
To be the last
The last man on Earth
The one that's at my door
To be with you in the end
The end is no gain
You'll be the last
The last of us
The moment you live for

Give us the power
Don't stand against us
We won't break much longer
If you keep ruining us

Just something to see you
To be the last
The last man on Earth
The one that's at my door
To be with you in the end
The end is no gain
You'll be the last
The last of us
The moment you live for
