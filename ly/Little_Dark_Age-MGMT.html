		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathing in the dark
Lying on its side
The ruins of the day
Painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out
The less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot
One wink at a time

Oh
Forgiving who you are
For what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide
It doesn't go away
When you get out of bed
Don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage, my little dark age

Picking through the cards
Knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face
Say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again
All limits of disguise
The humor's not the same
Coming from denial

Oh
I grieve in stereo
The stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide
It doesn't go away
If you get out of bed
And find me standing all alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

I grieve in stereo
The stereo sounds strange
You know that if it hides
It doesn't go away
If I get out of bed
You'll see me standing all alone, horrified
On the stage, my little dark age

Giddy with delight
Seeing what's to come
The image of the dead
Dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to god
Love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I
Would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed
Come find us heading for the bridge, bring a stone
All the rage, my little dark age

I grieve in stereo
The stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide
It doesn't go away
If you get out of bed
And find me standing all alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age
