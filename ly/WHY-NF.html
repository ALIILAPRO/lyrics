		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

Yeah, what's your definition of success? (ay)
I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (woo)
I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest
Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect, why?
Don't think I deserve it? You get no respect (woo)
I just made a couple mil', still not impressed
Let You Down goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (ay)
Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!
I push away the people that I love the most, why? (woo)
I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable, why? (woo)
That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable, why? (ay)
Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
Until I die, this isn't Nate's flow (woo)
Just let me rhyme, I'm in disguise
I'm a busy person, got no time for lies, one of a kind
They don't see it, I pull out they eyes, I'm on the rise!
I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (woo)
Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo!
They don't invite me to the parties but I still arrive
Kick down the door and then I go inside
Give off that "I do not belong here" vibe
Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
Why do y'all look mortified? (ay)
I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
Let You Down's the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (woo)
Story time, wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah)
If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
I, I don't care what anybody else thinks, lies (haha)
I do not need nobody to help me, lies
I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy, why?
I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like, "Why?
Just tell me why, not back to this flow
Inside I feel divided
Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, "Who am I, man?" Woo!
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for twenty-four hours a day and think I never did enough
My life is a movie but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (no)
I wanna be great but I get it in the way of myself 
And I think about everything that I could never be
Why do I do it though? Ay, yeah
Why you always lookin' aggravated?
Not a choice, you know I had to make it
When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
Like somethin' then I gotta take it
Write somethin' then I might erase it
I love it, then I really hate it
What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know
I know I like to preach to always be yourself (yeah)
But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
Which feels like I'm at war inside myself but I forgot the shells
I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces
