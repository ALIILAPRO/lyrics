		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a funny feeling deep in my stomach
Ain't nobody laughin', ah-ha-ha
Think the joke's on me
Feel it in my bones, feel it in my soul
Feel it in my spirit
No, I shouldn't put it all on me
Damned if I do, cancelled if I don't
Either way, I'm wrong, I'm just tryna get this weight off me
Didn't have a half, so I took a quarter
Sippin' holy water while I listen to hypocrisy

There's a war goin' on outside
Nobody see it but me (but me)
(Mmh, mmh, mmh)
There's a war goin' on outside
Nobody see it but me (but me)
(Mmh, mmh, mmh)

Still don't watch the news, no, no, no
'Cause my nigga ain't your nigga
So be careful what you say for views
Tried to talk about it, tried to walk around it
Trippin', now I'm drownin' and my aura got them ocean blues
Felt like I'm above it until it's my cousin
And I gotta tell his mama what I did not do
"Why weren't he with you?" Am I that removed?
Am I just confused?
I don't make the rules, they make me

There's a war goin' on outside
Nobody see it but me (but me)
Uh
There's a war goin' on outside
Nobody see it but me (but me)
(Mmh, mmh, mmh)

Ayy, the summer knows
I put my hope in embers of the day
I was in a phase with the dawgs dem
Nothing to communicate with, everything to say
I can't be out here beggin' for pardons, nah
Me and jigga saw a winner before we were asked if
We could bill a riddim, we were questionin' the answers
Even if it didn't drop, it's something out of nothing
Watch me, I'll be out here regardless
I said I didn't need a reason
I'ma make a bit and catch a win before I sleep here
I'ma need some things out of this place, it made me need it
A penny for your thoughts or a pound for your thinkin'
(Wait, I'm thinkin')
I'ma need some cheese here just to dip in
Just a have-not who had wants, then had a feeling, I could feel it
I could have everything that I didn't
I said I could have everything that I didn't, I didn't

There's a war goin' on outside
Nobody see it but me (but me)
(Mmh, mmh, mmh)
Oh, there's a war goin' on outside
No, nobody sees it but me
(Mmh, mmh, mmh)
No, no, no
No, no, no
