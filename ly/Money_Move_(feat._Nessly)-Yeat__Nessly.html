		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go 'head, O danny, I see you

On some cash, what I'm running through
Bands, make that money move
Dance, make that honey groove
Pussy tastes like honeydew
With these racks I see straight through you
You thought that shit was make believe
All this guap I got on me
It make these bitches want to see

Hold up diamonds flooded on my ring, check
I got money for my team
Women is so delicious
Swimming in different bitches i'ma get
Audemar on my wrist
Got a new bitch, suck dick
Autopilot in a spaceship
Bad lil' baby, can you face it?
Hop in the Tesla, I put it in coupe

What the hеll did I do to you?
Why can't you just keep it real
Keep the truth? Yuh

Keeping it the truth, yuh (Keeping it)
Keeping it truе, yuh (Keeping it keep)
Keeping it true, yuh (Keeping it true)
Keeping it true, yuh (yeah) huh, yuh, yuh
Keeping it true with me
(Keeping it keeping it)
Keeping it true with me (True)
Too many holes in my jeans

On some cash, what I'm running through
Bands, make that money move
Dance, make that honey groove
Pussy tastes like honeydew
With these racks, I see straight through you
(yeah)
You thought that shit was make believe
All this guap I got on me
It make these bitches want to see
(yeah, yeah)

Niggas flexing Gucci that they
Bought on Grailed (Heehee)
Same price for your Gucci
Pay my brother bail (O oh)
Pull up in a Batmobile
I feel like Christian Bale (Ooh, yeah)
I just poured the Wockhardt in the Ginger Ale
(yeah, yeah) got 30 texts 'bout money
Thought it was chain mail (Hey, yeah)
These bitches think I'm feeling them
I can't read braille (Hey, yeah)
Show me hifey, pussy taste like diced peach
(Mwah) diamonds white bleach
Diamonds made my Sprite pink (yeah)
I just made a chain and I ditched it (O oh)
Yuh, I just fucked her
Friend and went distant (Facts)
Yuh, Phantom and the Ghost, superstitious
(Big racks)
I fucked the most, too many hoes
Put 'em in Guinness (Heehee)

On some cash, what I'm running through
Bands, make that money move
Dance, make that honey groove
Pussy tastes like honeydew
With these racks I see straight through you
You thought that shit was make believe
All this guap I got on me
It make these bitches want to see

Dew dew
