		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
But there's just one thing (left a good job down in the city)
You see, we never ever do nothing
(Workin' for the man every night and day)
Nice, easy
We always do it nice and rough (why I never lost one minute of sleepin')
(I was worryin' 'bout the way that things might've been)
And we're gonna take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
(Big wheel keep on turnin')
But then we're gonna do the finish rough
(Proud Mary keep on burnin')
This is the way we do "Proud Mary"

And we're rollin' (ooh), rollin' (ooh)
Rollin' on the river
Listen to the story

Left a good job down in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
I was worryin' 'bout the way that things might've been

You know that big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin' (rollin'), rollin', yeah (rollin')
Rollin' on the river (rollin' on the river)

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
(You know I) pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

You know the big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin' (rollin'), rollin', yeah (rollin')
Rollin' on the river (rollin' on the river)
Say we're rollin' (rollin'), rollin', yeah (rollin')
Rollin' on the river (rollin' on the river)

I left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin' (turnin')
Proud Mary keep on burnin' (burnin')
Rollin', rollin'
Rollin' on the river
Say we're rollin', we're rollin'
Rollin' on the river

Yeah, we're up, do do do do do do do do do do do
Alright

Oh, I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin' (turnin')
Proud Mary keep on burnin' (burnin')
And we're rollin', took me rollin'
And we're rollin' on the river
I'll tell you we're rollin', rollin'
Rollin' on the river

We're up, do do do do do do do do do do do
Alright
Yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin' (turnin')
Proud Mary keep on burnin' (burnin')
And we're rollin', took me rollin'
And we're rollin' on the river
Tell me one more time
(Rollin') yeah, (rollin') alright
(Rollin' on the river) ooh yeah

We're up, do do do do do do do do do do do
Yeah
Alright
Uh-huh
Woo

(Rollin', rollin'), yeah
(Rollin' on the river)
Rollin', yeah, rollin'
We're rollin' on the river
Said we rollin', ooh, rollin', yeah
Rollin' on the river
I tell ya, we rollin', and we're rollin'
We're rollin' on the river

Yeah
Alright
Uh-huh
