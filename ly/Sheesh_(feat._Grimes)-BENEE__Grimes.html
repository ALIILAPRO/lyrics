		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me
You don't have to change, keep it high key
Everything you say is the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep
Acting like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, you're so sweet
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet

Everything you say is the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep
Acting like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
You don't have to change, keep it high key
Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me

Yeah, 'round in your BMW
Driving 'round in your BMW
By the looks, lots of girls want a piece of you
Mr. Nice Guy, it seems that I should want you
But, I'm stupid and I fall for other dudes
But, I'm stupid and I fall for other dudes
But, I'm stupid and I fall for other dudes

Everything you say is the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep
Acting like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
You don't have to change, keep it high key
Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me

Follow the rabbit, huh
Into the belly of the underworld
Here you stand, I don't know why
All or nothing, live or die
We ride east until dawn
To the heart of the song
I'm alive
May I have what I desire
And I shall be satisfied

Everything you say is the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep
Acting like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
You don't have to change, keep it high key
Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me

Get what I desire, and I get what I want
I get what I desire, and I get what I want
Get what I desire, and I get what I want
Get what I desire, and I get what I want
What I want
I get what I want
