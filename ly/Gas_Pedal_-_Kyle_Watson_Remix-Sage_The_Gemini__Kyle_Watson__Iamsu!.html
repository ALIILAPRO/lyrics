		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal, now
Speed up, gas pedal

Black money let them hoes say amen
I'm just tryna make it clear boy Ray-Bans
I'm a great man, woah say a friend
I play a hole every night DJ amen
Room full of boppers, tell them give me topper
Beat it beat it up no one hit the coppers
I'm S-A-G-E you would like to know
Fee-Fi fo-fum large me in yo throat
West-side baby do what you do
And you got tail, well that shit do
It's, pretty nigga mobbin' it's the way that it go
I be steppin' up in the club they make 'em drop to my shoe
And you mad cause I spoon, but I don't give a fork
Silverware a nigga out if he actin' a poor spork
You's like boy grab a girl and get a yank-in'
Got a booty like coupes I'm tryna make-it, woah

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal, now
Speed up, gas pedal

She a trick for a dolla bill
And her boyfriend a bitch call him Tyler Perry
Eugh, I'm in the black bat lookin' scary
On my way to the cake no bake Gary
Oops bakeries, never been no fake-amies
Lead her to the bathroom, she askin' where you takin' me
Uh, tell her slow down baby
I'm too turned up it's finna go down baby
When you hit the stage the people do a 180
When I hit the stage man the club wanna pay me
Uh, you niggaz so fugazzi got a white bitch with me call that hoe slim shady uh
Nigga 'su so crazy
Got two hoes with me make my old bitch hate me, uh
All about my payment, you say we gettin' money that's an understatement uh

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal, now
Speed up, gas pedal

Lil' mama got sex appeal
I make her sing if she wanna get a record deal
What the shit do, it's finna get real
She got a booty so big it's like a ferris wheel

Lil' mama got sex appeal
I make her sing if she wanna get a record deal
What the shit do, it's finna get real
She got a booty so big it's like a ferris wheel

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal, now
Speed up, gas pedal
