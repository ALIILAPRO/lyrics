		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, you stole my heart and changed it
Took all of my plans and rearranged 'em
Now, I finally know what amazing grace is
When I look into your eyes
Baby, I see my whole life

What ya say we put us down some roots
Find a house up on a hill
And travel 'round the world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Hold you close and keep the faith
Raise some kids with our last name
Well, come on, baby, what you say we do
I feel like growing old with you
Growing old with you

Every day I'll love you better
Than the day before
Watch them sunsets fading
From the front porch
We'll build this home together
Weather any storm
And as the years keep rolling on
You'll be right where I belong

What ya say we put us down some roots
Find a house up on a hill
Travel 'round the world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Hold you close and keep the faith
Raise some kids with our last name
Well, come on, baby, what you say we do
I feel like growing old with you
Growing old with you

What ya say we put us down some roots
Find a house up on a hill
Travel 'round this world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Maybe one day our babies go
And have some babies of their own
And you'll get all my time
'Til all my time is through
I feel like growing old with you
Growing old with you
I feel like growing old with you
