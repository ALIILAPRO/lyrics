		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Fuse, ayy
Yeah
It's a worldwide movement
Sigala-la, ayy
Sean-a-Paul
Bida bang, bang, bang
Let's go

If there's life in the east, that's where I will go
Born in the streets, I know where I'm from
If you're asking for me, you already know
(Turn up)
Where the vibe is, I call my home

The air that I breathe (ayy)
Is the same everywhere
So where's the party? (we on the street)
'Cause I'm gonna be there, ah
The air that we breathe
Is the same everywhere, ah

It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like (hey)
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like home (bida bang, bang, bang)
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home

Tell dem
We can't bother with the lame ting, tell dem
No, no, no, no
Tell dem
Turn up the bass well loud
And make the gyal dem go low, low
Tell dem
We can't bother with the waitin', tell dem
Go, go, go, go
Anywhere mi lay mi hat, ah deh so me ah call home
Well you feel this love escalating
Tell dem
Just make it grow
And you know we live our lives celebrating
Mad people ting, they should know
Well you know we view this life as a great ting
Just let Jah Jah love a glow
Any step, mi step, mi step

Wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home (Fuse tell dem again)
It feels like home
It feels like home (live it up 'til the end)
It feels like home
It feels like home (with me and my friends)
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like (hey)
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like
Home (hey)
It feels like
Home
It feels like
Home (hey)
Home, is here, yeah

I live a life of a Rollin' Stone (yeah)
Wherever I lay my hat's my home (yeah)
Tell me where you are and girl, I'm gone (yeah)
Meet me at LAX, won't be long (yeah)
I'll be right there you won't have to search (yeah)
Call us a Lyft, my Uber don't work (yeah)

Don't feel special 'cause I let you know (know, know)
I'm good everywhere, I go

Wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home (Fuse tell dem again)
It feels like home
It feels like home (live it up to the end)
It feels like home
It feels like home (with me and my friends)
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like
Home (turn up)
Home
It feels like
Home
It ain't where I live (home, is here)
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home
