		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind

You know you should so I guess you might as well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up wake up

All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind

You know you should so I guess you might as well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
(I said) well
Need a little time to wake up wake up
