		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How is it now have you moved on
And do you still think of me
When I'm gone
I think of you and I just wonder
Where you are
And what thoughts are racing through your mind

Who are you holding now
Oh I hope that you are happy now and
Someday I know I will be
I've been told there'll be another

(or so they say)
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears
And I'll face my fears
I've been told there'll be another

It's so simple to say I love you
But sometimes it's not enough
So I'll find my sunrise
At the end of these few words
Who are you holding now
oh I hope that you're happy now and
Someday I know I will be

I've been told there'll be another
(or so they say)
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears
And I'll face my fears
I've been told there'll be another
I've been told there'll be another
