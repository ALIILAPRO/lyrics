		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said you wanna move on
But baby I see us in the long run
Don't know what to do
My thoughts are confused around you
Baby I bloom when we're two
But you have me blue when I lay lonely
Can you feel me longing?
Give me something more
I'm with you when you're at your worst yeah
I see it when you need some loving
Ohh give me something more
Your word it just isn't enough
The way that you've hurt me, my trust is
Gone
Gone
Gone
Yeah
Baby I feel lucid
When you're around I feel like I'm loosing it
Tell me what is this love about?
I feel numb when you're out of sight
And I know that we've had our doubts
But can you hear me?
I can feel you drifting
Give me something more
I'm with you when you're at your worst yeah
I see it when you need some loving
Ohh give me something more
Your word it just isn't enough
The way that you've hurt me, my trust is
Gone
Give me something more
Gone
Oh
Give me something more
Oh yeah
Oh
