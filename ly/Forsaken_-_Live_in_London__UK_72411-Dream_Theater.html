		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream

Then rising suddenly, I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear (forsaken)

[Chorus:]
Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me

I waited faithfully for night to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me
Out of the night and mist I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson sting on her lips

I have to know your name
Where have I seen your face before?
My dear, why don't you be afraid?

[Chorus]

Take me far away
Close your eyes and hold your breath
Till the ends of the earth

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand
Forsaken
Fly away with me tonight
Awaken
Renew my life
Now you are mine
Give yourself up to me
