		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You owe me sleep
'Cause I've been on the phone with you 
For twenty-four hours of my day
Seoul to LA
Wish you'd stop calling me
'Cause you got me distracted by the
Cutest little things that you say
Am I stupid for falling?
'Cause you're a million miles away

Don't have wings but I'm flying
There's no perfect timing
To fall from the sky with no parachute
This could turn into something
So I'll climb the mountain
I'll do anything to get back to you, you

Life is but a dream, we got history (I just wanna)
Feel the chemistry, feel you next to me (you know that I)
Hate this distance
'Cause I'm just left here singing
Lonely harmony's broken melodies (ah)
Love drunk energy, I'm in ocean deep (ah)
Oh, I hate this distance and I hate singing

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I been trying to sleep
But when reality sinks in deep
I can't breathe like I'm stuck in a dream
Where my mind is awake
But my body's asleep
And I got memories ingrained in my mind
And I relieve 'em every night
You're not here when I'm grieving your touch
And the melody's clear but it's broken like us

공허해 난 너 없인 완전할 수 없지 (oh)
듣고 싶지 않은 소음일 뿐
닿지 못한 그 something 미완성의 우리
I'll do anything to get back to you, you

Life is but a dream, we got history (I just wanna)
Feel the chemistry, feel you next to me (you know that I)
Hate this distance
'Cause I'm just left here singing
Lonely harmony's, broken melodies (ah)
Love drunk energy, I'm in ocean deep (ah)
Oh, I hate this distance and I hate singing
Broken melodies

I don't have wings, but I'm flying
There's no perfect timing
This could turn into something
Let's turn it into something, yeah
Green light, I'm ready to go

달려갈게 지금 네게로 (지금 네게로)
힘껏 뛰어들어 초록빛으로 (oh, yeah)
I ain't scared no more (oh)
난 너에게로 dive in, yeah

Even when the skies are grey and
We don't see the light of day, I
Keep fighting 모두 뺏긴 채
종말 앞에 내게 쏟아지는 purple rain, ah
Don't need protection 
희망의 절벽 끝에선 네 미소 하나면 돼 (I will never die)
Guess I finally get back to you

Life is but a dream, we got history (I just wanna)
Feel the chemistry, feel you next to me (ooh, you know that I)
Hate this distance (hate this distance)
'Cause I'm just left here singing (oh, singing)
Lonely harmonies, broken melodies (oh)
Love-drunk energy, I'm in ocean deep (oh, yeah)
Oh, I hate this distance (hate this distance) and I hate singing
Broken melodies
