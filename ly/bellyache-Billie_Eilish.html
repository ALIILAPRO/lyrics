		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mind
Mind

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room 
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

Everything I do 
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared 
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
