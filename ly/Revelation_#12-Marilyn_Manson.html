		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I say it again
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I say it again

You will burn in the terminal fire pit
Just playing with matches and praying to ashes
Too stupid to call themselves evil
Too stupid to call themselves evil
So they call themselves heroes

Is it the Devil or us?
Is it the Devil or us?

We'll paint the town red
we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the children
We'll paint the town red
we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the children

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I say it again
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I say it again

Traded every traitor
This fucking game has no fucking players
Traded every traitors
This fucking game has no fucking players

You got something to say, now?
You got something to say, now?
Is it the Devil or us?
Is it the Devil or us?

We'll paint the town red
we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the children
We'll paint the town red
we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the children

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I say it again
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I say it again
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I say it again

You're welcome
You're welcome
You're welcome
You're fucking welcome
You're welcome
You're welcome
You're welcome
You're fucking welcome
