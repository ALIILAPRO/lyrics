		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, nothing much left to say
Cuts deep as if it was yesterday
I've been struggling on my own
'Cause your heart I called my home
Oh, oh, nothing much left to say

And now there's nothing else left to break

I'm down in the mud while you're moving on
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at
I don't wanna feel this anymore
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at

Oh, oh, find it so hard to take
Am I that easy to replace?
Got my back against the wall
You stood tall and watched me fall
Oh, oh, find it so hard to take

And now there's nothing else left to say
And now there's nothing else to break

I'm down in the mud while you're moving on
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at
I don't wanna feel this anymore
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at

I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at

I'm down in the mud while you're moving on

I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at
I don't wanna feel this anymore
I know I'd rather be you, I'd rather be you
Feeling nothing, nothing at
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
