		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my Ma and Pa
Not the way that I do love you
Well, Holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye
Girl, I never loved one like you
Man, oh, man, you're my best friend, I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie, chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La, la, la, la, take me home
Mother, I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park, through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, alleyways and pay phone calls
I been everywhere with you
We laugh until we think we'll die, barefoot on a summer night
Nothing new is sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run a-free, like it's only you and me
Geeze, you're something to see

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

Home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
