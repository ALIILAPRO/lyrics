		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ah
Mmm
Ah
Oh, ah

I see so much when I see you
A blessin', reflection, I just wanna be you (just wanna be you, yeah)
When I'm feelin' down, I talk to myself and my friends
I learn from mistakes, I'm fallin' in love with my sins (fallin' in love, yeah)
Perfect ain't the type of life I'm livin' and I never will
I'm flawed, but I try (try, try, yeah)
Fumble words and I'm really tryna find a better way
I hope you realize (hey)

Outta my cave, I come (come)
Pray for the day and run (run)
Man, I just met all my demons
I had a load of fun
Man, I just saw myself (saw myself)
I had to peace me up (me up)
My ego been callin' my phone
I hope it don't eat me up (yeah)

On the real, you know I got my vices, on the real (on the real)
Know I ain't always nice, but I'm always real (always real, yeah)
It's gon' take me some time to break off my pride
But I'm learnin' to show up (show up), learnin' to slow up (slow up)
Learnin' to say what I feel instead of a blow up
I'm tryna grow up
Ain't gonna flip it and act like you trippin', it's time that I own up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So I'm findin' any reason to detach
Guess I gotta get some healin' from the past
Life a ride and ain't nobody got a map (yeah)
I'm just tryna kick my feet up on the dash
Lookin' for the light, I need it bad, yeah (mm)

So outta my cave, I come (come)
Pray for the day and run (run)
Man, I just met all my demons
I had a load of fun
Man, I just saw myself (saw myself)
I had to peace me up (me up)
My ego been callin' my phone
I hope it don't eat me up 

Promise, I'm unfazed
No games, all gains, I'm changin'
I fall, but my wrongs ain't gon' make me
No games, all gains, I'm changin'
I'm changin' (changin')

So outta my cave, I come
Man, I just met all my demons
Man, I just saw myself
My ego been callin' my phone
I hope it don't eat me up
