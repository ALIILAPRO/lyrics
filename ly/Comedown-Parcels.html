		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, no, no, no, no, no, oh, when it all comes down
Ooh, when it falls you can find a way out
Oh, when it all hits the ground
Come down, come down, come down, come down

Ooh, when it's gone, you can cry
Oh, let it go and try
Ooh, when it all comes down
Come down, come down, come down, come down

No, no, no, no, no, no, oh, when it all comes down
Ooh, when it falls you can find a way out
Oh, when it all hits the ground
Come down, come down, come down, come down

Ooh, when it's gone, you can cry
Oh, let it go and try
Ooh, when it all comes down
Come down, come down, come down, come down

Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
