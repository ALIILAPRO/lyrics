		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could choose 
the things that I knew 
And all the things that I’d seen
I’d let the room fill with memories until 
The walls were staring at me 

The mystery of life 
Has just taken flight
I watch the walls closing in
So I swallow my pride and 
Take another bite 
I guess I’m dreaming again

I swear I’m not attached to living the past 
But I can’t get off my feet
You say we all go mad but I don’t believe that 
so you’ll prove it to me

If I could choose
Then I’d never lose 
I’d always take without giving 
I wrote down the truth 
In letters to you 
But I know you’ll never get them

If I were a mountain 
I’d stand my ground and
Maybe I’d never listen 
But if I were a mountain
I’d close my mouth and
Maybe I’d be forgiving

But I’m not 
I’m not 
No I’m not 
I’m not 

I’m not a mountain I can’t hold you on my own 
The mirror calls me so far and yet so close
There in the square 
My arms in the air 
Is it so bad to be alone? 
I can do it on my own 

(Instrumental interlude)

Is it really so bad? 
Is it really so bad?
I can do it on my own
