		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late night, you and I
Post-fight, it's my life
Let's roll, there's the door
I'm all for 4/4

I watch you walk away, it's just another day
Don't need you to stay, oh
I am not afraid, I know I'll be okay
There's nothin' you can say, oh

I just wanna dance alone, I ain't ever goin' home
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna dance alone, I just wanna lose my phone
I just wanna dance alone

I just wanna dance alone (forever, forever)
I just wanna dance alone (forever, forever)
I just wanna dance alone (forever, forever)
I just wanna dance alone (forever)

Won't stop, can't stop
No clock, another shot
Happy, so free
Look at me, finally

I watch you walk away, it's just another day
Don't need you to stay, no
I am not afraid, I know I'll be okay
There's nothing you can say, oh

I just wanna dance alone, I ain't ever goin' home
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna dance alone, I just wanna lose my phone
I just wanna dance alone (I just wanna dance)

I just wanna dance alone (forever, forever)
I just wanna dance alone (forever, ooh, forever)
I just wanna dance alone (forever, forever)
I just wanna dance alone (forever)

I just wanna dance alone, I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna dance alone (hey)
I just wanna dance alone, I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna dance alone

I just wanna dance alone (I just wanna dance alone)
I ain't ever goin' home (I just wanna dance alone)
I just wanna dance alone (I just wanna dance alone)

I just wanna dance alone (I just wanna dance alone)
I just wanna lose my phone (I just wanna dance alone)
I just wanna dance alone (I just wanna dance alone)
