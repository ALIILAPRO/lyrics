		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am be dangerous now
Not me hurt
When stairs fell down
Be pushed by you

Me hit head
Me nose broke
Soon you be dead
Soon you be dead

So strong my face is
You punch break fingers
Kick me you're limping
Stab me you're bleeding

I am be dangerous now
You throwing rock at me
Hit eye and it no hurt me
I'm strong

You're not
You're not

I'm making time for fighting
I'm clearing time for hitting
We'll meet and I will beat you
Our schedules permitting

I pick out fighting outfit
Don't want my pants too tight
Need clothes to breath to beat you
You'll be beaten down tonight

I'm so f**king tough
I'm so f**king tough
That's right

I'm so f**king tough
I'm so f**king tough
That's right

You're an ugly man
You're as dumb as sand
Your mom's fucking fat
Your mom blew a rat

You are a mistake
You have sex with cake
You think you're so tough
You're a living bluff

I will put you down
I will make you drown
I will make you bleed
I am filled with speed

I cannot feel pain
I might be insane
I am victory
I write history

Feel my fist
On your face
You hate this
I feel great

One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight

So strong my face is
You punch break fingers
Kick me you're limping
Stab me you're bleeding

I am be furious now
You say the bad word at me
You pull string and trip me
I fall down
You run
You run

I am making time for fighting
I think it's time to beat you
I think it's good decision
That I destroy and teach you

You put on very fast shoes
And try to run away
I'm very strong and last though
You're going down today

You're so fucking weak
I'm so fucking strong
That's right [Reepat: x 4]
