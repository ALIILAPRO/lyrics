		  Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that
Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that

Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that
Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Boom, boom, boom, boom

What's going on today? (Today)
We gotta break away (away)
We got a problem and (hey, hey, hey, hey)
I think it's going to make us go down (hey, hey, hey)

They think we're all the same (the same)
And always we're to blame (to blame)
For shit I think is lame (is lame)
It's time to stop the game (the game)
I think it's time to pay for everything you made me say

Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)
Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)

Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)
Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)

What's going on today? (Today)
Why must it be this way? (This way)
We're going nowhere (hey, hey, hey, hey)
And we're still knocking the need to bow down (hey, hey, hey, hey)

They think we're all the same (the same)
And always we're to blame (to blame)
For shit I think is lame (is lame)
It's time to stop the game (the game)
I think it's time to pay for everything you made me say

Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)
Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)

Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)
Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)

We are the ones breaking you down
We are the hope to drown out your sounds
All across the world you've been what you found
All across the world you're breaking you down

Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that shit
Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that shit

Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that shit
Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that shit
Fuck

Y'all want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that
Want a single, say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that

Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)
Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)

Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)
Y'all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)
Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that)
