		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bruh, I swear I don't got y'all on fuck shit, this shit so raw baby
Is that my, is that my voice?

Drippin' like a, (such a drip) pool (pool)
I don't fuck with school (I don't fuck with, school)
Baby gonna rule (baby gonna, rule)
She funny wit it, cool (brr)
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'ma hump on her bumps (bbno$)
Jack and Jill, up a hill, baby tryna get a mil' (bbno$)
Mary had a little lamb, I really do not fuck with Xans (bbno$)
She callin' me the muffin man, I surely like the muffin top

Slow (ayy), like molasses ('lasses)
I can't pick you (nope), it's either tits or some asses
Blue cover glasses (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt), please don't be so hassy
I'ma pull up on a thottie all the way from Kansas
Whoa, yeah I think need a teaser
If she be a pleaser
Baby needs a squeezer
Henny by the liter
She tryna bite my dick and you bitin' on my style
Is your name Sharkeisha?
Paint you like the Mona Lisa 'cause you is a fake (fake)
Yeah, the reason why I went to school, numbers on the pape' (pape')
And there several faster way to get the money, I don't skate (skate)
Ayy, your girly really 'bout the cake, she lookin' like an easy bake
Leave you covered up in a couple nerfs, whatchu say? (Whatchu say?)
Might just go an cop a Goyard purse, for my sake (for my sake)
Please don't tell me you gon' pipe her first, not okay (huh)
Money at the end I'm coming first, √Åndale (bbno$)

Drippin' like a, (such a drip) pool (pool)
I don't fuck with school (I don't fuck with, school)
Baby gonna rule (baby gonna, rule)
She funny wit it, cool (brr)
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'ma hump on her bumps (bbno$)
Jack and Jill, up a hill, baby tryna get a mil' (bbno$)
Mary had a little lamb, I really do not fuck with Xans (bbno$)
She callin' me the muffin man, I surely like the muffin top

Muffin top, muffle cops, I don't wanna stop (nope)
Got it on the lock, will this baby ever flop?
Dicing all these rappers up just like the slap chop (chop, chop)
Feel hella hard right behind my desktop, huh
Whoa, baddie why she praying up to me?
Ho ho, got a gift when you're on your knees
Oh no, sick and tired of doin' shit for free
Yo bro, I'ma avoid girls that let ya
Don't you like it when these diamonds look like respect?
Come a little closer sissy boy and inspect (skrrt skrrt)
Sip a little Henny that's a cause and effect
Bbno$ to this money, let me collect

Big bag, price tag, Gucci rag, okay
Don't brag, cocaine, red flag, no way
Big bag, price tag, Gucci rag, okay
Don't brag, cocaine, red flag, no way

Drippin' like a, (such a drip) pool (pool)
I don't fuck with school (I don't fuck with, school)
Baby gonna rule (baby gonna, rule)
She funny wit it, cool (brr)
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'ma hump on her bumps (bbno$)
Jack and Jill, up a hill, baby tryna get a mil' (bbno$)
Mary had a little lamb, I really do not fuck with Xans (bbno$)
She callin' me the muffin man, I surely like the muffin top

Uh, uh uh, uh-uh, uh
Bbno$
Dude, I'm so tired can we go home?
