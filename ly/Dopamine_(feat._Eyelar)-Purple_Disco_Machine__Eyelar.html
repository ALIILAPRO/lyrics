		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put my life on the line
It's the only way I'll ever feel alive
Kiss the rose, love is blind
I don't care about the thorns if you're my type, oh

You got me wide awake
When you keep living in my mind
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Start that beat again
I need you night and day
'Cause only you can get me high
Heartbeat, heartbeat

You make all the dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
The way you touch me, I'm loving the feeling
Of dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
Let it control me, I'm loving the feeling

That dopamine (yeah)
Start that beat again

Running wild, keep me sweet
'Cause I like it when you take control of me
When your love runs so deep
It's like sugar in my veins and I can't sleep, na na

You got me wide awake
When you keep living in my mind
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Start that beat again
I need you night and day
'Cause only you can get me high
Heartbeat, heartbeat

You make all the dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
The way you touch me, I'm loving the feeling
Of dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
Let it control me, I'm loving the feeling

That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine (yeah)
Start that beat again
Yeah
That dopamine
Start that beat again
Oh, yeah
That dopamine
Start that beat again

That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again

You make all the dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
The way you touch me, I'm loving the feeling
Of dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
Let it control me, I'm loving the feeling

That dopamine
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again

Start that beat again
Start that beat again
That dopamine
Start that beat again
Start that beat again
Start that beat again (yeah)
That dopamine
Start that beat again
