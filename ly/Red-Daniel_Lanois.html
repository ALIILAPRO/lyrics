		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm going to where the sun burns
And the heat stays in command
Come and lay by my side
Right here

To where the river turns to dust
And god is never rushed
Come and lay by my side
Right here

Red, I love you and the world

It seemed to make sense
When Brother Santo said
One more run be enough
Going to be enough

Money for everything
Silver toed boots and kerosene
Come and lay by my side
Right here

Red, I love you and the world

Well the buzzing, the stink
And the choking
I can't stay no more
Come and lay by my side
Right here

Red, I need you and the world

When I see you behind the glass
I forget that I'm in the cage
They bring me to Sunday mass
But it never wiped the rage

Red, I love you and the world

Seven months gone and seven years to go
Red, I can't stay no more
Come and lay by my side
Right here

Red, I love you and the world
Red, I need you and the world
