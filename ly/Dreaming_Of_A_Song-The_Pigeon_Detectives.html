		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This bird song,
Means something is going wrong,
I woke up with no shoes on,
And my face to the pavement again.

Yesterday,
How quickly night turned to day,
And I'm feeling the same old way,
Fear and loathing,

I'm dreaming of a song,
That I will never hear,
If Love is lost tonight,
By day it disappears,

I'm dreaming of a song,
That I will never hear,
If Love is lost tonight,
By day it disappears,

Turncoat,
Take your hands from around my throat,
I'll forgive but I l know you wont,
And that's why I'm leaving,

Because there's wine to be had,
Another party to make us feel sad,
Dining out on the times we had,
Feels exhausting,

I'm dreaming of a song,
That I will never hear,
If Love is lost tonight,
By day it disappears,

I'm dreaming of a song,
That I will never hear,
If Love is lost tonight,
By day it disappears,

I'm dreaming of a song,
That I will never hear,
If Love is lost tonight,
By day it disappears,

I'm dreaming of a song,
That I will never hear,
If Love is lost tonight,
By day it disappears,
