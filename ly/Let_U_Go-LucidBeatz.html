		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't understand
You said you'd never leave
You told me that you'd be there
But you lied again to me

You're always on my mind
And when it's late at night
I think of what you're doing
Do you think of me sometimes?

And when I'm feeling down
I lose all control
Emotions keep coming
And I'm trying to let you go

So if you wanna talk to me again
Don't try to act like we were always friends (lucid, am I dreaming?)

I don't understand
You said you'd never leave
You told me that you'd be there
But you lied again to me

You're always on my mind
And when it's late at night
I think of what you're doing
Do you think of me sometimes?

And when I'm feeling down
I lose all control
Emotions keep coming
And I'm trying to let you go

So if you wanna talk to me again
Don't try to act like we were always friends

I don't understand
You said you'd never leave
You told me that you'd be there
But you lied again to me

You're always on my mind
And when it's late at night
I think of what you're doing
Do you think of me sometimes?
