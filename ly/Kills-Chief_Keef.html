GBE baby
Bang bang
O'Block
Let's get it

I sell, I ship, I bag, I seal
I swag, that Gucci, that Louis, for real
Big knots in my Balmains, it is
The thing under this Louie, it kills
I sell (that dope)
I bag, I seal, I swag (that Gucci)
The Louis, for real, big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (that's up under)
This Louis, it kills, bang

So high up off this dope, I need a parachute
I'm in this Bentley coupe, it's filled with residue
I got my dawgs with me and now I let them loose
Tell the cops lies, 'cause I can't tell the truth
I'm rocking Louie sandals, my son got on Louie pampers
So many Gucci sandals, my house smell like Gucci candles
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me

I sell, I ship, I bag, I seal
I swag, that Gucci, that Louis, for real
Big knots in my Balmains, it is
The thing under this Louie, it kills
I sell (that dope)
I bag, I seal, I swag (that Gucci)
The Louis, for real, big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (that's up under)
This Louis, it kills, bang

I got a half a pound, it's rolled up in a joint
You can't hate me now, I'm in foreign cars
She used to hate me now, now she wanna fuck
It's only one way from down, bitch, I'm going up
I got the dope and it's in my Louis backpack
In a sportscar, racing to the racks
Keep on hating on me, you not doing that bad
I'm in this M truck, the plates say fast

I sell, I ship, I bag, I seal
I swag, that Gucci, that Louis, for real
Big knots in my Balmains, it is
The thing under this Louie, it kills
I sell (that dope)
I bag, I seal, I swag (that Gucci)
The Louis, for real, big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (that's up under)
This Louis, it kills, bang
