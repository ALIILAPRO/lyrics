		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you sailed away
Into a gray sky morning.
Now I'm here to stay,
Love can be so boring.
Nothing quite the same now,
I just say your name now.

But its not so bad,
You're only the best
I ever had.
You don't want me back.
You're just the best
I ever had.

So you stole my world,
Now I'm just a phony.
Remembering the girl
Leaves me down and lonely.
Sending in the weather
Make yourself feel better.

But it's not so bad,
You're only the best
I ever had.
You don't need me back.
You're just the best
I ever had.

And it may take some time
To patch me up inside.
But I can't take it
So I run away and hide.
And I may find in time
That you were always right.
You're always right.

So you sailed away,
Into a gray sky morning.
Now I'm here to stay,
Love can be so boring.
What was it you wanted?
Could it be you're haunted?

But its not so bad,
You're only the best
I ever had.
I don't want you back.
You're just the best
I ever had.

The best I ever had.
Best I ever had.
