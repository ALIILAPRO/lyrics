		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good
There was no promise made
The part you played
The chance you took

There are no boundaries set
The time and yet
You waste it still
So it slips through your hands
Like grains of sand
You watch it go
There's no time to be lost
You'll pay the cost
So get it right

There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good

There never was an answer
There an answer
Not without listening
Without seeing

There are no answers here
When you look out
You don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you played
The chance you took

There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good

There never was an answer
There an answer
Not without listening
Without seeing

There's no way out of here
When you come in
You're in for good
There are no answers here
When you look out
You don't see in

There was no promise made
The part you played
The chance you took

(There's no way out of here)
(When you come in)
(You're in for good)
(There's no way out of here)
(When you come in)
(You're in for good)
(There are no answers here)
(When you look out)
(You don't see in)
(There's no way out of here)
(When you come in)
(You're in for good)
