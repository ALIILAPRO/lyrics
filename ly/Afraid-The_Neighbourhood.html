		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place
I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place

Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paint junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?
All my friends always lie to me
I know they're thinking

You're too mean, I don't like you, fuck you anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but I won't fight you
You suck anyway
You make me wanna die, right when I

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might end up being me

Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons
And sell your soul, not your whole self, oh
If they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it
I can't even see if it's all there anymore, so

You're too mean, I don't like you, fuck you anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but I won't fight you
You suck anyway
You make me wanna die, right when I

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place 
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place 
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place 
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might end up being me

Being me can only mean
Feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me then I'll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious, gives me patience, calms me down
Lets me face this, let me sleep, and when I wake up
Let me be

When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid somebody else might end up being me
