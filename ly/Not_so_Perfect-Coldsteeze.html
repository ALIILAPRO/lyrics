		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not so perfect, baby, yeah
You're worth it come right here (It's)
I'm not so perfect, baby, yeah
You're worth it come right here

She say she wanna know Satan
Death to my enemies, I am not fakin', uh
I was so down in the dumps
These niggas so pussy
These niggas some chumps
I wanted you, but you wanted him
That's how it go, yeah, that's how it is
I'm fightin' these demons that's
All in my head
Crashin', I'm swervin', just tryna meet ends
Learn from your loss, it is what it is
Love at a cost, takin' a risk
I am in awe, lovin' your lips
Baby girl, I'm about to break down (Yuh)
Silly me, love is just a game now
I don't care, I just wanna lay down with you
With you, yeah

I'm not so perfect, baby, yeah
You're worth it come right here
I'm not so perfect, baby, yeah
You're worth it come right here

She say she wanna know Satan
Death to my enemies, I am not fakin', uh
I was so down in the dumps
These niggas so pussy
These niggas some chumps
I wanted you, but you wanted him
That's how it go, yeah, that's how it is
I'm fightin' these demons that's
All in my head
Crashin', I'm swervin', just tryna meet ends
Learn from your loss, it is what it is
Love at a cost, takin' a risk
I am in awe, lovin' your lips
Baby girl, I'm about to break down (Yuh)
Silly me, love is just a game now
I don't care, I just wanna lay down with you
With you, yeah

I'm not so perfect, baby, yeah
You're worth it come right here
I'm not so perfect, baby, yeah
You're worth it come right here
