		  (Mike WiLL Made-It)

Her pussy gettin' so good, it got me scared of her (huh?)
Is this a set up? 'Cause once you put that head on me (Lord)
This bitch so bad, she'll make you run your bread up (rrr)
Is this a set up? 'Cause once you wrap your legs 'round me
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me
Is this a set up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (yeah)
Is this a set up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?

I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me
Even if they never seen me, then they heard 'bout me (huh)
Rockstar status, talkin' Bruce Springsteen
Baby, fuck them other niggas, we the new dream team
Tell me how you never sucked the king but think that you the queen though?
Baby, why you sleepin' on me? This is not a dream, ho
I'm gettin' real impatient, I'm in a situation
Just wanna penetrate ya, fuck all them stipulations
Well, tell them come and get ya, 'cause ya gotta get out (go)
He best be in a hurry, 'cause you gotta leave now
I need that, hot, hot, mouth that make a nigga cool down
Got me searchin' through my phone, like, who tryna drool now? (Eugh)

Her pussy gettin' so good, it got me scared of her (huh?)
Is this a set up? 'Cause once you put that head on me (Lord)
This bitch so bad, she'll make you run your bread up (rrr)
Is this a set up? 'Cause once you wrap your legs 'round me
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me
Is this a set up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (yeah)
Is this a set up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't bring your bitch around me 'less you wanna lose her (damn)
I took me jewelry off and put it in a cooler (ice, ice)
I took my bae on a date, me and her and my shooters (yeah)
Then took her to the mall to have her weighin' Gucci, uh
For one night, I just landed in town (like, what up, though?)
Now I'm searchin' for the baddest bitch around (where she at?)
I'm weak for a juicy bitch with a attitude (damn)
Buy whatever she think she want, but fall in love they sold my dope
She's so bad, she can't do wrong, she's so thick, she hide her thong
Why you bring your friend around me? All that ass sittin' on her back
Pulled up on her in a Phantom, told her, "Come get in the back"
Her performance was so good, I feel like I owe her a stack

Her pussy gettin' so good, it got me scared of her (huh?)
Is this a set up? 'Cause once you put that head on me (Lord)
This bitch so bad, she'll make you run your bread up (rrr)
Is this a set up? 'Cause once you wrap your legs 'round me
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me
Is this a set up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (yeah)
Is this a set up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?
