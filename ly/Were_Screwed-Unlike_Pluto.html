		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, darling, are we an archetype?
A part to play, living by written lines
Downfalls, just so I can rise
Above it all, and learn a lesson of life

Mmmm, living inside of a lens
Mmmm, panning and fading, the colors degrading

After it all
We're gonna die
Don't wait for me after I'm gone
Cause in the end
Our purpose was to play a role
Packaged and sold
Oh, honey we're screwed

Oh darling, am I the only one
Eyes wide, while everyone else is shut
Dancing, choreographed
Stuck inside of 4 walls, how long can it last?

Mmmm, living inside of a lens
Mmmm, panning and fading, the colors degrading

After it all
We're gonna die
Don't wait for me after I'm gone
Cause in the end
Our purpose was to play a role
Packaged and sold
Oh, honey we're screwed

Earthquake
Falling from the sky
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die

After it all
We're gonna die
Don't wait for me after I'm gone
Cause in the end
Our purpose was to play a role
Packaged and sold
Oh, honey we're screwed
