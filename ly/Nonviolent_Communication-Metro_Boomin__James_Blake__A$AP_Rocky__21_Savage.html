		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You let me fall first, then you dream awake
I'd do anything to bring you to that other place
We speak so differently alone, love like friends, and we are low
Watch for constellations, soft as cloud formations
That will never leave, much as duty calls
If I'm in over my head, I'll swim Niagara Falls

Nonviolent communication, ah
Nonviolent communication

Uh, caught up in the whip, Mary Jane all up in my head
Upside down when I took the mask off
Pull the mask back down, time to ride out right now
You was mine then (you was mine then)
And you mine now (and you mine now)
Show me where they hide (show me where they hide)
And let me find out (let me find out)
Ball hog and I'm balled out
And we go all out, down to no doubt
Yeah, nose bleeds, sell the floors out
Caught up in the web, tell 'em, "Log out" (mwah)
Kisses, baby, I bossed up, go frisk us, baby
Won't you be my missus, baby?
Ven aqu√≠, I miss it, baby (uh)
Get lifted, I can tell you gifted, baby
Necklace like Saint Nicholas, baby
Wrap it up like Christmas, baby, uh

Nonviolent communication, ah
Nonviolent communication

(21, 21)
Yeah, takin' chances, takin' risks for you (on God)
Yeah, I climb a mountain just to get to you (on God, 21)
You hungry, that plate, I'ma split with you
You know I'm a dog, on command, if you tell me, I sit for you (21)
They don't understand our bond (nah)
Took a G5 to Milan (on God)
Treat me like a king, I'm a don (21)
Treat me like a king, I'm the one, baby (21)
Rolls-Royce, you will never see a Hyundai (never)
Suitcase go straight to the runway (21)
Big dawg, nah, I don't know TSA (on God)
Real money, you don't never need a sweepstake (straight up)
Big Birkin, I ain't never been a cheapskate (21)
I'm the type to vacation on a weekday (21)
Get American Express, no prepaid (21)
I'm avoidin' all the, "He say, she say" (on God)
I'm the one that had you grabbin' on the sheets, bae (yeah)
Tattoos, yeah, I'm straight up out of E-A (okay)
Lookin' in your eyes every time we speak, bae (21)
Won't play you, no, I'm not a DJ (21)

Nonviolent communication, ah
Nonviolent communication
Nonviolent communication, ah

I'm this dimension's one and only, Spider-Man
At least I was
