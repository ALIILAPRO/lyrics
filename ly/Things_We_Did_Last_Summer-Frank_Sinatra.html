		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The boat rides we would take, the moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite song
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

The midway and the fun, the kewpie dolls we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike, the rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

The leaves began to fade like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

I've tried so to forget, at times I do, and yet
The memory of you lingers like our song
The things we did last summer, I'll remember all winter long
