		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels like we're falling apart
Just a little unstable
We're both half asleep at the wheel
Yeah, we're struggling to save us

So we both get drunk and talk all night
Pour out our hearts, try to make it right
It's no fairy tale, no lullaby
But we get by, oh

'Cause the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright
And I know we're far from perfect
But at least we tried
Through every battle, every all time low
You always hold my hand and lead us home
I know the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright

Yeah, it will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright

I'm lying awake every night
Wondering if we will make it
It's hard to be strong when you're weak
And you're hiding your failures

So we both get drunk and talk all night
Pour out our hearts, try to make it right
It's no fairytale, no lullaby
But we get by, oh

'Cause the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright
And I know we're far from perfect
But at least we tried
Through every battle, every all time low
You always hold my hand and lead us home
I know the sun will shine tomorrow
It will be alright

Yeah, it will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
It will be alright
(Sun will shine tomorrow)
It will be alright
(Sun will shine tomorrow)
Yeah, it will be alright
It will be alright
