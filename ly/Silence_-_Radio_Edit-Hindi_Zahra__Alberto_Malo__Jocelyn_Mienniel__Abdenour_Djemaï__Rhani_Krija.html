		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silence in my heart
And my poor bones are tired
I was lost in the crowd
I was a fool before I knew you
There will be a time
When you will leave
For another one
Easy
How you can play
How you can say goodbye

But my heart started
And never wanna stop again
My heart started
And never wanna stop, ah huh baby
My heart started
And never wanna stop again
You are my homeland
And my sunlight

If you come to me
Sooner or later we will see
The beauty that you said
Will never, never be
Oh, it will grow from the dust 
And will turn to be the best

'Cause you know my heart started
And never wanna stop again
My heart started
And never wanna stop
Oh no no no
My heart started
And never wanna stop again
You are my homeland
And my sunlight

You came into my heart
And my world started changing
You are the reason why
I still wanna try
Love
In every places
In every secret parts
And in the silent move
You make over over me

You came to me that day
For a reason I couldn't say
I just know that from that time
My heart couldn't resist to your smile
Believe me
Or leave me
I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side
