		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can barely hear a sound, it's faded
All the words you used to say
Tried to keep me down, I'm elevated
No more rain on this parade

I went deep inside, where monsters hide
To free my mind, and come out alive
Tell me when you kicked me did you ever think that I would get up

Can you hear me now so loudly?
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Can you see me now so proudly?
Looking up at what I've become
Can you hear me now
Up above the crowd
Singing whoa whoa-oh
Can you hear me now so loudly
Can you hear me, can you hear me now?

Tried to find the light between your shadows, but it always seemed to fade
It took some time for me to learn to let go
But I grew stronger from the pain

I went deep inside, where monsters hide
To free my mind, and come out alive
Tell me when you kicked me did you ever think that I would get up

Can you hear me now so loudly?
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Can you see me now so proudly?
Looking up at what I've become
Can you hear me now
Up above the crowd
Singing whoa whoa-oh
Can you hear me now so loudly
Can you hear me, can you hear me now?

I went deep inside, where monsters hide
To free my mind, and come out alive
Tell me when you kicked me did you ever think that I would get up

Can you hear me now so loudly?
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Can you see me now so proudly?
Looking up at what I've become
Can you hear me now
Up above the crowd
Singing whoa whoa-oh
Can you hear me now so loudly
Can you hear me, can you hear me now?
Can you hear me, can you hear me now?
