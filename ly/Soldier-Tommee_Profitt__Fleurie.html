		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soldier, keep on marching on
Head down 'til the work is done
Waiting on that morning sun
Soldier, keep on marching on

Head in the dust, feet in the fire
Labor on that midnight wire
Listening for that angel choir
You got nowhere to run

You wanna take a drink of that promised land
You gotta wipe the dirt off of your hands
Careful son, you got dreamer's plans
But it gets hard to stand

Soldier, keep on marching on
Head down 'til the work is done
Waiting on that morning sun
Soldier, keep on marching on

Quiet now, you're gonna wake the beast
Hide your soul out of his reach
Shiver to that broken beat
Dark into the heat

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Soldier, keep on marching
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on marching on
Keep on, keep on marching
You're gonna rise someday
Soldier, keep on marching on
Keep on, keep on
Keep on marching on
Keep on, keep on marching

Soldier, keep on marching on
Head down 'til the work is done
Waiting for that morning sun
Soldier, keep on marching on
Soldier, keep on marching on
Soldier, keep on marching on
