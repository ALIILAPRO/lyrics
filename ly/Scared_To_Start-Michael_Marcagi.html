		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's wearing an old dress
Walkin' it out
Waiting for someone to turn her around
But she won't believe you
When you fall down on your knees

She fell asleep listening to my friends
Talking on and on about how the world ends
Then she wakes up and climbs in my front seat
And she said

Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you want to take my broken heart?
Are you scared to start?

Let's lay in the dead grass
Stare at the stars
Run away and live out of cars and bars
Let's just leave here
'Cause there's nothing left to see
And if that's wrong, let's make it right
And if you leave just give me one more night
'Cause there's no one
That you'll find that's quite like me
And she said

Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you want to take my broken heart?
Are you scared to start?

You don't need a paycheck, don't need the rent
You can take it all 'cause it's already spent
We can burn out
Just as long as we burn bright
And she said

Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you want to take my broken heart?
And will you ever heal from all these scars?
And did you have to take it all so far?

Are you scared to start?
