		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ruined every movie 
Every song 
Every item of clothing I own
You shot holes in my routine 
I've stayed home
In my bed for a couple of months 

You left me in the pouring rain oh
I don't think I'll ever be the same now
Stranded in the pouring rain oh
I'm a wreck and I don't get it (oh oh)

How did you let me go?
After all we've been through? 
I gave all of me to you 
You promised I was yours
Had me jumping through hoops 
Now you're gone oh won't you

Keep me in your heart
Keep me in your cold heart
Don't you ever let me out (oh)
Keep me in your mind
The broken man that you left behind

I haven't stepped one foot
Out my door
Every street sign reminds me of us
You straight up paralysed me 
Now I'm forced 
To pick up where our memories left off

Standing in the pouring rain oh
I don't think I'll ever be the same now
Since you left me in the pouring rain oh
I'm a wreck and I don't get it (oh oh)

How did you let me go?
After all we've been through? 
I gave all of me to you 
You told me I was yours
Had me jumping through hoops 
Now you're gone oh won't you

Keep me in your heart
Keep me in your cold heart
Don't you ever let me out (oh)
Keep me in your mind
The broken man that you left behind

Keep me in your heart
Keep me in your cold heart
Don't you ever let me out (oh)
Keep me in your mind
The broken man that you left behind
