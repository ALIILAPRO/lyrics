		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a lucky man who'll take you faraway
Faraway, so very very faraway
He will come some day
To another land he'll take you faraway
Faraway, so very very faraway
This will come they say

Nobody knows, who will share
All your love pure and fair
But in your eyes I can see
That someone will be me

Who will catch your heart my lovely
Who can say, who can say
From tomorrow you will stay
More than just a day

To another land he'll take you faraway
Faraway, so very very faraway
Love will show the way

Nobody knows, who will share
All your love pure and fair
But in your eyes I can see
That someone will be me

Nobody knows who will share all your love
But in your eyes that someone will be me
Nobody knows who will share
All your love pure and fair
But in your eyes I can see
That someone will be me
Nobody knows who will share all your love
