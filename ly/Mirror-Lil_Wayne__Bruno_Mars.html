		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, with everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it (woo)

Look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You lookin' at me but I'm lookin' through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the

Mirror on the wall (woo), here we are again (yeah)
Through my rise and fall (uh)
You've been my only friend (yeah)
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again?

Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pain
I see the scars that remain
I see you Wayne, I'm lookin' at the

Mirror on the wall, here we are again (yeah)
Through my rise and fall (uh-huh)
You've been my only friend (my only friend)
You told me that they can understand the man I am (they can understand)
So why are we here talkin' to each other again (misunderstood)

Lookin' at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fuckin' dad
Light it up, that's smoke at mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my momma smile that's a blessin'
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the

Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (take them to mars man)
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
Uh

Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
Mirror on the wall
Ayy BP, looks like I did take 'em to mars this time

So why are we talkin' to each other again?
