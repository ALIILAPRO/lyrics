		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dim the lights, let me tell you 'bout a story
(I gave all of myself to someone turns out
They were selfish and we went out with a bang)

Terrified, I made a promise to myself that
(I'd never let somebody hold me down
And choke me out, and walk all over me again)

I switched my energy, got no sympathy
You should beware, you should be scared of me

I got a chip on my shoulder
Break you down and puck you over baby
Red, red rover

Nah, it ain't fun if I ain't sinning
I'm not like those other women no
I don't gotta be the hero, don't you know
Don't you know that I'm the villain

Listen close, every bad guy's got their reason
Turned me to a criminal all cynical
But I don't want it any other way

Queue the smoke
It's so much better on the darker side
'Cause I don't get hurt no more I got

Cutthroat energy, got no sympathy
You should beware, you should be scared of me

I got a chip on my shoulder
Break you down and puck you over baby
Red, red rover

Nah, it ain't fun if I ain't sinning
I'm not like those other women no
I don't gotta be the hero, don't you know
Don't you know that I'm the villain

Lalalalalala lalalalalalala
Lalalalalala lalalalalalala
Lalalalalala lalalalalalala

I don't gotta be the hero, don't you know
Don't you know that I'm the villain
