		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cry, cry
You tell me stories that I wish were true.
But I know better than believe in you.
I keep on cryin', I keep on cryin'
You talk in circles and you laugh at sin.
I think it's over then it starts again.
I keep on cryin', I keep on cryin.

You say that you love me, that you'd never leave me cryin'!
I keep on cryin'. Cry, cry,
Oh mama save my soul, say you won't hurt me no more.
I keep on cryin', I keep on cryin.

You say that you need me, that you'd never leave me cryin'!
I keep on cryin'. Cry, cry, you make it easy to cry.
Oh mama save my soul, oh mama save my soul.
Keep on cryin', keep on cryin', keep on cryin', cry
