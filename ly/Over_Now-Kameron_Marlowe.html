		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night might as well have been an all-out war
Girl, I don't wanna fight like that no more
Let's clean the state, instead of drag this out
I'm sorry babe, let's just start over now

I don't give a damn who's wrong or right
Nothing hurts me more than to see you cry
Let's put it all in the past, it ain't worth fighting about
Instead of looking back, let's just start over now

It is what it is and it ain't what it was
And this ain't me saying let's get back to us
This is loving you enough to tell you goodbye
'Cause it's all we got left that we ain't yet tried
So let's start over now
Yeah, let's start over now

I still ain't changed my mind on meant to be
If time alone is what it takes to bring you back to me
Give me one more kiss before the sun goes down
Let's get it over with, let's just start over now

It is what it is and it ain't what it was
And this ain't me saying let's get back to us
This is loving you enough to tell you goodbye
'Cause it's all we got left that we ain't yet tried
So let's start over now
Yeah, let's start over now

First kiss, getting high, how it felt to fall
Lighting up your eyes, hearing your smile when I call
If letting you go will bring you back around
Instead of later down the road
Let's just start over now, yeah
Let's just start over now

Yeah, it is what it is and it ain't what it was
And this ain't me saying let's get back to us
This is loving you enough to tell you goodbye
'Cause it's all we got left that we ain't yet tried
So let's start over now
Yeah, let's start over now
Let's just start over now (let's just start over now)

Let's just start over now (let's just start over now)
Let's just start over now
