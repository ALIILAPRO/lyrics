		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you
And I'm tired of all your friends
Listenin' at your door
But I want what's better for you
So long, my friend
And adversary
Oh, but I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's singin' the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?
And they sacrifice their lives
And they're lyin' about those odds
And they said it a billion times
And they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you
Well, I'm tired of all your friends
Knockin' down your door
Get up in the morning, yelling no more
So long, my friend
And adversary
Oh, I'll be waitin' for you
