		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was looking outside
When she caught my eye
A pretty thing moving things
In the house right next to mine
Wonder what it's like
To be next to you
Oh, are you busy tonight?
Can I give you a hand with the move?

Wonder if I'm her type
Know that it's her first night
Wanna play it cool but I
Can't wait too long
Crop top with your green eyes
What's under those Levi's?
We ain't gotta sleep tonight
If that's what you want

Ooh I think that I
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the girl next door
Never been so in love with a girl like this before
She's got no idea how I'm really feeling

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the girl next door
With the girl next door
With the girl next door

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the girl next door
With the girl next door (next door)
With the girl next door (next door)

Oh, I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love
With the girl next door

I was just outside
When I saw this guy
6'3 white tee with the Nikes
Ooh he's just my type
Boy won't you just come on over
Both of your hands on my shoulders
Put on the TV
Act like we watching
Nobody's watching
You can come closer
Skip all the talking (yeah)

Ayy, I can see you staring through the window (window)
We should go ahead and skip the intro (skip the intro)
We can start it slow and see where things go (see where things go)
I might be going crazy 'cause I think I

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the boy next door
Never been so in love with a boy like this before
He's got no idea how I'm really feeling

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the boy next door
With the boy next door
With the boy next door

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the boy next door
With the boy next door (next door)
With the boy next door (next door)

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the boy next door

I can see you staring through the window
Can we go ahead and skip the intro?
Cut the tension with a knife
Do you wanna take a bite?
Take it slow and see where things go

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the girl next door
Boy next door
With the girl next door

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the boy next door (baby)
With the girl next door
With the boy next door (next door)

Oh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
With the girl next door
