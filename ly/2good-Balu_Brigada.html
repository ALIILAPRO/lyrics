		  Oh, darling, do you even like how I operate or
Do you just hang around 'cause it's more convenient? Yeah
I'm only asking because it's kinda late right now and
If it's not obvious I, I drank a couple down

I'm always questioning all the motivations
And I know it's not productive
But I just hate the thought that you would love me out of habit when you're

You're too fuckin' good to me (too fuckin' good to me)
You're too fuckin' good to be true (too fuckin' good to be true)

I kinda can't believe that, that you're not sick of me yet
I dig these holes and I can't make it back out of them, oh
Remember when I was sick, could have got rid of me then
Instead you hung around until I found my feet again

It's so nostalgic, yeah, when I think about it
And I know it sounds dramatic, yeah
But only you could ever love me at my lowest because

You're too fuckin' good to me (too fuckin' good to me)
You're too fuckin' good to be true (too fuckin' good to be true)

I over-analyze and complicate my situation
For someone who writes a lot, I'm not so good at communicating
I suck at metaphors, so I can't find the double meaning
I guess it's not that hard, so I'll just go ahead and say it

You're too fuckin' good to me
You're too fuckin' good to be true

You're too fuckin' good to me (too fuckin' good to me)
You're too fuckin' good to be true (too fuckin' good to be true)

(I over-analyze and complicate my situation)
(For someone who writes a lot, I'm not so good at communicating)
(I suck at metaphors, so I can't find the double meaning)
(I guess it's not that hard, so I'll just go ahead and say it)
