		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fallen angel, where'd you put your halo?
Gave you trust, but you dug me a grave
Paradise was only an illusion
I was just a victim in this game

The pinnacle of criminal
Subliminal (ah-ah)
You played the part
It fell apart
Doomed from the start (ah-ah)

'Cause you took my heart from a graceland
You left me for dead, and I gave up on trust
You kindled the flame now it's wasteland
Whoa, wasteland
Na nana na, nananana na na
Na nana na, nananana na (oh, yeah)
Na nana na, nananana na na
Whoa, wasteland

Once upon a time I lost it all (ah-ah)
Then I rose above and I stood tall (ah-ah)
Did everything that I could've done
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough

The pinnacle (ah-ah) of criminal (ah-ah)
Subliminal, ah (ah)
You played the part (ah-ah)
It fell apart (apart)
Doomed from the start (ah)

'Cause you took my heart from a graceland
You left me for dead, and I gave up on trust
You kindled the flame now it's wasteland
Whoa, wasteland (whoa)
Na nana na, nananana na na (yeah, yeah)
Na nana na, nananana na (yeah, yeah, oh, yeah)
Na nana na, nananana na na (yeah, yeah)
Whoa, wasteland (whoa)

The truth to your lies (lies)
They will rise from the smoke and
One day you'll reap what you sow
You'll reap what you sow
But I can't pretend (pretend)
That I'm not scared of trusting in someone
And hurting again
Don't hurt me again
Again and again and again

'Cause you took my heart from a graceland
You left me for dead, and I gave up on trust (gave up on trust)
You kindled the flame now it's wasteland
Whoa, wasteland
You wasted it all, it's a desert
And I see your name and it's painted in red
'Cause you took my trust and you left a
Whoa, wasteland
Na nana na, nananana na na (na-na, na-na)
Na nana na, nananana na (na-na, na-na, na-na)
Na nana na, nananana na na (na-na, na-na)
Whoa, wasteland
