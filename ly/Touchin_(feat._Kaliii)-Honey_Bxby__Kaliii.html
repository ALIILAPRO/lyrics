		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Maestro while you listen to them bass drops)

Takin' a few shots (uh)
Makin' me feel hot, oh yeah
Step up, show me what you want, oh
Something 'bout you got me in a trance, baby
We said no commitment
Whatever you wanna do
I can show you a thing or two, ayy

Baby, yes, I know you don't belong to me
But when you come around, makin' my body speak
When you touchin', touchin', touchin' on me
When you touchin', touchin', touchin' on me
Baby, yes, I know you don't belong to me
But when you come around, makin' my body speak, yeah
Touchin', touchin', touchin' on me
When you touchin', touchin', touchin' on me

One night of love, love (touchin' on me)
One night of love, love

Kaliii
First thing first, I, Kaliii (yeah)
Tricks all the niggas
I could never want him if you fuckin' with him (what?)
He know how to step if I'm runnin' with him (on God)
Hate that I'm his first, he ain't never had a money-getter
Oh, how I hate a reimbursed-ass nigga (uh)
He'll give it back if you pay first-ass nigga
Damn, don't them be the worst type niggas?
Rap niggas tryna flirt for a verse-ass nigga (ha)
Touchin', touchin', touch up my bank account (crazy)
Where the funds at? That's all a bitch think about (on God)
A nigga that's gon' keep shit a hundred, that's a good amount (I need that)
Give me that lettuce and that cheese and I'm in and out
He off that honey, now he lastin' (yeah, yeah)
I been wack dick fastin' (facts)
He a minute-man
I hate that for him with a passion (I do)
It's a lotta ass if you askin', I hope you take action

Baby, yes, I know you don't belong to me
But when you come around, makin' my body speak
When you touchin', touchin', touchin' on me
When you touchin', touchin', touchin' on me (touchin' on me)
Baby, yes, I know you don't belong to me
But when you come around, makin' my body speak, yeah
Touchin', touchin', touchin' on me
When you touchin', touchin', touchin' on me (touchin' on me)

One night of love, love (touchin' on me)
One night of love, love

One night, baby, one night, baby
One night, baby, one night, baby
One night, baby, one night, baby
One night, baby, oh, yeah
Ohh, yeah, no, no
Ohh, yeah
Ohh, da-da-da, da
Da-da-da-da-da, ooh-ooh
Da-da-da-da-da, ooh-ooh
Da-da-da-da-da, ooh, no
Da-da-da-da-da, mh-mh, mhm
