		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no on else can

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me lookin' so crazy right now your touch's
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy your love

When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" Look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
Yeah, but I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me lookin' so crazy right now your touch's
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy your love

I'm not gonna tell you twice, so listen
Got me looking so crazy, my baby I am not myself lately
I am foolish and I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love got the best, the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me strung and I don't care how sees
'Cause baby you got me so crazy
I am crazy in love with you, I cannot control myself so

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me lookin' so crazy right now your touch's
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy your love
