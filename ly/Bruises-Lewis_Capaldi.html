		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been takin'
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding onto hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, I need you by my side

There must be somethin' in the water
'Cause every day, it's gettin' colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from goin' under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be somethin' in the tide

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, I need you by my side

There must be somethin' in the water
'Cause every day, it's gettin' colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from goin' under

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

It's your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
And I'm tired of bein' so exhausted
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Even though I'm nothin' to you now
Even though I'm nothin' to you now

There must be somethin' in the water
'Cause every day, it's gettin' colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from goin' under
There must be somethin' in the water
'Cause every day, it's gettin' colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from goin' under
