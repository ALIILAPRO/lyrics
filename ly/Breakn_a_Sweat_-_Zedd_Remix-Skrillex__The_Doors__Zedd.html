		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright this is the breakdown
I'm breakin' a sweat
It's aright
I'm breakin' a sweat
I said it's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
It's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
Come on baby light my fire

I'm breakin' a sweat
It's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
I said it's alright
Breakin' a sweat
It's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
Woo, that's good
That's good
That's good
Come on baby light my fire
That's good
That's good
Robby Krieger

That's kick ass
That's good
That's good
Come on baby light my fire
That's good
That's good

The new generation's music will be 
It will have a synthesis of those two elements
And some third thing that will be in 
Maybe it will be, it might rely heavily on
Electronics, tapes, I can kind of envision maybe
One person with a lot of machines
Tapes, and electronics set up
Singing or speaking and using machines

I'm breakin' a sweat
It's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
I said it's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
It's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
Come on baby light my fire
I'm breakin' a sweat
It's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
I said it's alright
Breakin' a sweat
It's alright
I'm breakin' a sweat
OK play that beat again
That's good
That's good
Come on baby light my fire
That's good
That's good
Robby Krieger

Woo, woo, oh yeah

Woo, that's good, that's alright
