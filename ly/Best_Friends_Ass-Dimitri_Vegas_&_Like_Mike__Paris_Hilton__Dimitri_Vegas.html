		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That bouncer was so hot
But, honestly, that's not an excuse to be fucking rude
Literally
"What promoter are you with?"
As if I even need a fucking promoter to get into this club
No, like, literally, you don't deserve that
Ugh, why isn't my phone charging? Do you need to pee?
Yeah, I have to pee
Alright, let's go

Walk in VIP
Don't need no drink tickets, buddy
I got money, milk and honey
All my bitches actin' funny
Like, uh, they poppin' bottles like, uh
They on my body like, uh
They got the tab and they call me bad

But all I see is fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass

Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu-fuckboys, fucking rude
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–
Alright, let's go

Emptyin' they pockets like it's gonna make moves
They say, "Ooh, I like your shoes
Oh you fuck with Jimmy Choo?"
Uh, they poppin' bottles like, uh
They on my body like, uh
They got the tab and they call me bad

But all I see is fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass

Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu-fuckboys, fucking rude
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–
Fu-fu–

Should I have another one?
Yeah, you deserve it
We woke up like before noon every day this week
#Girlsonthegrind
Uh, I love you, do you have a key?
No, just do it off my nail
Is anyone in there?
Alright, let's go

Lights on, gotta leave here
Now they clearin' out the room
I don't care, let's get some food
Fuck that, we're goin' to the moon
Like, uh, we poppin', sippin' like, uh
And now we trippin' like fuck
I feel super, caught a Uber
But it turns out he's a fuckboy

So I told him step up on the gas
'Cause I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass

Fu-fu–
Should I go home with the broker dude or the chef guy?
The chef
Ty Dolla makes me kinda horny
No, do the chef
He just followed me on Instagram, that's kinda cute
Aw, you think he'll make you breakfast?
Delete that off your story, you can see me in the background
No, no, you look so cute
What are you looking at?
