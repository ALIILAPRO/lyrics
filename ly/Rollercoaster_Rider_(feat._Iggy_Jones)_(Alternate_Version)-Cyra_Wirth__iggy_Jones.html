		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder 'bout the ways that i go about my life
It feels like a silly sine wave right between my eyes
Some days I wanna smile, some days I wanna die
I really wondered if I'd make it past 25, yeah
Welcome to the carnival, lets go for a ride
All the people 'round the town really like the pretty lights
But when they get inside its not quite the same sight
It'll have you throwin' up by the end of the night, yeah
Hands to the sky, feeling like a paraglider
Falling with no parachute, skydiver
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Hands to the sky, feeling like a paraglider
Falling with no parachute, skydiver
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Hands up! Everybody scream
Hold on to your hats, yeah, it can be a dream
We're right at the top, yeah watch the sun gleam
If you make it to the end I can buy ice cream
You got a taste, now you know that you like it
Gotta make sure that you're tall enough to ride it
Catch a loop de loop, get some vomit on your eyelids
Wipe it all off at the bottom of the crisis
Hands to the sky, feeling like a paraglider
Falling with no parachute, skydiver
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Hands to the sky, feeling like a paraglider
Falling with no parachute, skydiver
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
You're not the first and you won't be the last
So don't feel too special when the good times pass
You can have a good time, search the sky for a friend
Or you can be a sad girl with torn tickets at the end
You're not the first and you won't be the last
So don't feel too special when the good times pass
You can have a good time, search the sky for a friend
Or you can be a sad girl with torn tickets at the end
Hands to the sky, feeling like a paraglider
Falling with no parachute, skydiver
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Hands to the sky, feeling like a paraglider
Falling with no parachute, skydiver
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
Up and down like a roller coaster rider
