		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was nineteen in a white dress
When you told me I'm your princess
So I played right in to your fantasy
Was your good girl, so I'd sit tight
And if I don't speak, then we can't fight
Looked in the mirror, now I can't believe

I forgot I was a bad bitch, tragic
Breaking all the rules 'cause they were only habits
Cinderella's dead now, casket
You thought the shoe fit but I
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)

I forgot I was a bad bitch
Now I'm blowing bubbles in my bath tub
After six hours in the night club
Got my feet up, put the TV on
Probably end up on a rooftop
With some new girls and our shoes off
Might black out and text my mom (hello)

I forgot I was a bad bitch, tragic
Breaking all the rules 'cause they were only habits
Cinderella's dead now, casket
You thought the shoe fit, but I
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)

I forgot I was a bad bitch, tragic
Breaking all the rules 'cause they were only habits
Cinderella's dead now, casket
You thought the shoe fit, but I

I forgot I was a bad bitch
(Forgot I was a bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch)
I forgot I was a bad bitch
(Forgot I was a bad bitch)
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
