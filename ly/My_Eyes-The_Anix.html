		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I missed you
Come back
I would take you home

Can’t excuse
I’m torn
Exhale and blow me away

They’ll break through the walls
To keep you away from me
They’ll cut through the glass
Contagious insanity

Do you feel what’s coming down
Let me know
Take the longest way back down
That you know
Standing on the outside with you
Never know what knocks you down
Stand your ground

I’m still new
Teach me
Show me your machine

Inside you
Watch me
Now we’re both alive

They’ll break through the walls
To keep you away from me
They’ll cut through the glass
Contagious insanity

Do you feel what’s coming down
Let me know
Take the longest way back down
That you know
Standing on the outside with you, now
Never know what knocks you down
Stand your ground

You’ve seen my eyes
And there’s nothing left inside
Don’t act surprised
You fed me cyanide

You’ve seen my eyes
And there’s nothing left inside
Don’t act surprised
You fed me cyanide

I won’t cry for you
I won’t cry for you

You’ve seen my eyes
Have you seen my eyes?

You’ve seen my eyes
You’ve seen my eyes
