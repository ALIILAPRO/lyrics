		<p>
		  Yo Ease let's do this

Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors

I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as a deathpack the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of L.A. will never die, just multiply

Colors
Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors

Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors

You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in

My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honor, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall

Tell me what have you left me, what have I got
Last night in cold blood a young brother got shot
My home got jacked, my mother's on crack
My sister can't work 'cause her arms show tracks

Madness, insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they're understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my sect, guess my religion

Colors
Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, 

Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors

My pants are saggin', braided hair
Suckers stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware

But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my set, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homocide's my favorite venge

Colors
Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors

So I'll just walk like a giant police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gangs my family its all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph

You don't like it, so you know where you can go
'Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psychoanalyze tried diagnose me why
It was a your brother the brutally died

But it was mine, so let me define
My territory don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy
'Cause that shit don't phase me

If you ran like a punk
It wouldn't amaze me
'Cause my colors death
Though we all want peace
But our war won't end,
Til all wars cease

Colors
Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors

Colors
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, 
Colors,
Colors,
Colors,
Colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors, 
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors, colors,
Colors, colors
