		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pussy-ass nigga, you ain't know that shit (uh)
Back of the club with a fat-ass bitch (ayy)
I'ma call your Uber when I call at night
She gon' count the dough when a nigga outside
Call me up an Uber, I ain't leavin' for shit
Call me in the mornin' when you needin' some dick
Call me in the nighttime when you needin' some dick
Call me anytime (anyday) when you needin' the dick (ayy)

I said, "Alright, bae," you said, "Alright, bae"
Pussy tight, bae, put that shit inside, bae
I love the kinks, bitch, panties to the side, bae
I gotta sneak 'cause your nigga do not like me
Hey ma, I need some patience
I give you paystub, you get these lace fronts
Ayy, I don't need your little implications
Oh, you the jealous one? I'm on vacation
You want to treasure me, I want the better me
You want the take you out to eat, show some effort me
Ayy, step out then, 'cause it's been a cool minute
It's some niggas goin' stupid in here, I must admit it
Got my eye on one and many, she look like a flight attendant
I know it's a few ball players that been hit it
You gotta come see me first, you know you in my city
Sin City, headed East until you met me

Pussy-ass nigga, you ain't know that shit (uh)
Back of the club with a fat-ass bitch (ayy)
I'ma call your Uber when I call at night
She gon' count the dough when a nigga outside
Call me up an Uber, I ain't leavin' for shit
Call me in the mornin' when you needin' some dick
Call me in the nighttime when you needin' some dick
Call me anytime (anyday) when you needin' the dick (ayy)

Ayy, spent a lot on your hair
Spent a lot just to take you on a trip and keep it player
Put my soul in these condoms, spent time, lil' bitch
Laid up at the crib on some Seinfeld shit
We overdue for some fuckin', huh?
We overdue for some suckin', huh?
We overdue, we overdue, we overdue
We overdue, we overdue, bitch, huh?

I need hands in the air (air), hand up in the air (air)
If I lose my hope (ooh), shit just won't be fair (fair)
I spent all night there (there), it cannot be fair (oh, oh)
If I can't see where you're goin', I'll wait all night

Pussy-ass nigga, you ain't know that shit (uh)
Back of the club with a fat-ass bitch (ayy)
I'ma call your Uber when I call at night
She gon' count the dough when a nigga outside
Call me up an Uber, I ain't leavin' for shit
Call me in the mornin' when you needin' some dick
Call me in the nighttime when you needin' some dick
Call me anytime (anyday) when you needin' the dick (ayy)
