		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With your big eyes
And your big lies

With your big eyes
And your big lies

I saw you creeping round the garden
What are you hiding?

I beg your pardon,
Don't tell me nothing

I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman

You were my knight and
Shining companion

To my surprise, my love's demise
Was his own greed and lullabies

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned

You paced around like you'd been waiting,
Waiting for something
Your world was burning
And I stood watching

As I looked down
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said good-bye

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me, was I wrong
To have trusted you?
Did I see what I want,
What wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on
Like a little fool?

It's amazing what
Women in love will do

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
