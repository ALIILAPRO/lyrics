		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Keep your hands off my man

He told your ass not once but twice
You should have took his advice
And left the man alone
You still drive by here every night
'Cause you're not wrapped too tight
When he left your mind was blown

You had your chance
And you lost a good man
I know it's sad
Thinkin' 'bout what you had

If you were smart
You'd keep that ass off my block
Next time you see me
I won't be a lady, no, no

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Keep your hands off my man

You bitched at him all night and all day
And constantly complained
Till you drove the man away
Always sayin' somethin', said he wasn't good for
Nothin'
So tell me why the hell you stalking
You're dismissed now get to walking

You had your chance
And you lost a good man 
I know, I know it's sad
Thinkin' 'bout what you had

If you were smart
You'd keep that ass off my block
Next time you see me
I won't be a lady, no, no

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Keep your hands off my man

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Keep your hands off my man

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Keep your hands off my man
