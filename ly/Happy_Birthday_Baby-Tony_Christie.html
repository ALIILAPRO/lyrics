		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a special day for everyone that comes but once a year and for you my love that day of days is here.

So have a happy birthday baby may all your dreams come true, the way mine have with you, this special day I'd like to say I wish you every happiness, I hope your feelin fine, now you have a real good time and I wish you happy birthday baby mine.

I don't know what I'd do if ever I lost you, I'd have no today no tomorrow. You've made a simple joe more happy than you'd know, and today I wanna say I love you so. 

So have a happy birthday baby may all your dreams come true, the way mine have with you, this special day I'd like to say I wish you every happiness, I hope your feelin fine, now you have a real good time and I wish you happy birthday baby mine.

Wear your red dress tonight and we'll dine by candlelight while the band plays those great golden oldies. I'll take you to a show and when its time to go I'll tell the cab to drive us home real slow.

So have a happy birthday baby may all your dreams come true, the way mine have with you, this special day I'd like to say I wish you every happiness, I hope your feelin fine, now you have a real good time and I wish you happy birthday baby mine.

happy birthday baby, I wish you happy birthday baby mine(repeat till end)
