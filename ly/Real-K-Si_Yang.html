		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me to my face you love me
Knife in my back, you're watching me bleed
I would've gave you everything
But fuck your life, I'm way too real
This can't be real, real, real
This can't be real
This can't be real, real, real
This can't be

Your heart don't beat
Your eyes don't see (Eyes don't see)
Keep searching, won't find nothing (Find nothing, no)
I should've lost faith in you yesterday
Or I should've done less for you anyways
I just want you to know, I don't need you
Don't need you, don't need you, don't need you
Don't tell me those tears are for me
You're drowning 'til you cannot breathe

Tell me to my face you love me
Knife in my back, you're watching me bleed
I would've gave you everything
But fuck your life, I'm way too real
This can't be real, real, real
This can't be real
This can't be real, real, real
This can't be
