		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like Elizabeth Taylor
This could be a movie
I feel like Elizabeth Taylor
Red lips, dark hair
Alone in my trailer
Under my white shirt
Heart like stone
Wearing fake designer and pearls

I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am, on my own

I feel like Elizabeth Taylor
"Do I make you nervous?"
I feel like Elizabeth Taylor
And not just on the surface

I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am, here I stand
I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am

Another lesson learned
Another lesson learned

I feel like Elizabeth Taylor
At the after party
In a room full of strangers
Just me and my Bacardi

Thinking of an old movie
And the roles that we play
Sometimes I look back
And I wish that you'd stayed

I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am on my own
I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am, here I stand
I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am

Another lesson learned

Ooooh, ooh, ooh
Red lips, dark hair
Oooh, ooh, oh
"Do I make you nervous?"

It's another lesson learned
Another lesson learned
Another lesson learned

I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am, here I stand
I've loved, I've lost and loved again
But here I am

Another lesson learned
No one could tame me
Another lesson learned
No one could tame me

Another lesson learned
Another lesson learned
