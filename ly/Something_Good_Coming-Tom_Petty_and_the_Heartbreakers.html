		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm watching the water
Watching the coast
Suddenly I know
What I want the most
And I want to tell you
Still I hold back
I need some time
Get my life on track
I know that look on your face
But there's somethin' lucky about this place
And there's somethin' good comin'
For you and me
Somethin' good comin'
There has to be

And I'm thinking 'bout mama
And about the kids
And the way we lived
And the things we did
How she never had a chance
Never caught a break
And how we pay for our big mistakes

I know so well the look on your face
And there's somethin' lucky about this place
There's somethin' good comin'
Just over the hill
Somethin' good comin'
I know it will

And I'm in for the long run
Wherever it goes
Ridin' the river 
Wherever it goes
And I'm an honest man
Work's all I know
You take that away
Don't know where to go

And I know that look that's on your face
There's somethin' lucky about this place
There's somethin' good comin'
For you and me
Somethin' good comin'
There has to be
