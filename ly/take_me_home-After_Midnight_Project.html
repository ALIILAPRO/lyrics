		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm walking in the shadow of my tempted soul
Time is ticking by
While I'm chatting with this bottle of wine
I know that I'm not perfect
I'll admit that I'm a fool
I'm always getting lost
But always finding my way back to you, the one
I need when I'm awake.

Take me Home
I wanna go
And I'm sorry I can't love you
I'm sorry I can't make you see who I am.

Did he see it coming'
Dying in a bath of shame'
While all his hopes past him by
And all his fears had killed him dry'
I can see what he was thinking
It's so easy if you try
Because killing yourself with a silver dagger just to show how much you love her
Is worth the pain
Then to hear her cry your name.

Take me Home
I wanna go
And I'm sorry I can't love you
I'm sorry I can't make you see who I am.

I can't go on, I can't live like this
And I can't go on, I can't live like this.
And I can't go on, I can't live like this...

Take me Home
I wanna go
And I'm sorry I can't love you
I'm sorry I can't make you see who I am.
