		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sky that I see with
my arms around my knees
It's so brutally beautiful
The arrow of inferiority has
deeply stricken through my heart
I hostage myself
into the dark room
With all the excuse and the hope
that I turned away
And just muttering
"it'sbecause of the time"
I closed my mouth
I closed my ears
I closed my eyes
I closed myself from the world
Then I felt so lonely
I cut my wound again
The mercy red splashed
out from me
I felt the pain and I realized
that I'm still alive
Just as same as I ever was
Still alive
Pus running down with
all my tears
Warmth running through with pain
The voices without actual sound
telling me
"lt ain't too late"
I was pulled back out
from the dark
A yellowy sun came into my sight
The monster hiding inside me
Still won't let me go
Still won't let me die

The monster screams so silently
My heart is beating fast
"Whatever you do,
there's only once
If you run away
Might as well kill yourself
Why don't you walk your own way
on your own foot You fool!!!
Pus running down with
all my tears
Warmth running through with pain
The voices without
actual sound telling me
"It ain't too late"
The monster that hides
inside of me
Killed me without a sound
And so l was born again
On the day with a
silent sun up in the sky
"It ain't too late"
"It ain't too late"
You fool!!!
