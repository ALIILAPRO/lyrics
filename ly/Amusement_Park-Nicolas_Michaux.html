		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holidays in Norway
Sure were a lot of fun And we stared at the sun For a while
But now the world has become One big amusement park
I’d rather stay in the dark
For a while
The tocsin is ringing
On the summer breeze
The orchard is singing
You kneel beneath the trees
You moved the table
Then you moved the chairs So that me and the band Were able to play
But now a four-lane highway Splits the village in two
We might work in the shade For a while
The tocsin is ringing
On the summer breeze
The orchard is singing
You kneel beneath the trees
Holidays in Norway
Sure were a lot of fun And we stared at the sun For a while
But now the world has become One big amusement park
I’d rather stay in the dark
For a while
