		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The walls are bleedin' red
Blisters for the scars and the damage did
But my picture's hangin' here
Didn't mean that much until it meant everything

Mm, and I know I'm so far gone
Your heart can't keep a vacancy for me
Oh, only you know how long you've got to go

Oh, there ain't no warnin' the first time
Ain't no one to tell you, "Run, boy, run"
Like I should've done
Oh, when I can't fight the bloodline
Livin' in the seams back home
Oh, no

How am I gonna know
If I'm never alone?
When I live in the numb
And all feeling is gone?
I throw it all out the window
All out the window
Like it's all I'll ever be

The halls are closin' in
If I knew from the start, would it change a thing?
