		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking alone on a cold night
Chills rattle through my bones
The way she looks it shocks me
Standing at the door that leads below

There's a light at the end of the hall
Can I reach it before I fall
She's unusual
So unusual

In a daze I turn to run
A thousand steps to her arms
Does she really want to touch me
I see it in her eyes
See it in her eyes
No

I follow through very slowly
When I get there she's gone
She's unusual
So unusual

I know some things can't be right
Ghostly visions of delight
She tells me of a better life
The way she looks it blows my mind
silhouette cast in time
Temptress of the night is calling
me

Does she really want to touch me
I can see it in her eyes
Snakes of fire hypnotize her
Seductress of lost lives

There's a light at the end of the hall
Can I reach it before I fall
She's unusual
So unusual
She's unusual
So unusual
