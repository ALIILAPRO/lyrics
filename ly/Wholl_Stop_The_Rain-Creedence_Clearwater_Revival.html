		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long as I remember the rain been comin' down
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder 
Who'll stop the rain

I went down Virginia seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder 
Who'll stop the rain

Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more
Crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm
Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder 
Who'll stop the rain
