		  Soul Parasites
Soul Parasites

Have I bowed to complacency?
Helplessly I face a fake deity
I want to lash out but I won’t try to deny
That this could make me or break me
Victims of soul parasite

Claim to pull us all together
Yet we are torn apart
Make us think that we’re alive
While bleeding from our hearts

Soul Parasites
Soul Parasites

I’ve given every piece of me to you
I’ve done so many things I can’t undo
I live in subjugation
You’re my disintegration, parasite

The more I give to you the more I need
They’re looking through your eyes to watch me bleed
I live in Isolation
My determination’s lost the fight
Soul parasite

If there’s so much love in this place
Well then WHY are we overwhelmed with this hate
We want to lash out but we cannot try to deny
That this could fill us or kill us
Victims of Soul parasite

(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)

I’ve given every piece of me to you
I’ve done so many things I can’t undo
I live in subjugation
You’re my disintegration, parasite

The more I give to you the more I need
They’re looking through your eyes to watch me bleed
I live in isolation
My determination’s lost the fight
Soul parasite

If there’s so much love in this place
Well then WHY are we overwhelmed with this hate
We want to lash out but we cannot try to deny
That this could fill us or kill us
Victims of soul parasite
Soul parasite

Let’s get away from these soul parasites

I’ve given every piece of me to you
I’ve done so many things I can’t undo
I live in subjugation
You’re my disintegration, parasite

The more I give to you the more I need
They’re looking through your eyes to watch me bleed
I live in isolation
My determination’s lost the fight
Soul parasite

(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)
(Soul parasite)
