		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got miles of regrets and confusing friends
But perhaps it's just my stupid head in the end
Thinking should I wait here or make my way home?
You said, "Go" (you said, "Go")

Making up problems that don't exist
Why do I let myself dream like this?
We're floating away, my body's in space
We are going home

Missing pieces of my skull
I'll sew on patches of my own soul
There's nothing you or I can do so let the stars fall
'Cause from up here the sky's my thoughts and we're all so small

Meteor shower, quick take cover
But the hues in our hair compliment one another
I'd sell my own bones for sapphire stones
'Cause blue's your favorite color

Missing pieces of my skull
I'll sew on patches of my own soul
There's nothing you or I can do so let the stars fall
'Cause from up here the sky's my thoughts and we're all so small

We're all so

My heart and the earth share the same rule
It starts with love and it ends with you
But don't go outside, it's dangerous tonight
Without me right here by your side

Take it slow, you'll know
Which way to go
Sew up your skull
Take your time
And we'll be just fine

Missing pieces of my skull
I'll sew on patches of my own soul
