		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My body's a temple crowded with ghosts
Hard as I try, I'm never alone

Hear me out
Yeah, I keep it together
Like a smattering of addicts in the dark
Yeah, I keep it together
Oh, it's a place where

Monsters walk around
How did silence get so loud?

Now it's all in my head, in my head, in my head, in my head
It's over and over again, and again, and again and again, yeah
Can somebody stop time, keep my hands from shaking?
I've tried but somehow I'm breaking
Again, and again, and again and again, yeah
It's over and over again

I'm scared to wake them, scared to move
So I tiptoe around the room

Hear me out
Yeah, I keep it together
'Cause we all got thoughts we never say out loud
And just keep them forever
Oh, it's a place where

Monsters walk around
How did silence get so loud?

Now it's all in my head, in my head, in my head, in my head
It's over and over again, and again, and again and again, yeah
Can somebody stop time, keep my hands from shaking?
I've tried but somehow I'm breaking
Again, and again, and again and again, yeah
It's over and over again

Wait for the silence, forsaking serenity
Internal dialogue, voice of the enemy
Lost in a world where the seams burst so readily
I wasn't ready to disperse this energy
I wasn't ready to pick up and go
Head versus heart, they keep telling me no
Now and again I've been losing control
Left all alone

Now it's all in my head, in my head, in my head, in my head
It's over and over again, and again, and again and again, yeah
Can somebody stop time, keep my hands from shaking?
I've tried but somehow I'm breaking
Again, and again, and again and again, yeah
It's over and over again
