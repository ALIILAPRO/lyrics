		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some call it powers of the mind
Bending thoughts through space and time
Reading everyone like that old book you've read a thousand times
Heard about it when I was young
Finishing sentences on tips of tongues
Sixth senses got you seeing all these things I haven't done
We're not the only ones

You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinking but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
Not much that matters that won't
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinking but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
But I'll never be your mind reader

I could head to old Japan
On a mountain with some ancient man
Searching for some wisdom that I still won't understand
Tell me what'll it take?
Never even knew you felt that way
Sitting here farther apart than Orlando to L.A.
Delayed at the gate

You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinking but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
Not much that matters that won't
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinking but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
But I'll never be your mind reader

Mind, mind, mind reader
Mind, mind, mind reader
(I can't tell you what I don't know)
Mind, mind, mind reader
Mind, mind, mind reader
(I can't tell you what I don't know)
Mind, mind, mind reader

You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinking but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
Not much that matters that won't
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinking but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
But I'll never be your mind reader

I'll never be your mind reader
I'll never be your mind reader
I'll never be your mind reader
I'll never be your mind reader
