		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the year around.
The sun is rising
and falling down.
The wonderful everyday.
I inspire it with mean.
I can speak and learn
and know and understand.
So I'm living life,
I'm gonna find
something in my life.
And I'm waiting final day.
I like summer day's sunshine,
and I like the cloudy sky.
I like winter snow.
Thank you all elements.
It gave many things.
Hello, I'm here.
I'm standing here.
I'm stained with sweat to alive.
Look! It's at your feet.
The flower is blooming.

I like summer day's sunshine,
and I like the cloudy sky.
I like winter snow.
Thank you all elements.
It gave many things.
Hello, I'm here.
I'm standing here.
I'm stained with sweat to alive.
Look! It's at your feet.
The flower is blooming.
Life is very short
and very steep.
And I walk hard.
Try and try
and try to do the best.
I don't want regret.
Life is very short
and very steep.
And I walk hard.
Try and try
and try to do the best.
I don't want regret.
