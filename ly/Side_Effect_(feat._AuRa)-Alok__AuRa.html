		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me all your lies
Play tricks on my mind
I don't care
I switched on the lights
You went on the side
I don't care

Why do you look so confused?
I know what you didn't do
You still want to play your games
I am wiser, I have changed
Yeah, and now the joke's on you

It's a side effect of love to lose control
Just to realize you're better on your own
It's a side effect of love to want it all
You can't get enough until the feeling's gone

It's the side effect of love
Just to realize you're better on your own
It's a side effect of love to want it all
You can't get enough until the feeling's gone
It's a side effect of love

Look into my eyes, you will realize
I don't care
I am in disguise, don't need you tonight
I don't care

Why do you look so confused?
I know what you didn't do
You still want to play your games
I am wiser, I have changed
Yeah, and now the joke's on you

It's a side effect of love to lose control
Just to realize you're better on your own
It's a side effect of love to want it all
You can't get enough until the feeling's gone

It's the side effect of love
Just to realize you're better on your own
It's a side effect of love to want it all
You can't get enough until the feeling's gone
It's the side effect of love

It's the side effect of love
It's a side effect of love to want it all
You can't get enough until the feeling's gone
It's a side effect of love
