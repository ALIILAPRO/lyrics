		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do it one more time
Do it one more time

When the lights are low
And we're going home (oh)
Just you and I, you and I

I know I'll be fine
As long as you are here tonight (oh)
And you know that

If you go down, I go down, pick you up again
Call on me now, you know how, let me be your friend
If you go down, I go down, lift you up again

Do it one more time
We'll be fine
Baby, you and I
We'll just try
Do it one more time
Get it right
Baby, you and I
We do it one more time

We do it one more time
Do it one more time

When the lights are low
And we're going home
Just you and I, you and I
I know I'll be fine
As long as you are here tonight (oh)
And you know that

If you go down, I go down, pick you up again
Call on me now, you know how, let me be your friend
If you go down, I go down, lift you up again

Do it one more time
(One, one more time)
(Do it one more time)

We do it one more time
We do it one more time

Do it one more time
We'll be fine
Baby, you and I
We'll just try
Do it one more time
Get it right
Baby, you and I
We do it one more time
