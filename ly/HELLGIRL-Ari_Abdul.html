		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me in your world
Pretty tears you hold

You got me all mesmerized
I need to know you're mine

I could be your hellgirl, baby
Just wanna hear you say you're proud of me
All the other angels hate me
Falling from you

Haunt me
You know I been hearing you calling
I know the devil, he wants me
Breathe me in
Haunt me
You know that heaven has lost me
I think I feel myself falling
Into sin

You got me all mesmerized
I need to know you're mine

I could be your hellgirl, baby
Just wanna hear you say you're proud of me
All the other angels hate me
Falling from you

I'll worship your lies
Sadistic design
Our false paradise

I could be your
I could be your
I could be your

I could be your hellgirl
I could be your
I could be your
I could be your
I could be your
