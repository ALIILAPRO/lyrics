		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the scene unfolds
Young girls thirteen years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got more stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin' they got rank
See Sega ain't in this new world order 
Them experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me
Poor white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipe lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me
Later on in the future look it up
Where they say it? Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like Operation Heartbreak Hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seal off despair
Them say expect no mercy
Fool, you should be my least worries
Gotta deal with W-2's, 10-99's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me
'Cause I can see the young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking for a hit of the blow, it's powerful
Oh, you know what else they tryin' to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you
The traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter
If we don't get prepared, people, it's gon' be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
But every now and then
I wonder if the gate was put up
To keep crime out or to keep our ass in

Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

Listen up, little nigga, I'm talking to you
About what yo' little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew
Every day on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost
After I lost my best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin'?
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't sixteen years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold, I'm in a cell under attack
Lock up folks they in the hood
Got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
'Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your aim, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy your dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past way's gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming, pow

Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peekin' in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

Yeah, cell therapy
Think about it
Use that tool between your two shoulders
