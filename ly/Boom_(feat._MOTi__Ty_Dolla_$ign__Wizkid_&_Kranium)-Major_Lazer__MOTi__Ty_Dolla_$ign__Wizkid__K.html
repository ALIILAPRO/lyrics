		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby got ass like a trunk
Took her from her man, he a punk
She got a body like Baywatch
I met her at the Playhouse
Ten bottles, bought ten more
Told her move her ass to the tempo
Is you really with the shit, though?
Really, is you really with the shit, though?
We got champagne and vodka
Goons with me if they need a problem
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money
All muhfucking day
Baby drop it to the ground like yass, bitch
Back it up like yass, bitch
After the club, I'm smashin'
We'll come home and you pass it

Baby girl, please please, baby don't leave
You got that booty booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Baby girl, please please, baby don't leave
You got that booty booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba

Shorts off, batti ryda
She a make buggin' eyes, me no even give a fuck
She a swallow a lot of sign dolla, what you a ga do?
Take her roadside, go smash it pon di avenue
Two of my bitches in the club
Me introduce them to each other, other, other
Man a gyal dis and mi stand to forever

Girl please, baby don't leave
You got that booty booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Baby girl, please please, baby don't leave
You got that booty booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
