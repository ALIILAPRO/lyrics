		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is like a board game some of the time
Mistakes and heartbreaks are no crime
But there's a light creepin' through under broken skies
Got plans? Better hurry 'cause time flies

Hold tight, get ready for the ride

If everythin' was easy, nothing ever broke
If everythin' was simple, how would we know?
How to fix your tears, how to fake a show
How to paint a smile, yeah, how would we know?
How good we have it though? Mm

Life is like a dance floor some of the time
(Life is like a dance floor some of the time, mm)
Dancin' with the stars, oh, every night
And gravity comes and wraps her arms around you again
It's all fun and games until the party ends

Hold tight, get ready for the ride

If everythin' was easy, nothing ever broke
If everythin' was simple, how would we know?
How to fix your tears, how to fake a show
How to paint a smile, yeah, how would we know?
How good we have it though?

Looking at the sun our whole lives
We're blinded by the (lights)
Looking at the sun our whole lives
We're blinded by the lights, ooh

We're still not ready for the ride

If everythin' was easy, nothing ever broke
If everythin' was simple, how would we know?
How to fix your tears, how to fake a show
How to paint a smile, yeah, how would we know?
Oh, if everything was easy, nothing ever broke
If everything was simple, how would we know?
How to fix your tears, how to fake a show
How to paint a smile, yeah, how would we know?
How good we had it though?

How good we had it though?
So hold tight, get ready for the ride
