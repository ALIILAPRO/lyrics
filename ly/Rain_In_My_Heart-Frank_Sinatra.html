		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My eyes are dry, my love, since you've been gone, I haven't shed a tear,
I'll never cry, my love, though every day seems like a hundred years,
For I'm just a fool who clings to his pride but when I'm alone,
I can hear the sound of rain in my heart, of the tears that I hide,
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside,
I can't get away from the sound of the rain in my heart.
How could I know, my love, I was a toy, only a game to you?
How could you go, my love, without a thought of what I'm going through?
How can I forget I still love you so, it echoes each time that I hear
The sound of rain in my heart from the tears that I hide,
So it tears me apart, I still keep them inside,
But I can't escape from the sound of the rain in my heart.
I hear that rain in my heart of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside...
