		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cause I've been craving
Your sweet haven
So I keep turning
While your body burns to the ground

Oh now
Oh now

Yeah, you've got to hold on
Yeah, you've got to stay strong
Oh yeah, you've got to move on on on
Yeah, you've got to hold on

So don't try to tell me
That I should go softly
Just look me in my eyes
Oh, and feed me your sweet lies

All night
All night

Yeah, you've got to hold on
Yeah, you've got to stay strong
Oh yeah, you've got to move on on on
Yeah, you've got to hold on

Children - they come in two
My mind, it bleeds through you
Cut glass in sheets of lies
I'll cut through your alibis

Hang a cross upside down
Your church is burning down
Just take me for the night
Just take me all night

Yeah you've got to hold on
Yeah you've got to stay strong
Oh yeah you've got to move on on on, yeah

You've got to hold
You've got to hold
You've got to hold
You've got to hold
You've got to hold
