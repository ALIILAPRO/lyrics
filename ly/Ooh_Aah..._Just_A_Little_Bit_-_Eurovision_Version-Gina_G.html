		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love

Am I wrong? Am I so unkind?
Show me the way, don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment I'm thinking of you

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Feeling good, let's go all the way
It's got to be, set me free
But tonight let my body say
Take it slow, don't let it go

How can I prove my love to you?
Baby please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's more than a phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Ooh what can you do for me?
Ooh, what can you do?
'Cause I feel so alive
I feel your love inside, ooh

Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit, just a little

Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit (oh oh oh)

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for

Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit, just a little

Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit (oh oh oh)
