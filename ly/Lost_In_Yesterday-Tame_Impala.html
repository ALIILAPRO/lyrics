		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it heaven?
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually terrible memories turn into great ones

So if they call you
Embrace them
If they hold you
Erase them

'Cause it might've been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said, "Oh, what I'd give to start over, boy I'd command it"
So what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry

'Cause they call you
Embrace them
If they stall you
Erase them

'Cause it might've been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been pickin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been something, don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

If it calls you
Embrace it
If it haunts you
Face it

I know it's mad, I understand
It's only snakes and ladders
The period you never had
There's only one that matters

And if it calls you
Embrace it
If it holds you
Erase it
Erase it
