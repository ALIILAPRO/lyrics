		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  One, two, 3D

I can't touch you through the phone
Or kiss you through the universe
In another time zone
It's the only time I can't reverse
But when there's two dimensions
There's only one I'm missing
And if you feel alone
You don't have to feel that no more

I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh

So if you're ready (so if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (and if you'll let me)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (uh-uh)
You won't regret me (you won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (champagne confetti)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D

'Cause you know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)

Body to body to body to body to body
You and me, baby, you know that we got it
So don't go getting me started
'Cause you know I get hot hearted
Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, you making me crazy
Rain, rain, rain, you can't fake it
You give me brand new emotion
You got me drinking that potion

I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh

So if you're ready (so if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (and if you'll let me)
I wanna see it (hey)
In motion
In 3D (show me girl, now)
You won't regret me (you won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (hey)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (come on, come on, come on)

'Cause you know how I like it, girl
(You know how I like it) 3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl
(You know how I like it) 3D (woo)
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (oh)
(You know how I like it) 3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)

I'm on my Jung Kook, take a chick off one look
And when they get took, they don't ever get untook
When I seen that body you would think it was a dead body
The way I told my boys, "Come look"
I used to take girls up to Stony Brook
And steal they hearts like some crook, true story
Now when I hold somebody's hand it's a new story
All my ABGs get cute for me
I had one girl (one girl), too boring
Two girls, that was cool for me
Three girls, damn, dude's horny
Four girls, okay, now you whorin'
(Hey, hey) I'm loose (hey)
I done put these shrooms to good use
I done put my city on my back
And the world know my name I'm the truth

So if you're ready
And if you'll let me
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (ooh)
You won't regret me (you won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (champagne confetti)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (show it to me, girl, now) (why?) 

'Cause you know how I like it, girl (I kinda like it, right)
3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (oh, yeah)
(Alright) 3D (woo, woo)
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (oh)
(You know how I like it, girl) (Spy Kids) 3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)

I got you playin' with yourself on camera
You my bae, just like Tampa
Speaking of bucks I got those
And as for fucks, well, not those, and as for thots 
Well, do you really wanna know? I thought so
I'll fly you from Korea to Kentucky
And you ain't gotta guarantee me nothing I just wanna see if I get lucky
I just wanna meet you in the physical and see if you would touch me
