		  Beetlebum
What you've done
She's a gun
Now what you've done
Beetlebum
Get nothing done
You beetlebum 
Just get numb
Now what you've done
Beetlebum

And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on then all my violence is gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
Nothing is wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone

Beetlebum
Because you're young
She's a gun
Now what you've done
Beetlebum
She'll suck your thumb
She'll make you come
'Cause, she's your gun
Now what you've done
Beetlebum

And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on then all my violence is gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
There's nothing wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone

He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
