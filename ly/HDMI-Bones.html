		  (SESH)

Smokin' like a motherfucker, higher than a motherfucker, bitch, please stop the playin'
SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ, death to them other boys, we can't hear a word you sayin'
We don't know your name, can't hang with the gang, crowd jumpin' when the bass get bangin'
All I need is dope so I gotta get paid
Never see me on the stage unless the money is arranged
My hair 1080, my teeth 240
My blunts 4K, and my dope you couldn't load it
If they ain't callin' with a price, we don't answer that
Tryin' to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

If they ain't callin' with a price, we don't answer that
Tryin' to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that, bitch, we gon' handle that
Tryin' to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
They ain't callin' with a price, we don't answer that
Tryin' to fuck around bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that, bitch, we gon' handle that
Tryin' to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

Bitch, I'm smokin' sacrificial, back to back, blink you might miss it
Boy, my team made up of legends and my ring made out of crystal
They ask me how I been livin' since these labels out to get me
But the only reason they want to meet me is just to say they fuckin' met me

I got money on the table but
I ain't count it yet
I ain't count it yet
I ain't, I ain't count it yet
Money on the table but
I ain't count it yet
I ain't count it yet
I ain't, I ain't count it yet

(Bones)
