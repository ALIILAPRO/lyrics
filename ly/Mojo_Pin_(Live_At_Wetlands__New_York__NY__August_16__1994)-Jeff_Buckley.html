		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lying in my bed
The blanket is warm
This body will never be
Safe from harm
Still feel your hair
Black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin
To keep me whole

Oh, if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't wanna weep for you
Don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow (horse has flown)
Memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so

Uh precious precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless and I'm there in your arms

Don't wanna weep for you
I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so
so, so, so

Dah

Oh the welts of your scorn, my love
Give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back
Give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for

Don't wanna weep for you
Don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow (horse has flown)
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so, 
so, black black black beauty
