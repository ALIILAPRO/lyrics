		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Been looking for a substitution
Healing my heart's confusion
Been looking for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacing you

Am I high or low? Am I bipolar?
Need another you to shake it, shake it
Oh, I love that face, perfect stranger
'Cause I could use someone to shake it, shake it

But I know that I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't numb you away
Yeah, I know when I wake up with her instead
No, there ain't no one replacin' you
No, there ain't no one replacin' you

Been looking for a substitution
Healing my heart's confusion
Been looking for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacing you
Been looking for a substitution
Losing all of my illusions
Looking for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacing you

Gotta loosen up my emotions
Just start it up to shake it, shake it
When I hear your name, I can't be sober
I could use someone to shake it, shake it

But I know that I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't numb you away
Yeah, I know when I wake up with her instead
No, there ain't no one replacing you

No, there ain't no one, no
No, there ain't no one, no
No, there ain't no one, no
No, there ain't no one replacing you

Been looking for a substitution
Healing my heart's confusion
Been looking for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacing you
Been looking for a substitution
Losing all of my illusions
Looking for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacing you
Been looking for a substitution
Losing all of my illusions
Looking for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacing you

Yeah, looking for a substitution
Losing all of my illusions
Looking for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacing you
