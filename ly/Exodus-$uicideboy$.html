		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First, I turned the Nile River into blood!
Then I released the frogs as the city floods!
Along with lice, flies
And I diseased your livestock!
Then I make sure the boils grow
On your wife and child!
Look up at the fucking sky
You'll see a storm of hail and fire!
Then I sent out the locusts
To swarm your fucking crops!
I blacked out the sun and made time stop!
Next I'm coming for your firstborn son
Watch him drop!

Bitch, I'm Yung Plague
Here to spread the flames
Makin' it fucking rain alligator fangs
Lightin' the flame that ignited
The revelation of Osiris
I'm risin' above the horizon
I blackened the diamond
And siphoned all of the water supply of Zion
Bitch, I cut the head clean off of the lion
Put it on a spike, and all
Of the sheep became enlightened, bitch
I'm standin' right beside Poseidon 'bout
To release all the Titans
Footprints in the sand
Followed by a herd of rotten bison

Grey, grey, grey, grey
Grey, grey, grey, grey
Grey, grey, grey, grey
Grey, grey, grey, GREY!

Crucify me with the nails in my feet
With the nails in my wrists
And that blade in my chest
Enlightened by Zion, I'm wearin' the lion
With teeth on a rope that surrounding my neck
Standing in fire, I'm God of the liars
Attire is made up of nothin' but wire
The choir is singin' my praises
With phrases that let
You all know I'm the bastard of Satan
Black in my eyes, homicide on my mind
With that blood on my face
Then I turn it to wine
Yung Christ the divine
Make them fall into line
Let the planets align as they
Build me a shrine
The end of the world as you know it
When I'm up in hell, I turn fire to snow
Bitch the waters
They swell as the polars are broken
Evoking the smoke from the
Bodies that's choking, ho
