		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

And I worked so hard
And I killed myself
And you broke my bones
And I sold my soul

But now days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you, ooh-ooh

And I could have been your mother
And I could have been your sister (ooh-ooh)
Be your (ooh-ooh) twin brother (ooh-ooh)
I just wanted to be (ooh-ooh), wanted to be

And our days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you, ooh-ooh

We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time
We were just wasting time

And our days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you

But now days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
