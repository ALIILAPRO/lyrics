		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Snakes in the club when it's pitch black
I put a lot of time in I can't get back (get back)
Gotta read the situation, gotta sit back (back)
Niggas TTG, ready to strike back (baow)
A lot of people turned they back tryna come back
Bad intent, from a mile away, I feel that (I feel that)
Same friends ride for me, then they wanna slide on me (slide, slide)
I done spent millions for your happiness, don't gossip me
I'd rather you lie to me (lie to me)
Smile to me (smile to me), follow me (follow me)
Say that you proud of me (say that you proud)
Disguise your despise for me (disguise your despise)
Hopin' times get hard for me (times get hard)
And I fall off eventually (I can't fall off)
They ain't feelin' me, love for my enemy
Don't appreciate, celebrate and belittle me

That's why I don't fuck with you (that's why I don't fuck with you)
It's the reason I don't fuck with you (it's the reason I don't fuck with you)
Play your part, what you supposed to do (what you supposed to do?)
But you got too comfortable (got too comfortable)
And that's why I don't fuck with you
Like a boss, how I'm supposed to move (how I'm supposed to move)
Why should I fuck with you? (Why should I?)
Taught you the game, you a substitute

I don't fuck with you niggas
Can't eat with y'all, fuck havin' lunch with you niggas
I done did a bunch for you niggas
But a bunch will never be enough for you niggas
Really from the streets
But I can't call on half of them niggas when it's beef
You could've threw a punch at least
Could've tripped a nigga, flipped a nigga, but your gangsta weak
I loved niggas, but they showed me the opposite
How you listen to the opps shit?
I'm on top shit, on your block
Complainin' about the next man just like a block bitch
But, ayy, I never changed (never)
Still let the flag hang
Nigga, we from the same gang
How you let the opposition speak on my name?

That's why I don't fuck with you (4Hunnid)
It's the reason I don't fuck with you
Play your part, what you supposed to do
But you got too comfortable (you got too bomfortable)
And that's why I don't fuck with you (that's why I don't fuck-)
Like a boss, how I'm supposed to move (like a boss)
Why should I fuck with you? (Nigga, why?)
Taught you the game, you a substitute (on the gang)

I'm sayin' though, these niggas got shit fucked up (I don't fuck with you)
Like I gave you niggas the game, I showed you niggas love
I ain't feel that shit, so I fell the fuck back, nigga (I don't fuck with you)
Respect that
Real shit, feel me though?
