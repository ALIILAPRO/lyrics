		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna party like 2003
I just wanna party like 2003
I just wanna party like 2003
I just wanna party like 2003

I come alive, we multiply
I'mma push you to the top if you're ready for the jump off one more time
You wanna ride, I'm 'bout to fly
I just wanna feel the bass and lose it
Take your money, go and dip, yeah move it

I just wanna party like 2003
AIM crush on my 'net 'cause I'm feeling the need
Yeah daddy it's a wreck but you gotta eat
Aye what you know about my piece
I just wanna party like 2003
Yeah all my haters makin' up the beef
And if I don't fuck with you, don't fuck with me
Shit like this don't come for free
(Shit like this don't come for free)
(Shit like this don't come for free)
(Shit like this don't come for free)
(Shit like this don't come for free)

I just wanna party like 2003
In the back, I'm doing drugs off a golden key
We got bodies in the trunk, yeah we put 'em to sleep
Car chase with the bass fallin' out of your seat
Poppin' pills, getting high, got a need for speed
Coked out in the fast lane, do it with ease
Come around boy, don't try fuckin' with me!
Try to speak, I'll be knockin' out all of your teeth

I just wanna party like 2003
In the zone, all alone, nose starting to bleed
Earthquake in the warehouse under your feet
Medicate and sedate, 'cause we get it for free!
I just wanna party like 2003
Headbang, go insane, 'cause I'm feeling the beat
One chance, but I think you blew it!
Put the gun in my face, bitch do it!

Oh my god, comin' out your radio
Hit you with the new shit, screaming all night long
Grab you by the neck, say you wanna fucking lose it
Dusk 'til dawn, two white lines
Speeding through the fast lane, never gave a fuck about anything
Pull up, top down in my denim jeans, wanna hit the scene
'Cause I just wanna party like 2003
I'm way too fucked up but give me the keys
Von Dutch, don't touch this, down on your knees
T9, flip phone, I'm hitting the streets
I just wanna party like 2003
Don't care what time or day of the week
Got something to say, boy, watch it with me
Shit like this don't come for free

(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep, yeah we put 'em to sleep)
(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep)
(Bodies in the trunk, yeah, we put 'em to sleep)
(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep, yeah we put 'em to sleep)
(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep, I just wanna party like 2003)
(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep, yeah we put 'em to sleep)
(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep)
(Bodies in the trunk, yeah, we put 'em to sleep)
(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep, yeah we put 'em to sleep)
(Oh my god!)
(Yeah, we put 'em to sleep, I just wanna party like 2003)
