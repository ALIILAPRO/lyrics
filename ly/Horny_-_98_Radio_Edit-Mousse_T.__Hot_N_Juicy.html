		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm not really feeling this
Give me something else

You got me horny in the morning and you know
I try to call you but I can't find the telephone
I sent a message through the Internet but it rejected
I wrote a letter and I sent it with the post
The post it takes so long, so I've got to sing this song
To let you know how I feel, what's the deal baby
cnd I can't wait for you, and the things you make me do
My heart is ringing so I'm singing this song for you

I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
So horny
I'm horny, horny, horny
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
So horny
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight

I searched from town to town but I can't find my boo
Now I got so desperate I sent a rocket to the moon
In New York City someone said they saw you singing the blues
But it was a man from Nowhere Land that looked like you

Now I will keep searching on
This feeling's much too strong
My heart is ringing and I'm singing this song for you

I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long

The post it takes so long, so I gotta sing this song
To let you know how I feel, what's the deal baby
cnd I can't wait for you, and the things you make me do
My heart is ringing so I'm singing this song for you

I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
So horny
I'm horny, horny, horny
I'm horny
Horny, horny, horny
So horny
I'm horny, horny, horny tonight
