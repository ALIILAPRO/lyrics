		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no moon in the sky tonight
Put my hands back on the wheel
Whisper something to me babe
Something I can feel

I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you

You told me I'm the only one
While your headlights fade and go
And just before the underpass
I'll hold you in the afterglow

I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you

I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you
