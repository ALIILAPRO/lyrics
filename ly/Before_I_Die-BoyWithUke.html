		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, one and two and three and four, and

One month left, my doctor shakes his head, yeah
He don't look so good, he should just rest
Ba-da-bum, bum-bum-bum
Trying hard not to vomit on my bed
He says, I should say goodbye to all my friends

Before I die, need a little bit, I just need a little bit more
Before I die, I just wanna be rich, I don't wanna die poor
Before I die, wanna marry her and then I wanna divorce
Before I die, I don't wanna die young, I just wanna live more

(Two, three, four)
Let's just keep on staying up past two (that's a bad idea)
I still see cigarettes by your shoes (ew, clap, clap)
When are we going to the zoo? (Bitch, when the fuck we leaving?)
There's so many things that I want to do with you

Before I die, need a little bit, I just need a little bit more
Before I die, I just wanna be rich, I don't wanna die poor (oh-oh)
Before I die, wanna marry her and then I wanna divorce
Before I die, I don't wanna die young, I just wanna live more (oh-oh)

Bitch, take me back to Tokyo
Can you take me where I wanna go?

Before I die, need a little bit, I just need a little bit more
Before I die, I just wanna be rich, I don't wanna die poor (oh-oh)
Before I die, wanna marry her and then I wanna divorce
Before I die, I don't wanna die young, I just wanna live more (oh-oh)
