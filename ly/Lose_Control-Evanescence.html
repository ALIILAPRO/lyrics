		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't remember my name
I don't really care
Can we play the game your way?
Can I really lose control?

Just once in my life
I think it'd be nice
(Just to lose control, just once)
With all the pretty flowers in the dust

Mary had a lamb
His eyes black as coals
If we play very quiet, my lamb
Mary never has to know

Just once in my life
I think it'd be nice
(Just to lose control, just once)

If I cut you down to a thing I can use
I fear there will be nothing good left of you

Just to lose control, just once
