		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you wake up, it just might be
The first of many blows that you'll receive
Today what we need

We want what we need
We need what's above
We're always reaching
For something above
But we've got enough

All of the haves they have not
Not got half of what we got
They want more, I just want you
Better believe it, I beg of you

Why don't you know that I know
When you're hurting after all these years I know
Like siamese twins
I can feel every one of your senses
We're just the same
Unconditional love easier said
Said than done

We want what we need
We need what's above
We find ourselves reaching
For something above
But we've got enough

All of the haves they have not
Not got half of what we got
The ceiling's so high
When your down on the floor
It's easy to be wanting
To be wanting more

All those years ago
When we could have met
So hard, oh, hard not to regret
But I know we got
A lot of life, life to live yet

We want what we need
We need what's above
We find ourselves reaching
For something above
But we've got enough

All of the haves they have not
Not got half of what we got
They're wanting more I'm just wanting you
Oh better believe me, all I'm begging of you
All of the haves with all that they do
All of the haves, they ain't got you
They ain't got you
They ain't got, oh, they ain't got
Oh, they ain't got you, got you, I got you
