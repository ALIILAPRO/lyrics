		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, "Girl, I think my butt gettin' big" (oh)

Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it
Is you fuckin'? Two shots, fuck it
Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it
Is you fuckin'? (Fuckin'), two shots, fuck it (ayy)
Throw it like a stripper, damn (like damn)
Throw it like a stripper, ayy (ayy)
Throw it like a stripper, damn (ayy)
Turn around and tip her, ayy (uh)
Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it (ayy)
Is you fuckin'? (Is you?) Two shots, fuck it 

Real slim waist with a body on me
Goddamn, I'm poppin', I'm hot (I'm hot)
Real thick bands in a motherfucker pants
He was staring from a stance, so I took him to the spot
I don't wanna talk, I wanna be in your mouth
Tell that nigga get out, he ain't packing with a Glock
Beggin' for a dance, he ain't even get a chance
Threw it back and let it land, ain't no beggin' me to stop, bitch
Ate the pussy up on Tuesday
Back and the side, yeah, two ways
Give me that top like toupée
Slurpin' on the pussy like Kool-Aid
One don't be enough, I need two baes
Nigga down my throat like D'USSÉ
Lick all on the tip like brûlée
Nigga, I'ma do whatever you say (ooh)
Now watch me

Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it
Is you fuckin'? Two shots, fuck it
Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it (ayy)
Is you fuckin'? (Fuckin'), two shots, fuck it (ayy)
Throw it like a stripper, damn (like damn)
Throw it like a stripper, ayy (ayy)
Throw it like a stripper, damn (ayy)
Turn around and tip her, ayy (uh)
Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it (ayy)
Is you fuckin'? (Is you?) Two shots, fuck it 

Drop it down low and pick it up, ayy
You know I don't ever give a fuck, ayy
Nigga lookin' at me in the club, ayy
He gon' have to throw a couple dubs, ayy
I don't even wanna much talk to the nigga
Why he always tryna come and see what's up? Uh
Brown liquor all in your cup, ayy
Say he wanna put it in my gut, uh
Nigga couldn't make it to the club, so
I'ma throw it back on FaceTime
I don't never be on no Tinder and
I don't never be on no Dateline (line)
Told me I could have a couple racks, shit (uh)
Told him I'ma need about eight, nine (nine)
Got a nigga you ain't never seen yet
'Cause I ain't never wit him in the daytime
Now watch me

Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it
Is you fuckin'? Two shots, fuck it
Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it (huh)
Is you fuckin'? (Fuckin'), two shots, fuck it (ayy)
Throw it like a stripper, damn (like damn)
Throw it like a stripper, ayy (ayy)
Throw it like a stripper, damn (ayy)
Turn around and tip her, ayy (uh)
Buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it (ayy)
Is you fuckin'? (Is you?) Two shots, fuck it
