		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my lover's prayer
I hope it'll reach out to you, my love
This is my lover's prayer 
And I hope you can understand it, my love 

My life is such a weary thing
But it might be your own presence bringing rain 
You keep wanting, waiting and wishing
When I know deep down that I'm not to blame 

What you gonna do tonight
When you need some loving arms to hold you tight?
Tell me, what you gonna do tonight 
When you need my happy voice to tell you good night?

Honey, but you can't let that be no problem
You've got to come on home and help me solve 'em
Yeah, I won't be missing you 
And honey, my lover's prayer would be all over, oh my

What can the matter be now?
It can't be too serious we can't talk it over
Living in this misery
Darling, you can't make my life all over 

Honey but don't you let that be no problem
Just come on home and help me solve 'em
Dear, I won't be missing you, I won't be missing you
And my lover's prayer would be all over 
It got to be all over, honey all over 
Don't keep my life going round, so many circles 
This is my lover's prayer, come on come on home, og
This is my lover's prayer I'm sending it out to you
And I hope it'll reach you, darlin'
This is my lover's prayer
I hope to get the message over, honey
