		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything started with instinct
My heart and my body felt in sync
Figured out what had been missing right then and there, ayy
Tried to grow up in a hurry
Caught in the sound and the fury
That's when it starts to get blurry, yeah, yeah, mm
The doctor wrote me my prescription
Had a taste, I was addicted
Ate the candy that was given to me, bittersweet

Walked to the beat of my heart
Got me a shot with the stars
Now I can't help wishing for
A little more space
Followed the path that I saw
I'd pay whatever the cost
Now the only thing I can afford
Is a little more

Spent my whole life with somebody
Wasted a whole lot of money
Anything not to be lonely, oh
Mama's entertainer, daddy's stranger in the orbit
Got a lot of baggage, always feeling like a tourist
Surfing though cyberspace debating what's important

Walked to the beat of my heart
Got me a shot with the stars
Now the only thing I'm wishing for is
A little more space
Followed the path that I saw
I'd pay whatever the cost
Now the only thing I can afford
Is a little more
