		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say I'm cold-hearted
But I'm just getting started
Got my eyes on the the target
Now, now

Ohh, ohh, ohh
'Til the battle's won
'Til kingdom come
Ohh, ohh, ohh
I'll never run

Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty

They'll be calling me royalty

They say I'm dangerous 'cause I
Broke all the cages
No, I, won't sit and take it
Now, now
They left me for dead, I guess they'll never learn
Every time I break there's just more pain to burn
They'll never, never, never learn

Ohh, ohh, ohh
'Til the battle's won
'Til kingdom come
Ohh, ohh, ohh
I'll never run

Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty

They'll be calling me royalty
They'll be calling me royalty
They'll be calling me royalty
