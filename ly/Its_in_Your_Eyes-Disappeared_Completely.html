		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always do this stuff.
We'll never be enough.
You were floating in life.
We were floating in life.
It's in your eyes.

You think that's not fun, day is done.
With no other feelings.
Why are your eyes not shine in lights?
There's more than one meaning.

Just get what you want, but again you got numb. It's because of freaking illusion.
That life is not fiction, the sense in the description of love, it's an awful conclusion.

You could always turn it back.
Get another heart attack.
We roll!
We'll find ourselves in love.
