		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reflect on everything you have done
Protect the light from your candle and

Shine so bright that now the Gods can see you
Climb so high they’ll call you “one of us”

Let’s embrace this moment and wash the pain away
You have been baptized in fire
You’re cleansed by the flame 

Don’t forget where you started from
Take a look to see just what you’ve become a
Shrine so high that everyone can see you
So divine now that you’re one of us

Let’s embrace this moment and wash the pain away
You have been baptized in fire
You’re cleansed by the flame

Close your eyes
Take my hand
Follow me
You’ll understand
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

Let’s embrace this moment and wash the pain away
You have been baptized in fire
You’re cleansed by the flame
You have been baptized in fire
You’re cleansed by the flame
