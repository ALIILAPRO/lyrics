		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey) Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Not that way that I do love you

Well, holy moly, me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you

Man, oh man, you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need

Well, hot and heavy, pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey, hey)
La, la, la, la, take me home
(Daddy) Mother, I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you (hey)

Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and pay phone calls
I've been everywhere (hey) with you

That's true, laugh until we think we'll die
Barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you (hey)

And in the streets you run a-free
Like it's only you and me
Geez, you're something to see

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey, hey)
La, la, la, la, take me home
(Daddy) Mother, I'm coming home

"Jade"

"Alexander"

"Do you remember that day you fell out of my window?"

"I sure do, you came jumping out after me"

"Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass
And you were bleedin' all over the place
And I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?"

"Yes, I do"

"Well, there's something I never told you about that night"

"What didn't you tell me?"

"While you were sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette
You thought was gonna be your last
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you
And I never told you 'til just now"

"Aww"

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is where I'm alone with you

Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

Oh, home, yes, I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you

Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and pay phone calls

Home is when I'm alone with you
Home is when I'm alone with you
