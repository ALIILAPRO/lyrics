		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With life's four-way stop
The tinges in your shadow drop
Fate pulls you down for the count
With broken promises to amount

Time seal our ways
To the heart of our hiding place
When all our lifelines have been crossed
Some scars can never heal from what we lost

To fail the test and depart the strong
Is to light the way where you have gone
For only our funerals to come
A requiem in death, a song

And it seems to be
That consistency is not what lingers ahead
But a virtue of the dead

One of these days
Hours pass yet the night stays
When your spirit won't turn anew
The world shuts down with no goodbye to undo you

Breathing lifeless
We are not afraid to die
Breathe in life's less
You're afraid not to live
