		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I could live free
I hope it's not beyond me 
Settling down, it takes time 
One day we'll live together 
And life will be better 
I have it here, yeah, in my mind 
Baby, know someday you'll slow 

And lately, my heart's been breaking 

I gave a lot to you
I take a lot from you too
You slave a lot from me
Guess you could say I gave you my edge 

I can't pretend 
I need to defend 
Some part of me from you 
I know I've spent some time oh lying 
I can't pretend 
I don't need to defend 
Some part of me from you 
I know I've spent some time oh lying 

You're looking alright tonight
I think we should go
You're looking alright tonight
I think we should go
