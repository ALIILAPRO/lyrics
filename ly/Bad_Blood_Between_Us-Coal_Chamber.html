		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't take offense
I don't mean offense
It's just that truth is a process, you see
It what gets by me 
That makes me lose my mind
I even called you a friend casually!

Poison in your heart and in your mind
Look in the mirror [?]
That no one in here is just wasting time
Passing time, wasting time!
With evil intent there's nothing more to lament

Turning the other cheek
Just evens out the scars
Nothing drowns the sorrows
I'll be damned it's not over
I'll be damned
Nothing drowns the sorrows

You can never come home again
You've got it coming, coming to you!
Watching the clock tick, tick
Take the easy way out
You've got it coming (coming!)
Don't you?!

Poison in your heart and in your mind
Look in the mirror [?]
That no one in here is just wasting time
Passing time, wasting time!
With evil intent there's nothing more to lament

Why!?

Turning the other cheek
Just evens out the scars
Nothing drowns the sorrows
I'll be damned it's not over
I'll be damned
Nothing drowns the sorrows

There's some bad blood
That flows between us
That flows between us
Turning the other cheek
Just evens out the scars
Nothing drowns the sorrow

Say it, we're out for blood
I'm out for blood, it's time to unravel
This wrath is on you
Heed this warning, take this message, I'm out for blood!
[x2]

Say it, we're out for blood
We're out for blood!

Turning the other cheek
Just evens out the scars
Nothing drowns the sorrows
I'll be damned it's not over
I'll be damned
Nothing drowns the sorrows
