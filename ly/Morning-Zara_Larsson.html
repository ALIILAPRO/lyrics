		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember
The people we used to be
As you were the one who couldn't get enough of me
Eat out together
Or calling me constantly
Now I don't wanna talk that you looking at me differently

I know, we need to talk
But let's not, let's not, no, not tonight
I know, we need to talk
But why not, why not
Just hold me tight

Save it for the morning
Hold me close and just enjoy the moment
Let's not mix these drinks with our emotions
Let's not blow this way out of proportion
Save it for the morning

Let's call a truce then, all of my friends say, "Yeah"
Put your hands on my waist, baby, we ain't gonna make it weird
We could get though this
When we get out of here
We had too many drinks, baby, we ain't really thinking clear

I know, we need to talk (we need)
But let's not, let's not, no, not tonight (not tonight, not tonight)
I know, we need to talk
But why not, why not
Just hold me tight 

Save it for the morning
Hold me close and just enjoy the moment
Let's not mix these drinks with our emotions
Let's not blow this way out of proportion
Save it for the morning
Save it for the morning

Hold on to me
Just be the last to leave
Just close your eyes
Being a memory
Hold on to me
Just be the last to leave
Just close your eyes

Save it for the morning
Hold me close and just enjoy the moment
Let's not mix these drinks with our emotions
Let's not blow this way out of proportion
Save it for the morning

Save it for the morning
Hold me close and just enjoy the moment
Let's not mix these drinks with our emotions
Let's not blow this way out of proportion
Save it for the morning
Save it for the morning
