		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em, "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mm
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo-deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?

I was out back, where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Niggas tryna get me for my water
I lay his ass down on my son or my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
'Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (yeah)
And I know Papi get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen the double C's I bought her
Got a bitch that's lookin' like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forget it

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em, "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mm
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo-deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?

Ha-ha-ha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch (yeah)
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
Bitch don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wanna fly again
I take my chances in traffic (yeah)
She suckin' on dick no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing-strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hunnid bands on Zimmerman shit
I been movin' real gangsta, so that's why she pick a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco, 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street-wealthy, yeah

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em, "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mm
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo-deals, we been trappin' like the '80's
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?
