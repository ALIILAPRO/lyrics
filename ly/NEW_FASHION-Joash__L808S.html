		  Ahhwoo
She hit hills for louis vuitton
Trying to hit the party looking dope
dope dope dope
She knows exactly what she want's
I know I ain't never going broke
Trying to feed all her new fashion goals
Louboutins just made her strike a pose
When she walked I swear my audemars froze
She's just addicted to the

Rolex
Balenciaga dope fein
Patek
Cartier she copping
Dolce
Gabbana got her shopping
Want a bit of that
Bit of this bit of that
Hit the streets for that Steve Madden Hat
Cavalli on her wrist
Coz she feel it like that
Ooooh

She hit hills for louis vuitton
Damn
Look how she swipes for that
Credit card flies for ya
Burberry price for love
But I love the way you style on them
O's
Wrist froze
Rings
Gold
The way you style on them
O's
Wrist froze
Rings
Gold
The way you style on them
Ohhhhh
The way you style on them
Ohhhhh
The way you style on them
O's
Wrist froze
Rings
Gold
The way you style on them
O's
Wrist froze
Rings
Gold
