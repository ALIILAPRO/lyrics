		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friday night, drank a Cab Sav
At your stupid party, no one danced
T-shirts, obsolete DVDs
All these novels I bet you'll never read
Seemed fine

All this time, we believed we were living
Joy rides, splitting sides, getting thinner
We were so tired, baby we got salt eyes
All this time, we believed we were living
So high, splitting sides, getting thinner
We were so tired, baby we got salt eyes

Swallowed hard, squeezed tight
I lost my car keys overnight
Almost did, chickened out
Everything between us is different now

All this time, we believed we were living
Joy rides, splitting sides, getting thinner
We were so tired, baby we got salt eyes
All this time, we believed we were living
So high, splitting sides, getting thinner
We were so tired, baby we got salt eyes

I snap my hat back, to feel fine
You're never mean, but you're never that kind
Yeah I snap my hat back, to feel fine
You're never mean, but you're never that kind

You're never mean, but you're never that kind
You're never mean, but you're never that kind
You're never mean, but you're never that kind
You're never mean, but you're never that kind
You're never mean, but you're never that kind
You're never mean, but you're never that kind
You're never mean, but you're never that kind
