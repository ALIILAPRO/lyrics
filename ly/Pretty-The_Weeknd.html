		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man, finally
I knew this day would come, woah oh, oh
'Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land you're mine (mhm, mhm)
It's been exactly three sixty-five since I've seen your face (あったかいね)
I've been living on the road
And you've been living all alone, at home
Girl I hope
He made you satisfied (気持ちいい)
Well, baby I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there

There are certain things that I've come to understand (ah, ooh)
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman woah oh
I try to master the art
Of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
(Warm, ooh)
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
(Say to myself)
We've been living in a cold, cold world
Cold world
But at least I have you to rely (気持ちいい)
Even if for a short time (うん 気持ちいい)
As long as you know when I land you're mine

And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
Oh, when I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there

Ah (no, no-no)
Ah (no, no-no)
Ah (no, no, no, no, no)
Ah (oh oh oh ah)
Ooh (hoo, hoo, hoo)
Ooh (hoo, hoo, hoo)
Ooh (oh babe) (oh, oh)

Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh

And you will never feel so pretty (pretty)
And you will never feel this beautiful (beautiful, oh)
When I make it there (when I make it there)
Oh when I make it there (hey)
And he can't make you feel this pretty (pretty)
No he won't make you feel this beautiful (beautiful) (hoo, hoo, hoo)
When I make it there (when I make it there baby) (oh baby)
Oh, when I make it there (hoo, hoo, hoo)

And you will never feel so pretty (pretty) (oh babe, no you won't)
And you will never feel this beautiful (beautiful) (hoo, hoo, hoo, eh)
When I make it there (when I make it there) (hey)
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty (baby)
And he won't make you feel this beautiful (oh babe)
When I make it there (when I make it there) (hey)
When I make it there
When I make it there

Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveaux
Dix ans mon ami, que ne rien d'autre compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé
Une douleur très profonde
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue
Seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans
