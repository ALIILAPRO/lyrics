		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sit down with an old friend
Like time it never stopped
From the cradle to the coffin
We drink until we drop
Yeah, we grew up on the same street
Small town under the hill, yeah
But dreams get lost and buried down
Deep inside the soil there, yeah

All day all night
Keep pressing rewind
All day all night
I remember
All day all night
Keep pressing rewind
All day all night
I remember

We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
Looking back in the rear view mirror
You know the view used to be much clearer
But we'll laugh and we'll cry
Till there's no more tears
Yea tonight can we just hold on to those 18 years
18 years

Some ran down the highway
To chase away their ghosts
Some frozen in the same place
This time inside their bones
Remember throwing TVs off the overpass onto the tracks, yeah
But the trains roll on through the small towns and never looked back, and yeah

All day all night
Keep pressing rewind
All day all night
I remember
All day all night
Keep pressing rewind
All day, tell me do you remember

We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
Looking back in the rear view mirror
You know the view used to be much clearer
But we'll laugh and we'll cry
Till there's no more tears
Yea tonight can we just hold on to those 18 years
18 years yeah

Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on (To those 18 years)
Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on?
18 years, 18 years, yeah

We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
We were building a bridge
Out of broken dreams
We were crashing like cars
When we were 18

We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
Looking back in the rear view mirror
You know the view used to be much clearer
But we'll laugh and we'll cry
Till there's no more tears
Yea tonight, can we just hold on to those 18 years

Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on (Oh yeah, those 18 years)
Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on?
Can we just hold on?
Oh those 18 years
