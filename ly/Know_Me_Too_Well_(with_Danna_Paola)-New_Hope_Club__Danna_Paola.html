		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-ah, ah-ah (ah-ah, ah-ah)

I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell (good but you can tell)

You're right, I shoulda text you goodnight
I shoulda given more time
I wish I had've known this before
Now I'm replaying our goodbye
But it wasn't a goodbye
And I still hear you slamming the door

Try to hit you up, but you've had enough
You're screaming down the phone
"You don't know what you lost"
I say, "I'm fine," I didn't care that much
But I realize when you hang up, I messed this up

I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell (uh)
'Cause you know me too, you know me too well

Ah-ah-ah-ah
You know me too well
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Lo puedo dejar para mí, jamás volverte a llamar
But baby no puedo engañarme a mí misma, no
Porque cada vez que me oyes, yo sé que tú me lees
Lo mejor será dejarte ir, y olvidarte

Try to hit you up, but he had enough
Just screaming down the phone
"You don't know what you lost"
I say, "I'm fine," I didn't care that much
But I realise when you hang up, I messed this up

I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell (uh)
'Cause you know me too, you know me too well

Ah-ah-ah-ah
You know me too well
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Oh, if we could take it back
Baby, if I could, then I would (I would)
I would give you all I have
Baby, if I could, then I would (I would)

I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, I can't make it stop
Tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell
Mm, I'm not
I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell
'Cause you know me, you know me too well (you know me too well)

Ah-ah-ah-ah
You know me too well
Ah-ah-ah-ah
You know me too well
Ah-ah-ah-ah
You know me too well
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Solo tú me conoces tan bien
