		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hurt i done fell in love
I done fell in love
I done fell in love with the dope game
With the dope game with the dope game

In the trap house whippin' up a whole key
(What?) turn two thang to a four piece
(Whip, whip, whip)
Niggas say they got shooters, well show me
(Show me)
Got shooters on a squad like Kobe (Like Kobe)
In my left pocket, 'bout a whole thang
(Bricks, nigga)
This ain't rap money this off cocaine
(Trap, nigga)
I done fell in love with the dope game
(Dope game)
I done fell in love with the dope game
(With the dope game)

Mansion trapping fuck abandon
(Skrr, skurkskurskur)
Baby don't you see my wrist how it's dancin'
(Bling, bling)
They like damn Chief Sosa, why you flexin'?
(Why you flexin', Sosa?)
'Cause I member all the times
I ain't had shit (I ain't had nothin')
Remember pullin' up, Volvo
Posted on FrontStreet sellin' coco
(FrontStreet, ayy, ayy)
Bitch, I smoke dope, I don't snort dope
(I don't snort it)
Bitch, I sell coke, I don't snort coke
(I don't snort it)
I ain't give no fuck if I was trappin'
(I was trappin')
Pull up on a opp block and get to clappin'
(Get to clappin', bang bang)
Couple bands on my clothes and my MAC-10
(Bands)
I'm a shoot a muthafucka through this fashion
(Bang, bang, bang)

In the trap house whippin' up a whole key
(What?) turn two thang to a four piece
(Whip, whip, whip)
Niggas say they got shooters, well show me
(Show me)
Got shooters on a squad like Kobe (Like Kobe)
In my left pocket, 'bout a whole thang
(Bricks, nigga)
This ain't rap money this off cocaine
(Trap, nigga)
I done fell in love with the dope game
(Dope game)
I done fell in love with the dope game
(With the dope game)

In the trap house whippin' all this cocaine
(Cocaine)
Hit the lean man up, I need two thangs
(Two bricks, nigga)
So bossed up, bitches tie my shoe strings
(Bossed up, nigga)
Who is you? I can't serve you
You lookin' too strange (Too strange)
Call up Lil' Moochie like to shoot thangs
40 cal kickin' bullets just like Liu Kang
Niggas gettin' young money
Call 'em Mack Maine
Watch this choppa flip some
Cars while I'm shootin' (Graah)
Frontstreet 061 that's my domain (061)
'Member posted on the block
With three dope names (Three dope names)
Sellin' all the fiends while I'm toting
(I'm toting) i ain't give a fuck long
As the money comin' in (Trap, trap)

In the trap house whippin' up a whole key
(What?) turn two thang to a four piece
(Whip, whip, whip)
Niggas say they got shooters, well show me
(Show me)
Got shooters on a squad like Kobe (Like Kobe)
In my left pocket, 'bout a whole thang
(Bricks, nigga)
This ain't rap money this off cocaine
(Trap, nigga)
I done fell in love with the dope game
(Dope game)
I done fell in love with the dope game
(With the dope game)
