		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been broke (yeah) , I been rich
I always chose the latter
Start the foreign whips
No matter what the weather
Mama think I'm better
My plug been gettin' clever
My bitches getting wetter
(Wet, wet, wet, wet)
Yeah, they know (yeah, they know)
I'm the man where I come from, woah
(yeah, they know)
I took your main ting and your side ho (yeah)
How you feel, how you feel you let them go?

Now they in my bedroom getting backstrokes
(Backstrokes)
That's just how I move, moving tender
I been pinging for a week (O oh)
Killing serotonins when you're with me
(O oh) yeah, yeah, I approve (I approve)
Baby, get loose (Get loose)
Grab that bottle, pour a glass of the goose
(No chase) she loves the buzz (Buzz)
She loves the camera (yeah)
The way she strippin' that Fendi
I gotta film her (Straight jawn)
Her skin like mocha (Straight porn)
She way too bad, she don't fuck with coco
(No, no) stand on the table while I
Make that Henny pour (Yah)
Pour it straight into her mouth
Niagara Falls

I been broke (yeah) , I been rich
I always chose the latter
Start the foreign whips
No matter what the weather
Mama think I'm better
My plug been getting clever
My bitches gettin' wetter
(Wet, wet, wet, wet)
Yeah, they know (yeah, they know)
I'm the man where I come from, woah
(yeah, they know)
I took your main ting and your side ho (yeah)
How you feel, how you feel you let them go?

You want a bad bitch, but you way too cheap
You can't trust them
Stay awake in your sleep
I just pulled that Ghost and it's all for me
I just took your girl and she all for me
Pour me up my drink, don't you hold back
Take it off for me, let me hold that
Time to show her how it goes
How it sound when you punch the Lambo

Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt

I might splurge you with some bands
Tell me what the plan is put you in Chanel
Put you in CÃ©line and Burberry
Hotel room looking like DOA (yeah)
We too V-Live (For real)
Moving too fast, I can't tell the time
