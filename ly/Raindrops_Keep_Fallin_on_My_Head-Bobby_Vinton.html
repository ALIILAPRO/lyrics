		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raindrops keep falling on my head 
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed 
Nothing seems to fit 
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling 

So I just did me some talking to the sun 
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done 
Sleeping on the job 
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling 

But there's one thing I know 
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me 
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me 

Raindrops keep falling on my head 
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red 
Crying's not for me 
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining 
Because I'm free 
Nothing's worrying me 

It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me 

Raindrops keep falling on my head 
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red 
Crying's not for me 
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining 
Because I'm free 
Nothing's worrying me
