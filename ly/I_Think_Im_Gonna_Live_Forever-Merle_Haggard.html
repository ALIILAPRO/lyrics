		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you first left me baby 
I thought I would surely lose my mind
Everyday of life was just another day gone by
Well you really had me down in a deep depression
I wanted real bad just to crawl off and die
But now I think I'm gonna live forever 
Hey dyin' ain't on my list of things to do
I think I'm gonna live forever 
Hey it feels so good 
Just to be out of love with you

Hey, babe, you left me hanging 
Just trying to aggravate me all the way
And you got it done just the way you always do
But all you really did was aggravate me 
Cause I got my health and I got over you
And now I think I'm gonna live forever 
Hey dyin' ain't on my list of things to do
I think I'm gonna live forever 
Hey it feels so good 
Just to be out of love with you
