		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's smoke
Smoke a cigarette in bed together
In bed together
Just a metaphor 
For all the ways that we see each other
We see each other
I keep on pulling you in, holding my breath
Long as I can, 'til I need to exhale
And it can't be good for you
No, it can't be good

We gotta go home 
We could just stay here and kick it
Got a lot to learn, 
But I don't want to admit it
Sorry to put you down
I'm up on us right now, let's hit it
Just trying to kick it like, let's kick it like
My bad, my bad, bad habits, yeah
My bad, my bad, bad habits

Let's call 
So let's call it what it is and have another
Have another
Against the wall 
And now you got my mind in the gutter
In the gutter
I keep on drinking you down
Cooling my thirst
Causing a scene and I'm slurring my words
And it can't be good for you
No, it can't be good

We gotta go home, 
We could just stay here and kick it
Got a lot to learn, 
But I don't want to admit it
Sorry to put you down
I'm up on us right now
Let's hit it
Just trying to kick it like, let's kick it like
My bad, my bad, bad habits, yeah
My bad, my bad, bad habits
My bad, my bad, bad habits, yeah

I wanna go home, no
I just wanna stay here
I just wanna stay here and kick it

We gotta go home
We could just stay here and kick it
Got a lot to learn
But I don't want to admit it
Sorry to put you down
I'm up on us right now
Let's hit it
Just trying to kick it like, 
Let's kick it like
My bad, my bad, bad habits, yeah
My bad, my bad, bad habits
Let's smoke 
Let's call it what it is and have another
Have another (my bad, my bad, bad habits)
