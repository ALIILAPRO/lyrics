		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In these days of man made wonders we still bicker over flies
When you come seeking for forgiveness, I'll be forced to choose my side

If I deny you what you're searching, do I do it out of fear
Am I ruling out my reason, killing that which I hold dear

Out of my way I'm running, with an excuse just underway
Reality's so daunting, and I've got no way to explain

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name, why do I turn away and run
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds, sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears

In the light of recent findings, there's no greater taint than grace
But to relinquish all our bindings, always finds us out of place

If I rested here a while more, would you hold me to your heart
If I knew what it's meant for, would I know to play my part

Out of my way I'm leaving, another excuse before I'll stay
Reality's applauding, I know I don't know the right way

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name, yeah, I know you're the one
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds, sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears

Is it a lost cause 
Can we overlook this taint
Are these the dead laws
Like a doubt eating the saint

And though I fear these shackles, like my darkness closing in
I will hold out my hands, I will hold out my hands

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name, I know the good I've done
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds, sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name, I know the good I've done
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds, sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears
