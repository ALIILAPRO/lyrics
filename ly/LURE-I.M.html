		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me all your time
'Cause I can't hide
Keep it on the low (ooh)
Keep it on the low, yeah
Sip me like a wine
I'll treat you right
Pour it more 'til we slip the floor

참아 봐도 지금의 감정 can't let go (can't let go)
너도 알잖아 우리의 tempo
Think I'm so addicted to your scent
But your attitude is so wicked
No need to lie
Now feel me like you're blind

But I can't take it off, yeah
(But I can't take it off, yeah)
But I can't take it off, yeah
(But I can't take it off)
Tell me babe, is it a crime?
One bite, I can't satisfy
Keep it on the low
But I want them to know for sure

Give me all your time
'Cause I can't hide
Keep it on the low (ooh)
Keep it on the low, yeah
Sip me like a wine
I'll treat you right
Pour it more 'til we slip the floor

어제 했던 말들은 모두 다
기억하지만 maybe you forgot
I'll make you remember
Everything 'bout tonight
Deep breath, all messed
Now I can read your sign

어서 말해봐 내게
원하는 게 뭔지
없다면 난 teach it
올라간 너의 체온 I feel it
I'll keep it a secret
I'ma keep you lifted
오묘해진 우리의 눈빛
말을 하지 않아도 굳이
No need to lie
Now feel me like you're blind

But I can't take it off, yeah
(But I can't take it off, yeah)
But I can't take it off, yeah
(But I can't take it off)
Tell me babe, is it a crime?
One bite, I can't satisfy
Keep it on the low
But I want them to know for sure

Give me all your time
'Cause I can't hide
Keep it on the low (ooh)
Keep it on the low, yeah
Sip me like a wine
I'll treat you right
Pour it more 'til we slip the floor

Want them to know for sure
Can't keep it on the low
Babe, can you love me out loud? (Oh)
