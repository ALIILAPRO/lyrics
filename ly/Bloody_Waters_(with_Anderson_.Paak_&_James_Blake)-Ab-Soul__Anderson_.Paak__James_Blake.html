		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet the man in the mask
Meet the man in the mask

All those days and all that stays and
I don't keep it
I won't be here for it
All those days and all that stays and
I don't keep it though
I won't be here for it

Yes Lord, huh
Hail Mary's in the sky
Bossed up, let's get buried alive
Head on the throne 'cause that's where I reside (reside)
Ways of the world that we won't survive
Something's in the water (water)
My nigga we lawless (lawless)
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? (Fairway)
Damn right I need all this (all this)
Yeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy

Hittas acquitted with fingerprints on the Glock
Screamin' we gon' make it like two-thirds of The LOX
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Blah blah, he comes, blah blah

Blood on my hands I'ma need hot agua
You gon' meet your maker I won't say it in Patois
Hope I strike a nerve like a pack of matches
You might wanna bypass, this smoke ain't gas trick
A prince-turned-pauper trying to do like kings do
Sweating in chess games try move like kings move
You should slow your roll before you drown in the moat
He tried to channel balance but never found the remote
Killers on the prowl still juggin' off a lick
Stealing, with a double for his 
Common politics, everlasting mayhem
Draw to stick you for your figures, that's how they hang man
So what's your game plan, if you got one?
You aimin' at passengers with a shotgun? (Woah)
The aftermath is you in the scope
It's warfare, is war fair? (No)
You understand? It's probably better you don't
Just keep a dock on standby, charter a boat
Ship set sailing, planes depart
The big picture's in motion, are you playing your part?
Before the lights get dark and the curtains get closed
Are you playing your role?
As told by an organized criminal
And general, get off my genitals, I got your general

Hail Mary's in the sky
Bossed up, let's get buried alive
Head on the throne 'cause that's where I reside (reside)
Ways of the world that we won't survive
Something's in the water (the water)
My nigga we lawless (lawless)
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? (Fairway)
Damn right I need all this (all this)
Yeah, Jack, I need all this

I had to be about 9 when I first had seen it
Low lows pulled up outside of the Ralph's
After a car show at Dominguez
They had a disagreement, they had to air out
Just another day in Del Amo
Fo' sho man down, mando
Thank God I never had to knock your partner off
Or be an another casualty of war, Amen
There's 4 footprints in the sand where I walk
I never claimed to be a saint at all
Four Russians trippin' with hollow tips
And a Kalashnikov, ain't that y'all
No, Soulo hoe, kept it clean
Riding dirty, jury would have gave me thirty
Herbie love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded
Electorial college devoted
To hit the score, to write the score, that's not a metaphor
Raging against the machinery, taping up the scenery
You gotta keep the piece, to keep the peace
Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleaning fee

I don't need you to change
I don't need you to change yourself (get, get away)
But I've got get away (get, get away)
But I've got get away from it all
Be as free as you can
Be as free as you can away from me
I tried to be a saint like everybody else
