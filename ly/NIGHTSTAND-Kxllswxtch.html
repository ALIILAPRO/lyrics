		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't act like you care, bitch
I'ma be just fine took a chance with you
I guess I'm not that wise
Staring in the mirror at the man I despise
Talkin' to my friends, that's me, myself
And I

Why you filling lies in my head?
(Oh yeah, yeah)
Toss and turn around in my bed
(Oh yeah, yeah)
Loaded pistol on my nightstand
(Oh yeah, yeah)
With a bullet calling my name
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

Back n forth sick n tired bitch I'm fed up
Shorty suck me in the back of the Benz truck
Took his bitch now he wanna catch a head up
Toe to toe and if I lose I
Hope he got a vest uh
Ain't the one you want to play with
Parasail with a breeze you catching my drift
Swiffer shorty wanna clean the
Spit off my dick
Gotta little bit a bread n my
Phone ain't been dry since
Novocane y'all ain't feeling my pain
Take his life tryna play with my fate
Same ones ones tryna plot on my grave
Be the same motherfuckers wanna
Smile in my face
Y'all ain't shit y'all could portray
Counterfeit y'all Imitate
Everybody throw stones till it ricochet home
It don't feel so good when
Your glass house break huh

Why you filling lies in my head?
Toss and turn around in my bed
Loaded pistol on my nightstand
With a bullet calling my name
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't act like you care, bitch
I'ma be just fine took a chance with you
I guess I'm not that wise
Staring in the mirror at the man I despise
Talkin' to my friends, that's me, myself
And I

Why you filling lies in my head?
(Oh yeah, yeah)
Toss and turn around in my bed
(Oh yeah, yeah)
Loaded pistol on my nightstand
(Oh yeah, yeah)
With a bullet calling my name
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
