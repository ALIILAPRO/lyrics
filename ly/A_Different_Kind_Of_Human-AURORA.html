		  Hello? Hello?
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Hello?

Are you awake or are you sleeping?
Are you afraid? We've been waiting for this meeting
Oh, Superman, are you with me when I am too weak?
Oh, Mother, are you dreaming of me in your sleep?

We have come here for you, and we're coming in peace
Mothership will take you on higher, higher
This world you live in is not a place for someone like you
Come on, let us take you home

It's time to go, you are infected
Come as you are, don't be scared of us, you'll be protected
(Protected, protected)
I guess you are a different kind of human
I guess you are a different kind of human

We have come here for you, and we're coming in peace
Mothership will take you on higher, higher
This world you live in is not a place for someone like you
Come on, let us take you home

Omega hai foleet, Omega hai foleet
Omega toneca, Omega for let in
Omega hai foleet, Omega hai foleet
Omega toneca, Omega for let in

There is a flaw in man-made matters
But you are pure, and we have to get you out of here

We have come here for you, and we're coming in peace
Mothership will take you on higher, higher
This world you live is not a place for someone like you
Come on let us take you home
We have come here for you, and we're coming in peace
Mothership will take you on higher, higher
This world you live is not a place for someone like you
Come on, let us take you home

Omega hai foleet, Omega hai foleet
Omega toneca, Omega for let in
Omega hai foleet, Omega hai foleet
Omega toneca, Omega for let in

Hello? Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone out there?
Am I home? Am I home?
