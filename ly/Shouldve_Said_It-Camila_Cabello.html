		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a, back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed and I'm all good now
Someone else is gettin' all of me
If you wanted me so desperately
You should've said it

Show up at my door, but I don't live there anymore
Sendin' me your songs, but they don't really sound like before
I was crazy for you, all caught up and confused
Love was broken for me, now it's broken for you

You're only lonely, now you ain't the one that hold me
Only lonely now

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a, back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed and I'm all good now
Someone else is gettin' all of me
If you wanted me so desperately
You should've said it

Isn't it something? That I get more when I'm giving you nothing? Huh
Isn't it magic? That when you stop lookin' for it, it happens?
Baby, he fell from grace, landed right in your place
Kissed me so many times that I forgot your taste

You're only lonely, now you ain't the one that hold me
Only lonely now, now

So you want me now? That's funny (hey)
'Cause you didn't give a, back then
Comin' back around, so sorry (around)
'Cause there's no room in my bed and I'm all good now
Someone else is gettin' all of me
If you wanted me so desperately
You should've said it
You should've said it, love
Should've said it
Should've said it, love

I wish that you could turn back the time
You hold me closer, instead of your pride
I knew it was you from the very first night
And it took you two years to make up your mind

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a, back then
Comin' back around, so sorry (hey)
'Cause there's no room in my bed and I'm all good now
Someone else is gettin' all of me
If you wanted me so desperately
You should've said it (oh)
You should've said it, love (uh)
Should've said it (oh)
Should've said it, love

So you want me now, now baby?
So you want me now, now baby?
So you want me now, now?
You should've said it
Should've said it, love
