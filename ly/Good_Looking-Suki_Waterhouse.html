		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tides thrash inside, baby, I'm high octane
Fever in a shock wave
My core vibrates in an opium haze
Yet you think we're the same

The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy

Play casino halls on one of my eyeballs
Roll the dice on my thighs
You stopped for breath and I sped up
Just to impress you

The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy

My good looking boy
My good looking boy
My good looking boy
Oh, my good looking boy

You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone
You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone, these days
I'm not who I am to anyone, no, not me at all
I'm not who I am to anyone these days, not at all

The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all (not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns, out there's more (not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
(Not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy
