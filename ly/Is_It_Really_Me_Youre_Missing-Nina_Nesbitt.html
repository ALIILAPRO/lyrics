		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen? Mmm
All of these high hopes and low blows
I hope you know
Just how much it hurts to believe you
I should cut this off, but I need you
I should help myself
But I can't help myself

Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen to you?
And if I pick up the phone tonight
Will it be pieces by the morning?
Am I the only number that you've tried?
Or is it just another lonely night?

Everybody tells me what I should've done now
'Cause I only ever tell them when you're letting me down
Oh, high hopes and low blows
I hope you know
Just how much I've wanted to leave you
But there's nobody else that can be you
I should help myself

Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen to you?
And if I pick up the phone tonight
Will it be pieces by the morning?
Am I the only number that you've tried?
Or is it just another lonely night?

Is it really me?
And if you turn all the lights off
And put your hands on my body
Could I be just anybody?
(Is it really me?)
And when you get what you wanted
Is that the end of the story?
I know you'll never be sorry
Until it's really me you're missing

Is it really me you're missing?
Or am I the only one who'll listen to you?
And if I pick up the phone tonight
Will it be pieces by the morning?
Am I the only number that you've tried?
Or is it just another lonely night?

Is it really me you're missing?
Is it really me?
Is it really me?
