		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If could know what you're thinking
If could know what you're thinking
Tell me it's real, what you're singing
Tell me I'm good, I'm forgiven
I feel like you're cold, and you're distant
Whenever we talk, you're consistent
If I could know
If I could know

What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking

I'm overdoing it now
It used to come so easily but now I think you've broken me
I've got my head in a cloud
Remembering the warmer days we spent
If could know what you're thinking
I could learn to do everything right
Wish I could know how to fix it
But that's just not the way I live my life

What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
Thinking, thinking, thi-think, thinking
Thinking, thinking, thi-think, thinking

When you're with me
I just breathe so quickly
The sky is low and things are changing
Can you help me figure out my feelings?
'Cause clarity is not in love with me
Not in love with me
Not in love with me
Oh
We're not in love
Can you help me figure out my feelings?
We're not in love
