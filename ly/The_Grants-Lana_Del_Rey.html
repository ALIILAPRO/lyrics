		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine with you with me
Ah, "Mine," say it again
"Mine of you with me," thank you
One more time

One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like Rocky Mountain High
The way John Denver sings

So you say there's a chance for us
Should I do a dance for once?
You're a family man, but, but

Do you think about Heaven? Oh
Do you think about me?
My pastor told me
"When you leave, all you take
Oh, is your memory"

And I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me

So many mountains too high to climb
So many rivers, so long, but I'm
Doin' the hard stuff, I'm doin' my time
I'm doin' it for us, for our family line

Do you think about heaven? Oh
Do you think about me?
My pastor told me (I'll do it, I'll do it)
"When you leave, all you take (I did it, I did it)
Oh, is your memories"

And I wanna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Yeah, I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like Rocky Mountain High
The way John Denver sings

My sister's first-born child
I'm gonna take that too with me
My grandmother's last smile
I'm gonna take that too with me
It's a beautiful life
Remember that too, for me
