		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time when I knew nothing about
Hatred, rejection, intolerance, pain, abuse, as it turns out
I know these things
They’re all you bring
There was a time when hope shined

How could you leave me alone
Abandoned and then disowned
Never even had a name
You forgot me all the same
I choose my own home

There was a child who loved everything outside and in
There was a time when my light started to dim
I know these things
I’m so empty
There was a time when hope died

How could you leave me alone
Abandoned and then disowned
Never even had a name
You forgot me all the same
I choose my own home

This is for the losers
This is for the freaks
This is for the broken
Forgotten and diseased
This is for the outcast
This is for the widows son
This is for all of us
Abandoned

I’m not motherfucking angry 
I’m not angry anymore
I’m not fucking crazy
I’m not crazy anymore

How could you leave me alone
Now I got you listening motherfucker
Abandoned and then disowned
You fucking threw me away
Never even had a name
Bitch
You forgot me all the same
Fuck you
I choose my own home
I choose my own home

Fuck you

I don’t wanna motherfucking kill you
