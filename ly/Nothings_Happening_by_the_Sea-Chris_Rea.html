		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Salty river
Falls asleep in the bay
Always gets there
Never early, never late

Nothing's happening
Nothing's happening by the sea

White waves tumble down
And gently roll back into blue
On wooden seats outside the bar
The couples make their rendezvous

Nothing's happening
Nothing's happening by the sea

The trouble has been found
There's too far ups and too many downs
I found a level that feels just right
There's no mistaking where I'm going tonight

Nothing's happening
Nothing's happening by the sea
