		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These niggas is wildin' right now, like, these niggas is really wildin'
You know what I'm sayin'? Like, we ain't playin' with y'all niggas, man, you heard?
Sometimes you just gotta catch chlamydia on these niggas, G shit
You know what I'm saying? Gonorrhea, all of that shit
All of that shit
I catch all diseases in the world so the world don't have no more diseases, you feel me?
G shit
P. Soul on the track

I'm as real as they come, they feel it, get numb
You think you got a little buzz so now you can't get stung
I keep a razor blade tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of hardest ever
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas
And bomb whatever
Say we don't move calmly never
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort, no pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxing these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya

Murder these flows like I murder these hoe ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy bro?
Make your nigga deep throat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a hoe, pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shape shift, cold expression like a facelift
At the Publix with like eight grips, if you talking all that ape shit
I'm not talking YM Bape shit, but I'm banging on my chest bitch
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Travelin' through the infinity, uh
You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit and entity, uh
You just wanna suck all my energy, uh
I am the realest since Kennedy, uh
You pussy ass niggas fucking suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why the young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane

Spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more
I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
So I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no -
I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more
I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
So I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more
