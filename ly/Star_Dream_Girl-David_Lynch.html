		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crank up that radio, let me 
Tell y'all a story
They're coming from all around 
Flying down that wide highway
Coming like crowds like never before
Her being the one they can't wait to see

Every night they come, to dream of her
Star dream girl, star dream girl

Crank up that radio, let me 
Tell y'all a story
They're coming from all around 
Flying down that wide highway
Coming like crowds like never before
Her being the one they can't wait to see

Star dream girl, star dream girl
Every night they come, to dream of her
