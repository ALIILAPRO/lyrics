		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place another time
Touching many hearts along the way yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say

It's just an illusion, illusion, illusion

Follow your emotions anywhere
Is it really magic in the air
Never let your feelings get you down
Open up your eyes and look around

It's just an illusion, illusion, illusion

Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion now
Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion now

Could it be a picture in my mind
Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams I turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone

It's just an illusion, illusion, illusion

Illusion, illusion, illusion, illusion

Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion now
Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion now

Could it be that
Putting me back
Could it be that
Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion now

Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion now

Could it be that it's just an illusion
Putting me back in all this confusion
Could it be that it's just an illusion now
