		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many times I've been let down
To the point where love made no sound
Then you came and love moved back in
Now it's my turn to give back again
I want you to know that

I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please

So many people wasted my time
Too bad I couldn't
See behind their smiles
Are you an angel in disguise
Cause you made me realize

You will always be my best friend
Cause you gave me the
Strength to go on again
I want you to know that

I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Cause you were always there for me
You were always there, baby
So let me return the favor, please
Let me, let me, baby

I owe it all (I owe it all)
To you (to you)
Baby love, what can I do
(What can I do)

I owe it all (I owe it all)
To you (to you)
And I'll do anything for you

I said if loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
No, not tonight
Never wanna fight
Baby, only you can make it right

Me say, fans them follow me
Boys them bother me
Girls them watch me
Kids adore me
Still I put God before me

Me say, Arista love me
Number one company
Big up to me family
Cause only you have spoiled me

I'm here for you
(Whenever you need someone)
When you need someone too
(When you need)

Always there for me (always)
So let me return the favor, please
(Let me, let me)

I'm here for you
(Well, you know you can find me)
Need someone too
(I'll fill your every need)

Always there for me
(I will be your everything)
So let me return the favor, please

(I want you to know that)
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
(When you need)
Always there for me
(Yeah, oh, yeah)
So let me return the favor, please

(I want you to know that)
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please
