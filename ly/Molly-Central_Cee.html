(I-I-I Love Chris Rich)

Gyal wan' come round 'ere
Them boy round dere too bummy
And we get money (we get paid)
Dem man broke, as a joke
It's not even funny
Can't answer the phone
I'm with my side ting, now my main ting worried
Jeet and skeet, I'ma call right back
I just seen your missed call, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
Put my mum through too much drama (my bad)
Maybe I shoulda went colle'
Too much time in the trap
But now, when I shop, I fill that trolley (fill that)
On the field, I do it like Costa
Give the assist, I hit that volley
I'm the reason the party tun'
I was the one givin' out Molly

All this label talk is drainin'
Got A&Rs actin' friendly
Tryna get me to sign these papers (okay, okay)
Man said, "Twenty-one with a mill'" (swear)
I need the same deal as Aitch's
What the fuck do you mean 'bout, "Twenty bags"?
I spent that shit on trainers
What the fuck do you mean 'bout, "A hundred bags"?
Huh? Take your pen back (take that back)
Why you talkin' shit?
I'm not dissin' DBE, blud, I'm ratin' dem man (haha)
I'm just not really ratin' the followin' ting
Goin' on right now, I'm a leader
Can't lie, it's 'bout time that they took me in
Spend 'bout five years in the T house
But, the hard work pays off (pays off)
Nah, I can't take days off (days off)
Lotta man got things to say
Remember, the talk don't cost
I got what the rappers got
I don't even rap a lot
Too clean, I'm immaculate
You wouldn't think I'm in the trap a lot (hmm-hmm, anyways)
Balls deep in a bitch, I'm all in
No bowlin', free yard, who's rollin'?
Who's that wit' a back, wait, hold on
Mandem way in the back just scopin' (who's that? Who's that?)
She's likin' my recent posts
Send that post-code, I'm roastin'
All I do is make money, I'm borin'
South parked up, now I'm just postponin'

Gyal wan' come round 'ere
Them boy round dere too bummy
And we get money (we get paid)
Dem man broke, as a joke
It's not even funny
Can't answer the phone
I'm with my side ting, now my main ting worried
Jeet and skeet, I'ma call right back
I just seen your missed call, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
Put my mum through too much drama (my bad)
Maybe I shoulda went colle'
Too much time in the trap
But now, when I shop, I fill that trolley (fill that)
On the field, I do it like Costa
Give the assist, I hit that volley
I'm the reason the party tun'
I was the one givin' out Molly

I'm the reason the party lit
Tryna squeeze four tings in the whip at Lib
She bad, gonna shake that back for the vid
Bad bitch gonna make that trip for the kid
Cute one in the hood like Rich
Boujee one in SW6
See the camera flash, no wait
Cover my face, I don't wanna be in your pics
Didn't show that ho no love
Now she wanna set me up
All 'cause I fucked and ducked, didn't call her back
Now she wanna see man get touched
The life I live's all nuts
Think I'm mad, you should meet my pups
Ain't been with the gang as much
One up in the cut with the grub, no fuss

Gyal wan' come round 'ere
Them boy round dere too bummy
And we get money (we get paid)
Dem man broke, as a joke
It's not even funny
Can't answer the phone
I'm with my side ting, now my main ting worried
Jeet and skeet, I'ma call right back
I just seen your missed call, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
Put my mum through too much drama (my bad)

Too much time in the trap

On the field, I do it like Costa
Give the assist, I hit that volley
I'm the reason the party tun'
I was the one givin' out Molly

I'm the reason the party lit
Tryna squeeze four tings in the whip at Lib
I'm the reason the party lit
Tryna squeeze four tings in the whip at Lib (I-I-I Love Chris Rich)
