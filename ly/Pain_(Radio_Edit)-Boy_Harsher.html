		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is it that you are doing here?
I know, I don't know
What is it that you are doing my dear?
I know, I don't know
I am gonna follow you tonight
All the way, all the way home
I am gonna find you in the night
All the way, all the way home

You see me you see a stranger
I see you I see danger
Pain, always pain
Pain, always pain

Pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain

Pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain

Where were you when I was out of line?
I know, I don't know
You and me in your thoughts, alone
So it goes, so it goes

I am needing this from you tonight
Your side, your dark side
I want you to turn off the light
Your side, your dark side

Pain, I love pain
Pain, I love pain
Pain, I love pain
Pain, I love pain

Pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain, pain
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm
Breaks the rhythm

Pain
