		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're back now at the jack-off hour, this is DJ EZ Dicc
On WBALLZ, right now, somethin' new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gon' make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loc'd and looney, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD? You hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' that I learnt in Tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this ho
Just to lay this ho?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothin' else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe, you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (uh-huh)
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop Doggy?
I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love 'em

Woo! Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo', red to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up bitch because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (woo)

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

(Soul)
