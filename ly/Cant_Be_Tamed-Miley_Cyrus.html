		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Rock mafia
For those who don't know me
I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way yep
Twenty four hours a day
'Cause I'm hot like that

Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always get a ten 'cause I'm built like that

I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man understand

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't can't, I can't can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

If there is a question about my intentions
I'll tell ya I'm not here to sell ya
Or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this
We can make some magic I'm on like that

I wanna fly I wanna drive I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't can't, I can't can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

Well I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired the different way
I'm not a mistake I'm not a fake
It's set in my DNA
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me (I can't be tamed)

I wanna fly I wanna drive I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't can't, I can't can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
