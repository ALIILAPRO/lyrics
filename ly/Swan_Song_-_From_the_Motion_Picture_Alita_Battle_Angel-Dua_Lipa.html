		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I can't lie
I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothin' at all?
Nothin' at all
What is the point
Of my lips if they don't make noise? Uh
What is the point of doin' nothin' at all?
Watchin' it fall

The flicker burning
You know the time is runnin', runnin' out
Only I see
Oh, the diamonds, diamonds breakin' down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause stayin' silent's the same as dyin'
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burnin' low

This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song
Swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

Real fantasy
Wishin' it was make-believe, uh
What is the reason of doin' nothin' at all?
Watchin' it fall

The flicker burning
You know the time is runnin', runnin' out
Only I see
Oh, the diamonds, diamonds breakin' down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause stayin' silent's the same as dyin'
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burnin' low

This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song
Swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

Tread heavily around you
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread

This is not a, this is not a
Swan (tread heavily)
Swan song (tread)
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (tread heavily)
Swan song (tread)
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song
Swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

It's a new life
