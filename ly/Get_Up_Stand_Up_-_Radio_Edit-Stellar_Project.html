		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No-one can hear the things I whisper
No-one but you can hear the sound of my soul
Don't run away from me, I need you
I'm gonna follow you, wherever you go

Stay with me forever
Call my name and I'll be there
Follow me where ever
I will fly(?)

Get up, stand up,
Open your eyes,
Take me to the limit
Never let me go.
Don't cry, don't lie,
Open your mind
Come and take me over 
Make me feel alright.
(Repeat twice)

I feel I'm fading like the sunset,
Two moons softly, slowly into the sea
You are the stars on my, horizon
And you are always where, I need you to be.

Get up, stand up,
Open your eyes,
Take me to the limit
Never let me go.
Don't cry, don't lie,
Open your mind
Come and take me over 
Make me feel alright.

Get up, stand up,
Open your eyes,
Take me to the limit
Never let me go.
Don't cry, don't lie,
Open your mind
Come and take me over 
Make me feel alright.

Stay with me forever
Call my name and I'll be there 
Follow me wherever, I will fly.

Get up, stand up,
Open your eyes,
Take me to the limit
Never let me go.
Don't cry, don't lie,
Open your mind
Come and take me over 
Make me feel alright.

Get up, stand up,
Open your eyes,
Take me to the limit
Never let me go.
Don't cry, don't lie,
Open your mind
Come and take me over 
Make me feel alright.
