		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We poolside, toasting cocktails, catching tans
I can get my jewelry wet it cost a hundred bands
My phone never stop ringing I'm in high demand
I always get treated like the queen that I am
Never worked 9-5's, I got pretty privilege
Bad bitch run my own business
It ain't one hoe topping me I'm the littest
I'm a hard body bitch, it's survival of the fittest
Top knot bun, swoop bang, silver hoops
Top notch bitch, perfect frame, good cooch
Your hoe give every nigga attention the bitch loose
I'm not accessible baby I'm bullet proof
Scared money don't make money I'm taking risks
Why would I hate on a dusty old bitch
Thought you had tea on me, you was drinking piss
Bitches older than me, I call them lil sis
I'm his lil stepper, taught me everything I know
Having too much motion to entertain broke hoes
I ain't kicking it for free bitch that ain't how it goes
Get your weight up bitch and stop snorting coco
Behind every gangster, it's a bitch like me
Sexy gangster bitch talking to him spicy
I might be small but I'm real feisty
Wearing matching ski masks cause we both shiesty
We poolside, toasting cocktails, catching tans
I can get my jewelry wet it cost a hundred bands
My phone never stop ringing I'm in high demand
I always get treated like the queen that I am
Never worked 9-5's, I got pretty privilege
Bad bitch run my own business
It ain't one hoe topping me I'm the littest
I'm a hard body bitch, it's survival of the fittest
His bitch a trophy wife, so he flooded me in ice
Intelligent, attractive, and my pussy tight
Bag chaser that's toting guns, you know he my type
He fell asleep in it, we was off dirty sprite
Got the opps tucked in, bitches copping pleas
But my man yea he taking me on shopping sprees
One thing he gon do is really spoil me
Him having money is a plus it's bout the loyalty
And for them bitches speaking on me get y'all facts straight
Like them hand me downs y'all wearing y'all a few years late
I ran it up on that one shit for 3 years straight
You wasn't starving with me, can't eat off my dinner plate
Why you posting your brother cheese, you know it's not yours
You know I'm still putting on for them block hoes
Real 5 star go-er, real thot hoes
We in the paint doing skits dodging pot holes
Behind every gangster, it's a bitch like me
Sexy gangster bitch talking to him spicy
I might be small but I'm real feisty
Wearing matching ski masks cause we both shiesty
We poolside, toasting cocktails, catching tans
I can get my jewelry wet it cost a hundred bands
My phone never stop ringing I'm in high demand
I always get treated like the queen that I am
Never worked 9-5's, I got pretty privilege
Bad bitch run my own business
It ain't one hoe topping me I'm the littest
I'm a hard body bitch, it's survival of the fittest
You know I'm still putting on for them block hoes
Real 5 star go-er, real thot hoes
You know I'm still putting on for them block hoes
We in the paint doing skits dodging pot holes
