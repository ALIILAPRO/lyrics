		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go ahead and bark after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I-I am your escape

When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the Sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity

Souls that dream alone lie awake
I'll give you somethin' so real

If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Pull me oh-so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
