		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh it's on the roof, oh it's on the roof
Oh it's on the roof, and I can't see
Oh it's on the roof, oh it's on the roof
Oh it's on the roof, and I can't see
Oh it's on the roof, oh it's on the roof
Oh it's on the roof, and I can't see

When you're taking your time
When you're taking your time
When you're taking your time

Oh it's on the roof, oh it's on the roof
Oh it's on the roof, and I can't see

When you're taking your time
When you're taking your time
When you're taking your time

Oh it's on the roof, oh it's on the roof
Oh it's on the roof, and I can't see

When you're taking your time
When you're taking your time
When you're taking your time

Close your eyes and tell me what you see
The oil and the rain mix with the setting sun
After dark when I can't believe the sun
Could feel the whole world glory in a spotlight

Oh it's on the roof, oh it's on the roof
Oh it's on the roof, and I can't see
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark, like a new day

Oh it's on the roof, oh it's on the roof
Oh it's on the roof, and I can't see
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark, like a new day

Close your eyes and tell me what you see
I'm gonna do this
There's something glowing and my blood is bubbling

And it fills up the dark, like a new day, new day
