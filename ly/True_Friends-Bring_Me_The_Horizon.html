		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

It's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony
Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart
Right from the start
But I couldn't even see
The forest for the trees
(I'm afraid you asked for this)

You got a lot of nerve but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

It's kind of sad 'cause what we had
Well it could of been something
I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you
Try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded
Well hate is gasoline
A fire fueling all my dreams
(I'm afraid you asked for this)

You got a lot of nerve but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

You can run
But you can't hide
Time won't help you
'Cause karma has no deadline

You can run
But you can't hide
Time won't help you
'Cause karma has no deadline

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
