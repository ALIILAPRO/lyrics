		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the writing on the wall
But I'm not ready to let go
I know it's all been said and done
But nothing can compare with you

So go ahead, go on
Don't keep me waiting no more
Just go ahead and love me hard
Nothing can compare with you

You, you
Nothing can compare with you, no no
You, you

Nothing can compare with you, no no
Just love me little (love me)
Yeah, hold me little (little)
Make me feel you're all mine, (all mine) yeah

Just give me little (give me)
Yeah, hold me little
Nothing can compare with you

And all the things I said to hurt you (to hurt you)
You know I'd take them back if I could (yeah)
Just give me one more, one more chance (chance)
('Cause) nothing can compare with you, no

So go ahead (go ahead), go on (go on)
'Cause I've been waiting (I've been patient) way too long, yeah
Just go ahead and love me hard
Nothing can compare with you (oh, nothing)

You, (you) you
Nothing can compare with you, no no (nothing at all)
You (yeah), you
Nothing can compare with you, no
I made up my mind
Want every little piece of your heart now (want every piece) 
I made up my mind (my mind)
Nothing can compare with you (yeah)

Nothing can compare with you
Nothing can compare with you (nothing can compare)
Nothing can compare with you
Nothing, nothing, nothing at all

Someday, somehow
You will understand (you will understand) (hey)
Someday (someday), somehow (somehow), hey
You will

Someday (someday), somehow
You will understand, yeah
Someday, somehow (you)
You will
