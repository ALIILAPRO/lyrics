		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pit stop, here we go
Bucket off the pick and roll
She ain't fuckin', gotta go
We don't move with scary hoes

Last time a nigga shed a tear, that when Prince died
'Cause if we rockin', then you know we rockin' like it's Slipknot
See, this ain't basketball or halftime, we don't switch sides
She think she love me, but she fell in love with my rich side
I got it for less, flip that, then I got on a check
Dispatch, then we go on a race
Switch it up if that ho out of place
Mix it up, got a lot on my plate
Got the broccoli and cheese with the beef on the side
This ain't no regular steak
No one where I went richer than me, this shit ain't up for debate
Fuck, you shit out of luck
Maybach, laid back, matte black, just to shit on your truck
Huh, now I'm in the AMG with the all black tint
They don't know it's me, but they got a lil' hint
How you worried 'bout a nigga when you can't pay rent?
Huh, I been there
Lago and Buoy, I went there
Off MLK, used to live there
Basketball on the tear, used to win there
Up in a cell at seventeen
Back in jail with no bail at nineteen
Hampton Road with the lifers is at twenty
Made my first hundred-thousand at twenty-three
Now who is he, or who is she to speak on my name when you ain't me?
Why these niggas talkin'? I'm overseas
Biggie Smalls when I move, it was all a dream
Keep on talkin' and talkin', it pump me up
Call me lucky, I guess we got dummy luck
Give a nigga a play and ended his time, better believe he gon' fuck it up

Ayy, he might snitch on you too
Say that you was oppin', put that shit on YouTube
Why you always rappin' 'bout the shit that you do?
Why you always rappin' 'bout the shit that you do?
Ayy
If it's up like that (like that)
It's stuck like that (like that)
If it's (that)
If it's up like that (like that)
It's stuck like that (like that)

Sometimes, my feelings are blind, blind
Sometimes, I can't even give it a try
Sometimes, I keep it inside
But still, I cry
Still, I cry
