		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rhythm is a dancer 
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices 
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Rhythm is a dancer 
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices 
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
Oh 

How very like the future this place might be
It's a tiny world just big enough 
To support the cubicle of one knowledge worker
I feel a wave of loneliness and head back down
Now I'm going too fast

Rhythm is a dancer 
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices 
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
Oh

I plunge right on through the office door
And into the bottomless sinkhole below
Suddenly I can't remember how to stop or turn around
Do I point behind myself? 
Do I have to turn around before I can point? 
I flip into brain fugue

Rhythm is a dancer 
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices 
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
Oh
