		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From here all the world is a raging fire
I know You can see what I see
Well they'll have their way
Everyone breaking down
If we turn and we flee

All I know is I'd rather die than believe a lie (Live a lie)
I cannot follow the blind

We'll never back down
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming
As we press on
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming to life

These voices are making me lose my mind
I know You can hear what I hear
Well they'll have their way
Everyone's heart bled dry
If we turn and we flee

All I know is I'd rather die than believe a lie (Live a lie)
I cannot follow the blind

We'll never back down
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming
As we press on
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming to life

When darkness arrives
I cower and hide
But You found a way to pull me out
They come in the night
To take what is rightfully in the hands of every son and daughter

We'll never back down
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming
As we press on
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming to life
