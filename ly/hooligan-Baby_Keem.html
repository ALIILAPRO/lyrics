		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get the top while I skeet off, huh
Swervin' through lanes, I am limitless
For the ones down I say free all, huh
I start to question what freedom is
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
But these are not regular clothes
These are the outfits I make a movie in
Baby Keem countin' through Frito-Lay
I get the call and I go
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
I am above the buffoons, stop it
I am above all the rules
Look at my wrist, it say, "freeze, freeze"
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I stopped wearin' VVs
(Huh, huh, huh)
Please get the fuck out the pic (huh)
He got to fuck, and he got to fuck
So what is the use of my dick?
She wanna put on her jewelry and play with it
Like she's entitled to it
I'm done
Bitch, go to your room

I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah, fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes

I need another exit at the show
'Cause niggas be lurkin' when I hit the road, stupid
Y'all gotta deal with the boss
Y'all gotta talk to the ones that control, stupid
Even if I take a loss
I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
Take your credit, now you're toast, stupid
(Huh, huh)

I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah, fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes
