		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father, can You hear me now?
I'm feeling like I've let You down
I've lost the strength to turn myself around
I really hope You hear me now

How'd I get so far away?
What if I outrun Your grace?
Can You replace these broken yesterdays?
And promise me I'm not too late

Call me home, I want to be Your own
I'm running desperately into Your arms where I belong
And I know Your love can turn this heart
A hundred and eighty degrees to bring me back to where You are

Tell me I am welcomed in
Show me mercy doesn't end
Wash these muddy stains that marked my skin
And tell me I can start again

Call me home, I want to be Your own
I'm running desperately into Your arms where I belong
And I know Your love can turn this heart
A hundred and eighty degrees to bring me back to where You are

I can barely believe it
You're racing to meet me
Your eyes filled with healing, oh
Restoring, redeeming
Forgiving, receiving
This is my beginning, oh

And call me home, I want to be Your own
I'm running desperately into Your arms where I belong (I belong)
And I know Your love can turn this heart
A hundred and eighty degrees to bring me back to where You are

Woo-ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh
I'm running desperately, ooh
Ah-oh, oh, a hundred and eighty degrees, I'm back to where You are
A hundred and eighty degrees degrees
