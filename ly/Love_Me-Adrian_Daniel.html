		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was a lie
The way that you looked in my eyes
I felt myself crumble inside from the questions that lingered just tell me oh why
Tell me why I walked down this road
A hopelessly lingering soul
I stay when I know that your poison to me
But it feel so damn good fucking you fucking you
I’ve been working all night just to make it home
Just to deal with lies that you keep
It’s okay just as long as we’re all alone
There’s just one simple thing that I need
Just say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say that you
Say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say that you
I don’t care if you lie
I would pay any price for your love
You're all I know
Just say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say that you
Say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say that you
Think it’s time you decide
If I’m worth it tonight cause I’m done
If you don’t say that you love me
People always think they know me
Niggas always acting phony
All I know is that we been through it all
This ain’t a short story
More like a Quentin movie mixed with a psycho love scene
Fuck me like my little Harley
I ain’t joking baby clearly
I’ve been thinking it over
I’m a little more sober
From the memories that’s haunting me and making colder
Baby I think its time that we say it over
But I know it ain’t over girl I know it ain’t over
I’ve been working all night just to make it home
Just to deal with lies that you keep
It’s okay just as long as we’re all alone
There’s just one simple thing that I need
Just say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say that you
Say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say that you
I don’t care if you lie
I would pay any price for your love
You're all I know
Just say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say that you
Say that you love me
Say that you Say that you Say you you
Think it’s time you decide
If I’m worth it tonight cause I’m done
If you don’t
Say that you love me
Tell me what you need boo right away
I’ll do all you want too tell me babe
Tell me what you need boo right away
I’ll do all you want too tell me babe
Oh won’t you say that you
Clearly I need you
Tired of playing baby
Need you right away babe
Oh won’t you say that you
Clearly I need you all alone
Tired of playing baby
I need you right away babe all alone
