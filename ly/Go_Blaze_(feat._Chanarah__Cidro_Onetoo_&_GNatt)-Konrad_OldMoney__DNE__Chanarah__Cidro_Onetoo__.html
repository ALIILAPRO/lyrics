		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go , go
Get down
when Iʼm around
because the sound
go, go, go, shake that ass,
go, go, go, shake that ass,
go, go, go, shake that ass,
slap on dat ass, clap throw it back yuhhh

I was gone for a minute
Now I'm back for another
Let ME paint you a picture
Uh
Propane in the Winter
Snowflake in the Summer
No caking for dinner
Canʼt hang hit a chin-up
Stay Preying on a sinner
Whoa...
If I make it issa Winner
Put a Frank on my shit
Let it Bang in the whip
I don't break hits for nothing
Aye Zaddy
Keep on Tapping that Percussion Aye Flyboi he the shit
That keep em buzzing
Aye would I even say it if he wasn't Yʼall ainʼt hear me tho
Aye got the cuts
Yʼall ainʼt hear BEFOE
Aye thatʼs whassup
Keep it on the low
Aye see my brain
Like a crystal ball
Whoa...

Go , go
Get down
when Iʼm around
because the sound
go, go, go, shake that ass,
go, go, go, shake that ass,
go, go, go, shake that ass,
slap on dat ass, clap throw it back yuhhh

I been thinkin for a minute
from beginnin
to the end
and how im ever goin finish
yeah
then i started thinkin physics started movin like a psychic
I envisioned how to live it
donʼt make money my religion
keep faith in my decisions
whoa whoa
put the key in the ignition
octane in the engine
go , go
gotta see, gotta know,
got a lead
got a plug
i donʼt need
any dough yuhh yuhh
i just knead
with my hands
let it bake in the stove
now the team fin to blow up, yuh dats me talkin
cracks in the street, thats me walkin flash on the beat
thats me joggin,
snap on that ass
clap throw it back

Go , go
Get down
when Iʼm around
because the sound
go, go, go, shake that ass,
go, go, go, shake that ass,
go, go, go, shake that ass,
slap on dat ass, clap throw it back yuhhh
