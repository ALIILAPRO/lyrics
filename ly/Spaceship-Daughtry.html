		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hood of my car
Radio's just loud enough
So I can hear "Levon"
Where you are is anybody's guess for now
Just a song I grew up on
Constellations seem so out of line
Wish that we could make it this time

Somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes out of nowhere
Like a shooting star or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me we can't be too far
'Cause I can see me on a spaceship leaving
Here when you find that we're not the only ones
We're not the only ones.

Call me a fool
Daydreaming in the dark and throwing ??? moon
Why you're gone is "Nobody's Fault But Mine"
Another song that we grew up on
Anybody tell me where I can find
The hurt I can't get outta my mind

Somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes out of nowhere
Like a shooting star or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me we can't be too far
'Cause I can see me on a spaceship leaving
Here when you find that we're not the only ones

I'm looking for love,
I'm looking for something more
When its not enough
Try to stay above the clouds
'Cause with our feet both on the ground
We'll never learn

('Cause I can see me on a spaceship leaving
Here when you find that we're not the only ones)
Somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes out of nowhere
Like a shooting star or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me we can't be too far
Taken aboard a spaceship leaving
Come see for yourself if you don't believe me
Together we will find that we're not the only ones
Yeah we're not the only ones
