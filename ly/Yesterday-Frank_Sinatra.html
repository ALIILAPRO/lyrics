		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now they look as though they're here to stay,
Oh I believe in yesterday, oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me, oh yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away, oh I believe in yesterday.
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong , now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away, oh I believe in yesterday.
