		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spiritual recites and
Chanting with desires
Keeping up with what they need
Creatures of universe
Walking with instructions
Preaching when it comes to need
Watch us in the distance
Breeding and feeding
Attentive on the human need
Creatures of universe
Walking off instructions
Preaching when it comes to need
Bide my time, I’m biding my time
I bide my time I’m biding my time
I bide my time
The ocean is emptiness
Celestial contains
A never ending abstract soul
Soulless man performing
Knows of what’s coming
Yawning on the human need
Watch us in the distance
Breeding and feeding
Attentive on the human need
Bide my time, I’m biding my time
I bide my time I’m biding my time
I bide my time
Bide my time, I’m biding my time
I bide my time I’m biding my time
I bide my time
The empty notion
The empty notion comes along
The empty notion
The empty notion comes along
The empty notion
The empty notion comes along
The empty notion
The empty notion comes along
The empty notion
The empty notion comes along
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you just follow along
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you just follow along
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you just follow along
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you
And if it tempts you just follow along
Bide my time, I’m biding my time
I bide my time I’m biding my time
I bide my time
