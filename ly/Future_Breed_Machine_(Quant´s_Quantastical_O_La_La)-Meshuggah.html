		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An even strobe a pulse of flashing
Hatelights of synthetic souls mass-produced
Hammered into shape a sign of times dreams
Turn into systems a new way a new breed
Implanted in our minds

Here i am in the hand of a sterile hate the
New control i can not wake I'm not a sleep

New intelligence arise in emptied bodies
Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic
Fits through not known codes mother
Machine in genocide now scorn a dying race

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me
Changing what am i to be contorted an eternity defeated

Programmed to appease you we're symbols of
Perfection humanoids ruined by your laws:
Destroy erase improve lesson first: sub-
Mission we're docile servant dogs our
Leashes are your limbs computed deep within

Remoted minds controlled our thoughts no
More doubts the new way is here disgorged
Another thousands fakes that obey to a
Circuit skein to vacuum

Mechanical thoughts i now conceive no
Longer me always to see inanity millions
To be units like me eternally human
Patterns copied dissected distorted
Completed to fit the machine the nerve
Fibres give in to cords to the unknown

See me be me same contents same machine

The currency of ours no more flesh and bone
We are to be unaware of what we have been before

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me
Changing what am i to be contorted an
Eternity defeated by the new machine
