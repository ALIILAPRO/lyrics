		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh)
You're as good as it gets for me
Slow it down
Don't wanna miss our moment
Sit me down if you want
Teach me, girl, I'm willing
I'll be yours if you want
Whatever you want

Got high hopes
Just like you
Truth be told, we both got things to lose (things to lose)
Can't go ghost, not like usual
Because I'm ready for your love

What would it take here
To make you mine for real?
I got a taste and now can't keep off my mind

What would it take for real
To make you mine?
I got a taste and now can't keep off my mind, mind

Is it obvious
That I'm falling, I'm lost in it?
And I need it often, on my way
And, baby, no lie, I'm here to stay
No games to play
And maybe I'm tryna say your love is good to me
I'm saying this time you're mine, you're mine

Got high hopes
Just like you
Truth be told, we both got things to lose (things to lose)
Can't go ghost, not like usual
Because I'm ready for your love

What would it take here
To make you mine for real?
I got a taste and now can't keep off my mind

What would it take for real
To make you mine?
I got a taste and now can't keep off my mind, mind
