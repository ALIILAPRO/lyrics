		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I have this dance (Yeah, uh-huh)
I know you never danced for the man like me before
And when you dance with me [Chicka-chicka-ah]
You'll never want to dance no more
Let me show you

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancin' (Dancin')
When we're out on the floor (Out on the floor)
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me (oOh, oh, oh)
So I slowly move closer (Yeah)
Let her know that I want her (Yeah, yeah)

Looking in your eyes
As we start to dance the night away [Uh-huh, uh-huh]
I can feel your heart
Has you pushing your body close to mine, yeah

To the beat, to the drum
To the music, to the one (To the one)
Don't you worry 'bout the crowd (No one)
'Cause there's no one else around (Ho)

I can freak it if you like (You)
I can make you feel alright
I can serve it to you right
'Cause I'd like to explore your body tonight (Whoa, oh, oh)

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancin' (Dancin')
When we're out on the floor (Out on the floor)
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me (Yeah)
So I slowly move closer (Slowly)
Let her know that I want her

Baby, take my hand
And let me guide you to this dance of love [We'll be movin' so close]
Almost like we're makin' love
Baby, bring your body and let it bounce with me [Come on, come on, come on], (Hey, oh)

To the beat, to the drum
To the music, to the one
Don't you worry (Don?t you worry) 'bout the crowd (No, no, no)
'Cause there's no one else around (I can freak it)

I can freak it if you like (Oh)
I can make you feel alright (Alright)
I can serve it to you right (Oh, ho, ho, ho)
'Cause I'd like to explore your body tonight

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancin'
When we're out on the floor (Out on the floor)
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer (Slowly)
Let her know that I want her (I want her)

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees (The only one)
When we're dancin' (Yeah)
When we're out on the floor (Out on the floor)
And I like to think (Yeah) that she'll be coming home with me (Yeah, yeah)
So I slowly move closer (Move closer)
Let her know that I want her

Do you want to dance with me (Hey)
Do you want to dance with me (Hey)
I want you to (Hey)
I want you to (And you know that I do)

Do you want to dance with me (Yeah)
Do you want to dance with me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want you to
I want you to (Hey, hey, hey, I do)

I like to think that I'm the only one (Yeah) she sees
When we're dancin' (Dancin')
When we're out on the floor (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And I like to think that she'll (You) be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer (Slowly)
Let her know that I want her (I want you, baby)

I like to think that I'm the only one she sees (I need you)
When we're dancin' (I want you)
When we're out on the floor (Dancin', dancin')
And I like to think that she'll be coming home with me (Dancin', dancin', dance with me)
So I slowly move closer
Let her know that I want her

Can I dance, can I dance (Dance with you)
Can I dance with you (I want to dance with you)
Can I dance, can I dance
Can I dance with you (Dance with you)
So I slowly move closer
And I know that I want her (She Y2K)
