		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've always felt like i'm a drop in your ocean and when it hurts, you don't see  
I'll pretend what's wrong is right like I'm wasted
So you can get a little closer

You held my hand and lead me in to the water
You told me to go deep but don't you drown 
Don't wanna think of all this time like it's wasted 
So won't you get a little closer

But you can hold my hand like you needed
Keep my soul 
like you wanted
Hold my hand
Just stop wasting it all

You can hold my hand like you needed
Keep my soul
like you wanted
Hold my hand
Just stop wasting it all 

Don't walk way until you know what i'm feeling don't close your eyes until you know what's real Why can't you keep me in a place where it alls feels new  
I'm tired of you, pushing me, away   

and Now the days are leaving us with the weather  we felt the sunshine, you couldn't stay  
Wish i knew what I was getting myself into  
I'm trying hard to wash it away   

But you can hold my hand like you needed
Keep my soul 
like you wanted
Hold my hand
Just stop wasting it all

You can hold my hand like you needed
Keep my soul
like you wanted
Hold my hand
Just stop wasting it all 
 
I hope you keep my beating heart, 
feels like i am falling apart, 
hear my beating heart 

I hope you keep my beating heart, 
feels like your among the stars,
hear my beating heart  

But you can hold my hand like you needed
Keep my soul 
like you wanted
Hold my hand
Just stop wasting it all

You can hold my hand like you needed
Keep my soul
like you wanted
Hold my hand
Just stop wasting it all
