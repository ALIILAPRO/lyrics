		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Licking the barrel of a gun
Chewing it like it's bubblegum
Wave it like a magic wand
Pop a few rounds out just for fun

Go to the strip club all alone
Thinking that I could take you home
To picture you with those other guys
It's driving me crazy all the time

Well, I never wanted to be with you
But I think I'm falling, so what can I do?
You'll just lead me on 'til I'm drowning in tears

Oh, and you're holding me
Oh, and you're holding me
Oh, and you're holding me
As if I was the last man standing on earth

Well, I never wanted to be with you
But I think I'm falling, so what can I do?
You'll just lead me on 'til I'm drowning in tears
