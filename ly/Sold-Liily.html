		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you're losing your mind
I see you're wasting some time
Why are you in such a grind?
Don't worry I'll tell your momma you're doing fine

Lies
You told me I was the one with the gun and a toolkit
Why would you pick on a little white boy turned misfit
I don't know what you're doing to me cuz it feels like I'm running in circles while I'm
getting sold off for free

I know I'm easy to fool
But I ain't cut open just to bleed
I see you're making all the rules
But you're just giving me more to feed

Lies
You told me I was the one with the gun and a toolkit
Why would you pick on a little white boy turned misfit
I don't know what you're doing to me cuz it feels like I'm running in circles while I'm
getting sold off for free

You can't sell that for free x7
You can't sell that for...

Lies
You told me I was the one with the gun and a tool kit
Why would you pick on a little white boy turned misfit
I don't know what you're doing to me cuz it feels like I'm running in circles while I'm
getting sold off for free
