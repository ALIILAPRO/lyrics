		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull up to the mirror, staring at my face
Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've been carrying for 1460 days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messing with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love?

So I gotta get you out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on
Get you out my head now
I just cut you off

I imagine all the endless places I could know
With a drop-drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I got from head to toe
Yeah they'd, yeah they'd, yeah they'd start to show

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Emotionally messing with my health (ha)
How could I confuse that shit for love?

So I gotta get you out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on
Get you out my head now
I just (I just), I just

You out my head now (I just)
When I'm without
You out my head now

So I gotta get you out my head now
I just (I just), cut you off (yeah, I cut you off)
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on
Get you out my head now
I just, I just (yeah)
