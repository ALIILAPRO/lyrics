		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mother, mother tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won

Father, father please believe me
I am laying down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son

Everybody needs somebody to love
(Mother, mother)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(Please believe me)
Everybody's bitching
'Cause they can't get enough
And it's hard to hold on
When there's no one to lean on

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord you got to keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've got to
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

Tell me baby when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside?
Do you tell me "All's forgiven"
And just hide behind your pride

Yeah
Everybody needs somebody to love
(Mother, father)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(Please don't leave me)
Everybody's bleeding
'Cause the times are tough
Well it's hard to be strong
When there's no one to dream on

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, you've got to keep the faith
Don't you know it's never too late
Right now, we've got to keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Love, you've got to keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Oh, we've got to keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've got to keep the faith

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been walking in the footsteps
Of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever
To stand out in the rain
So no one sees me cryin'
Trying to wash away the pain

Mother, father
There's things I've done I can't erase
Every night we fall from grace
It's hard with the world in your faith
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, you got to keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've got to keep the faith
Faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
Try to hold on, trying to hold on
Yeah

Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Everybody keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Ooh yeah

Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody to hate (ooh yeah)
