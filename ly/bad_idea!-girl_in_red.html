		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was a bad idea calling you up
Was such a bad idea 'cause now I'm even more lost
It was a bad idea to think you were the one
Was such a bad idea 'cause now everything's wrong

You put your hands under my shirt
Undid my bra and said these words
"Darling, you're so pretty, it hurts"
You pushed me up against my wall
Threw my clothes down on the floor
"Darling, are you ready for more?"

It was a bad idea calling you up
Was such a bad idea, I'm totally fucked
It was a bad idea to think I could stop
Was such a bad idea, I can't get enough

It was a bad idea meeting you so late
Was such a bad idea 'cause I can't think straight
It was a bad idea to bring you back home
Was such a bad idea, I need to be alone

You put your hands under my shirt
Undid my bra and said these words
"Darling, you're so pretty, it hurts"
You pushed me up against my wall
Threw my clothes down on the floor
"Darling, are you ready for more?"

It was a bad idea calling you up
Was such a bad idea, I'm totally fucked
It was a bad idea to think I could stop
Was such a bad idea, I can't get enough

Bad idea, bad idea
Bad idea, bad idea

You put your hands under my shirt
Undid my bra and said these words
"Darling, you're so pretty, it hurts"
You pushed me up against my wall
Threw my clothes down on the floor
You said "Darling, are you ready for more?"

It was a bad idea calling you up
Was such a bad idea, I'm totally fucked
It was a bad idea calling you up
Was such a bad idea, I'm totally fucked
It was a bad idea to think I could stop
Was such a bad idea, I can't get enough
