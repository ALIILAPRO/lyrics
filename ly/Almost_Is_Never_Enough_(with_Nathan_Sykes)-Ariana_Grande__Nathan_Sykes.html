		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie
That's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time, our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost
Almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost
We almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time, our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth, is everyone knows

Almost
Almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you, oh
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost
We almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

(Huh) oh, huh oh
(Oh, baby) hmm
(You know) oh
(You know, baby)
(Almost)

Baby, baby, baby (is not enough, baby)

(You know) huh-huh
(Huh, yeah)

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time, our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost
Almost is never enough (is never enough, babe)
(We were) so close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me (that you wanted me)
The way I wanted you, babe
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we we almost
We almost knew what love was (baby)
But almost is never enough

(Huh)
(Oh, baby) almost
(You know) hey
(You know, baby)
(Almost)
(Is never enough, baby) never
(At all)
(Hey-ey-ey)
