		<p>
		  What the fuck is we doin'?
Yeah
Yeah
Ha, yeah, yeah

Gang, back in the stu' (gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)
Uh, yeah, gang back in the stu' (gang)
Young nigga win, win, win, win (bitch)
How can I lose? (Ha, bitch)
Uh, how can I lose? (Ha, bitch)
Uh, how can I lose? (Yeah)
I ain't with the gang, gang, gang, gang (bitch)
Fifty gon' shoot, uh (squad)
Me and Trav' in a coupe (zoom)
Paparazzi, we switch the route (yeah, uh)
Uh, yeah, see your bitch gettin' loose, huh
I'm in LA with the views, huh (yeah)
I'm in LA with your boo (It's lit)

We on the quest with the tribe (I bought it)
It's way too late, pick a side (Feng Shui)
Jack make them boys come alive (they what?)
Better not fuck up the vibe (it's Travis)
Runnin' this shit with a stride
You know my gang the flyest

I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang
Boys hoppin' out of coupes (gang)
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain
Duckin' boys in the blue (zoom)
I see you holdin' out on my change
I'm needin' all of the loot (ching, ching)
When I'm ridin' off I'm outside
Best believe I got the scoop (scoop)
I could make a hundred right now
Give it all to the troops
Whole squad got the juice (yeah)
Sit in the stand like a flute (yeah)
Whole spot goin' up
JACKBOYS on the loose (yeah, yeah, bitch)

In the H, bumpin' Screw (Screw)
Flamin' Harlem with the goons (it's lit)
We was wildin', skippin' school (wildin')
Now we can go make the (ching, ching)
Now we can go make the millions
Trinidad my crew (I'm tilt)
Cactus Jack on my shoe, in this shit

I came from the mud straight to the top (yeah)
Shooters outside double parked
I'm from New York, she like how I talk
She need a ass, it's bought
Came to my chambers, we went wild
Drove the bitch crazy, gave 'em all miles
I'm with young Jacques, know it's goin' down
Smokin' that Jack, get it by the pound (straight up)
Don't need the pussy, I'm in and I'm out (I'm out)
But I'm still smokin' that loud
Hit my hoes when I'm in town (yeah)
They know who got the scouts (zoom)

I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang
Boys hoppin' out of coupes (gang)
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain
Duckin' boys in the blue (bitch)
I see you holdin' out on my change
I'm needin' all of the loot (ching, ching)
When I'm ridin' off I'm outside
Best believe I got the scoop (scoop)
I could make a hundred right now
Give it all to the troops
Whole squad got the juice
Sit in the stand like a flute
Whole spot goin' up
JACKBOYS on the loose (yeah)

Look, I'm from the North where they robbin' and killin' (woo, woo)
Young nigga rich but I'm still from the trenches (woo)
Luxury Tax, my water by G
P-i-r-u, bitch, I bang what I bleed
I'm passin' out pills, I'ma geek up the VIP
One shot to the head and make sure it don't miss
I fuck on the bitch, have her stalkin' on 5th
Still pourin' up Act', they say it don't exist (at all)
Fifth got some vibes at the crib
Like, "I wanna fuck right now"
Keep hunnids on hunnids for real
Bitch, I'm goin' up right now (yeah)
Bitch, roll up some weed, you know gang in the stu'
Bottles on bottles, 1942
Models on models, this shit nothin' new
You might catch some shots takin' shots at the crew
I like my hoes by the two
Blew eight hundred K on a coupe (uh-huh, racks)
We fucked, there wasn't none else to do (skrt)
You play with La Flame, I'ma shoot (racks)
This a hundred round drum, I got mob ties
This a double M truck, ain't no broke vibes
Now we only take jets for the hard times
Know I call up them killers, they gon' slide
Bitch, I'm with the gang

I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang
Boys hoppin' out of coupes (gang)
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain
Duckin' boys in the blue (bitch)
I see you holdin' out on my change
I'm needin' all of the loot (ching, ching)
When I'm ridin' off I'm outside
Best believe I got the scoop
I could make a hundred right now
Give it all to the troops
Whole squad got the juice
Sit in the stand like a flute
Whole spot goin' up
JACKBOYS on the news (yeah)
