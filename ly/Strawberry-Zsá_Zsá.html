		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took a whole pill
Zsazsi doesn't need to sleep
I'm out all night, all day I've been on my feet
6AM sunrise, got nowhere to be
Please put your lips on mine
Tastes like strawberry

(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like-like-like-like)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)

I took the whole pill
Zsazsi doesn't need to sleep
I'm out all night, all day I've been on my feet
6AM sunrise, got nowhere to be
Please put your lips on mine
Tastes like strawberry

Double text, strawberries
L-O-V-E-E you and me
I miss you on my screen
Flight mode on, off
Low, low battery

I took the whole pill
Zsazsi doesn't need to sleep
I'm out all night, all day I've been on my feet
6AM sunrise, got nowhere to be
Please put your lips on mine
Tastes like strawberry

(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like-like-like-like)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)

I took the whole pill
Zsazsi doesn't need to sleep
I'm out all night, all day I've been on my feet
You're in you're favorite car while I'm on the streets
three, two, four, three, two, one put me on repeat

My city's cold but nothing's icier than me
My diamonds shine, my diamonds need some company
6AM sunrise, got nowhere to be
Please put your lips on mine
Tastes like strawberry

(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like-like-like-like)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
(Like strawberry, like strawberry)
