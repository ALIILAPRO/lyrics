		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As she parts her greying hair
Voices on the stair
When she turns there's something there.
Like a nightmare from the past
To the sound of splintered glass
Dance the monsters in the mask.
Man of steel
Just standing in the rain.
Have you killed her, someone said
As they dragged you from your bed
Kicking in your head.
What kind of times are these
No one hears, no one sees
As they drive you to your knees
Man of steel
Just standing in the rain
You just stood laughing in the rain.
What kind of times are these
As they drive you to your knees
Dying on your knees
Dying in the rain
The rain.
How can you laugh this one away?
Will you ever laugh this one away?
