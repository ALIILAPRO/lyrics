		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you walk in the room
In a white bodysuit
And I say, "Take it off"
So you tell me to watch

When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep
Gets so hot and it's so beautiful

And the TV is on
When we make love, because
We get carried away
We don't care anyway

When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep
Gets so hot and it's so beautiful

Wrapped your hair in a towel
But I watch you let it down
And it's all soaking wet
As you take me in your mouth

And we stare at the street
From the back balcony
But now all I can see
Is you undressing for me

When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep
Gets so hot and it's so beautiful
