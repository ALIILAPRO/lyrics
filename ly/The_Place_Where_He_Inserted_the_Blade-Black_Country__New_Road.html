		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're scared of a world where you're needed
So you never made nice with the locals
But you tied me up slow with your vine, stuck
It takes a few years, but they break bones
It takes a few months, but our bones heal
We're stronger, we tell all our school friends
And they sign our cast in the playground
Darling, the rest of my body
It's yours, then

I know you're scared
Well, I'm scared too
Oh, that every time I try to make lunch
For anyone else, in my head
I end up dreaming of you
And you come to me
Good morning

Show me the place where he inserted the blade
I'll praise the Lord, burn my house
I get lost, I freak out
You come home and hold me tight
As if it never happened at all
Good morning

Show me the place where he inserted the blade
Good morning
Where is your light?
Am I home?
I will hold to my chest
Where the wind can exist
I will try
Not to keep you too long

So, clean your soup maker and breathe in
Your chicken, broccoli, and everything
The tug that's between us
That long string
Concorde bound to
And my evening
The good hunter's guide to a bad night
Darling, I'll spoil it myself
Thanks, you're leaving
Well, I tried just to stroke your dreams better
But darling, I see that you're not really sleeping

And I know
You're tired
Well, I'm tired too
Oh, that every time I try to make lunch
For anyone else, in my head
I end up dreaming of you
And you come to me
Good morning

Show me the place where he inserted the blade
I'll praise the lord, burn my house
I get lost, I freak out
You come home, hold me tight
As if it never happened at all
Good morning

Show me the fifth of the cadence you want me to play
Good morning
Show me where to tie the other end of this chain
