		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feelin' outta place, plus it's gettin' kinda late
Tryna make it home safe and not get raped, where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffin' dope, so her dome is leanin' on her rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz 'cause you just helped your friends
Flag a taxi, now you walkin' not too far from your crib (uh)
Cravin' for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feelin' flabbergasted, you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th Ave, flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid, French braids and he keep the potent
Hold ya purse don't trust him 'cause his teeth is golden
Dice rollin' reefer blowin' in the streets he smokin'
Blowin' weed while police patrollin' (uh)
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip (drip)

Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip
Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip (uh)

Uh, uh, uh (yeah)
Drip
Uh, uh, uh (yeah)
Drip
Uh, uh, uh (yeah)
Drip
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip (drip)
