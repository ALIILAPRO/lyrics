		  (Diego)
(B-b-bankroll Got It)

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, Tay (okay)
Thirty on my neck, thirty when I hit the stage (ooh, ooh)
Just money on my mind, put that money on his face (Money)
If I'm done, then I'm done, that's on Tay (hah)
And if he bullshittin' (yeah), that's okay
You a grown-ass kid (ayy), now go play, ayy
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, Tay (Tay, ayy)
I'ma always be good, that's on Tay (Tay Money)

I ain't got time to be sweatin' no 
Basic-ass, lame-ass, silly-ass, stupid-ass ho (ew)
If you ain't with the shit, bitch (yeah)
Worried about this bitch (yeah)
Well, you need to worry 'bout why your ass broke (broke ass)
Talkin' like you 'bout it, but you don't want no smoke
Feelin' like a dancer when you hear this song (Tay)
Baby, pull your pants up (yeah), I can see your thong (ooh)
Apple Bottom jeans and I can barely put 'em on, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, Tay (okay)
Thirty on my neck, thirty when I hit the stage (ooh, ooh)
Just money on my mind, put that money on his face (money)
If I'm done, then I'm done, that's on Tay (hah)
And if he bullshittin' (yeah), that's okay
You a grown-ass kid (ayy), now go play, ayy
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, Tay (Tay, ayy)
I'ma always be good, that's on Tay (Tay Money)

Fuckin' with a boss bitch (yeah) 
Probably got him lost, bitch (huh?)
Neck look like a faucet, he blow me up, stop it (hey)
I'm his favorite topic (Tay), can't nobody top this (yeah)
Nah, you ain't got this (you ain't got this) 
Tay Money, I bought this (got money)
Fifty and I drop, in Houston like a rocket
Put that money where you talk, bitch (yeah) 
Watch out where you walkin' (yeah)
Instagram stalkin', in Miami like a dolphin (money)
I be everywhere, you just at the crib watchin' (face ass)

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, Tay (okay)
Thirty on my neck, thirty when I hit the stage (ooh, ooh)
Just money on my mind, put that money on his face (money)
If I'm done, then I'm done, that's on Tay (hah)
And if he bullshittin' (yeah), that's okay
You a grown-ass kid (ayy), now go play, ayy
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, Tay (Tay, ayy)
I'ma always be good, that's on Tay (Money)

C'mon, Tay
Fuck 'em up, Tay
