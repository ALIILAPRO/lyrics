		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smack me again and I cant believe its true
Smashing the opponent
Was not my intention to do
Nether did you

Foresee such an outcome to this unnecessary ending
I wish I could retrace all my steps
And erase my mistakes
With you

I wanted to say
You shouldnt suffer this way
I wanted to say
I hope I can take it away
(x2)

Tempt me again and I will forget the truth
Backing your decision
Was something I neglected to do
Even for you

If you feel rage to strike me with revenge
I will be standing right here
Waiting without fear
For you

I wanted to say
You shouldnt suffer this way
I wanted to say
I hope I can take it away
(x4)

I wanted to say
I wanted to say
