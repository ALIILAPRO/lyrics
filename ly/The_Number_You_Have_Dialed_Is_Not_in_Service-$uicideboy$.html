		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm fallin' apart
You mighta thought I was playin' 
A part in the art I've created
But most of the words reflect what's happened 
Or what is waitin' to start happenin'
I keep on damagin' myself
Tryna fill the void with all this water round my neck
I'm 'bout to drip until I drown
All these drugs up in my nose
I taste the drip, that shit's so sour
All these cars that I bought 
Either don't start or they got impounded
Pursued the American dream
The nightmare's what I doubted
Catch a flight to London or I'll catch I flight to Lyon
Show my face in public, show another one at home
See my name on the marquee, letters fallin' down
Litterin' a cold dark street somewhere downtown
As soon as I reached cloud nine it started stormin'
Heavy thunderstorms in every city that I'm tourin'
Life ain't like a rap video, that's just a warnin'
Hopin' to see the sun when I wake up in the mornin'

All this misery, misery, misery, fuck
Look at my history, no mystery 
Where I might end up, just shut up
Don't wanna hear it, it's my decision
May be my last wish so just please listen (not in service)
So long, it's been torture bein' here
So cold, gettin' high but now I cope with fear
Same song and I'm sick of singin' it
Let me move on, it's for my benefit 
But one come all to my downfall
Bear witness to everything that I can't solve
My therapist made me promise before I end it all
That her phone would be the one I choose to call, cryin', askin'
Is it really worth it?
What's beneath the surface or behind the curtain?
Really don't think I wanna take this any further
Made one last attempt to figure out my purpose
I called her phone, it said, "Not in service"

When life gets hard (get's hard)
Keep on marchin' on (keep on marchin' on)
Even if the finish line is far 
Or you have to push the car (push the car)
Keep on marchin' on (keep on marchin' on)

When life gets hard (get's hard)
Keep on marchin' on (keep on marchin' on)
Even if the finish line is far 
Or you have to push the car (push the car)
Keep on marchin' on (keep on marchin' on)
