		<p>
		  Eyes meeting mine
Your style was so unusual I knew I had to say hi
Wild, but I'm shy
Coming, and it's coming, and it's coming, and it's coming, and it's

Coming, and it's coming, and it's
Coming, and it's coming, and it's

Timid but impatient
My mind is racing
Things that I could do to you to get your body shaking
Wish that I would ask you
Meet me in the bathroom
Running and I'm running and I'm running and I'm running, and I'm

I might be domesticated
But deep down inside, I'm an animal, baby

I wanna get you close but I don't know how (know how)
I wanna feel your tongue moving in my mouth (my mouth)
Saw you on the other side
Dancing bloody valentine
Wanna take you back to mine
Show you what I'm really like
But I'm too shy
I'm too shy

Heated when you watch me
Killing me softly
Spike the pulse, the blood rush when I fantasize your touch
Fuck the puritanical, come lick my mandible
I worship you, you are my, my messiah

Coming, and it's coming, and it's
Coming, and it's coming, and it's

I might be domesticated
But deep down inside, I'm an animal, baby

I wanna get you close but I don't know how (know how)
I wanna feel your tongue moving in my mouth (my mouth)
Saw you on the other side
Dancing bloody valentine
Wanna take you back to mine
Show you what I'm really like
But I'm too shy
I'm too shy

Dancing bloody valentine
I wanna take you back to mine
But I'm too shy
I'm too shy
But I'm too shy
I'm too shy
