		  Something special
Unforgettable
50 Cent (Cent)
Justin (-tin)
Timbaland (-land)
Goddamn (damn)

She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that, it's right here for her
I wanna see you break it down (yeah)
I'm ballin', throwin' money around

She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she about the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money money, she makin' makin'
Look at the way she shakin' shakin'
Make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it
Have you lustin' for her, goin' crazy face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shakin' make you want to hit it
Think she double jointed from the way she splitted
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She's so much more than you're used to
She knows just how to move to seduce you
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
Dance in your lap till you're ready to pop

She always ready, when you want it she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I show you where to meet her
On the late night, till daylight the club jumpin'
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want
Lemme talk to you

Baby you're so new age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
The smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me

Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (so), I got to give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (so), I got to give it to her

Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you girl

Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
Make it rain for us so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In her fantasy, there's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watching her doing her thing on all fours
Now that, that shit should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride, break it down (down, down)
You know I like, when you hike and you throw it all around
Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move
Girl you got me thinking about, all the things I do to you
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Lemme talk to you

Baby you're so new age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
The smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me

Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (so), I got to give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (so), I got to give it to her

Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you girls
