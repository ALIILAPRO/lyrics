		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been searching for an exit, but I'm lost inside my head;
Where I spend every waking moment wishing I was dead.
For a few minutes get me away from here,
For a few minutes wipe away my tears.
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.

It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs,
And I can't take another step,
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's fire under my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath,
Please tell me I am not undone.

I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head;
Where I spend every waking moment wishing this would end.
I can't take another step, I cannot live inside my mind,
I can't face another day, I am so fucking tired.
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep,
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep,
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink.

It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's fire under my skin
And I'm drowning from within.
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone.

I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head;
Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead.
I'll take another step for you
I'll shed my tears until I drown, or until I am underground.
I'll take another breath for you
Will you still be there when I'm home, out from the great unknown?

It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs,
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's fire under my skin
And I'm drowning from within.
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone.

It's like there's cancer in my blood,
It's like there's water in my lungs,
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone.
It's like there's fire under my skin
And I'm drowning from within.
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone.
