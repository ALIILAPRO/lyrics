		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't call me baby, don't call me beautiful
Don't be so tragic, don't be so difficult
Don't call me crazy, don't call me delusional
Don't be dramatic, while you're at it
Don't call me at all

You
You always know how to take it too far
Take it too far
Now you
Outside my house, crying love in the dark
Love in the dark

Oh, you can keep your letters, I'm gon' keep my distance
Done with reminiscing for life
You can keep your sweaters, don't you ever listen
I'ma say it one more time

Don't call me baby, don't call me beautiful
Don't be so tragic, don't be so difficult
Don't call me crazy, don't call me delusional
Don't be dramatic, while you're at it
Don't call me at all

Don't call me at all
Don't, don't, don't, oh
Oh

You (you)
Thought I'd be stuck in the mess that you made
Mess that you made
But, ooh
I'll wave goodbye out here in outer space
In outer space, so

You can keep your letters, I'm gon' keep my distance (oh-oh)
Done with reminiscing for life
You can keep your sweaters, don't you ever listen
I'ma say it one more time

Don't call me baby, don't call me beautiful
Don't be so tragic, don't be so difficult
Don't call me crazy, don't call me delusional
Don't be dramatic while you're at it
Don't call me at all

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Don't call me at all)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
