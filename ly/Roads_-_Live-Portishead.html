		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong

Storm, in the morning light
I feel, no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right

And surely that ain't right

Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong

How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong

Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong
