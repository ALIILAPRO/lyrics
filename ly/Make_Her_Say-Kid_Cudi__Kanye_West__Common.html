		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I make her say

Oh ah oh oh oh ah oh oh (when I)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face pa-pa poker her face (I make her say)
Oh ah oh oh ah ah ah oh oh (what up)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face (me first) pa-pa poker her face

She wanna have whatever she like
She can if she bring her friend
And we can have one hell of a night
Through the day
Hey I mean starrin' like a grouper cause you gotta peep her
I mean you probably might be sayin' you ain't jockin' either
But man ol' girl gotta fat ol' ass
Yeah the type to make you tell a bitch just dance
And fuck them otha' niggas cause you down for her bitches
And fuck them otha' niggas cause she down for the stickin'
And fuck them otha' niggas cause hope down for sum lickin'
And fuck them otha' bitches cause she down for the trickin'
I'm hoping she a rider
When it's said and done will she spit it up and swallow now
I ain't got trip bout them niggas who like her
'Cause me and mommy know, we could really make her go

Oh ah oh oh oh ah oh oh (when I)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face pa-pa poker her face (I make her say)
Oh ah oh oh ah ah ah oh oh(when I)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face pa-pa poker her face (I make her say)
(ay, what you talkin' bout 'ye)

She say she want whatever she like
She say she gonna bring her friend
And we gonna have a hell of a night
Threw the day
I made her say
Hold up (yea), born in 88 (word)
How old is that? (damn)
Old enough
I got seniority, with the sorority
So, that explains why I love college
Getting brain in the library cause I love knowledge
When you used your medulla oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I comatose'st
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a lil' osmosis
And that's my commandment, you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts'st
More damn planes, more coasts'st
And fuck the bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa (osa)

Oh ah oh oh oh ah oh oh (when I)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face pa-pa poker her face (I make her say)
Oh ah oh oh ah ah ah oh oh(when I)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face pa-pa poker her face(I make her say)
(I make her say)

She said she want whatever she like
But you gotta bring your friend
And we can have one hell of a night
Through the day
She blamed it on the al-a-a-al-a-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down down for a damn, cudi already said it
Her poker face book I'd already read it
But man her head was gooder than a music
Electro body, known to blow fuses
A stripper from the south
Lookin' for a payday
Said, bitch you should do it for the love like Ray J
But they say you be on the conscious tip
Get your head right and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
Its the way I was raised on the south side safari
So

Oh ah oh oh oh ah oh oh (when I)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face pa-pa poker her face (I make her say)
Oh ah oh oh ah ah ah oh oh (when I)
Pa-pa-pa poker her face pa-pa poker her face (I make her say)

Can't read my, can't read my,
No he can't read 'em my poker face,
(she's got me like nobody)

Can't read my, can't read my,
No he can't read 'em my poker face,
(she's got me like nobody)
