		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, she may be weary
Them young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah-yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness, yeah-yeah
(Oh my, not)

You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
For things that she'll never, never, never, never possess, yeah-yeah
But while she's there waiting, and without them
Try a little tenderness
(That's all you gotta do)

It's not just sentimental, no, no, no
She has her grief and care, yeah, yeah, yeah
But the soft words, they are spoke so gentle, yeah

It makes it easier
Easier to bear, yeah

You won't regret it, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their own happiness, yeah

But it's all so easy
All you gotta do is try, try a little tenderness, yeah
All you gotta do is, man
Hold her where you want her
Squeeze her, don't tease her
Never leave her, get to her, try, try
Just try a little tenderness, yeah-yeah-yeah
You got to rub her gentle, man
Don't got, don't bruise her, no, no
You got to love her, tease her, don't squeeze her
Got to try, now, now, now
Try, try a little tenderness, yeah
Watch her groove, you got to know what to do, man
Take this advice
