		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She told me that I'm weak, alright, alright
And I'm out here tryin' to breathe, alright
Alright
She ain't never gonna leave, alright
Alright right behind my shoulder
Whispers that we're on the same team, yeah
And all the shit she done is for me, yeah
She says I'm being paranoid but I'm not
I'm not

And I say just go away, just go away
Just go away
I'm wondering everyday, everyday, everyday
Why can't I just force you out of my life?
Why can't I just find a way
A better way to survive?

No one really cares if you try
Everything you have is a lie
I may come and go for a while
But know I'm gone be here until you die

If only you weren't buried in my mind
Pushing me to the edge of my decline
Tried to keep my grip but
I'm falling off the edge
And I don't know how I'm still alive

I don't really care if you try
Nothing'll change your life
Just know that I'm here 'til you die

She told me that I'm weak, alright, alright
And I'm out here tryin' to breathe, alright
Alright
She ain't never gonna leave, alright
Alright right behind my shoulder
Whispers that we're on the same team, yeah
And all the shit she done is for me, yeah
Says I'm being paranoid but I'm not, I'm not
Yeah
