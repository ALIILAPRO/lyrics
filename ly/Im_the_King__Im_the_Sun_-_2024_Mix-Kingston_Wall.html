		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every morning the Sun goes up n' tells you  
"Just do it boy, 
No matter what you're up to 
I'm telling you just do it boy" 

"I'll take care o' things up here 
So you don't take the other way 
I'm your captain relief, I give light 
And I let you play" 

"When I hear you giving the weep 
Shine on me I won't compromise 
Praying won't take you that deep 
You need real eyes to realize: 

It's that smile on your face 
That gives space and I hear you call 

I'll give light in your eyes, make you shine, take you 
To your goal" 

Could it be so, that all the answers are there 

All it takes is the pace to hear what it says 

"Circumstances are something you just can't 
Avoid but it's that first step you take and you're 
On your way, boy 
It's a question of faith will you keep going on 
I'll give light on your way, 
I'm the King, I'm the Sun" 

"It's all just laws of nature, anyway 
Theirs,hers,ours, 
Yours,his as mine" 

"Smile go on and smile"
