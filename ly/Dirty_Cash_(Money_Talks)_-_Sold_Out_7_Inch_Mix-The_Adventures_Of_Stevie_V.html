		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm-hmm, wooh-hooh-hooh-hooh-hooh-yeah-eah

I've no excuse, I just want you to use me-ee
Take me and abuse me
I got no taboos, I'll make a trade with you-ou-ou
Do anything you wa-ant me to

Money talks, mmm-hmm-hmm, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh

(Dirty cash, dirty cash)

Meanwhile, back in the city, the real pill, the nitty gritty
Sell yourself for your own soul
For a nickel, not a bag of gold
Behold, to what you've been told
Plus the bubba and roomies below
Money is the cause, tell me what's the path

(Dirty cash, that dirty cash)

(Mmm-hmm, money money)

I once had pride, now that's all behi-i-ind
I want to get rich qui-i-ick
I want success and all that goes with i-i-it
And I'm gonna use my se-ex

Money talks, mmm-hmm, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh
Money talks, (you know) money talks, (ah-hah)
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh 

(I want you, money)

I'm dirty cash, the one that you asked for
I'm wanted by the rich and the poor
More and more, you just can't reject it
You're the junkie and I inject it
Into your blood stream, it's like a bad dream
Money's the theme, do you know what I mean

Money talks, (you know) money talks (ah-hah)
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh

Talkin' 'bout that money-ey
Oh giv-it-to-me, gimme, gimme, gimme, money, money, money

Mmm hmm hmm hmm yeah
I want ant you, money
Got to have you money-ey
Give it to me
