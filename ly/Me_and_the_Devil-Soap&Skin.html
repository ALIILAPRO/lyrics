		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
And I said, "Hello Satan, I
I believe that it's time to go"

Me and the Devil
Walking side by side
Me and the Devil
Walking side by side

And I'm gonna see my man
Until I get satisfied

See, see, you don't see why
And you would dog me 'round
Say, don't see why 
People dog me around

It must be that old evil spirit
So deep down in your ground

You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side

So my old evil spirit
Can Greyhound bus that ride
So my old evil spirit
Can Greyhound bus that ride
