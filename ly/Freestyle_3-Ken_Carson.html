		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My weed came in a bag, my lean came sealed
My molly all white like cocaine, yeah, for real
My bitch just struck three lines, she got cocaine on her lips
Got fangs, yeah, I'm vamp
Got fangs, yeah, I'm vamp, bitch (X-Man)
O-P-I-U-M, he was talkin' that shit, then he got his mouth stitched
Niggas ain't fuckin' with him, they ain't fuckin' with X-Man, hell nah
I'm with my college bitch, oh yeah, we geeked up on Adderall
He tweakin', he off bath salt, that boy, he goin' crazy
But if he try me and my gang, we gon' leave his body on the pavement
Pull up in that space coupe, pull up in that May' B'
Pulled up in the Maybach, my chains on like JAY-Z
Young nigga, but I got money like JAY-Z
I ran up them bands, told my bitch she better be outside the airport before I land
My bitch freaky, she go both ways, but she not no trans'
Bitch, I'm geekin', I get too high, you can tell by my stance
You can tell by the way I stand, I'm too high, I'm too geeked
You can tell by the way I stand, I got swag, Marni my jeans
I put Marni on her and her team, and then I put my gang in Balenci'
These niggas stuck in 2015, they rockin' Supreme and vintage
I put a switch on a Drac', now it's a fully, at first, it was just a semi
I don't think these pussy niggas hear me
I'ma shoot this bitch until it's empty
I'ma shoot this bitch 'til that bit' click, clicks
Look at my wrist, yeah, it glisten
Look at my watch, yeah, it's iced out
Look at my mo'fuckin' necklace
Look at my mo'fuckin' neck, bitch
Look at my mo'fuckin' neck
Bitch, you should've went down Alex Moss, but instead you at the Elliot
I make her suck my dick 'til she lockjaw, then I bend her over on the bed
I fuck on that bitch and now we on, thank you to them Percocets
Yeah, thank you to my drugs (yeah), thank you to my plug (yeah)
Got to thank God, I'm up (yeah)
I was just broke the other day, now a young nigga rich as fuck (Yeah-yeah)
These niggas, they all in my way (Yeah), I swear these niggas suck (Yeah)
I'm the only nigga in my lane, just keep that shit a buck

Just keep that shit a hundred
Bitch, yeah, X, X, yeah
Bitch, X-Man
Yeah, X, X, X, yeah, X, X-Man
X, X, X, X, yeah
