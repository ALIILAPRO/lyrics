		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so hard just being me sometimes
I wish I could escape out my mind
Got too many situations
Complicating things, I ran out of time

I know I haven't turned the corner
Please, don't leave me behind
Who the hell am I to think that you're my angel from above?
It's not right

Who are we?
Who have we become?
Are we counting sheep until we dissolve?

It's a painful situation
Do you feel complacent on the outside?
It's so close that I can taste it
Begging you to chase it, God knows I try

You got the life you always wanted
Please, don't leave me behind
Quite some time has passed
You fell right through my fingertips, I still look alright

Who are we?
Who have we become?
Are we counting sheep until we dissolve?
Who are we?
Who have we become?
Are we counting sheep until we dissolve?

(Who?)
(Who?)
