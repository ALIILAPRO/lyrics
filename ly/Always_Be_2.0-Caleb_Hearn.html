		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were there in times of need
Helped me up when I was weak
Showed me that it's okay to dream

And there's a world that I need to see
Pushed me further when I would give up
Pushed me harder when I would fall
You were there in my weakest moments
You told me that it's okay to crawl
But tell me now, how can I move on
If you're not here to see me through
Tell me now, how do I do this heavyweight that I can't pull?
Tell me now, do I look stupid?
Chasing dreams that are far to reach
Tell me now from your point of view
That you're still here and you'll always be
You'll always be

And I know the hardest part is when you're not here
And I'm overtaken by my fears alone
I'm not okay
So tell me now, how can I move on if you're not here to see me through?
Tell me now, how do I do this heavyweight that I can't pull?
Tell me now, do I look stupid?
Chasing dreams that are far to reach
Tell me now, from your point of view
That you're still here
And you'll always be
You'll always be
