		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you take all of the li-li-light away
But, but then you give me fireworks
I, I think of leaving ni-ni-night and day
But, but then you always find the words

You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me

Oh, I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
You dry my tears and make it pour
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn

I, I always wanna run, run, run away
But, but then I crawl into your arms
It, it's like we're starting drama every day
But, but you know that's my favorite part

You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me

Oh, I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
You dry my tears and make it pour
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn

(Torn, baby, I'm torn, torn)
(Torn, torn, baby, I'm torn, torn)

Torn from the pages out of our book
A beautiful tragedy
I'm torn in-between Heaven and Hell
'Cause, baby, when I'm with you
I just don't know where I'd rather be

Oh, I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn (oh)
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
You dry my tears and make it pour (oh yeah)
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore (oh whoa)
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
