		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that you've got what you wanted
Now that you've got what you need
Girl, if we're gonna be honest
Honestly, what's left for me
Oh oh oh oh oh

'Cause all I got
Is close but not
And all I want is to know just how

Try to be the fire for you, try to be the sun
Try to be your home and the place that you come to
Babe, I took the whole world and put it in your hands
I'm really trying hard but I don't understand

Tell me, oh oh oh
How to be the one that you love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How to be the one that you love

Don't treat my love like a habit
Why don't you show me a way
I'd give it to you, you can have it
I just wish I knew what to say

'Cause all I got
Is close but not
And all I want is to know just how

Try to be the fire for you, try to be the sun
Try to be your home and the place that you come to
Babe, I took the whole world and put it in your hands
I'm really trying hard but I don't understand

Tell me, oh oh oh
How to be the one that you love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How to be the one, how to be the one, how to be the one

Try to be the fire for you, try to be the sun
Try to be your home and the place that you come to
Babe, I took the whole world and put it in your hands
I'm really trying hard but I don't understand

How to be the one oh oh oh
How to be the one that you love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How to be the one that you love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How to be the one that you love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How to be the one
How to be the one that you love
