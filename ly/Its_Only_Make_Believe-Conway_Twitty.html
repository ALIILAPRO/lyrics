		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you
No one will ever know how much I love you so
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me
But it's o-only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true, my life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring, my all, my everything
My heart I can't control, you rule my very soul
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me
But it's o-only make believe

My one and only prayer, is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you
No one will ever know how much I love you so
My prayers, my hopes, and my schemes, you are my every dream
But it's o-only make believe (make believe)
