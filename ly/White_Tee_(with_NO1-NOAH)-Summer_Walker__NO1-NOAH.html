		  (CrackGod made it)

Treat me like white tees (treat me like white tees)
Don't get me dirty (don't get me dirty)
Love, love, love on me (love, love, love on me)
Love on, love on me (love on, love on me)
She cannot come with (she cannot come with)
I just gotta dip (I just gotta dip)
Level up with me (level up with me)
If you fuck wit' me (if you fuck wit' me)
Oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, I'm that nigga from the O (yeah, I'm that nigga from the O)
I'm the one that they ain't never told (they ain't never told)
You could catch the breeze, but it's cold (breeze, but it's cold)
You could come with me but I don't know (me, but I don't know)
Big cappin', if you say that you didn't love me
Little bitch, you know I'm lovely, I'm that nigga from the O, too
I know that you fuckin' sayin' that you hate me
But you really do not hate me, in reality, they love you (they love you)

Treat me like white tees
Don't get me dirty
Love on, love on me (yeah)
When we in the V (when we in the V)
Jump on, jump on me (jump on, jump on me)
Fuck on, fuck on me (fuck on, fuck on me)
Yeah (yeah)

Mess up your white tee
I'll do you dirty, yeah
Wish you could fuck on me (yeah, yeah)
Love on, love on me 
But I'll take your money (oh)
I bet you wanna come with me (oh, oh)
I bet you wanna cum on me, oh (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got you feelin' so funny (oh, yeah)
Feelin', feelin' free
Throw it all on me, yeah

Treat me like white tees
Don't get me dirty (yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)
Love on, love on me, yeah (love, love, love, yeah, oh)

Jump on, jump on me (yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck on, fuck on me, yeah (oh, oh, ooh-whoa)

Nigga, you know that I'm mental, lil' bitch from the A
You know that you love how I move, you love my lil' waist
Love all that shit that I say (say)
Love it when I call you bae (bae)
I throw my lil' fist, I talk my lil' shit
And I always be gettin' my way, hey, hey 
You know what it is and you know what it ain't, hey, hey (oh, whoa)

Yeah, doin' the things that I never will know (oh, no, no)
Middle of summer, my niggas is cold (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We don't, we don't break the code
We, we just make the code
Fuck 'em, we don't bait the hoes
Fuck it, I'ma take a dose
Take a dose (take a dose)
Take a dose

Treat me like white tees
Don't get me dirty
Love, love, love on me (on me)
