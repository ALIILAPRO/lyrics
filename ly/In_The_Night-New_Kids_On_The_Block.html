		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the night
You live in my dreams
In the day
You're all that I see
I can't shake it
This vision of you stays in my head
I won't make it
If I don't get you back in my bed

There is a hunger burning in me
Feels like I'm dying, please, come set me free
My body wants your body now, I need your touch

In the night
Come take me to the danger zone
Set me on fire
In the night
Nobody will ever know
What we do after dark in the night

I'm losing my mind
In the day
There's nowhere to hide, oh, no
My heart is racing
I see your face in magazines
I'm hallucinating
I see you on every TV screen

There is a hunger burning in me
Feels like I'm dying, please, come set me free
My body wants your body now, I need your touch

In the night
Come take me to the danger zone
Set me on fire
In the night (oh)
Nobody will ever know
What we do after dark, in the night
Take me to the danger zone (oh, yeah)
Nobody will have to know
What we do in the dark

I wanna be there in your atmosphere
Gonna trust your light to guide me there

In the night (oh)
Come take me to the danger zone
Set me on fire
In the night
Nobody will ever know
What we do after dark, in the night
Come take me to the danger zone
Set me on fire
In the night (oh)
Nobody will ever know
What we do after dark in the night
