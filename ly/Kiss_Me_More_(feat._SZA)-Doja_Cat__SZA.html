		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We hug and yes, we make love
And always just say "Goodnight" (la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh, oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh, oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I like to say, "What if?", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be on to somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh, oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh, oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga (feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, nigga (exhale)
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on ya-, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (all this ass)
Drama make you feel (make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal
Is all I can give you

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh, oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh, oh
Oh, darlin'

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
