		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey you, where'd you go?
Your side of the bed has been getting cold
And I haven't slept since you left, at all
My signals been in and out
And I've been tryna figure out
If you ever tried to call

I'm doubting myself
Morbid and conscious of the way I felt
When you drove off
And I hope you found a way to forgive yourself

You're on fire, invincible
And you're on top of the end of the world
But so alone (So alone)
And now you're getting high and falling down
And you're looking hard
All around for a piece of mind

I'm doubting myself
Morbid and conscious of the way I felt
When you drove off
And I hope you found a way to forgive yourself
