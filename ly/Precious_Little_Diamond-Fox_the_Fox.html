		  Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you

Precious little diamond
Let it come to you.
Precious little
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
. . .
Well
I got my reasons why I still believe in you

You're my cry of wonder
There's no doubt I need you.
Love is talking to me whisper sweet things in my ear

Chain to chain reaction if you pull I move along.
You're my will and pleasure never felt so good
So strong.
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you.
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you

Precious little diamond
Crystallizing you.
Still I got my reasons
Won't you talk to me

You're a precious diamond - baby
Stay with me.
As you're coming closer
Pressure disappears

Baby. take it over. everything's so clear.
Well
I got my reasons why I stlll believe in you
. . .
Still I got my reasons
Won't you talk to me
. . .
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you

Precious little diamond
Let it come to you.
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
. . .
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
. . .
Ooh
I got my reasons
Won't you talk to me
. . .
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
