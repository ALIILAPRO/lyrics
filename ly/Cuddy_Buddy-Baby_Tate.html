		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I wanted was some dick
And conversation on occasion
I was never tryna cuff
Guess my intentions went amiss
Or you did too much contemplation
Why you had to fuck it up
You coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
Coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
You coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
Coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy

Why this keep on happening
Man why you keep on doing this
Why you keep on capping
When you say that you pursuing this
Ain't no strings attached
But you keep pulling it, pushing it
Pushing me away but baby
You know I'm not new to this
You do this shit everytime that
I fuck you too good
I would give you trash ass pussy if I could
But that's impossible
You know I just wanna get it poppin boo
All I really want from you is one thing
You call and I pick up for you on one ring
What the fuck you want from me
You exhausting me
I'm getting way less out this deal
Than it's costing me
I want my energy back you niggas wack
Say you love me to my face
But then you hate behind my back
Try to play me but you only play yourself
You was on a pedestal but now you on a shelf

All I wanted was some dick
And conversation on occasion
I was never tryna cuff
Guess my intentions went amiss
Or you did too much contemplation
Why you had to fuck it up
You coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
Coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
You coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
Coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy

Why you always gotta be so serious
I'm playing you be overthinking
You be twisting what I'm saying
Just because I said
I wanna ride you till I die
That don't really mean that
I want you to be my man
Told you if you take that dick away from me
I'll go brazy
So I guess you wanna see me go psycho
I go wild on it, don't I last time we did it
Almost left you in a coma
Did it in your dad's room
Did it in the bathroom if we was in school
We would have did it in a classroom
We did it all but we never did it right
You can't commit so I'll never be your wife
I guess you and I's sex was so priceless
I know I won't be able to find this
Anywhere else
But all you do is think about yourself

All I wanted was some dick
And conversation on occasion
I was never tryna cuff
Guess my intentions went amiss
Or you did too much contemplation
Why you had to fuck it up
You coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
Coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
You coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
Coulda been my cuddy buddy
Coulda been my cuddy
