		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh, yo, yo, I need all the dudes in the club
Get ya money out
(Let's get 'em Keri)
Stop, now let me see your booty drop

If you think you impressin' us with your ice and your dub
Poppin' bottles in the club, get your money up (uh-huh)
'Cause I ain't your average girl, I've been all around the world
If you wanna wow me then get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
I wanna see somethin' bigger than a Hummer truck
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You gotta throw somethin' bigger than a hundred bucks

Now slide slide one of them black cards
If you got it, then show me how you're gettin' it
Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it
When you see me in my thang, blow a whole lot of change
At the bar don't get jealous, get your money up
And if you don't like us, ain't nothin' to discuss
We don't even give a fuck, get your money up

Get your money up
Get your money up
(Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up)
Get your money up (get your money up)
Get your money up (get your money up)
(Stop) 
Get 'em, Keysh (now let me see your booty drop)

If you're tearin' the bar down with all the fly women
And still livin' with your mama
Get your money up
If you ridin' big whips, can't take care of your kids
Why you lookin' at me?
Get your money up
When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll
Them bottles pop, nonstop
You actin' Hollywood, you know how we roll 
(Stop)
Now let me see your booty drop

Cash is what I'm talkin' about 
I don't wanna hear your mouth
You needa put some money down, or get your money up
Why you invadin' my space? Why you get up in my face?
I ain't got nothin' to say, but get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
Know you wanna see somethin' better than the autobus
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks

Get your money up
Get your money up
(Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up)
Get your money up (get your money up)
Get your money up (get your money up)
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

Okay now, slide slide one of them black cards
If you got it then show me how your gettin' it
Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it
Now grind, grind
Get you some big money and don't forget about me when you're spendin' it
But if you ain't gon' pay, don't be screamin' out, "Hey girl"

Yo, yo, yo, yo (stop, now let me see your booty drop)
Big meals, think I'm gettin the 'itis
I big ball, that ain't no elephantiasis
Three girl play, so I'm triplin' my value
Keri steal, Keyshia pass, Nicki with the alley oop
More bottles then a wine-o
The winter coupe all-white, albino
And you know it is goin' down, like Drano 
'Cause when I come out, it's a zoo with a rhino
Okay, he know he's gon' have to step up on a C-note
Starbucks Hazelnut Vanilla Frappuchino
Rose Cliquot
Flyer than a bee so
Get your Brinks truck, I'm flyer than Darwing Duck

Get your money up
Get your money up
(Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up)
Get your money up (get your money up)
Get your money up (get your money up)
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

Woo
I know that's right, Keri
Your girl KC (uh-huh)
They gon' hate on this one right here, let's go
Oh (yo, yo, I need all the niggas in the club)
Now get your money up 
(Get ya money out)
Get your money up
(Put it in an escalator)
Get your money up
We don't like them broke boys (step ya money up) 
We don't like them broke boys (step ya money up, nigga)
