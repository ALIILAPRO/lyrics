		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you bleed for me?
Lick it off my lips like you needed me?
Would you sit me on a couch?
With your fingers in my mouth?
You look so cool when you're reading me

Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek

But I've got my mind, made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?

And I've got my mind, made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette, set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head, tonight

Would you lie for me?
Cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?

Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek

But I've got my mind, made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?

And I've got my mind, made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette, set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head, tonight

Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd let me
Hmm, when you met me when you met me
You told me you were gonna get me

Don't forget me don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd

And I've got my mind, made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?

And I've got my mind, made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette, set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight, tonight, tonight
Set a fire in my head tonight
