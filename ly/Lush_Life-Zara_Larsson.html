		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up
It was a crush
Now I might have went and said too much
But that's all it was
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
I kept saying I'ma stay in touch
But that thing went bust
So I gave it up, ooh
No tricks, no bluff
I'm just better off without them cuffs
Yeah, the sun won't set on us
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah

Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain't ever worried
Went low, went high
What matters is now
Getting right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush
The lush life giving me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
Now I've found another crush
The lush life giving me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush
The lush life giving me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
Now I've found another crush
The lush life giving me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
