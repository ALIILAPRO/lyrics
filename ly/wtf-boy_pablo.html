		<p>
		  You seem to be down and I don't see why
Is it something that I've done
I thought you were fine, now you don't wanna talk
Can you tell me what is wrong?

I need to say to you
I don't understand

Yeah, I need to understand
Why you want so much space
Yeah, I need to understand
Why you're making that face
