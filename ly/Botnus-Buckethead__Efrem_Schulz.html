		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run, Run, Run...

Blast, Blast across your face
Deep cuts will open new space
As I fight, there's no way around
All the truth, the story never told

As we fight
Will you get us
Inside of the serenity

No loss, but ends without a lie
A new level, a reign of tolerance
A thrill ride you'll bnever wanna leave
Hold your breath it's your choice to look inside

The sign of doom, just when it's time to leave
Direct action, along with apathy
No other drug, but I love everyone
Mountains from molehills, crushing foundation
The lies are true, but fuck everything you've heard
My life hinges on every single word
I've got on last request before I leave
Kill me softly - Tear me limb from limb!!!

And now I'm gone...
My existence stretched too far...
I want this too much...
I want this too much...
So I may...

Run, Run

Bash, Blast across your face
Deep cuts will open new space
As I fight, there's no way around
All the truth, the story never told

As we fight
Will you get us
Inside of the serenity

As we fight
Will you get us
Inside of the serenity

...Until next time!
