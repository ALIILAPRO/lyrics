		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you've come from a long ways to go
Endowed with the flow and the destinies to grow
Into what you've come to be, the sons of the P
As it is so shall it be the max

If being is what it's all about
You as I as we, be maximum is
All that can be you be, sons of the P
Graduation is upon you

Relax your mind and let your conscious be free
Relax your mind and let your conscious be free

Release your mind and let your instincts flow
Release your mind and let the funk flow
Release your mind and let your instincts flow
Release your mind and let the funk flow

Release your mind and let your instincts flow
Release your mind and let the funk flow
Release your mind and let your instincts flow
Release your mind and let the funk flow

We are here to let you flow
Raise your hands and let 'em go
We are here to let you flow
Raise your hands and let 'em go

So we go, portfolio dolio
Dodio doe, sons of the flow
Portfolio dolio
Dodio doe, sons of the flow

Some say we're the sons of the preacher
Some says we're the sons of the prophet
But most of all we need the funk, got to have the funk
We are the sons of the P

So we go, portfolio dolio
Dodio doe, sons of the flow
Portfolio dolio
Dodio doe, sons of the flow

We are the sons of the P

Your present state of mind, you're happiness
You're spiritual creativity will be at its best
But first we must undress the clothes of society
Oh yes, we must undress the clothes of society

We're pulling down the pants to your mind
This time we'll make love to your intellect
The people in control are working very hard
To keep your natural desires in check

The things we bring will scatter sunshine
In those times of rain
So enter near and have no fear
And we'll set free the pain
Take me away, let me fly

Some say we're the sons of the preacher
Some says we're the sons of the prophet
But most of all we need the funk, got to have the funk
We are the sons of the P

Never bringing a short to you
A new candle wax for your jeep, doo doo
What you like as long as it's hype alright
And the doctor said you don't need a thing

We are here to let you flow
Raise your hands and let 'em go
Yes, we are the sons of the P
Take me away

And as you have grown into
What you and only you can be
Sons of the P
Go forth and funk 'em

Pack your bags, we're gonna take a trip
Don't watch your intuition, let your thought waves slip
To another level where the funk is fat
If I toast to the rhythm would you drink to that?

I won't try to judge, just letting you know
We need more sun if the P's gonna grow
We need more sun, sons of the flow
Portfolio dolio

'Round and 'round, and 'round and around
So you've come from a long ways to go
Endowed with the flow and the destinies to grow
Into what you've come to be

And only you can be sons of the P
As it is so shall it be the maximum izness
Graduation is upon you, go forth and funk 'em
Fuck 'em, just to see the look on their face

Some say we're the sons of the preacher
Some says we're the sons of the prophet
But most of all we need the funk, got to have the funk
We are the sons of the P
