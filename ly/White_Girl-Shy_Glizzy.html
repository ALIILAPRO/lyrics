		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In love with a white girl
She soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said get me dope, boy

In love with a white girl
She soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said get me dope, boy

I seen 15 bricks today
You make 15 bucks an hour
Robbin' ass niggas in the kitchen, playing with flour
I got all this power, you a fucking coward
My bitch come from France, oh, she like my Eiffel Tower
Oops
My plug got them blocks , just like LuLu
I supply your block, give you work and tell you do you
You no fool, you know that the Glizzy Gang will shoot you
We're not backing down, we not run from shit but woo woo
Cocaine, that's my bitch, oh, she made me rich
I wanna be like rich these niggas wanna be like Mitch
In the kitchen, when I cook a wankle wankle wip
Free my dawg they book 'em just like Michael Michael Vick

In love with a white girl
She soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said get me dope, boy

In love with a white girl
She soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said get me dope, boy

Trips to Puerto Rico
Fucking with my 'migo
Bitch, they sing like Ne-Yo
This shit do not come with cheat codes
Lil' over seas ho
Wish I had a trio
Feisty like a lion, I forgot she was a Leo
She come from the slums
Grew up on first of the month
Know how to shoot a gun
Her father fought in Vietnam

She so fucking fine, yeah, she so fucking fine
She have a lot of niggas
She say I'm the dopest one

I got a lot of guns
I got a lot of paper
Won't nobody find ya body
Boy I got a lot of acres
I give these niggas tips
Ooh y'all should've been some waiters
My wrists like dirty chicks
Ooh I should've been a baker

In love with a white girl
She soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said get me dope, boy

In love with a white girl
She soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said get me dope, boy
