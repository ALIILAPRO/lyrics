		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that the love is gone

What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone (love is gone)

What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone (love is gone)

Now that the love is gone
The love felt so right, so wrong
Now that the love is gone

I feel so hurt inside
Feel so hurt inside
Got to find a reason

What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone (now that the love, now that the love is gone)

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone (now that the love)
(Love is gone)

Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason to hold on

Love
There's nothing left for us to say
Love
Why can't we turn and walk away?

What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through (now that the love)
When everything that felt so right is wrong (now that the love)
Now that the love is gone (oh)

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone (now that the love)

What are we supposed to do?
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong (yeah)
Now that the love is gone (love is gone)
