		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Balls hangin' low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swangin', cling clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Badass B, keep on goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath (yeah, ay)

Just popped a kidney, I bought a million options of the stock
And I stopped doin' the green
Man, I rock arenas, bringin' the peace and I'm bumpin' that Pac
In the car, pretendin' I got all the eyes on me

Got a bad baby and she's independent
Too many people older than me that's seekin' attention
When they warned me 'bout the goofies, man I shoulda listened
And the smell of the money my strangest addiction, uh

She tip for dick
I let her lick
I had to dip
I'm off a 5th
Am I rich now?

I bought a whip
I paint it pink
It drive itself
The fuck you think?
Yeah, I'm rich now

Ay, lil mamma, yeah, you heard about me?
I'ma pop you like a pea, yeah, edamame
Yeah, I feel so hot like I'm chillin' on the beach
Yeah, baby in the sun like the Teletubbies (woo)

Balls hangin' low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swangin', cling clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Badass B, keep on goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath

I've been in the club and takin' shots
If you got your mask off in the photo you gettin' cropped
Hoppin' out the function, the CVS is like a block away
Bought a moisturizer, my ice cold, it's dryin' my face
Don't need that VVS, my ice is fake, your life is fake
I choose to do it for my pocket's sake
You basin' your opinions on what the major says
I renovate, the bad energy I erase, uh 

Yeah, I don't really ever wanna talk, talk, talk, talk
Only really ever want the top, top, top, top
Guess I'm goin' back to the sock, sock, sock, sock
Least this money never really stop, stop, stop, stop

Hey little mamma, yeah, you heard about me?
I'ma pop you like a pea, yeah, edamame
Yeah, I feel so hot like I'm chillin' on the beach
Yeah, baby in the sun like the Teletubbies (woo)

Balls hangin' low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swangin', cling clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Badass B, keep on goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath
