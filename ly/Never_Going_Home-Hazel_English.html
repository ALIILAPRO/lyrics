		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm drawn in
Etched into this
It's part of me
It's under my skin
And I'm addicted tonight

There is no wait
I've got to satiate
This burning feeling in my throat
I'm not playing it safe
And it's getting late

Wasted on this feeling
Helpless to this call

Never going home again
Turn the lights out when you're leaving
Never going home again
Don't wait up for me I'm not leaving

Falling in
Inch by inch
I'm not resisting
And I'm addicted tonight

There is no wait
I've got to satiate
This burning feeling in my throat
I'm not playing it safe
And it's getting late

Wasted on this feeling
Helpless to this call

Never going home again
Turn the lights out when you're leaving
Never going home again
Don't wait up for me
I'm not leaving

Falling in
Inch by inch
I'm not resisting
And I'm addicted tonight
Falling in
Inch by inch
I'm not resisting
And I'm addicted tonight

Think I'm getting closer

Never going home again
Turn the lights out when you're leaving
Never going home again
Don't wait up for me
I'm not leaving
