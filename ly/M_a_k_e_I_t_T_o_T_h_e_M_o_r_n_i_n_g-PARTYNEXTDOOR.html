		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wow, wow, wow
Oh-woo-ooh
Oh-ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, oh-woah, no, woah

Let's make it 'til the mornin', girl, yeah
Oh, let's make it 'til the mornin', girl
Yeah

I don't wanna fight, but you got the wrong vibes
Hold, let me get you right, it's how I apologize
JT when you act up, I'll eat the pussy up
And give you somethin' to make noise about
Don't scream or shout, I'm workin' my way down
Girl, you gettin' loud, now, put it in yo' mouth
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The shit I did last night I'm not real proud of (Wet)
But let's just wait 'til the mornin' until I say my part, oh

Let's make it 'til the mornin', girl, yeah
Let's make it, yeah, yeah
Oh, let's make it 'til the mornin', girl
Ooh-woah, oh, yeah

I don't wanna fight with ya, tryna end my night with ya
Don't let yo' mind getcha, I wanna vibe with you
Oh-woah (yeah, yeah, nah, nah)
Yeah, as soon as I get up out of this bed, I'm tryna make love (oh-yeah)
As soon as I get up out of this bed, I'm tryna make it up (oh)
It's the lyin' you said, felt like Maybelline
You can't just make shit up (oh)
It's the spinnin' and spinnin' again for me
My shawty gon' spin back again for me
Yeah, I know I say it all the time, but I promise
And let's just say it'll take a little more patience, ooh
'Cause the shit I did last night, I'm not real proud of
Oh, yeah, yeah

Let's make it 'til the mornin', girl, yeah
Let's make it, yeah
Oh, let's make it 'til the mornin', girl
