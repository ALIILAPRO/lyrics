		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatever you give life you will get back
Why be a wallflower
When you can be a Venus fly trap?

I never quite fit in
To that Hollywood thing (ah)
I didn't play that game
For the money or the fame (oh)

I did it my way, baby
Nothing in this world could change me

Don't underestimate me
'Cause one day you're gonna see
You're in a losing battle
Babe, you'll never stop me being me

I got the beauty, got the brains
Got the power, hold the reigns
I should be motherfucking crazy
Nothing in this world could change me

I sacrificed it all for a life to call mine
All the love and security
To be myself, oh I

I know that money ain't important (ah)
And it don't mean you're the best (oh)
But I earned it all myself
And I'm a millionairess

I did it my way, baby
Nothing in this world could change me

Don't underestimate me
'Cause one day you're gonna see
You're in a losing battle
Babe, you'll never stop me being me

I got the beauty, got the brains
Got the power, hold the reigns
I should be motherfucking crazy
Nothing in this world could change me

They'll shame you, blame you
Pretend to even hate you
Take away your rights
Pacify you with their lies
Whatever you give life
You are gonna get back
Why be a wallflower
When you can be a Venus fly trap?

Don't underestimate me
'Cause one day you're gonna see
You're in a losing battle
Babe, you'll never stop me being me
'Cause whatever you give life
You're gonna get back
Why be a wallflower
When you can be a Venus fly trap?

Nothing in this world, oh
Nothing in this world could change me, me
