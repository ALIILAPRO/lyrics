		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think it's been a while, since they called you son
Digging out a smile, since the crowds have come
The body never lies, sugar-sweet pain
Sleeping on the tiles, how times have changed

And heaven will never be empty
Strange the way the silence grows

Hold on, you must be hurting
I'm thinking of you now
I'm thinking of you now
It's all gone, you must be searching
I'm thinking of you now
I'm thinking of you now

Spinning like a top
A never ending course that finds a darker place
The coward in my heart
That's never held the pain that finds you everyday
Standing in the crowd
You've seen it all through photographs that cameras take
If you could see them now, silhouetted on your face

Heaven will never be empty
Strange the way the silence grows
You'll never forget your twenties

Hold on, you must be hurting
I'm thinking of you now
I'm thinking of you now
It's all gone, you must be searching
I'm thinking of you now
I'm thinking of you now

And heaven will never be empty
Strange the way the silence grows
