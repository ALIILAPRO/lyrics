		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me a choice between pleasure and pain
I choose pain

Another day without a heartbeat
How can your heart beat
If they've taken it away
For the first time, just don't think about it
Take the water and wash your face with pain

You can take away the power
Your finest hour
It's when you laugh in their faces
For the first time just forget about it
Take a hammer and pound yourself with pain

Bury my bones on the moon
If they never should find me it would be too soon
Give me a choice between power and pain
I choose pain

Oh, bury my bones on moon
If they never should find me it would be too soon
For the first time just forget about
Take the water and wash your face with pain
Oh just forget about pain
Forget about the pain
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain!
