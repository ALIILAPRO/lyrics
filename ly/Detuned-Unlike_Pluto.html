		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All alone in this room (ha ahh)
Out of time and detuned (ha, ah, ah)

Late at night I'm staying up
Run the scene and slow it down
I'm not close to keeping up
Lost the color all around

Bend the fabric of time
Distorted
Sounds that fit in my life
Oscillate
At your rate when you're

All alone in this room (ha)
Out of time and detuned (ha ahh)
Happier on the wrong notes (ha)
Half speed with the moon (ha, ah, ah)

Everyone thinks I'm giving up
Just because I'm different
Off beat of a rhythm
I live out of harmony

Bend the fabric of time
Distorted
Sounds that fit in my life
Oscillate
At your rate when you're

All alone in this room (ha ahh)
Out of time and detuned (ha ahh)
Happier on the wrong notes (ha ahh)
Half speed with the moon (ha, ah, ah)

It's hard to say what I'm feeling
Got a cadence that's never ending
The light is always bending from the prism I'm in
Don't throw glass stones, at a glass house it will shatter within
Put the pieces in the trash bin and the thoughts you live in

(All alone in this room)

All alone in this room (ha ahh)
Out of time and detuned (ha ahh)
