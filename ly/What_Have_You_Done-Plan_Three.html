		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the stories are over
Chapters are done
All this chaos around me
Always Alone

Why did I see burning fires in your eyes?
How could you let me end up in this?
Well, I don't know
The rose I hold
Won't seem to grow

So what have you done?
What are you hiding?
What are you holding onto?
This side of me is gone
It's killing me inside
To watch you go
It's keeping me alive

All the sirens are warning
Screaming our sins
I've been hiding the feeling
Of touching your skin
Why did I put out the fires in your eyes?
How could I erase the living in me?
I need to go
My lonely soul falls on you

So what have you done?
What are you hiding?
What are you holding onto?
This side of me is gone
It's killing me inside
To watch you go
It's keeping me alive
It's keeping me alive

So what have you done?
What are you hiding?
What are you holding onto?
This side of me is gone
It's killing me inside
To watch you go
