		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Softly, just break it to me softly
Be straight with me but gently
Tender before you kill me
Pow, pow (אוי ואבוי)
Calmly, I don't freak out in public
Take me outside and crush me
Over a cup of coffee
Ow, ow

What a joke, what a joke you made me
What's a queen to a joker? Tell me
What's a laugh to a self-destructive me?
What's a prayer to a death wish?
You so
Joke, what a joke you made me
What's a queen to a joker? Tell me
What's a laugh to a self-destructive me?
What's a prayer to a death wish?

You so done, done, done
Shut up
One way to make it stop
Shut up

Touch without leaving traces
Scar me in hidden places, inside
Don't get my mom all worried
Not now (kids these days)
Losers outplay other losers
Guess what that makes the two of us
Rooftop city shines at sunrise
I'll let you watch while I jump

What a joke, what a joke you made me
What's a queen to a joker? Tell me
What's a laugh to a self-destructive me?
What's a prayer to a death wish?
You so
Joke, joke, j-j-joke you made me
Qu-queen to a joker, tell me
What's home to a claustrophobic?
What's a sea to a dead fish?

You so done, done, done
Shut up
One way to make it stop
Shut up
Shut up
