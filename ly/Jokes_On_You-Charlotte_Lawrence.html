		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drag me to death, like a lit cigarette
Took my last breath, like the smoke from my lips
I've lied for you, and I liked it too
But my knees are bruised, from kneelin' to you
I've had enough, but you're too hard to quit
We've had our fun, now your sugar makes me sick
I've lied for you, and I liked it too
But my makeup's ruined

And now I'm laughin' through my tears
I'm cryin' through my fear
But baby, if I had to choose
The joke's on you

The joke's on you

God knows I've tried to be kind
But I will just lay down and die
Wearin' a fake smile
The joke's on you

My heart's gone bad, now it won't beat for you
You had your laugh, now I won't play the fool
I've lied for you, and I liked it too
But I'm black and blue, from bleedin' for you
You strike the match, burn me out so fast
Look what we had, now it's turned to ash
I've lied for you, and I liked it too
But my makeup's ruined

And now I'm laughin' through my tears
I'm cryin' through my fear
But baby, if I had to choose
The joke's on you

The joke's on you

God knows I've tried to be kind
But I will just lay down and die
Wearin' a fake smile
The joke's on you
