		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad all the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands on my body
Tell me you want it tonight

I'm lookin' for my Mr. Wrong
If that's alright then let me know, oh oh, oh oh
I know exactly what you want
But if you tell me we can go, oh oh, oh oh

So put your summer hands all over my summer body
You'll get some of this after my summer party
I can make it hard if that's the way you want it
If that's the way you want it 
(That's the way you want it)

Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad all the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands on my body
Tell me you want it tonight

(I know exactly what you want)
(I know exactly what you want)

I'm lookin' for my Mr. Wrong
If that's alright then let me know, oh oh, oh oh
I know exactly what you want
But if you tell me we can go, oh oh, oh oh

So put your summer hands all over my summer body
You'll get some of this after my summer party
I can make it hard if that's the way you want it
If that's the way you want it 
(That's the way you want it)

Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad all the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands on my body
Tell me you want it tonight

(I know exactly what you want)
(I know exactly what you want)

Tell me the truth
Tell me you wanna be bad
'Cause I wanna be bad all the time

Tell me the truth
When you put your hands on my body
Tell me you want it tonight
