		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riders on the storm 
Riders on the storm 
Into this house, we're born 
Into this world, we're thrown 
Like a dog without a bone 
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm 

There's a killer on the road 
His brain is squirmin' like a toad 
Take a long holiday 
Let your children play 
If you give this man a ride 
Sweet family will die 
Killer on the road, yeah 

Girl, you gotta love your man 
Girl, you gotta love your man 
Take him by the hand 
Make him understand 
The world on you depends 
Our life will never end 
Gotta love your man, yeah 

Riders on the storm 
Riders on the storm 
Into this house, we're born 
Into this world, we're thrown 
Like a dog without a bone 
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm 

Riders on the storm 
Riders on the storm 
Riders on the storm 
Riders on the storm
