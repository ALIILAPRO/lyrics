		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Step one side to side
Bodies gently moving
I let myself fly this time
Dance for miles and miles
Crowd's been slowly growing
But it's only you I see this time

We're going in now deeper down the rabbit hole
Never ending rivers wind us to the fall
Keep falling all the deeper down the rabbit hole
Never ending rivers wind us to the fall

They drop us way down low

Drop us way down low

Learn my melodies
Keep my two feet shuffling
Always stay right here this time

I got everything with ease
We'll be living, not surviving
It's only you and me this time

We're going in now deeper down the rabbit hole
Never ending rivers wind us to the fall
Keep falling all the deeper down the rabbit hole
Never ending rivers wind us to the fall

We're going in now deeper down the rabbit hole
Never ending rivers wind us to the fall
Keep falling all the deeper down the rabbit hole
Never ending rivers wind us to the fall

They drop us way down low

They drop us way down low
