		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A year from now we'll all be gone
All our friends will move away
And they're going to better places
But our friends will be gone away

Nothing is as it has been
And I miss your face like Hell
And I guess it's just as well
But I miss your face like Hell

Been talking 'bout the way things change
And my family lives in a different state
And if you don't know what to make of this
Then we will not relate
So if you don't know what to make of this
Then we will not relate

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Oh rivers and roads
Oh rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you
