		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to Heaven above
But honestly I never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me

I'm gonna run, run away, run, run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run, run away, run, run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to Heaven above
But honestly I never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me

It would take some time just to see me shine
For the whole world to see me here in all of my light
But honestly I've given up on all the fight
'Til one day I'll have you here wrapped up in my light

I'm gonna run, run away, run, run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run, run away, run, run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black

I'm gonna run, run away, run, run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run, run away, run, run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black

(I don't think we should sit here) 
(And take any more time for our children to be endangered)
(For if they come after our children and we give them our children)
(Then our children will suffer forever)
(You had to be honest and you stayed)
(If you'd have wanted to run, you'd have had to run with them)
(Because anybody coulda run today, they would have wanted to)
(I know you're not a runner and your life is precious to me) 
(It's as precious as John's) 
(And I, and I don't, what I do, I do with weight and justice and judgment)

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to Heaven above
But honestly I never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself calling up to Heaven above
But honestly I never had much sympathy
'Cause next time you're praying, you'll be praying for me
