		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too high, too deep
It's you, it's me
Too wired to sleep, oh, yeah
One thing to need
Three words, I speak
When you're with me, babe

Oh, come on, come on
However I act, you know how much I care
Come on, come on
You know what I want, now meet me if you dare
Love on the run, love on the run, run
Do anything to be there, be there

And I'll always say your name like a prayer
Oh, when you touch me there
Oh, you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you all through the night and
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh, you'll always be my ritual

Oh, you'll always be my ritual
Oh, you'll always be my ritual

You worship me
Beneath the sheets
Our love unique, and even when
You leave my bed, you're in my head
You're all I need

Oh, come on, come on
However I act, you know how much I care
Come on, come on
You know what I want, now meet me if you dare
Love on the run, love on the run, run
Do anything to be there, be there

And I'll always say your name like a prayer
Oh, when you touch me there
Oh, you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you all through the night and
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh, you'll always be my ritual

Oh, you'll always be my ritual
Oh, you'll always be my ritual

So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, babe
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, babe
Oh, love on the run, love on the run, love on the run, babe
Oh, anywhere, be there, with you

And I'll always say your name like a prayer
Oh, when you touch me there
Oh, you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you all through the night and
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh, you'll always be my ritual
I'll always say your name like a prayer
Oh, when you touch me there
Oh, you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you all through the night and
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh, you'll always be my ritual

You'll always be my ritual
