		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, Ned captain Crunch presents
In love with the moon in love with the moon
In love with the moon
You can feel the energy, the energy

In love with the moon
You can feel the energy
I step into the room, everyone my enemy
They got a lot to prove
Let you know I'm watching how you move
I'm a creep
I could hear you lying when you speak
I'ma test you, baby, you was nothing
But I blessed you you ain't really like me
But my tendencies arrest you
I can hypnotize you like a dream
I'm what you want
I can hear your message when you scream
I'm in the front

What I wrote I'ma live it, I ain't tripping
I'm the man
I'ma get it how I know, I can do it on my own
How you're living? You ain't
Doing what you wrote
You ain't show that you mean it
Remind me of a demon just let me be
Crawl inside my head
Control me like a lucid dream
You don't care about me
But you mean a lot to me
You won't let me breathe
You're gonna drown me like the sea
Baby, can't you see?
You're a fucked up girl in a fucked up world
Yeah, you're broken, you're alone, but
That's just tough love, girl
Now you wanna go back home
But you can run with me
I can show you something different
If you promise you don't leave
If you don't leave I can
Show you what you need
I can put you in a mansion
I can buy you anything
I can take you in a fast car
Something like a NASCAR
Speed around the city
Doing anything we please

In love with the moon
You can feel the energy
I step into the room, everyone my enemy
They got a lot to prove
Let you know I'm watching how you move
I'm a creep
I could hear you lying when you speak
I'ma test you, baby, you was nothing
But I blessed you you ain't really like me
But my tendencies arrest you
I can hypnotize you like a dream
I'm what you want
I can hear your message when you scream
I'm in the front

What I wrote I'ma live it, I ain't tripping
I'm the man
I'ma get it how I know, I can do it on my own
How you're living? You ain't
Doing what you wrote
You ain't show that you mean it
Remind me of a demon just let me be
Crawl inside my head
Control me like a lucid dream
You don't care about me
But you mean a lot to me
You won't let me breathe
You're gonna drown me like the sea
Baby, can't you see?
You're a fucked up girl in a fucked up world
Yeah, you're broken, you're alone, but
That's just tough love, girl
Now you wanna go back home
But you can run with me
I can show you something different
If you promise you don't leave
If you don't leave I can
Show you what you need
I can put you in a mansion
I can buy you anything
I can take you in a fast car
Something like a NASCAR
Speed around the city
Doing anything we please
Doing anything we please
