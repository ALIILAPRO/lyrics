		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I loves you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me and drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever and I'll be glad

Yes, I loves you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me with his hot hands
If you can keep me
I wants to stay here with you forever
I've got my man

I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me and drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
I've got my man

Someday I know he's coming to call me
He's going to handle me and hold me soon
He's going to be like dying, Porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes I know I'll have to go

I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Honey, don't let him handle me and drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
I've got my man
