		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die
They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones, they'll ride into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
The scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Whoa, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die

Oh, when the world is calling out your name
Beggin' you to fight
Oh-oh-oh, pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
