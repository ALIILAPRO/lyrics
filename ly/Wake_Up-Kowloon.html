		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how to cry
Does any one these days
Know what's real
Won't you take me by the hand
I didn't want to feel
Cuz life felt too hard
Now its all a game that I don't understand

Wake up
Live someone else's dream
Smile smile
Cuz they're all watching
Shakeup shakedown
They can't hear you scream
Smile smile
Can't you hear me sing?

I don't know how to feel
Does any one these days
Even care if the next man is 'live or dead?
I didn't want to look 
The daylight is too hard
I feel like somethings changed
But I can't understand

Wake up
Live someone else's dream
Smile smile
Cuz they're all watching
Shakeup shakedown
They can't hear you scream
Smile smile
Can't you hear me sing?

Wake up
Live someone else's dream
Smile smile
Cuz they're all watching
Shakeup shakedown
They can't hear you scream
Smile smile
Can't you hear me sing?

There is something strange
In my brain
Thats coming through (And I never)
I hear your name
And my brain
Tears me in two
