		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I say
I can't make her stay
When I know that she's so far above
How could she ever love
Someone like me
She's out of reach

Here in the dark, inside the hole in my heart
I'm fighting all of my demons tryna tear me apart
And I'm still not sure
What you ever saw in me

No
I'ma, I'ma fallen angel
And no matter where my heart is there's no way I'll ever
Reach up to Heaven to ya

She's so far outta this world
No way I could ever be with her
'Cause I know Heaven's your home
That's where angels belong
And it wouldn't be fair
If I keep you down here

Here in the dark, inside the hole in my heart
I'm fighting all of my demons tryna tear me apart
And I'm still not sure
What you ever saw in me

No
I'ma, I'ma fallen angel
Tryna fly but I'm not able, oh
And I need you to know
That it's okay to let me go
'Cause no matter where my heart is there's no way I'll ever
Reach up to Heaven to ya

I'ma, I'ma fallen angel
Yeah, I'ma, I'ma fallen angel
And I'm still not sure
What you ever saw in me

No
I'ma, I'ma fallen angel
Tryna fly but I'm not able, so
Just let me go (I'ma, I'ma fallen angel)
'Cause no matter where my heart is there's no way I'll ever
Reach up to Heaven to ya
