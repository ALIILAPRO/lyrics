		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My girl Liddy used to always smoke
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
She'd disappear for an hour and a half
And when she'd come back she'd brush her teeth
But I could still smell it on her raggedy tee
And I could taste it on her lips when we kissed
Poor little Liddy used to always quit
But she never really quit
She'd just say she did

My girl Liddy used to always smoke
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
I wonder what she did when she got done
I guess she'd just flick them out in the street
Poor little Liddy, she wishes it was dark
But it's never really dark in LA
The light from the billboard always shines
But it changed twelve times since you went away
