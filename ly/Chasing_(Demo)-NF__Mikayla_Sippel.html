		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna run away
Find somewhere that feels safe
Find somewhere the bad days
Don't come as often in this sad phase
Somewhere I can be loved
Where I don't have to run away from my flaws
And I don't have to be afraid of my thoughts
This high, this high that I've been chasing

Doesn't have an exit
I don't learn my lesson
I don't see no endin' in sight
I don't feel the best when I try
Holdin' my head up high but it's not workin'
Makin' you cry makes me feel like a bad person (bad person)
And something's got a hold on me
They don't see the world I see
Heartbeat in my chest feels weak
It's really startin' to weigh on me, yeah

I just wanna run away
And find somewhere that feels safe
Find somewhere the bad days
Don't come as often in this sad phase
Somewhere I can be loved
Where I don't have to run away from my flaws
And I don't have to be afraid of my thoughts
With this high, this high that I've been chasing

Always likes the sad trip
And ruin all my friendships
Way too many questions in my mind
I don't have the answers but I try
Holdin' my head up high but it's not workin', yeah
Making you sad makes me feel like a bad person (bad person, person)
I said some awful things last week
Messin' with my self-esteem
Mixed up my priorities
It's really startin' to weigh on me, yeah

I just wanna run away
Find somewhere that feels safe
Find somewhere the bad days
Don't come as often in this sad phase
Somewhere I can be loved
Where I don't have to run away from my flaws
And I don't have to be afraid of my thoughts
This high, this high that I've been chasing
