		<p>
		  I'm waiting, please come back
I've got the guts now
To meet your eye
Those guts are killing
But I can't stop now
Got to connect with you girl
Before I forget how
Please won't you hang around?
Can drop you under
What it is we found
I'm waiting, please come back
I've got the guts now
To meet your eye
Those guts are killing
But I can't stop now
Got to connect with you girl
Before I forget how
Please won't you hang around?
Can drop you under
What it is we found
