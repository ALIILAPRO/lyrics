		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's it

Can we be how we used to?
How we started
Golden moments
Before you were broken-hearted for me
So selfishly
So carelessly
I broke pieces of you

And you turned 'round and walked out of that door
Ain't been the same, numbers got changed
Couldn't take the pain no more
Oh, na, na, na
It's midnight and the word's getting around town
That you're in love
Heard that you found the kind of love you hurt for, mmm

I hope I don't see you around (hey)
Can't let you see how much I miss you
And these lips that yearn to kiss you again
I hope I don't see you around (hey)
I'm barricading in the condo
Places I used to go I'll never go again
'Cause I don't wanna see you around (hey)
I don't wanna see you around, ooh
I don't wanna see you

Every morning click on the TV
And watch our shows on repeat
Waiting for the seasons to change (yeah)
'Cause July's feeling like December
And April feels like winter
My mind doesn't wanna remember
But my heart won't let me forget

When you turned 'round and walked out of that door
Ain't been the same, numbers got changed
Couldn't take the pain no more
Oh, na, na, na
It's midnight and the word's getting around town
That you're in love
Heard that you found the kind of love you hurt for, mmm

I hope I don't see you around (hey)
Can't let you see how much I miss you
And these lips that yearn to kiss you again
I hope I don't see you around (hey)
I'm barricading in the condo
Places I used to go I'll never go again (places I used to go I'll never go again)
'Cause I don't wanna see you around (hey)

No never
No never
No never
Don't wanna see you around
No never
Never, never
I don't wanna see you
No never
No never
No never
I don't wanna see you around
No never
Never, never
I hope I don't see you around

I know you got somebody else but I can't act like I don't know
I know I said I'd never do this, but this one time I'll be yours
And I'll let my morals go for you
I'll put on my best show for you
I think about you every night
I can't lie, I need more of you, yeah
So this is what it feels like
Birthday cake on the side
To be open this wide, yeah (to be open this wide)
This is what it feels like
To swallow your pride
That Ziploc love undefined
This is what it feels like

I think I like it like this
