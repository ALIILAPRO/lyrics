		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ready or not
We've started a game
The rules are few and empty
Drip out of your heart
Reach out of your cell
Come in closer
Time your movement well

Reversed the rules again
Deciding how to win
Your turn at the cross
The way I see it's your only shot
You covered in gowns
You'll wear never again
Getting closer, so close

Sometimes I feel like the rules been changed
Sometimes I feel like a ghost in chains

It's only a test
Take this chain into your hand
Offer up to the gods
Let's pretend
We're getting closer, so close

Sometimes (sometimes) I feel like the rules been changed
Sometimes (sometimes) I feel like a ghost in chains
Sometimes (sometimes) I realize you wrote this game
Sometimes (sometimes) I feel like we're both in chains

Ready or not
We're caught in this game
Life is cruel and empty
Reach out of your heart
Reach out of your cell
Getting closer

It's only a test
It's only a
It's only a test
It's only a
It's only a test
It's only a

Sometimes (sometimes) I feel like the rules been changed
Sometimes (sometimes) I feel like a ghost in chains
Sometimes (sometimes) I realize you wrote this game
Sometimes (sometimes) I feel like we're both in chains
