		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got the look
She's so fine
And you know damn well
The girl will be mine
She got the breaks
She's a scene
And you know damn well
She gives it to me (uh-huh)

Black jeans
And a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin'
'Cause I've seen her look better
She composition
She statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kickin' at the back

She got the look
(She's got the look)
(Wanna know better)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
(She's driving me wild)
(She's got the look)
(Wanna know better)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
(She's driving me wild)

Come to the place, shocked and see
And you know damn well
You know what I mean
Hot in the face
One and three
Like a pleasure trip
Like you've never seen

Satin lace
And a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
And she knows she's just hot
She got position
She got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case

She's got the look
(She's got the look)
(Wanna know better)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
(She's driving me wild)
That girl's my baby
(She's got the look)
(Wanna know better)
(She's got the look)
(She's driving me wild)

Please no, keep back
I can't take it
You're driving me wild
I might not make it
You got me looking like Buckwheat
Oh, hair pulled
Every which way but neat
Far from Medusa
But you look so deadly
Your walk is soft
Still I hear the medley (uh-huh)
Uh, shiver me Timberland boots
Cramp my style
She drives me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(Wanna know better)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
(She's driving me wild)
That girl's my baby
(She's got the look)
(Wanna know better)
(She's got the look)
(She's driving me wild)

She's got the look
Wanna know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look (uh-huh)
Wanna know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look (she's got the look, she's got the look)
She's got the look (she's got the look, that's just my baby)
She's got the look (give it here, I like that)
She's got the look (never gonna)
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
I wanna know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
