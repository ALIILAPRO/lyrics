		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes fading
Now my mindset, screaming
C'mon
Unfocused now my faces going numb
Pissed off
There's no chance I got
Cause my mindset ain't the same as back then
But you don't get me baby
So why you got to hate me
Guess I should've told you
That we aren't the same
I'm so down
I'm so down
I'm so down today
I wanna run away
I wanna run away
I wanna run away
From this place
Wanna take this knife
Lemme lose my mind
Baby that's my life
Takin' drugs every night
Imma mind my time
Imma cross my line
In a world with the sky'
Dead by design
Ay
Don't know what to do
Nothing left to do
I just need a slate
Yeah
On my mind wonder why
Life a roller coaster
Better make the most yeah
I hate the world,
And everyone in it
Just go away
But you don't get me baby
So why you got to hate me
Guess I should've told you
That we aren't the same
But you don't get me baby
So why you got to hate me
Guess I should've told you
That we aren't the same
I'm so down
I'm so down
I'm so down today
