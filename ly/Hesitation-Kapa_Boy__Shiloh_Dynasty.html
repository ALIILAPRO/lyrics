		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Situations, bring you back to me
Oh, lovers never break up
I guess you want that so in my head
You say that I'm dying to forget
I bit the bullet for you
For you, I wrote a song, too many, plenty
So I hope you really know that
I been thinking 'bout you oh
Thinking 'bout you

When it's dark out, I'm the one you need
Yeah
Listen to the beating of your heart's song
(Heart's song)
When it's dark out, I'm the one you need
(yeah)
Listen to the beating of your heart's song

Da dum, da dum, mm da dum, da dum, oh
Da dum, da dum, mm oh

Never give up on your love for me, oh
I'm unforgettable, you'll see, you'll see me
Oh no, I'm all yours i'm all yours
Oh oh oh, ooh, you didn't notice oh
You should know

When it's dark out, I'm the onе you need
Yeah
Listen to the bеating of your heart's song
Heart's song
When it's dark out, I'm the one you need
Yeah
Listen to the beating of your heart's song
Song

Da dum, da dum, mm da dum, da dum, oh
Da dum, da dum, mm oh

And there's a question that I'll never ask
No one to help me when I'm feeling bad
Hesitation hesitation, oh
You gotta know
I've been a mess since I met you
I'm stuck in a mood tonight oh (Oh)

When it's dark out, I'm the one you need
Yeah
Listen to the beating of your heart's song
Heart's song
When it's dark out, I'm the one you need
Yeah
Listen to the beating of your heart's song
Song

Da dum, da dum, mm da dum, da dum, oh
Da dum, da dum, mm oh
