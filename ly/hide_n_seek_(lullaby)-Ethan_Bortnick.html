		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not done grieving the one that came before you
On the run, from the one, to New York
I don't want you to be the reason that it's over
So I'm sorry if it seems like I'm cold

I know how it looks, I'm one foot in
Trust me when I say it's genuine
It's hard to shake the memories in my gut
You're scared that you're my backup
Cry myself to sleep, but it's not you I'm thinking of

Never again. Never again
That's what I told myself
Never again, well I guess it depends
Does love ever end?
If not don't let me in

Planned a future by myself but you're the present
Shared your bed, overheard your chest, you're in love
Booked a red eye to hear I'm claustrophobic
It's game over but I'm tip-toeing
Hide and seek out in the open

Never again. Never again
That's what I told myself
Never again, well I guess it depends
Does love ever end?
If not don't let me in

I know how it looks, I'm one foot in
Trust me when I say it's genuine
It's hard to shake the memories in my gut
You're scared that you're my backup
Cry myself to sleep, but it's not you I'm thinking of
