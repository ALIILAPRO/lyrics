		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many men have crossed my way
Promising peace or my soul to save
But I already heard you
I have seen what they made with their freedom
But I, I have no need for your god
The shallow truth of your poisonous tongue
Brothers it's time to make a stand
To reclaim our lives
Because all this steel can set us free

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
Till justice and reason we'll wield
In my sword I trust

The sword that shivers in my hand
Do you have the might
To eat the putrid flesh
To drink the blood of the true one to blame
The time of change is here
Avail your blade

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
Till justice and reason we'll wield
In my sword I trust

Leave your souls to your gods
Kneel, obey, follow their laws
Diseased and decayed, cherish their fate
This day I repay
Your love for fear come fate
Your love for fear come fate

Omen build me a fiery falcon
Pull your blade in a blazing shore
She'll never wait and may make war
Rest my hands and come to pray
But my life shan't go to waste
Grip the spirit that they turn on
Upon the point, the point of our steel

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
Till justice and reason we'll wield
In my sword I trust
In my sword I trust
