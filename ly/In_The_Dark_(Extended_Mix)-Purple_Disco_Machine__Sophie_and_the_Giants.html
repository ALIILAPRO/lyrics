		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got lost in the wilderness
I thought I was surely falling apart
The pain you caused cut so deep
Truly was a work of art

I don't care what they say, I'm gonna do it anyway (oh, oh)
It's the only thing I see, always staring back at me (oh)

I've been left in the dark, standing cold in the night
Memories of your taste, I've been holding on tight
Falling apart and I'm living a lie
All of this time I've been loving a liar

Pulled me in with your words so sweet
Every time I ignore the sign
Redemption's mine on the day I leave
Falling for you was my only crime

I don't care what they say, I'm gonna do it anyway (oh, oh)
It's the only thing I see, always staring back at me (oh)

I've been left in the dark, standing cold in the night
Memories of your taste, I've been holding on tight
Falling apart and I'm living a lie
All of this time I've been loving a liar

Ooh-ooh, am I going under?
Ooh-ooh, should my heart surrender?
Ooh-ooh, am I going under?
Ooh-ooh, should my heart surrender?

(Am I going under?)
(Should this heart surrender?)
Ooh-ooh, Am I going under?
Ooh-ooh

I've been left in the dark, standing cold in the night
Memories of your taste, I've been holding on tight
Falling apart and I'm living a lie
All of this time I've been loving a liar

Ooh-ooh, am I going under?
Ooh-ooh, should my heart surrender?
Ooh-ooh, am I going under?
Ooh-ooh, should my heart surrender?
