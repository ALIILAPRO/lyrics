		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear

So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feelin' your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while
Haven't I? I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking

Baby, you (yeah)
Are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appeared, yeah
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free
Fallin' all in you

Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while
Haven't I? I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking

Baby, you (yeah, ooh)
Are bringing out a different kind of me (ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appeared, yeah (ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free
Fallin' all in you

Every time I see you baby I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking

Baby, you, yeah
Are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free
Fallin' all in you (ooh, yeah)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free
Fallin' all in
