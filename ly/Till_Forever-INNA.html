		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how to be, how to be, how to be without you
And I'm sad and alone and I'm feeling, I'm feeling blue
Therapy to my heart with the drink 'cause I'm lost without you
What we had no, wasn't true no

No more expectations in these situations
Should I remind you what you promised me?

I promised you till forever, but the end is closer than ever
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe
'Cause you promise me till forever, and now you are colder than ever
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe

(Do-do-don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe)
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe
(Do-do-don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe)
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe

I can change how I feel, how I feel, how I feel about you
But maybe we need our recess for our love, maybe something new
Therapy to my heart with the drink 'cause I'm lost without you
What we had no, wasn't true no

No more expectations in these situations
Should I remind you what you promised me?

I promised you till forever, but the end is closer than ever
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe
'Cause you promise me till forever, and now you are colder than ever
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe

(Do-do-don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe)
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe
(Do-do-don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe)
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe

No more expectations in these situations
Should I remind you what you promised me?

I promised you till forever, but the end is closer than ever
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe
'Cause you promise me till forever, and now you are colder than ever
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe

(Do-do-don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe)
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe
(Do-do-don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe)
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, babe
