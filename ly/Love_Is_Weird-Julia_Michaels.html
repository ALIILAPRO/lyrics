		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tattoos on my arm, still scared of forever
Keep my exes letters in the third drawer of my dresser
First one hit me hard, second was a feather
Playing operation tryna put me back together

Closed off and exposed
Salty and I'm seared
Naked in my clothes, yeah

Love is weird
Don't know how I wound up here
Love is weird
It shows up and disappears
Love is strange for some 
It ranges from
Making love to tears
Now we're here
Love is weird

Ooh

People in my past, put 'em in a coffin
Laid 'em all to rest but I still think about 'em often
We were on our toes tryna make a good impression
Now we're kissing under lamp posts and we're asking deeper questions

Closed off and exposed
Salty and I'm seared
Naked in my clothes, yeah

Love is weird
Don't know how I wound up here
Love is weird
It shows up and disappears
Love is strange for some 
It ranges from
Making love to tears
Now we're here
Love is weird

Ooh
Now we're here
Ooh
Love is weird
