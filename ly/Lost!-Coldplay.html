		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I've tried to cross
And every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one
And you'll be lost

Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the firing starts
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
