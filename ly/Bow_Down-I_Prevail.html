		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get on your knees and bow down

Yeah, I come alive, I'll survive, take on anything
So paint a target on my back let 'em come for me
I don't fall, don't quit, don't ever sleep
'Cause, I'm on another level that you'll never reach
If you seek forgiveness
You'll get nothing, you'll get nothing from me

You will never know, it's the price I pay
Look into my eyes, we are not the same
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
'Cause I'm in control and you'll know my name
'Cause I gave my life, gave it everything
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and bow down
Get on your knees and bow down

You better recognize
You wanna talk that shit, time to back it up
'Cause the best of your best ain't good enough
Playing with my name, now I know you really fucked up
Keep runnin' your mouth and I'ma call your bluff

You will never know, it's the price I pay
Look into my eyes, we are not the same
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
'Cause I'm in control and you'll know my name
'Cause I gave my life, gave it everything
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and

You're never gonna be enough
So I had this dream
It meant everything
And I watched it come alive
Then I let you in
Underneath my skin
And I learned to love the lies
Now I lay awake and I contemplate
Have I become what I hate?
Can I take it back?
'Cause it's all I have
Will it get the best of me?

Have you ever had a dream?
Would you fight for it?
Would you go to war?
Would you die for it?
So now I'll take my stand
Now I'll make you see
That if you seek forgiveness
You'll get nothing from me

You'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me

To everybody who doubted (to everybody who doubted)
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and bow down
Bow down
Bow down
