		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be there to see your face
As you choke on the smoke you made

(Burn)

This day has finally happened
You're getting back what you gave away
I'll watch you turn to ashes
Then I'll let you suffocate

Impatiently waiting
Basically, I've been debating
Should I be making the flames that you went and created?
The way I imagined the blazing fire would ravage you
It's sad but true
I didn't even have to get back at you

Light up the sky

And I'll be there to see your face
As you choke on the smoke you've made
Yeah, I wanna watch the sky turn gray
You're up in flames
I'll be there to see your face
While you light up the sky and burn
While you light up the sky and burn

I've suffered long enough from
Every lie that you swore was true
You've played with fire for too long
Now it's all coming back to you

You're instantly thinking and wishing things would be different admit it
You live in a script only you could've written you dimwit
You took a ticket ripped and then committed
You did it
Broke up the sticks poured out the gas and then lit it

And I'll be there to see your face
As you choke on the smoke you've made
Yeah, I wanna watch the sky turn gray
You're up in flames
I'll be there to see your face
While you light up the sky and burn

I thought that you would've learned
You're getting what you deserve
I thought that you would've learned
You're getting what you deserve
Just burn
I thought that you would've learned
Just burn
You're getting what you deserve
Just burn
I thought that you would've learned
Just burn

And I'll be there to see your face
As you choke on the smoke you've made
Yeah, I wanna watch the sky turn gray
You're up in flames
I'll be there to see your face
While you light up the sky and burn

And I'll be there to see your face
As you choke on the smoke you've made
Yeah, I wanna watch the sky turn gray
You're up in flames
I'll be there to see your face
While you light up the sky and burn
