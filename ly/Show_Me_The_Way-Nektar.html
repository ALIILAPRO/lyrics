		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me the way i can't find
Peace of mind help me fair in every way
Nothing but to fall
Change what you tried to do

Hey, it's the end you may try
To be old but I'm told you're too young
Don't despair i'll really show you now

Pictures all around painted on the ground
Takes a long time please come back
If you can

Show me the way show me, show me the way
Show me the way show me, show me the way

Show me the way show me the way
Show me the way show me, show me the way

Show me the way not to float to here
In my mind ropes untwine
Please don't be long nothing but to fall
Change what you tried to do

Hey, it's the end you may try
To be old but I'm told you're too young
Don't despair i'll really show you now
