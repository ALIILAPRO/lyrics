		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knock on the door I tap on the floor.
It's gloomy in my mind.
I scratch on the wall too feeble to bawl.
All along the line.

I'm losing faith.
I'm losing faith.
Here in my darkness.
I'm losing faith.
I'm losing faith.

Is there somebody here.
Somebody listening.
Someone who cares.
Someone who tries.
Somebody out there.
Someone to hold me.
When the raven dies tonight.
Is there somebody here.
Somebody listening.
Someone to share the rest of my time.
Somebody out there.
Someone to hold me.
When the raven dies tonight.
Is there somebody here.

Who hears what I hear who fears what I fear.
And pulls a left-behind.
Who lulls me to sleep dreamless and deep.
Who's sensitive and kind.

I'm losing myself.
I'm losing myself.
Here in my darkness.
I'm losing myself.
I'm losing myself.

Is there somebody here.
Somebody listening.
Someone who cares.
Someone who tries.
Somebody out there.
Someone to hold me.
When the raven dies tonight.
Is there somebody here.
Somebody listening.
Someone to share the rest of my time.
Somebody out there.
Someone to hold me.
When the raven dies tonight.
Is there somebody here.

A rare soul to believe me.
A savior to release me.
A guiding light to lead me.
Hello is there somebody here.
