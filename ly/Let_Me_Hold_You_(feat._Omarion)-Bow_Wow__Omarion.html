		  Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh
Uh, uh, uh
Y'all know what this is
This what you need to do, girl
So So Def
(Let me hold you)

I been watchin' you for a minute
Come through here so sweet scented
Your life, girl, you need me in it I'm determined to win it
I know what you need, I know what's wrong
I know how to make it tight 
Everything'll be alright if ya (let me hold you)
And introduce you to my world
Introduce you to the better side of life
That you ain't been seein', girl
I'ma show you where it's at
And I'ma show you how to get it
All you got do is be wit' it and (let me hold you)
Down, like a real man's supposed to
I never would've approached you if I ain't have intentions on doin' good
See, dude you wit' is so fooled, to me, girl, you're so cool
And all I'm askin' you to do is (let me hold you)
Down, like a best friend and two homies in the gang
When you cry I wanna feel your pain, no secrets, no games
All excitement, nothin' plain, to keep you happy that's my aim
And all you gotta do, girl, is (let me hold you)

In my arms, in my mind all the time 
I wanna keep you right by my side 'til I die 
I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everythin' is right wit' you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down, like a real friend's supposed to
I'm tryna show you the life of somebody like you should be livin'
Oh baby, baby, you can never go wrong if you let me hold you (never)

I'ma keep you up on what's poppin' and shake you fresh to death
When we hit the mall we can ball 'til there's no more left
I know you ain't used to it, but you gon' get used to it
'Cause that's the only way I'ma do it, let me (hold you)
All da homies think I'm trippin' 'cause I got you a pad, but see
They just mad 'cause they ain't get you, they ain't get you
Scorpio is your sign and girl you're so fine
And I would do whatever in no time, no shine (let me hold you)
It's what your comin' with, but I'ma change all that
Rearrange that, put you in the Range, all black
With the rims to match, phone attached, TVs in the back
How you gon' say no to that, huh? (Let me hold you)
Niggas look at me like, "Man, here you go, really 'bout to blow some dough
Ain't nobody did before, so why is you so gung-ho?"
'Cause I believe this was meant to be
I just gotta work at it like a crack addict up in rehab (let me hold you)

In my arms, in my mind all the time 
I wanna keep you right by my side 'til I die 
I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everythin' is right wit' you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down, like a real friend's supposed to
I'm tryna show you the life of somebody like you should be livin'
Oh baby, baby, you can never go wrong if you let me hold you

Down-down, around, Atlanta-lanta, f-found
E'rybody know now what I'm tryna do
I say, down-down, around, Atlanta-lanta, f-found
I'm just tryna get you to let me hold you
Down-down, around, Atlanta-lanta, f-found
E'rybody know now what I'm tryna do
I say, down-down, around, Atlanta-lanta, f-found
I'm just tryna get you to let me hold you

In my arms, in my mind all the time 
I wanna keep you right by my side 'til I die 
I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everythin' is right wit' you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down, like a real friend's supposed to
I'm tryna show you the life of somebody like you should be livin'
Oh baby, baby, you can never go wrong if you let me hold you (hold you)
