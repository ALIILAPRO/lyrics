		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your love is taking control of a man
Imagine won't just leaving me behind
My feelings for you have always been real
That after all this time tell me that you cant feel
All this love that I'm giving, giving my love
Giving all my love, just take it baby

All this

Tell me how'd you feel
You made it good till I fell for you
To do me any way you want me to
Too bad you didn't handle me with care
You'll never find this love again anywhere
All this love that I'm giving, giving my love
All this love, love that I'm giving, giving my love
Love

All this

Tell me how'd you feel
