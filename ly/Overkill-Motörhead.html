		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it, screaming with the crowd
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Overkill, overkill, overkill

On your feet you feel the beat, it goes straight to your spine
Shake your head you must be dead if it don't make you fly
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Overkill, overkill, overkill

Know your body's made to move, ya feel it in your guts
Rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name if it don't make ya strut
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Overkill, overkill, overkill
