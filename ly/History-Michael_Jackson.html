		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Monday March 26th, 1827"
"November 28th, 1929"
"Whatever I sing, that's what I really mean"
"Like, I'm singing a song
I don't sing it if I don't mean it"

"Remember, it will be for us, the children of today
To make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place"
"He made it, Charles A. Lindbergh, first person to fly
New York to Paris non-stop"
"And that was a page of history 
That will probably stand for a long time"

He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing

Every day create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing

Every day create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

"I am happy to join with you today
In what will be down in history as the greatest
Demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation"

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And be one family, oh

Every day create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around
