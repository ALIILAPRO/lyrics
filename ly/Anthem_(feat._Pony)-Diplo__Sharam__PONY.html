		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crowd rolling up, tell 'em bring all the stuff
Harlow got weed and Sharam brought mush'
Ride at a low speed, can't be in handcuffs
Young, wild, and free, extremely handsome
I just want the beat to be my intro
I just want peace, don't need a handgun
I beat the beat, the beat my anthem
Ha-hands and feet, kiki in tandem
I beat the beat, the beat my anthem
I beat the beat, the beat my anthem
I beat the beat, the beat my anthem
I beat the beat, the beat my anthem

Who's red 'Rari's parked outside?
All that money with nowhere to hide
One too many drinks and nobody wanna drive
Nobody's goin' home, staying the whole night
Who's red 'Rari's parked on the side?
Young and we're free, it's the time of our lives
Well, what we gotta do? Hustle to stay alive
Put both hands up and your hands to the sky
I'm high
I'm high

So what you wanna do with it?
How you gonna act brand new with it?
You was in love when the crew hit it
So keep the same energy, I'm cool with it
Don't call, I got new digits
When you needed me, I was your soup kitchen
I saved your number under the stool pigeon
This is the remix to Ignition
Start it up, start it up
Get it in, seatbelt, rev it up, tell a friend
We can make love in the back of the Benz
Or we can make out, take a walk and hold hands
I could be your man, dream boyfriend
Barbie and Ken, or Barbie and Jane, Ken and Justin
This is just in, homie's hustlin'
Yellow Mustang, got moved through customs
There's no discussion, I'm liquor guzzlin'
With the percussion and my boy's husband
We get to cuttin' 'til I malfunction

Who's red 'Rari's parked outside?
All that money with nowhere to hide
One too many drinks and nobody wanna drive
Nobody's goin' home, staying the whole night
Who's red 'Rari's parked on the side?
Young and we're free, it's the time of our lives
Well, what we gotta do? Hustle to stay alive
Put both hands up and your hands to the sky
I'm high
Way too high
