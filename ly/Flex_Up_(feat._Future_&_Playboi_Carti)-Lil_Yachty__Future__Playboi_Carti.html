		  Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa (big Lambo')
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa (you dig?)
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa (woo)
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa (yeah)
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa (flex)
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa

Bet you won't get no murders out me (homicide, homicide, yeah)
Go tell the cops (flex up), I bet you won't get no murders out me

Flex up, racks up (homicide), flex up (what?), Racks up (yeah)
Flex up (flex up), racks up (racks up), flex up (flex up), racks up (you dig?)
Sticks up, sticks up (what?), Sticks up, sticks up (yeah)
Pick up the K, yeah (what?), I pick up the Drac', yeah (slatt)
Spray at your bitch (bitch, bitch), she gave me face, yeah (Carti)
I sprayed at the opp, yeah, he got shot in his face (yeah)
I'm on that Codeine (yeah), I'm fallin' in love with Codeine
I really be sippin' the lean (yeah), I'm never sippin' the green (yeah)
I'm doin' them drugs, mean, I'm doin' them drugs, mean
That white ho love me, that white bitch love me, hold on

Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa (get it)
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa (you dig?)

Six speeds, Bentleys, APs, that shit light
Two-piece, FNs, red dots, chop your height
His bitch posted us on her story, now he tight
My bitch, she know better, she do that and she might die
I was buyin' Birkins at eighteen (yeah, yeah)
That's why she don't mind the B's, fuck you mean? (Woo)
My Spur fatal, rock 'em, cradle (grrt)
I don't hang with brokes, I don't take advice (boom)
Niggas snitchin', meet in person, feds tapped bro device
Spent a quarter like a hoarder, ball like Jerry Rice

Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa

Bet you won't get no murders out me
Go tell the cops (yeah), I bet you won't get no murders out me
Bet you won't get no murders out me (ooh, yeah)
Go tell the cops (yeah), I bet you won't get no murders out me (go)

Flip flop, drop-top, swap out, four-door Rolls
Pill poppers, head doctor, she swallow it up, whoa, whoa, whoa
Big as a Bronco, big-ass chopper, rings lightin' up, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hella boppers suck me proper, like to gobble, whoa, whoa, whoa
Richard Mille aquia, I'm flippin' that tilapia
Turn the temperature way up, they can't get in the way of us
Private invitational, but everyone is safe to come
Gotta make my haters mad, give 'em somethin' to talk about
Take a bitch from south of France, push her back to Waffle House
Murder on the case, I had to spazz, fuck her doggystyle
I don't know how to be a normal nigga, one thing I forgot
I got blood then on the floor, but now I ball like basketball (burr)

Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa (Lambo')
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa
Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa (tell the cops)
(I bet you-) Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa
(I bet you-) Flex up, stretch out, big bands, whoa, whoa, whoa

Bet you won't get no murders out me
(Big bands), whoa, whoa, whoa
