		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I belong here, the vibes are kinda strong here
The vibes are kinda wrong, it's good to know just what goes on here
Some guy is taking me into his garden
Seems to be some kind of mountain
I'm especially anxious and a long way from home
I've only just got my margarita from Molito's, so
Could I belong here, the vibes are kinda strong here
Ask me if I'm from here and I won't say no

I won't say no, I'll give it a go
I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top
A girl like me, would you believe I'm in Los Angeles?

Ask me where
Ask me where my home is, I say I don't know, it's
Probably where the boy I love and left all on his own is
He rolls his eyes and cuts a selfish line of blow
He was here for one thing
If he can't get it then he'll go but
I don't care, I'm in the Hollywood Hills
I'm no longer pulling pints, I'm no longer cashing tills
And I'm alive, I feel like Marilyn Monroe
If you're up poppin' pills
You know I won't say no

I won't say no, I'll give it a go
I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top
A girl like me, would you believe I'm in Los Angeles?

Don't lose sight
Don't lose it

The guy from the garden, I think his name is Adam
He's in bed here beside me, though I think he is a bad man
He liked the fact that I play music in a band
He is making a movie and is gonna need some hand
Feel like I'm falling, dream slowly stalling
Extravagance disguises, elegance is boring
I don't belong here, though it really is quite funny
"Hey, is mum there? It's just me, I felt like calling"

I won't say no, I'll give it a go
I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top
A girl like me, would you believe I'm in Los Angeles?

Don't lose sight
Don't lose it

Don't lose sight
Don't lose sight
Ooh-oh-oh
