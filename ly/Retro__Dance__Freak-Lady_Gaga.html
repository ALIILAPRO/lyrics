		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello everybody!
Get a ride to the west side
Kiss the girl with her tongue tied

Hello everybody!
Work it out 'cause you don't care
Shut down like software

Hello everybody!
Take a sip for the hip-hop
Fuel up at the rest stop

We're just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene

Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats
Retro dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

What's up everybody?
Take a ride on an airplane
Take a bath in champagne

What's up everybody?
Watch the girls all curtsy for the paparazzi!

Let's go everybody!
It's time that we rotate, 'cause it's getting real late

We're just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene

Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats
Retro dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats
Retro dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats
Retro dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

We are just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene

Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats
Retro dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover

Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)
Singing retro dance beats
Retro dance, freak!
Undercover the girl needs a lover
