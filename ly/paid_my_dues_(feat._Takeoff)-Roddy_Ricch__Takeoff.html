		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had to call my accountant to make sure a nigga wasn't trippin'
I done ran up a check, lookin' like a nigga doin' fitness
Late night, back of the club, searchin' and fishin'
I went back to the Glock 'cause everybody talkin' 'bout switches

If I said I fuck with you, I fuck with you
When they pile up that money on money on money on money
We see what these niggas do
I ain't never gon' run, you know I ain't holdin' my tongue
For these niggas, I tell the truth
They say I'm a young nigga and I keep it too solid
You know I done paid my dues
You know I done paid my dues

I look at my phone and see what bitch I'm finna hit
I scroll and pick and choose
Roddy and Take', they know it ain't safe
So I suggest that you play it cool
They let us in and gave us the space to win
So how could a nigga lose?
Been havin' money, I came out the womb
To havin' that shit on in middle school
Year after year, gotta keep it comin'
Keep the wardrobe and the wheel new
When all of these hoes see how me and Take' move
It get crowded, I take two
And I'm knockin' that bitch down on the first date
I ain't never gotta take two
I got hoes on hoes on hoes on hoes
They swing on each other like Babe Ruth
I go to Fashion Week sittin' on the side with a double cup
I got a sweet tooth
All-white Rollie Sky-Dweller, and the face K.C. Blue
Plain Jane gold presidential, I got yellow rings, look like Pikachu
Look in my garage, this ain't no fa√ßade
They got different eyes when they peek at you

Had to call my accountant to make sure a nigga wasn't trippin'
I done ran up a check, lookin' like a nigga doin' fitness
Late night, back of the club, searchin' and fishin'
I went back to the Glock 'cause everybody talkin' 'bout switches

If I said I fuck with you, I fuck with you
When they pile up that money on money on money on money
We see what these niggas do
I ain't never gon' run, you know I ain't holdin' my tongue
For these niggas, I tell the truth
They say I'm a young nigga and I keep it too solid
You know I done paid my dues
You know I done paid my dues

Still gettin'
Still sippin' on the lean like I'm motherfuckin' pimpin'
Driveway loaded than a bitch
My driveway loaded than a bitch, nigga (bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga)
My driveway loaded than a bitch, nigga (bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga)
My driveway loaded than a bitch, nigga (bitch, nigga, bitch, nigga)
