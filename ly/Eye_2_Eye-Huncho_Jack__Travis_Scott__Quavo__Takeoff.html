		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Murda on tha beat, that's not nice

Real nigga, I
Get high, touch the sky
Right hand in the air
Left hand in the pot
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Yeah, yeah (yeah)

I see green in your eyes, it don't lie (it's lit)
Blew dollar bills in them Hills to the sky (cash)
We with the flow and dash
And all of my hoes, they goin' cash
Over that, 'bout they mad
I know the problem, yeah, yeah

Eye to eye (yeah)
Choose to Dubai (yeah, yeah)
I could see that they jealous, don't know why (ahh)
Is it 'cause we lit at 4 AM at the spot?
Put that on your tongue, wait for the swag to unlock (yeah)
If you searching, come look for us (alright), over the border (it's lit)
We import 'em (yeah), just don't record us (straight up)
Poppin' at the crib, the livin' room look like the Forum
Roll the dice at night, I take the chance in the morning

Nah mean?
We ain't really with that camera shit
Nah

We fuck up for real, for real, for real
We fuck up the check for real (checks)
We havin' a lean inside, it's the Percs, she havin' the X pill (lean)
We know how to flex for real
We hop on a jet, the time we kill (pew)
These niggas be ridin' and chasin' money
Wrong, signing deals (ye)
I got Patek Philippe (ye)
And I bought a skeleton (ice, ye)
I'm a deadly weapon (ye)
I'm 'bout to go off in a second (vroom)
Moving bricks and medicine (bricks)
She like to fly, pelican (brr)
Touch the sky, heavenly (sky)
Designer belt from the Netherlands (yeah, yeah)

Real nigga, I
Get high, touch the sky
Right hand in the air
Left hand in the pot
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Yeah, yeah

I see green in your eyes, it don't lie (green)
Blew dollar bills in them hills to the sky (yeah)
We with the flow and dash (skrrt, skrrt)
All of my hoes, they goin' cash (skrrt, skrrt)
Over that, 'bout they mad
I know the problem, yeah yeah

Real nigga, I (I), pop a Perc and fly (brr)
Crack that ceiling, take a whiff and I come back alive (live)
Niggas commit suicide when they don't got mob ties
Flip it like it's Five Guys, I'm 2Pac, get all eyes (all)
Look at the bitch, she a dime
So many watches, a nigga can't run out of time
They get out of line
They gang in your yard but they strapped like the Uber driver with the sign (brrt)
I've been known to tell the truth in my raps
These other rapper tell lies (lies)
Real niggas keep the trap alive
Ain't no fabrication on the vine (let's count)

Real nigga, I
Get high, touch the sky
Right hand in the air
Left hand in the pot
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Yeah, yeah

I see green in your eyes, it don't lie (green)
Blew dollar bills in them hills to the sky (yeah)
We with the flow and dash (skrrt, skrrt)
Know my hoes, they goin' cash (skrrt, skrrt)
Over that, 'bout they mad
I know the problem, yeah, yeah (yeah)
