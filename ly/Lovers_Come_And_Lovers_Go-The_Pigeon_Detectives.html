		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard that you're laying with someone else
'Cause I'm not enough for you
And you are not enough for me

Where do I go just to help myself
To a shot of empathy, a dose of reality?

Well, lovers come and lovers go
What we have you cannot hold

I heard that you're lying to someone else
'Cause you're not in love with truth
But you love the taste of youth

And I still dream about you now and then
When it's good it's almost great
But I believe in luck not fate

Lovers come and lovers go
What we have you cannot hold
So take me back to where I know
Where lovers come and lovers go

Lovers come and lovers go
What we have you cannot hold
So take me back to where I know
Where lovers come and lovers go

I heard that you're lying to someone
I heard that you're lying to someone
I heard that you're lying to someone else
