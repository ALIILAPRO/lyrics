		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been on my own (I've been on my own)
I've been on my own for awhile
I've been putting off (I've been putting off)
Giving someone else all my time
Maybe I should go
Maybe I should give it a smile
Grit my teeth and bear it
Oh, it's been a while

Didn't even really wanna go (oh)
I'm much better on my own (yeah)
And now I just wanna go home

'Cause, baby, you're not the best
Boy, you're missing out on that zest
I don't think I'll be taking that quest
So, I'll be swiping on to the rest
Darling, I'm not one for bad breath
Or that yellow stain on your vest
Yeah, you're really not passing my test
So I'll be swiping on to the rest

Oh, baby
To the left you go, to the left you go
To the left you go, to the left you go
Oh, baby
To the left you go, to the left you go
Going home tonight, still looking for Mr. Right

I know what I deserve
I deserve the whole damn world
And if you can't provide it
Then I'ma keep swipin'
Maybe I should find my Romeo, oh-oh (where's my Romeo?)
But I'm way too good at being alone

And I didn't even really wanna go (oh-oh)
Much better on my own (oh)
And now I really wanna go home

'Cause, baby, you're not the best
'Cause, boy, you're missing out on that zest
I don't think I'll be taking that quest
So, I'll be swiping on to the rest
Darling, I'm not one for bad breath (hey)
Or that yellow stain on your vest
Yeah, you're really not passing my test
So, I'll be swiping on to the rest

Oh, baby
To the left you go, to the left you go (to the left you go)
To the left you go, to the left you go
Oh, baby
To the left you go, to the left you go
Going home tonight, still looking for Mr. Right

(To the left) To the left of Mr. Right
(Of Mr. Right) Mr., Mr., Mr. Right
(To the left) To the left of Mr. Right
(Of Mr. Right) Mr., Mr., Mr. Right
(To the left) To the left of Mr. Right
(Of Mr. Right) Mr., Mr., Mr. Right
