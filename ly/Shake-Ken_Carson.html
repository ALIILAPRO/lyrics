		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Star Boy, you're my hero yeah

Shake (Shake) , shake (Shake) , shake (yeah)
Make that shit shake (Oh yeah)
Shawty throwin' that ass like some bait (Oh)
Shawty throwin' that ass in my face (Uh, huh)
We in the strip club
Ain’t throwin' 'em ones, bitch
I'm throwin' dubs
Got so many racks could fill up a tub
Got so many racks to fill up a tub (yeah)
Now I got them racks, them hoes show me love
I'm totin' my gat when I'm in the club
See the opps in the back
But they know it's up
See the opps in the back but
Them boys know what's up
Hit 'em with the ratchet
You thought it was tucked
Send him a drop, you know he bluffed
It's going down 'cause he said it was up

It's going down 'causе he said it was up
They say she won't еven see me but I said
"What's up?"
I swear these niggas be scared as fuck
Give a fuck about 12, see an opp and I buck
Give a fuck about 12, see an opp and I buck
I be living this shit, you be making it up
Shawty shaking that ass and she caking it up
I just threw a whole bag
Now they raking it up, yeah

Shake (Shake) , shake (Shake) , shake (yeah)
Make that shit shake (Oh yeah)
Shawty throwin' that ass like some bait (Oh)
Shawty throwin' that ass in my face (Uh, huh)
We in the strip club
They throwin' 'em ones, bitch
I'm throwin' dubs
Got so many racks to fill up a tub
Got so many racks to fill up a tub (yeah)
Now I got them racks, them hoes show me love
I'm totin' my gat when I'm in the club
See the opps in the back
But they know it's up
See the opps in the back but
Them boys know what's up
Hit 'em with the ratchet
You thought it was tucked
Send him a drop, you know he bluffed
It's going down 'cause he said it was up

Shawty shaking that ass
Got me falling in love
But really it's lust, bae, I just wanna fuck
I ain't gon' cap, ain't gon' lie to ya
I just wanna put my dick inside of ya
She wanna get kinky, I tied her up
You know I'ma fuck, I'ma massage her up
Met that bitch on IG, I was slidin' up
I saw her one time, now I'm slidin' in her
(yeah, yeah)

Shake (Shake) , shake (Shake) , shake (yeah)
Make that shit shake (Oh yeah)
Shawty throwin' that ass like some bait (Oh)
Shawty throwin' that ass in my face (Uh, huh)
We in the strip club
They throwin' 'em ones, bitch
I'm throwin' dubs
Got so many racks to fill up a tub
Got so many racks to fill up a tub (yeah)
Now I got them racks, them hoes show me love
I'm totin' my gat when I'm in the club
See the opps in the back
But they know it's up
See the opps in the back but
Them boys know what's up
Hit 'em with the ratchet
You thought it was tucked
Send him a drop, you know he bluffed
It's going down 'cause he said it was up
Yeah
