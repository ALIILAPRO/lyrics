		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  D.A. got that dope
Ay, yeah

Tell your friend she invited (invited)
And I know she gon' like it (like it)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (private)
So baby, just slide in

Uh, 24-7, I'm in high demand
Got too many hoes, I just leave 'em on read
Too much sex, shawty, you can give me head
She know I'm thinkin' it, but I ain't gotta say it
Blueprints, new house, this a temp (yeah)
I'm throwin' parties all week like Coachella, bitch (ah)
Rollin' loud on the balcony, watch the set (uh)
That Rihanna kush (uh), keep her pussy wet (wet)
Uh, I'm talkin' to my life like, "you're the best"
Niggas wanna strike, boy, boy, you don't pose a thread (nope)
Stones in the safe, all I'm sayin' my paper legit
Niggas wanna say you ain't shit when they know you the shit
If hell froze over, I'm just trynna get the ice Patek
Wealth for my lil' man, royalties on his desk
Runnin' through the hallways, up from the South of France
I'mma count this million, pull up on me 'round ten

Ay
Tell your friend she invited (invited)
And I know she gon' like it (like it)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (private)
So baby, just slide in (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Taste kush, I'mma light it (light it)
Bring the liquor, bring your best friends (best friends)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (private)
So baby, just slide in (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

Ride with me, baby (Come on)
To the 305, slip and slide with me, baby (yeah)
Show you when I get inside, all this time we done wasted (time)
We got Cookies by the flavors and got bottles by the cases
Just like a rookie got a agent, I got bitches by the braces (yeah)
Takin' jets to different places (whew), pick up backends on occasions (cash)
The bigger the mansion, bigger the gate is
The bigger the bad, the bigger the plate is (big)
I'd rather be rich than famous
The bigger you get, the bigger the hate is
Tell your friends they all invited (invited)
I'm bringin' my dogs, they bitin'
The room, it sound like a storm
A little bit of thunder, strike out the lightnin' (boom)
Spicy, know she spicy (spicy)
Wet-wet like a Pisces (wet, wet)
Drip, Lil Boosie, bite me (drip, drip, splash)

Ay
Tell your friend she invited (invited)
And I know she gon' like it (like it)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (private)
So baby, just slide in (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Taste kush, I'mma light it (light it)
Bring the liquor, bring your best friends (best friends)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (private)
So baby, just slide in (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

Slide like we in four
On a Sunday, top down, wind blowin'
Kush in the jar, lil' baby, we can roll some
Back seat, I'mma beat it up like it stole somethin'
Get it wet, I'mma slide in
All my diamonds dancin', they vibin'
Girl, don't tell nobody, don't be triflin' (ooh yeah)
Goin' face first, I'mma dive in (whoa)

Tell your friend she invited (invited)
And I know she gon' like it (like it)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (private)
So baby, just slide in (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Taste kush, I'mma light it (light it)
Bring the liquor, bring your best friends (best friends)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (private)
So baby, just slide in (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
