		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brought to this world to wither again
Naive about the ways of life is what they say
Millions live millions die, more are yet to come
Living skeletons 
Where they come from

Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony
Born dead into this world
It's their choice, why can't you see

Life of misery, soon a corpse you be
As bones show through, nothing you can do

Relief does not exist
When you are born to die

Disease spreads fast across their dying world
Many cemeteries they will have to build
As process goes on for many years to come
A human waste land created when they are done

Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony
Born dead into this world
It's their choice, why can't you see
