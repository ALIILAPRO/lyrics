		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will not play along, the things I find unfair
I will not mount defenses against unjust attacks
This land was never given we built this on our own
Insanity dependent whether we rise or fall

Whether we rise or we fall
One for the night
One for the uncontrolled

Hold your feet to the ground
To the end of our time
For the rest of our lives
Hold your head up high
To the end of our time
For the rest of our lives

Secretively I hope if nothing ever comes of this
And you are not alone and wanted to come back
To a place where it won't matter just what side you're on
It's where our lives are blended what's underneath will overcome

What's underneath will overcome
One for the night
One for the uncontrolled

Hold your feet to the ground
To the end of our time
For the rest of our lives
Hold your head up high
To the end of our time
For the rest of our lives

Now it's time to stand up tall
One for the night
One for the uncontrolled

Hold your feet to the ground
To the end of our time
For the rest of our lives
Hold your head up high
To the end of our time
For the rest of our lives
