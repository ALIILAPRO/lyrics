		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gonna say what?
Make a love song, like about us, like long distance

I think it's best that we cut ties
The way I'm livin', probably never see a love life
Ain't nobody gonna love me from the inside
All these love scars on me, can't apologize
You always told me I was wrong, we never get along
I've been on the road and I ain't never coming home
Ain't no time to run around like a marathon
When she don't respond, I take you out to Saint Laurent

So I go away
We live miles apart
We knew this from the start
So I'll go, can't stay
I can't change who you are
You knew this from the start

Fuck love
What's love?
Fuck love
Enough
Fuck love
What's love?
Fuck love
Enough

You told me, fuck love and all your gimmicks, that shit typical
I can see the lies, it ain't surprisin', it be visible
She the only one that stayed down when it's difficult
We ain't solve the problem, now we flippin' like reciprocals
Told her, "Fuck love", the fuck was I thinkin'?
Day by day, then no communicatin'
I didn't mean to give up when times are frustratin'
I've been doin' me, I got a dream that I've been chasin'

So I go away
We live miles apart
We knew this from the start
So I'll go, can't stay
I can't change who you are
You knew this from the start

Fuck love
What's love?
Fuck love
Enough
Fuck love
What's love?
Fuck love
Enough
