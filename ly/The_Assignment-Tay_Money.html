		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (that's Fyre)

I'm big fine, too confident
I don't need your compliment
Bad bitch, I'm dominant, trunk bussing, got diamonds in it (money)
She talking it, she ain't trying it
He keep calling me crying, bitch (yuh)

Damn Tay, you killed this
I understood the assignment (duh)
Ah-ha, ah-ha (rich)
I understood the assignment
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha (duh)
I understood the assignment (bitch I'm d-)
Ah-ha, ah-ha,
I-I-I understood the assignment
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
Bitch, I understood the assignment (duh)

All my bitches piped up (duh), "Damn, you fine", like duh (okay)
Keep that pussy locked up (okay), he a broke boy, he can't touch (ew)
"Damn, you fine", like duh, like duh, like duh, duh (duh)
"Damn, you fine", like duh, like duh, like duh, duh (duh)

Bitch, you fine
Bitch, you fine-fine (okay)
He wanna be mine, mine (uh-uh)
I'm a cowgirl (hee-haw), he gotta be prime time (money)
She a side hoe (ah-ha), on the sideline (a mess)
She a sad hoe (a mess), ain't got no time, time (I don't)

Rollie got me blinged up and I got my team up
Valentino kingdom, damn Tay, you clean though (money)
Two shots like a free throw
Jet-skis for the week, hoe
This ain't for no weak hoe (uh-huh)
Shoutout to my freak hoes

Ah-ha, ah-ha
I understood the assignment
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
I understood the assignment (duh)
Ah-ha, ah-ha
I-I-I understood the assignment (bitch I'm d-)
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha (duh)
Bitch, I understood the assignment (duh)

I did, it's over
I murked it, it's over
I own that shit
Tay Money season is forever, I told you that shit
You bitches is seasonal
Tay motherfucking Money is forever, hoe
These bitches do what I do and that's that
That's facts, we get straight in, we back-back
I got them racks-racks all up in my bag packed
I'm who did that, and I'm going home-home
