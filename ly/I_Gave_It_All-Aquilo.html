		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And this glass, it breaks
It's so delicate, it shatters round my feet
And my hands they bleed
A stain I'll always remember
A stain that stays in me
But this changes you
Mmmm, its harder now we're breaking
And I should know its never right for me to say I wanted this
I know I can't but I can still recall, I gave it all
Given up on luck my heads above the dust

This love you broke
Come closer darling, don't forget to fake
A smile you had
You tried so hard to fool yourself instead

You gave it all
Given up on luck your heads above the dust
You gave it all
I waited by the other side, my friend

I've waited by the other side
I've waited by the other side my friend
I've waited by the other side

You'll find it funny when you're looking back some day
The love you've known, the love you've known
You'll find it funny when you're looking back some day
You gave it all
You'll find it funny when you're looking back some day
The love you've known, the love you've known
Given up on luck your heads above the dust
You gave it all
You'll find it funny when you're looking back some day
The love you've known, the love you've known
I waited by the other side my friend
