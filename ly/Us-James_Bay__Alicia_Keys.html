		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I'm beaten
Sometimes I'm broken
'Cause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke
Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better? 'Cause I'm losing hope

Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how could I believe in something
I believe in us

After the wreckage
After the dust
I still hear the howling, I still feel the rush
Over the riots
Above all the noise
Through all the worry, I still hear your voice

So, tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes out
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

Used to be kids living just for kicks
In cinema seats, learning how to kiss
Running through streets that were painted gold
We never believed we'd grow up like this

So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes out
That even in the dark we can find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
I believe in something
I believe in us

I believe in something
I believe in us
