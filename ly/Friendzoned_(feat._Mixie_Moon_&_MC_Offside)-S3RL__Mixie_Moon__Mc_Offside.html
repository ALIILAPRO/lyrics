		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, drop the bass

Oh, girl this is agony
I wish you were into me
But no it's not meant to be
No matter how good I treat you

Oh no, your with that dick
He treats you like shit
But to me you say

I friendzone you, you, you, you, you, you
I want you here with me whenever I'm sad
But you'll never get to take me to bed
Sorry that the feelings aren't mutual
Take it or leave it, 'cause I friendzoned you

Yo, drop the bass

The bass

I friendzone you, you, you, you, you, you
I want you here with me whenever I'm sad
But you'll never get to take me to bed
Sorry that the feelings aren't mutual
Take it or leave it, 'cause I friendzoned you
I friendzoned

Yo, here we go
I'm the asshole in her life I give her the D
No matter how I treat her she stays with me
We're fighting all the time, 'cuz I cheat, I lie
Then it's you on the phone when she's having a cry
You treat her real good, you treat her so nice
But when she gets home, she's back on my pipe
A little advice, to you from me
With girls like these, treat'em mean, keep'em keen
Bring the beat back

So now can you see it too? 
That this guy's no good for you?
No, won't listen to me
No matter how much you see it

Oh, no you're still with that dick
He treats you like shit
But to me you say

I friendzone you, you, you, you, you, you
I want you here with me whenever I'm sad
But you'll never get to take me to bed
Sorry that the feelings aren't mutual
Take it or leave it, 'cause I friendzoned you
I friendzoned
I friendzoned you
