		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's a woman when a man
Don't stand by her side?
What's a woman when a man
Has secrets to hide?
She'll be weak
She'll be strong
Struggle hard
For so long
What's a woman when a man
(What's a man without a woman?)
Don't go by the rule?
What's a woman when a man
(What's a man without a woman?)
Makes her feel like a fool?
When right
Turns to wrong
She will try
To hold on to the ghosts of the past
When love was to last
Dreams from the past
Faded so fast
All alone
In the daek
She will swear
He'll never mislead her again

All those dreams from the past
Faded so fast
Ghosts of the past
When love was to last
All alone
In the dark She will swear cross her heart
Never again
Cross my heart
Never again
(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
What's a woman when a man
Never again
(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
What's a woman when a man
Never again
(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
What's a woman when a man
Never again
(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
What's a woman when a man
Never again
(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
What's a woman when a man
Never again
