		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So soon we're too old to carry
We knew we only had a little while
In the middle keep ticking over
Before you know it, parent a parent

To have it all and still want more
One things for sure we're all getting older
So we take a lover waiting in the corner
Before you know it, pushing up the daisies

And we go back to where we came from
Like those before and those to come
And know its the ever and the more
And again and again and again

In the end nothing comes easy
So you find a way to take a little with you
For the ones you love, there if they need to
Pharaoh, they're not coming with you

And we go back to where we came from
Like those before and those to come
And know its the ever and the more
And again and again and again

So soon we're too old to carry
We knew we only had a little while
In the middle keep ticking over
Before you know it, parent a parent

And we go back to where we came from
Like those before and those to come
And know its the ever and the more
And again and again and again
