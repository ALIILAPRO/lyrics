		  Yeah, yeah, hello?
Uh, uh

Bitch, pass me the rock (ew)
Pick my dribble up and pass it to the opps (yeah, yeah)
Caught another triple-double on the block (block)
In her mouth like soul food when I'm hot (shop)
You ain't big, dawg, stop
Twenty eights and they sittin' in a shop (yeah, yeah)
Go the destination, boy, we in a lot (parkin' lot)
It's a situation, hit 'em with the chop
Yeah, uh

Bought a buss down

I'm sick of cap, fuck
Big richard mille playin' in my food

If he big then I'ma call for backup
Two jack rocks for a bitch nigga
Baby keem don't talk to gorillas
Spider-man suit and I'm in and out the zoo
Boogie man costumes hangin' out the rood (swerve)
