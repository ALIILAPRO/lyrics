		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatcha gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside your trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump, my lovely little lumps
Check it out

I drive these brothers crazy
I do it on the daily
They treat me really nicely
They buy me all these iceys
Dolce & Gabbana
Fendi and that Donna
Karan they be sharin'
All their money got me wearing fly
Gear but I ain't askin'
They say they love my ass in
Seven Jeans, True Religion
I say no but they keep givin'
So I keep on takin'
And no I ain't taken
We can keep on datin'
Now keep on demonstratin'

My love (love), my love, my love, my love (love)
You love my lady lumps (love)
My hump, my hump, my hump (love)
My humps they got you

She's got me spending
Oh, spending all your money on me
And spending time on me
She's got me spending
Oh, spending all your money on me
On-on me, on me

Whatcha gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
Whatcha gon' do with all that ass
All that ass inside them jeans?
I'ma make, make, make, make you scream
Make you scream, make you scream
'Cause of my hump (hump), my hump, my hump, my hump (what?)
My hump, my hump, my hump (hump), my lovely lady lumps
Check it out

I met a girl down at the disco
She said, "Hey, hey, hey, yeah, let's go"
I could be ya baby, you could be my honey
Let's spend time not money
And mix your milk with my coco puff
Milky, milky coco
Mix your milk with my coco puff
Milky, milky
Right

They say I'm really sexy
The boys they wanna sex me
They always standin' next to me
Always dancin' next to me
Tryin' to feel my hump, hump
Lookin' at my lump, lump
You can look but you can't touch it
If you touch it
I'ma start some drama
You don't want no drama
No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama
So don't pull on my hand, boy
You ain't my man, boy
I'm just tryin' to dance, boy
And move my hump

My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump, my hump, my hump
My lovely lady lumps (lump)
My lovely lady lumps my lovely lady lumps (lump)
In the back and in the front
(Lump) My loving got you

She's got me spending
Oh, spending all your money on me
And spending time on me
She's got me spending
Oh, spending all your money on me
On-on me, on me

Whatcha gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
Whatcha gon' do with all that ass
All that ass inside them jeans?
I'ma make, make, make, make you scream
Make you scream, make you scream

Whatcha gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off this hump
Whatcha gon' do with all that breast
All that breast inside that shirt?
I'ma make, make, make, make, you work
Make you work, work, make you work

She's got me spending
Oh, spending all your money on me
And spending time on me
She's got me spending
Oh, spending all your money on me
On-on me, on me

So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real), so real (so real)
So real (so real)
