		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I had said this was one thing
Two hands on the wheel, that's how we cruise
How'd I lose control and end up falling?
Guess you got in my head before I knew, knew

Running around it but when did we cross the line?
Running around it, I know that it crossed your mind
Me too, babe, might lose but if

It don't work, at least we tried
Never know 'til you let me in
Can't let it go 'cause you back again
Wondering if this don't work, at least we tried
Love is always a losing game
But in the end, I still wanna say
At least we tried (we tried)
Tried

We both understand this may not work
It's clear we both agree but here right now
Don't make a sound and let's just
Wait for that day to come
'Til then, I'm all yours
Just make me love you
I can't get this feeling out my heart
Without

Running around it but when did we cross the line?
(Running around it, around it)
Running around it, I know that it crossed your mind
Me too, babe, might lose but if

It don't work, at least we tried
Never know 'til you let me in
Can't let it go 'cause you back again
Wondering if this don't work, at least we tried
Love is always a losing game
But in the end, I still wanna say
At least we tried (we tried)
Tried

(Yeah)

Which way we play it?
It is what we make it
What are we waiting for?
'Cause I know there's something more with you
Even exchanges give some to take it
Maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong
At the end of the night if

It don't work, at least we tried (yeah)
Never know 'til you let me in
Can't let it go 'cause you back again
Wondering if this don't work, at least we tried
Love is always a losing game
But in the end, I still wanna say
At least we tried (we tried)
Tried
