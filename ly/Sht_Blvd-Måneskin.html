		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm cold, I'm drunk
I just don't care about, care about you
I smoke too much and I just don't care about you
I sing my songs and I just don't care about, care about you
I'm on my stars and I just don't care

So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down
So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down
So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down
So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down

Baby, and I just wanna fly away
Because I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't have time for you
And I just wanna fly away
Because I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't have time for you, hey

Yes, I'm listening
To the voice that I got inside my head
Maybe lately you began to trust in me, trust in me
So baby, stay here
Please darling, have no fear, have no fear
This is my dream, do you wanna live it?

So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down
So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down
So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down
So say that you hate me
Say that you want me down, down, down

Baby, and I just wanna fly away
Because I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't have time for you
And I just wanna fly away
Because I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't have time for you, you
For you, you

Yeah, I got something standing in the lot
Of the Shit Boulevard
One, two, three, shot the king to the ground
I got wings and I reach for the stars
For my system, I'm bored in my mind

'Cause I'm standing in the lot
Of the Shit Boulevard
One, two, three, shot the king to the ground
I got wings and I reach for the stars
For my system, I'm bored in my mind

'Cause I'm standing in the lot
Of the Shit Boulevard, yeah
One, two, three, shot the king to the ground, yeah
I got wings and I reach for the stars, yeah
For my system, I'm bored in my mind

'Cause I'm standing in the lot
Of the Shit Boulevard, yeah
One, two, three, shot the king to the ground, yeah
I got wings and I reach for the stars, yeah
For my system, I'm bored in my-

Baby, and I just wanna fly away
Because I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't have time for you
And I just wanna fly away
Because I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't have time for you
