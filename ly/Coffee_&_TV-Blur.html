		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you feel like a chain store?
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around, bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

So give me coffee and TV, peacefully
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability
Is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
There's people there who will hurt you
'Cause of who you are
Your ears are full of their language
There's wisdom there you're sure
'Til the words start slurring
And you can't find the door

So give me coffee and TV, peacefully
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability
Is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

So give me coffee and TV, peacefully
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability
Is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

Oh, we can start over again
Oh, we can start over again
Oh, we can start over again
Oh, we can start over again
