		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a minute since I called you
Just to hear the answerphone
Yeah, I know that you won't get this
But I'll leave a message so I'm not alone
This morning I woke up still dreaming
With memories playing through my head
You'll never know how much I miss you
The day that they took you, I wish it was me instead

But you once told me, "Don't give up
You can do it day by day"
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away

So I will keep you day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favorite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

I could feel your blood run through me
You're written in my DNA
Looking back in every mirror
I know you'll be waiting, I'll see you again

But you once told me, "Don't give up
You can do it day by day"
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (fade away)

So I will keep you day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favorite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

I promised you I'd do this
So all of this is all for you
Oh, I swear to God you're living
Through everything I'll ever do

So I will keep you day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favorite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

One life for the two of us
I'll be living one life for the two of us

We'll end just like we started
Just you and me and no one else
I will hold you where my heart is
One life for the two of us
