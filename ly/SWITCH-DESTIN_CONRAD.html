		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Toast to this, young and rich, blasphemous
Can't deal with the same old love, over and over (same old love)
I don't know, keep it interesting, mi nuh want no boring fuck
Want something mek mi high like drugs, but I'm still sober
Want something that I can't get over (no)

No hesitation, want a sure thing
We can switch it up and even role play
I think I need someone who loves like me (I need someone to love like me)
Don't shy away, mm-hmm, you're sick of repetition
Set it off, babe, no ignition
Do me that way (switch position)
Switch position, switch position
Switch-switch-switch switch position
Do me that way (switch position)

No, babe
On the floor, on your back, in your bed
And the sex, it feels so expected
I know that move that you make gon' make me feel this way
And babe, try loving me this way

No hesitation, want a sure thing
We can switch it up and even role play
I think I need someone who loves like me (I need someone to love like me)
Don't shy away, mm-hmm, you're sick of repetition
Set it off, babe, no ignition
Do me that way (switch position)
Switch position, switch position
Switch-switch-switch switch position
Do me that way (switch position)
