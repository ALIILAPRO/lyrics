		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, oh, no, no, no, no, ooh, oh
Ah, no, no, no, no

Half of my heart wants what we had again
Falling apart thinkin', "What could've been?"
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Baby, please, I don't think we can be friends
(I don't think we can, we can)
Half of my heart wants what we had again (we can, we can)
Falling apart thinkin', "What could've been?"
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Baby, please, I don't think we can be friends
(I don't think we can, we can)

I just wanna stop, had enough, out of love and out of luck
I don't wanna give a fuck about my feels, dozin' off
Emotionally uninvested, resting for the day to come
Try my hardest not to run away from everything I've done
But I'm looking back, ignoring facts
I see two moons but walk six paths
Inside my head, I'm going mad for you

Half of my heart wants what we had again (we can, we can)
Falling apart thinkin', "What could've been?"
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Baby, please, I don't think we can be friends

I just wanna go, I just wanna go (go, go, go)
I wanna take it slow (oh, oh, oh, take it slow)
I just wanna go, I just wanna go (go, go, go)
I wanna take it slow (oh, oh, oh, take it slow)

Half of my heart wants what we had again (we can, we can)
Falling apart thinkin', "What could've been?"
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Baby, please, I don't think we can be friends
(I don't think we can, we can)

Ah, oh, no, no, no, no
(I don't think we can, we can)
Ah, no, no, no, no
(I don't think we can be friends)
