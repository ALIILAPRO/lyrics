		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I heard you were a live one
Dreamin' all the time
And they told me you were driving
Out the corners of your mind
And I watched from a distance
As you crossed the borderline
But I knew that I could find you
Who else would find the time?

And ooh, when I met you
Yeah, you were so unkind
And ooh, now I've met you
I try to walk the line
Line
Line
Line

I heard your friend call me a pig
Yeah, I tried to leave it there
And no I didn't give a shit
Until I saw your curly hair
And now I try to change my ways
I'm tryna settle fuckin' down
I walk the line on where we kissed
And all I wanna do is frown

And ooh, when I met you
Yeah, you were so unkind
And ooh, now I've met you
I try to walk the line
Line
Line
Line
