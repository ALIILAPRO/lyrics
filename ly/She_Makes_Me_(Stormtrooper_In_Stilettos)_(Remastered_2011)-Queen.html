		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love...she makes me
She is my heart
She is my love
She is my love

I know you're jealous of her
She makes me need
She is my love
She is my love

Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
But the world will surely heal my ills
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so...

I know the day I leave her
I'd love her still
She is my love
She is my love

Who knows where my dreams will end?
I'll follow as they grow
But the world will know
How long I'll take
And if I'm very slow
She makes me so...
She is my love
She is my love
