		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flying 'round the world (whoa-ah), married to the game
Picture to a frame, yeah, I ain't gon' change
Tell me what else, tell me your tale
It's easier to scream, I'll send you straight to hell
I love Hell, Hell on earth
It's a burnt smell (yeah), as far as I could tell
It get deeper than a well
I don't wish you well, yeah, I don't give a fuck
Yeah, richer than the world
Got this new kind of money
You should see these new bills
You wouldn't know any better
I just put it all together, send a note to a letter
Write my sins off, yeah, know the blood better
Turn the wheel to the left, right, not better
Go be fake, bitch, yeah, being real's not better
I could tell a couple lies, yeah, you could tell I misled 'em
Look me in the eyes, don't tell me what you see
And I randomly tweak, I'll knock you off your feet
I been out for weeks, it get easier for me
But don't tell me, "Go help yourself", you can go and die
Do what you want, I won't hold the gun (I won't hold a grudge)
But imagine me there, with a dead blank stare
I was tryna warn you, but it seem like you don't care
And it's fine, that's fair, yeah, I would never care
I don't need to see, yeah, I don't need to hear
I don't wanna talk to you, yeah, I don't want you near
I never would care, you said, "Life ain't fair"
It's fair enough to me, I'ma let you feel free (yeah)
And I do it better, so I know that you could fail (yeah)
I do it for me, I don't do it for you
And it's cool
Lotta baggage to unpack, and it's cool
I can't go back on my words 'cause that'd be rude
Yeah, I like being disrespectful and that's cool
I'ma break you apart and feed you to fish for food
We live in the dark, live on the moon
I guess two-zero-nine-three is not for you (you, you, you, you)

The only thing I need from you (from you)
Instead of tellin' me things
I wish you would feel like me (I wish you would feel like me)
I wish you could see like me (I wish you could see like me)
And there's more to life than that (and there's more to life than that)
And there's more to life than this (and there's more to life than this)
And I tell you that now (and I tell you that now)
Now I want you to feel (now I want you to feel)
Everything's near (everything is near)

Eat an organ, you live forever
Yeah, I was born to live forever
Forever
Don't you feel good? You say you feel good
(Good) I'ma let you cry (good God)
I'ma let you die
You know this ship's tight
It's more than just me
It's more that you see
And it's more that you feel
Pay more just to feel
Clinging on the sheets
Falling down for weeks
History repeats
