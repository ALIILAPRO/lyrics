		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A smoky room
A small café
They come to hear you play
And drink and dance the night away

I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream you're mine
But you don't know
You don't even know that I am there

I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn

I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long
All night long (all night long)
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

Steal my heart
With every note you play
I pray you'll look my way
And hold me to your heart someday

I long to be the one
That you caress with tenderness
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn ('til the dawn)

I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long (all night long)
All night long (all night long)
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

Te sientas entre la gente
Cierras tu ojos
Y sueñas que soy tuyo
Pero yo no sé ni siquiera que estas ahí
Me gustaría tenerte entre mis brazos amor

I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream you're mine
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn ('til the dawn)

I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
Wish that I was in your arms, hey yeah
Like that Spanish guitar (Spanish guitar)
All night long (all night long)
All night long (all night long)
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

Seria tu canción

I'll be your song, your song, your song
I'll be your song, yeah
I'll be your song, your song, your song
Baby, all night long, yeah
I'll be your song, your song, your song
I wish I was in your arms
And you could play me like a Spanish guitar (I'll be you song, yeah)

I'll be your song, your song, your song (I wanna be)
I wanna be your song
I'll be your song, your song, your song
I'll be your song, yeah
I'll be your song, your song, your song (I wish that I was your song)

Hold me, baby all night long
I'll be your song, your song, your song
I'll be your song
