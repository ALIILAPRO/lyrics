		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ow, oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh whoa, come on
Listen girl

Drop your clothes on da floor
And close da door, ya know da score, yeah
Don't be shy, fantasize
(All night)
And just enjoy, my nasty ride

Get horny, get horny
I said, "You got me horny"
Get horny, get horny
All night, yeah

Get horny, get horny
I said, "You got me horny"
Get horny, get horny
Oh oh oh oh oh, listen

Knockin' boots, all night long
Said a bump n' grind, 'til the break of dawn, oh
Show ya bod, I don't waste no time, no
'Cause she knows, I goes for mine

Get horny, get horny
I said, "You got me horny"
Get horny, get horny
All night

Get horny, get horny
I said, "You got me horny"
(Yeah, yeah)
Get horny, get horny
Oh oh oh oh oh, swang on

Ya want a freak, a freak like me
Tah get low down dirty like a freak can be?
I see how ya play it, you sure as how you say it?
I like that in a man, so why should we delay it?

Come get a move on, baby, getcha groove on
I feel impatient, don't keep me waitin' too long
So if ya with it and ya know ya want me
I letcha win 'cause I be so horny

Roses are red
And violets are blue
Get on the floor
I wanna freak you, huh

Roses are red
And violets are blue
Get on the floor
Oh oh yeah

Get horny, get horny
(Drop your clothes on da floor)
Get horny, get horny, wooh
(An close da door, ya know the score)

Get horny, get horny
(Show ya bod, I don't waste no time, no)
Get horny, get horny
('Cause she knows, I goes for mine)
