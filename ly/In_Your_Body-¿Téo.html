		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say I'm crazy
Words can't make me feel what your body language shows me
I'll drop all I've got for a chance to feel you on me
Gain your lovin' and I know you feel it comin'

Why not let these feelings have their place
In a world without your touch my love feels wasted
And to lay here on my own it's not the same
It's not the same

And it's time like these to be lost in love
I fucked up
When you called my bluff
But it's time like these to be centered in love
And I got love for you so I said

I said baby
I feel it in your body
I feel it in your body
I said honey
I feel it in your body
I feel it in your body

Take your guard off
What a joy to see you naked
Share your sound with me
Your movement feels so sacred
I'mma follow
Where you lead it
Give me something
And tomorrow when you leave me
Know I won't be far

'Cause it's time like these to be lost in love
I fucked up
But that's just my luck
But it's time like these to be centered in love
And I've got love for you so I said (oh)

I said baby (oh, oh)
I feel it in your body
I feel it in your body (oh)
I said honey (oh, oh)
I feel it in your body
I feel it in your body

My bad
It flew over my head
Fucking with my mindset
You still got me woo-ooo

My bad
It flew over my head
You bringing my heart death
You still got me woo-ooo

My bad
It flew over my head
Fucking with my mindset
You still got me woo-ooo (I feel it in your body)

My bad
It flew over my head
You bringing my heart death (I feel it in your body)
You still got me woo-oo (I feel it in your body)
