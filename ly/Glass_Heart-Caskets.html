		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn’t think to question, the blissful truth
That your intentions were all pretend and this sinking feelings you
I’m feeling exhausted I just wanna be free
To claw myself from deaths front door and not let him capture me

I just can’t help but say that we should know better
We should know better
I just can’t help but feel like we should know better

Maybe if I take back what you meant to me
Just like you took my self belief
It’s like a war I fight inside myself
I always lose and I can’t help
Fall for the beating of my glass heart
The beating of my glass heart

I finally agree, I’m a mess, I confess
To the lies and my mistakes they convulse till they scream and they cry
‘Cause I feel so exhausted
I just wanna be free
To drag myself from deaths front door
And not let him capture me

Maybe I should
Take back what you meant to me
Just like you took my self belief
It’s like a war I fight inside myself
I always lose and I can’t help
Fall for the beating of my glass heart
The beating of my glass heart

We should know better
We should know better
We should know better
We should know better

And if you think that saying sorry can make it all ok
Then you’re the one mistaken
I’ll put you in your place

I just can't help but say that we should know better we should know better
I just can’t help but feel like we should know better

Maybe if I take back what you meant to me
Take back what you meant to me
Just like you took my self belief
It’s like a war I fight inside myself
I always lose and I can’t help
Fall for the beating of my glass heart
The beating of my glass heart
