		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm talking so slow
My tears, they overflow
So done with feeling low
It's making me mental, I'm so temperamental
I'm tripping on snow
Another heavy blow
It's dripping down my throat
I take it all back, I just want my mind back

All my tears and all my pain
Take it away, Novocaine
All my tears and all my pain
Take it away, Novocaine

Take it away, Novocaine
All my tears and all my pain
Take it away, Novocaine

My healing's isolated
Forgotten who I am
Got so ripped off by living
It all feels like a scam
My happiness is fading
The lighting's shine is waning
Emotional fixation
How long's it gonna last?

Take it away, Novocaine
All my tears and all my pain
Take it away, Novocaine

Tell my mom that I'm sorry
Don't know how it got this way
Her baby's in the darkness
She's begging me to stay
Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I'm fighting through the pain
I try my best to stop it
No one should take the blame

Take it away, Novocaine
All my tears and all my pain
Take it away, Novocaine

Take it away, Novocaine
All my tears and all my pain
Take it away, Novocaine
