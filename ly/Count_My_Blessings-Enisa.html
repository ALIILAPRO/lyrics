		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a rebel
Yeah, I know 
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
 
I see the light on
When you don't
I don't forget 
Where I come from
 
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
So far from where 
I was before
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know

He woke up cryin'
Cryin' in his Maserati
He won't stop countin'
Countin' all that dirty money
The bottom line is 
The only thing that gets him goin' 
Oh my, my it's never enough 

I may not have all your money
I'm still on my way, way
I wake up stay
Thankful for the day

I'm a rebel
Yeah, I know 
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
 
I see the light on
When you don't
I don't forget 
Where I come from
 
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
So far from where 
I was before
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
 
She goes so hard, yeah 
Knowin' that somebody's watchin'
Then get so mad when
They don't really pay attention 
I wish she knew that 
She don't gotta please nobody 
Oh my, my, knew she was enough

I may not have all your money
I'm still on my way, way
I wake up stay
Thankful for the day

I'm a rebel
Yeah, I know 
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
 
I see the light on
When you don't
I don't forget 
Where I come from
 
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
So far from where 
I was before
I count my blessings
Yeah, I know
