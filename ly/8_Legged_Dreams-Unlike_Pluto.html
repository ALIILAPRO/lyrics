		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I go to sleep at night
Eight legged dreams arise
Cobwebs in my eyes
Never, never gonna wake up

Stuck in a web of lies
Paralyzed like a fly
Spiders don't sleep at night
Never, never gonna wake up

Never, never gonna wake up

You were gonna say
My mind is a place
Where fears are raised
My mind plays tricks
It turns and it twists
It bends what I see

And I will stay awake, and I will stay awake
Nightmares go away, oh, oh, oh
You will fall, when you sleep
You will fall, when you sleep
Close your eyes, sweet dreams, oh, oh, oh

When I go to sleep at night
Eight legged dreams arise
Cobwebs in my eyes
Never, never gonna wake up

Stuck in a web of lies
Paralyzed like a fly
Spiders don't sleep at night
Never, never gonna wake up

Never, never gonna wake up

You're stressed when you wake 
It'll stay for awhile, it'll stay for awhile, oh 
Your subconscious fades
It'll wait to unveil, it'll wait to unveil, oh

And I will stay awake, and I will stay awake
Nightmares go away, oh, oh, oh
You will fall, when you sleep
You will fall, when you sleep
Close your eyes sweet dreams, oh, oh, oh

When I go to sleep at night
Eight legged dreams arise
Cobwebs in my eyes
Never, never gonna wake up

Stuck in a web of lies
Paralyzed like a fly
Spiders don't sleep at night
Never, never gonna wake up

Never, never gonna wake up
