		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi kids! Do you like violence?
Want me to grab a spare bear
Suit and stuff you inside it?
Got an appetite, grab a couple slices
Mom and Dad lied when they
Told you I was lifeless
What's this? Someone in the main office?
Hanging out after hours? How obnoxious
Watching us on his monitor, preposterous
Time to wake the others
Now we'll show him who the boss is
Call me Freddy, I'm the teddy with a temper
When I see a face like yours, I remember
Make it through the night and I'll
Bet they'll give you tenure
Then you can be part
Of Freddy's family forever
Most of us got a major upgrade
So I hope you don't hate staying up late
If you're scared, give your resume an update
'Cause unless you quit
You'll still be making minimum wage

When I come to life, you got no place to hide
Keep an eye on the time and
A light by your side you can try
If you'd like to survive five more nights
Stick around, don't be shy
We're your friends, we'll show you why

Beware Mangle
He'll leave your brains scrambled
You could say he's got a couple wires tangled
He likes surprising you from a higher angle
Keep an eye above ya
'cause it's where he likes to dangle
We got a brand new Freddy, Chica, Bonnie
You can bring balloons, boy
Time to throw the party put your mask on
'cause now the fun is starting
Don't keep it on long, it ain't fooling Foxy
Check the vents that we'll be
Crawling out the bottom of
If you got doors, now you oughta lock 'em up
Whoops, I forgot, you don't even got 'em
Keep the music playing
Or we're gonna have a problem
But don't relax once you have us distracted
We move around as sporadic
As mechanical crackheads
We think on our own, no strings attached
If you don't believe that, ask the Marionette

Did you listen to the vision you saw?
As the clock keeps ticking
We'll be giving you more
Do you remember the orignal four?
(Take a look at us now
'cause our condition is poor)
We were left to decay
In this dark, troubled place
Too late to run away
(Just don't run out of double As)

When I come to life, you got no place to hide
Keep an eye on the time and
A light by your side you can try
If you'd like to survive five more nights
Stick around, don't be shy
Just don't listen to the phone guy

Hello? Hello? Wow, you made it this far
Honestly, didn't think you'd really
Ever get far
Ha ha, don't worry, you got nothing to fear
This is just the beginning
Of a thrilling career
Now, the animatronics are known to bug out

Isn't that enough reason to get the f out?!
Listen up, guy, this gig ain't for me

But we're having such fun and
We'd hate you to leave you might mistake us
For hostile monstrosities
But accidents will happen when you
Got a lot of teeth
If you got a birthday, let us make it bright
It's so exciting when a party
Stops by for a bite
We wait all night for the day to begin
With a special surprise that we
Save for the end
If you don't already know how
We like to make friends
Then we'll show you now and
You're gonna fit right in

When I come to life, you got no place to hide
Keep an eye on the time and
A light by your side you can try
If you'd like to survive five more nights
Stick around, don't be shy
We're your friends, we'll show you why

Join us and die join us and die
Join us and die join us and die
