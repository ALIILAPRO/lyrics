		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see your smile in the sunrise
Look at the stars, but I only see your eyes
The brightest red in the sunset
Those summer nights with you lying there on your bed

Everywhere I go, wherever I stay
I'm always reminded of you every day
No matter the distance it won't ever change that you're my

Everything, everywhere, always
Love 'til it hurts, 'til my heart aches
The light in my world on my dark days
For always you'll be my
Everything, everywhere, always

My cup of coffee in the morning
The break of dawn right after the storm lifts
And even if I know you're miles away, close my eyes and pray that I'll dream of you

Everywhere I go, wherever I stay
I'm always reminded of you every day
No matter the distance it won't ever change that you're my

Everything, everywhere, always
Love 'til it hurts, 'til my heart aches
The light in my world on my dark days
For always you'll be my
Everything, everywhere, always
Love 'til it hurts, 'til my heart aches
The light in my world on my dark days
For always you'll be my
Everything, everywhere, always
