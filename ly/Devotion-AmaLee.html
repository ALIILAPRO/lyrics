		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The autumn leaves they fall, but I am left the same
A thousand years have passed, but still nothing has changed
What’s left to give when you have met the end
The petals fall, and leave a barren stem 

I feel it crumbling somewhere inside me
My strength, my love, my sanity
But through it all, my Devotion it burns strong

Another moment
Another memory
Another tear to tear me down
But I’ll keep fighting
My knees will never know the ground
I wanna keep your memory, won’t forget
But can’t it find a way to hurt me less
It’s my Devotion, 
It cuts me open, time again 

I thought that love that light, would be forever mine
The beating of your heart, it’s only in my mind 
I close my eyes and see all my mistakes 
A throne of gold, a perfect masquerade 

I feel it set to flame somewhere inside of me
My pain, my hate, my clarity
But through it all, my Devotion it burns strong 

Another moment
Another memory
Another tear to tear me down
But I’ll keep fighting
My knees will never know the ground
I wanna keep your memory, won’t forget
But can’t it find a way to hurt me less
It’s my Devotion, 
It cuts me open, time again 

My undying Devotion
My undying Devotion

I wanna keep your memory, won’t forget
But can’t it find a way to hurt me less
It’s my Devotion, 
It cuts me open, time again 
It’s my Devotion, 
It cuts me open, time again
