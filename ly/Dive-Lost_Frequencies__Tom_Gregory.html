		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just can't get enough of all these summer skies
The sun, it brings me up, it gets me high
I can live in this moment for the rest of time
So stay a little longer, my love
I just can't get enough of all these summer skies
They wash away the darkness from my mind
I can live in this moment for the rest of time
Oh my

I just wanna dive into your love, your love
Dive into your love, your love
I just wanna dive into your love, your love
Dive into your love, your love
I just wanna dive into your love

I just wanna dive into your love
(I wanna dive, wanna dive)
I just wanna dive into your love

I feel there's something coming over me
It's like a flash in my head
Right here with you is where I'm supposed to be
It's like coming home again

I just can't get enough of all these summer skies
The sun, it brings me up, it gets me high
I can live in this moment for the rest of time
So stay a little longer, my love
I just can't get enough of all these summer skies
They wash away the darkness from my mind
I can live in this moment for the rest of time
Oh my

I just wanna dive into your love, your love
Dive into your love, your love
I just wanna dive into your love, your love
Dive into your love, your love
I just wanna dive into your love

I just wanna dive into your love
(I wanna dive, wanna dive)
I just wanna dive into your love
