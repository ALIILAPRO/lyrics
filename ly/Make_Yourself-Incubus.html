		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I hadn't made me
I would have been made somehow
If I hadn't assembled myself
I'd have fallen apart by now

If I hadn't made me
I'd be more inclined to bow
Powers that be would have swallowed me up
But that's more than I can allow, bye-bye

If you let them make you
They'll make you papier-mâché
At a distance you're strong
Until the wind comes
Then you crumble and blow away

If you let them fuck you
There will be no foreplay
Rest assured, they'll screw you complete
'Til your ass is blue and gray

You should make amends with you
If only for better health, better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?
Make yourself, make yourself

If I hadn't made me
I'd have fallen apart by now
I won't let 'em make me
It's more than I can allow

So when I make me
I won't be papier-mâché
And if I fuck me
I'll fuck me in my own way

I'll fuck me in my own way
I'll fuck me in my own way
I'll fuck me in my own way
I'll fuck me in my own way

You should make amends with you
If only for better health, better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?
Make yourself, make yourself
Make yourself, make yourself
