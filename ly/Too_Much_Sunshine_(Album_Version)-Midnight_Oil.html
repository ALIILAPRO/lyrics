		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haven't had so much fun since my daddy
Took the V8 away
Light a spark in the dark take a mark
It's resurrection day
It's a breeze timorese apec speak
Wear batik seen not heard.

Well we do the same things that we always do
Nothing changes but the colour changes hue
I don't come to bury you
The trouble is with you.

We got too much sunshine,
We got too much sunshine.

Have you ever built your house
In a town called pissitaway
You were dreaming of marinas
With a crown you were king for a day
Saw a man with a reason any season
Got a bird in his hand.

Well we do the same things that we always do
Nothing changes but the channel changes view
Well the trouble with you has been
You can sleep but you can't dream.

We got too much sunshine.
