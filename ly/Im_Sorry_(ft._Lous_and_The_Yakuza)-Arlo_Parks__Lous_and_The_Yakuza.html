		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Butterflies in my skull when you sat me down
At the Dayglow cafe
I know that I haven't been myself
That I lost my courage

Petrol in the air, wisteria and scrambled eggs
Try to pin me down but I can't stand to show you
He affected me

I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
It's easier to be numb
I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
It's really just hard to trust anyone
It's really just hard to trust anyone

Sky blue shirt and I'm so desperately hurt
But I know you're there
And I can't make myself open up
As the sirens blare

Petrol in the air, wisteria and scrambled eggs
Try to pin me down but I can't stand for you to see me like this

I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
It's easier to be numb
I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
It's really just hard to trust anyone
It's really just hard to trust anyone

I've been working incessantly
But that won't keep the wolves at bay
I been working incessantly
Like a wasp, feeling trapped and crazed
Tried to tell my therapist everything
Tried to meditate
Fuck the pain away
Tried to move out to LA
Dye my hair lime, be a saint
But I won't peek through the blinds I've shut in myself
And so nothing changed
Yeah I won't peek through the blinds I've shut in myself
And so nothing changed

I'm sorry 
It's easier to be numb
I'm sorry 
It's really just hard to trust anyone
It's really just hard to trust anyone
It's really just hard to trust anyone
