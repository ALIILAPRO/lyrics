		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, cool, great, uh
My mama told me that you ain't right for me
Pop up
I wanna pull up to your crib, I'ma pop up
Sixty bands on your head, I'ma pop up (yeah)
Ayy, pull up on me, ten
Shows, ten hoes, bitch, i'm flowin'
Stroll through the mall
Spend it all 'cause I'm ballin'
Drop six on my wrist, lil' mama
Miss Charlotte face on, fakin' on

Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wide awake, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch
I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down
Fuckin' love your head, woah
Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wide awake, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch
I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down
Fuckin' love your head, woah

I could take offence
But you been changed on me
My ex took a risk 'cause
She been changed on me
Smokin' doobies with your friends
Why did you change on me?
I tried to talk some sense
But you still changed on me
Ayy, I know what you like
Your best friend like woah (yeah)
Pussy fuckin' up my life
In my head like woah (yeah)
Boss up on the price, take a risk like woah
Lil' mama been a freak and I already know
Ayy, condom in my pocket, your girl ho
Please stop it
Fuck up these price tags, love it
I'ma buy it
Stop sellin' dope, your sister love me
Only got the top
You actin' like we fuckin'
Scoop you in the whip, pick you up, I say so
Ayy, bitch, you ain't even got no say so
Ayy, I drive whip, I'm poppin' with my woes
I'ma surprise you, keep your
Eyes closed, I'ma, ayy

Okay, cool, great, uh
My mama told me that you ain't right for me
Pop up
I wanna pull up to your crib, I'ma pop up
Sixty bands on your head, I'ma pop up
Ayy, pull up on me, ten
Shows, ten hoes, bitch, i'm flowin'
Stroll through the mall
Spend it all 'cause I'm ballin'
Drop six on my wrist, lil' mama
Miss Charlotte face on, fakin' on

Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wide awake, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch
I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down
Fuckin' love your head, woah
Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wide awake, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch
I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down
Fuckin' love your head, woah
