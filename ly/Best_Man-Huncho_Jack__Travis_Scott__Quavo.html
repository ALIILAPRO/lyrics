MWA Music
Four bombs baby
C4

Left hand (left hand)
Cook up grams with the left hand
(Cook up grams with the left hand)
Count up bands with my best mans
Count up bands with my best mans
Cookin' up grams with the left hand, left hand
Count up bands with my best mans
Count up bands with both of my hands
Shouts out go out to all of my fans

Save me some in the bowl
Just to go all outta control
Used to have dreams of Final Four (dreams)
Until I went all around the globe (globe)
Then the feds hit my door (feds)
I had to flush the work right down the commode (flush)
Trap life (trap,) rap life (rap)
If you don't know now then you'll never know
Back then that's all I wanted
Split it up with all my brothers
Told 'em we gon' kill our opponents
Just because they never loved us, no
You want me to look back when you left us? No
Niggas on the Nawf can't leave the bando
Stayed down in the trap, tryna free the North Pole
Most niggas out here beggin' please to get on
Oh, no, not my gang, yeah, you know we built strong
Migo Gang, we built strong

Left hand (left hand)
Cook up grams with the left hand
(Cook up grams with the left hand)
Count up bands with my best mans (best man)
Count up bands with my best mans (yeah!)
Cookin' up grams with the left hand
(Cook up grams with the left hand)
Count up bands with my best mans
Count up bands with both of my hands
Shout outs go out to all of my fans

Best man had been my brother, took the fire, took the cover, uh
Can't tell us apart, but different fathers, different mothers
We got caught smokin' weed, we tried to hide the shit
But we like Swizz and DMX, we ruff ride the shit
I bumped the Ye and Screw tapes, you bumped the Nas and shit
We was both presidents, fuck the politics
We took two bright Lambs' on a speed chase
It's like a thousand on the dash on the freeway, yeah
Best man (best man) best man
R.I.P. to Ben Franklin, that's my best friend
My girl got that ass, she a Texan
She can bounce it up and down with her left leg
Tell me what gang is you reppin'

Left hand (right hand)
Cook up grams with the left hand
(Cook up grams with the left hand)
Count up bands with my best mans
Count up bands with my best mans (best mans)
Cookin' up grams with the left hand (yeah, best man)
Cookin' up grams with the left hand
(Cook up grams with the left hand)
Count up bands with my best mans
Count up bands with both of my hands (both hands)
Shout outs go out to all of my fans

Dropped out of school
Graduated from the streets
Countin' up the bands
Just my brothers and me
Dropped out of school
Graduated from the streets
Countin' up the bands
Just my brothers and me
I just count, with best mans
When I count them bands
My brother, best man
I just count, with best mans
The best man
