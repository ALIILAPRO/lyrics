		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard that song on the radio
And it got my gears turnin'
Like a real life time machine
You were there in the front seat
Windows down, we were burnin'
It was just like a movie scene
Those dashboard lights and your pale blue eyes
Cutting through me

Two hearts on a getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
Singin' louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone but
I hear it louder than ever

We spend our whole summer long
You and me in the moonlight
Chasing dreams in a fast machine
No way life could go wrong
When it all felt so right
Real life California queen
How can I forget our love
Or the ways that you loved me

Two hearts on a getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
Singin' louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone but
I hear it louder than ever

And I can never turn it off
No it can get loud enough
Yeah I just wanna hear it over and over
Over and over

Heard that song on the radio
And it got my gears turnin'
Like a real life time machine

Two hearts on a getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
Singin' louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone but
I hear it louder than ever

Two hearts on a getaway
Feels just like yesterday
Young love on the freeway
I hear it louder than ever
Those nights we used to sing along
We were livin' in a love song
Those days might be gone but
I hear it louder than ever
