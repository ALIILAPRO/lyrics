		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it love or is it lust?
'Cause I don't know who to trust
So I might as well have fun
If it's true the good die young
Do you love me or my drugs?
These days keep fucking me up
So I might as well have fun
If it's true the good die young

Die young (yeah)
Die young (yeah)

I keep seeing coffins
This syrup keep me coughin'
I got bodies all around me
I swear I see it often
She a devil in a dress
Double Gs on all my clothing
You're the only reason why my heart is always broken
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes so gone
Remember your lies, remember your lies for so long
Too many lies, too many lies to walk on
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights I'm too on

Is it love or is it lust?
'Cause I don't know who to trust
So I might as well have fun
If it's true the good die young
Do you love me or my drugs?
These days keep fucking me up
So I might as well have fun
If it's true the good die young

Die young (yeah)
Die young (yeah)

Yeah look what I've become
Got me going dumb
My heart feeling numb, yeah
Dealing with all this pain
Insane in my brain, yeah
Love scars
You broke my heart
Tore my shit right apart
Yeah, you got no heart
Baby you got no heart yeah
Reptar
Ate my shit like a shark
Is it love or lust, you should've said that from the start

Is it love or is it lust?
'Cause I don't know who to trust
So I might as well have fun
If it's true the good die young
Do you love me or my drugs?
These days keep fucking me up
So I might as well have fun
If it's true the good die young

Die young (Yeah)
I'm gone (Yeah)
