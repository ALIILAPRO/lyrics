		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chorus:
I'm gonna leave him tonight, just in time for that late LA flight
Somewhere else that I gotta be; I need to do what's right for me
But it sure ain’t an easy thing, when it comes down to love or dreams

Verse:
The day we met I was riding a wave, Ocean City beach on a hot summer day
He crashed my board; we collided when we hit the shore
I stood up covered in sand; he smiled and took my heart in his hand
It'll be so hard to say goodbye; just the thought of looking in his eyes

Chorus:
I'm gonna leave him a note, say I'm sorry, but I have to go
Somewhere else that I gotta be; I need to do what's right for me
But it sure ain’t an easy thing, when it comes down to love or dreams

Verse:
He’s not perfect and it’s far from easy, but he does his best to try and please me
Life can be bittersweet when I’m leaving him for a first-class seat
My career takes me miles away, colliding with my heart like he did that day
I've walked miles in my own shoes; still it's a muddy path I choose

Chorus:
I'm gonna leave him with a kiss, to remind me what I'm gonna miss
Somewhere else that I gotta be; I need to do what's right for me
But it sure ain’t an easy thing, when it comes down to love or dreams

Bridge:
The note will say, "You’re the love of my life. I’ll miss you. Be back Wednesday night."
I'll kiss him good-bye at the bedroom door
Cuz I'm gonna leave him...wanting more
