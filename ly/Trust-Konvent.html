		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come and show what you hide
Let's help you decide
Come, let us know. We won't tell
We will end your Hell
Bring it here
Let's see your fear
And then we'll rip you up from the bottom to the top
Bring it here
Let's see your fear
We don't lie
Greatest fear. Open up. After all, unbreakable is trust
Greatest fear. Open up. After all, unbreakable is trust
Bring it here
Let's see your fear
And then we'll rip you up from the bottom to the top
Bring it here
Let's see your fear
Greatest fear. Open up. After all, unbreakable is trust
Open up. With us your fears turn to dust
You bleed
We feed
Let the knife in
Come, forget about the town
Let your shoulders down
Come, leave it all behind
Our embrace is kind
