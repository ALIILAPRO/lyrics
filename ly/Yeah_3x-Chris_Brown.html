		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move your body, out on the floor
Put your troubles aside
Start living anybody can let go
Throw away all your problems
'Cause right now it's party time

Girl don't feel outta place
'Cause I, I'm in love with this feeling now
And I, I, hope that this will last a while
We should make it last a while

You like to drink, so do we
Get more bottles, bring 'em to me
Hold your glasses up, people everywhere
Now everybody put your hands in the air say

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl I wanna yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna see you tonight yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl I gotta yeah, yeah, yeah
I gotta see you tonight

Oh oh, oh whoa, let me see your hands
Oh oh, oh whoa oh oh, tonight is the night

Lost in the moment
Can't believe, you're so beautiful
Feels like I'm in a dream
Baby we're going
Somewhere you've never been before
So take my hand and come with me

Girl don't feel outta place
'Cause I, I'm in love with this feeling now
And I, I, hope that this will last a while
We should make it last a while

You like to drink, so do we
Get more bottles, bring 'em to me
Hold your glasses up, people everywhere
Now everybody put your hands in the air say

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl I wanna yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna see you tonight yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl I gotta yeah, yeah, yeah
I gotta see you tonight

Oh oh, oh whoa oh oh
Oh oh, let me see your hands
Oh oh, oh whoa oh oh
Oh oh, tonight is the night

All the pretty young things in the party
Let me see your hands up
And if they mad and they don't wanna party
Tell 'em to shut the fuck up
So D.J. turn it loud
And watch me turn it up
Don't worry 'bout it we here to party
So jump, jump, jump, jump

Girl I wanna I wanna see you tonight yeah, yeah
Girl I gotta, I gotta, I gotta I gotta see you tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna see you tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight is the night

Tonight is the night, tonight is the night
