		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel so good
when I spend all my
time with you
I feel so safe after all
we've been going through
When I'm looking in your eyes
I can see that you want me too
So go on, I feel so good
when I spend all my
time with you
When the night is gonna
get to you
Were gonna scream my love,
even dance forever
And I'm gonna be in your groove
I'm gonna dance with you
until the night comes to an end
Hush hush, baby, don't you know,
we are not a cliche
Hush hush, baby,
don't you want us to
sway the same way
Hush hush, baby,
it's been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near
we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, don't you know,
we are not a cliche ?

I feel so good, is gonna move me
so close to you
I feel so safe
I could go all the way with you
When the night is gonna
get to you
We're gonna scream my love,
even dance forever
And I'm gonna be in your groove
I'm gonna dance with you
until the night comes to an end
Hush hush, baby, don't you know,
we are not a cliche
Hush hush, baby,
don't you want us to
sway the same way
Hush hush, baby,
it's been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near
we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, don't you know,
we are not a cliche?
Hush hush
Hush hush
Hush hush
Hush hush, baby, don't you know,
we are not a cliche, cliche
Hush hush, baby,
don't you want us to
sway the same way
Hush hush, baby,
it's been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near
we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, don't you know,
we are not a cliche
