		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last time I saw you
We did coke in a closet 
At the Chateau Marmont 
We were happy and on it 
There were too many people
There was fun there was evil
And we both took the ride

It was colder than fuck
For a night in LA
And I couldn't stop thinking 
If I was ok
You were making me laugh
Shit was making me sway
And I thought I could fly

How low can you go?
'Cause I wanna know
How low can you go?

How low can you go?
'Cause I wanna know
How low can you go?

I heard that you stopped
Have some kids and a guy
I was happy and sad 
But I didn't know why
I still think of you now 
While I'm touching the sky
It's been a long, long time

And so much happens in between
The days catch fire like gasoline
Just tell me what's the worst you've seen
I wanna know

How low can you go?
'Cause I wanna know
How low can you go?
 
How low can you go?
'Cause I wanna know
How low can you go?
