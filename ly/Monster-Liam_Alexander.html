		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  l've been driving
Through the night
Down roads that
I don't know
Mind keeps racing
All the same things
I just can't let go
I see
No light in this darkness
To set me freeâ€¦
Why do I feel like the monster?
And nobody sees it but me
Just when I'm feeling hopeless
You're there to help me to breathe
I won't stop fighting
We've all got demons
We're trying to beat
There's a horizon
Where the sun sets for just you and me
I feel
That light in the darkness
When you're with me
Why do I feel like the monster
And nobody sees it but me
Just when I'm feeling hopeless
You're there to help me to breathe
Made some mistakes
Might've caused you some pain
I'm the first to admit I ain't Perfect
You choose to stay
Throughout my darkest days
And make all of this Hell feel worth it
You're my
Light in the darkness
To set me free
Why do I feel like the monster
And nobody sees it but me
Just when I'm feeling hopeless
You're there to help me to breathe
I feel like a
Monster
Monster
Monster
(Oh)
Monster
Monster
Monster
I feel like a
Monster
Monster
Monster
(Oh)
Monster
Monster
Monster
I feel like a
