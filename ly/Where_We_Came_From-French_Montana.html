		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Montana

Look at where we at, look at where we came from (haan)
Look at where we at, look at where we came from

Live life, I don't fear death (uh)
Slide through Morocco with the Euro step
Drop-top mindset, ain't nothin' above it
Bossed up from the block to them Playboy covers
Shorty licked it like Adderall residue
Ran through a hundred mill', it ain't nothin' new
You claiming her, she ain't claimin' you
Get caught without your chop, they spankin' you (bah-bah-bah)
Turn the pawns to a queen, was the best sport
Sixty-four, thirty-two like a chessboard
Love me like your friend, fuck me like your enemy
If you ain't a asset, you a liability
Let a young nigga get paid (shit, shit)
I snipe and I skate
Let a young nigga get paid (ooh, ooh)
Get the bag then I skate

Look at where we at, look at where we came from (tell me again, haan)
Look at where we at, look at where we came from (we gon' make lovin' again)
Look at where we at, look at where we came from (tell me again)
Look at where we at, look at where we came from (we gon' make lovin' again)
