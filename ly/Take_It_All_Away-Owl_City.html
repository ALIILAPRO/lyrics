		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a shot in the dark
I was caught by surprise
There was a hole in my heart
There were tears in your eyes
And there was nothing to say
'Cause you made up your mind
And so I guess what you meant
When you left was goodbye

So if you're gonna go
And leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show
Until you finally float away

You gotta know that you tear me up
When you say you wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear it up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away!
You were the one, and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of!
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it away, take away!

I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek
And as I tried to digest the words I couldn't believe
I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve
Making it easy to hurt, and even harder to breathe

So if you gonna go
And leave me in the lonely gray
I won't let it show
Until you finally float away

You gotta know that you tear me up
When you say you wanna take it away, take it away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it away, take it all away!
You were the one, and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away!
You take it all away, you take it all away

You gotta know that you tear me up
When you say you wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it away, take it all away!
You were the one, and it was enough (it was enough)
To be the one you were dreaming of (dreaming of)
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it away, take away!
You take it all away, you take it all away
