		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (BNYX)

Pull up in my (yum, yum)
Porsche topless (woo)
Cool as shit, he stuntin' (yeah)
Keep on lookin', mommy (yeah)
Let me know you 'bout it (ooh)
Whoa, dippin' through blue skies 
And the money doublin' (yeah)
'Round the world, don't mean to brag, my man
Watch me
Celebratin', do a toast to the life 
We live, we live tonight
And you see we got the glow, to the city
Get live, get live tonight

The G.O.a.t (G.O.a.t)
They say this on approach
While I'm geeked, I can hardly speak
Thank them take photo and as I lean
What could be next in my dream? Blessings from my God (God)
Serve 'em with that bomb
That's a taste, nigga just gettin' on his job
While I'm floatin' loose, baby cute (cute)
She say like the way I live my life, hey, I will show you (na, na)
I walk among the clouds 
And all the stars it's like a movie (na, na, na, na)
I landed on the moon (ayy, yeah)
She let me grab all on that booty (let's go)

Pull up in my (yeah)
Porsche topless (love it)
Cool as shit, he stuntin' (cool)
Keep on lookin', mommy (mwah)
Let me know you 'bout it (ooh)
Whoa, dippin' through blue skies (ooh)
And the money doublin' (ooh)
'Round the world, don't mean to brag, my man
Watch me
Celebratin', do a toast to the life 
We live, we live tonight
And you see we got the glow, to the city
Get live, get live tonight

Did you notice that I'm the coldest? (Tell 'em now)
These women they sayin' hi, blow a kiss, say, "Hold this" (mwah)
The realer who I be, smokin' neon potent (iller)
Young nigga in his bag, my man, run it
Feelin' right, feelin' perfect, mhm (yeah)
Surfin' got my wave, cowabunga, ooowee (yeah)
Movin' I'm on 10, ain't no less no way (yeah, yeah)
We party in my bedroom (uh)

Pull up in my (baby, baby)
Porsche topless (hit me)
Cool as shit, he stuntin' (uh)
Keep on lookin', mommy (yeah)
Let me know you 'bout it (uh)
Whoa, dippin' through blue skies (ooh)
And the money doublin' (ooh)
'Round the world, don't mean to brag, my man
Watch me
Celebratin', do a toast to the life 
We live, we live tonight
And you see we got the glow, to the city
Get live, get live (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Pull up in my (yeah)
Porsche topless (hit 'em)
Cool as shit, he stuntin' (uh)
Keep on lookin', mommy (yeah)
Let me know you 'bout it (yeah)
Whoa, dippin' through blue skies (ooh)
And the money doublin' (money)
'Round the world, don't mean to brag, my man
Watch me
Celebratin', do a toast to the life 
We live, we live tonight
And you see we got the glow, to the city
Get live, get live tonight
