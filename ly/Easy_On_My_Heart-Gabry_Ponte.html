		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say love is supposed to be kind, taking you high
They say love ain't supposed to feel like a mountain to climb

Well, there's plenty of good reasons for my sensibility
'Cause for some apparent reason, love ain't ever good to me
When I try to get my hopes up, I end up like I expect
Ain't no wonder why I became a mess

When everything I touch it falls to pieces
And everything I love just tore me apart
Before I let you get too close I beg you to go easy on my heart
When everything I touch it falls to pieces
And everything I love just tore me apart
Before I let you get too close I beg you to go easy on my heart

Easy on my heart

Tell me that we ain't nothing like that
Don't wanna hold back
You seem different, but I don't know how
I'm gonna move past

All the obvious good reasons for my sensibility
'Cause for some apparent reason love ain't ever good to me
When I try to get my hopes up, I end up like I expect
Ain't no wonder why I became a mess

When everything I touch it falls to pieces
And everything I love just tore me apart
Before I let you get too close, I beg you to go easy on my heart 
Everything I want is to believe in
But everything that I've been through makes it hard
Before I let you get too close, I beg you to go easy on my heart
Easy on my heart

When everything I touch it falls to pieces
And everything I love, just tore me apart
Before I let you get too close I beg you to go easy on my heart (my heart)
