		<p>
		  (Ayy, Kevlar, that motherfucker fire)
(I wish Kevlar cooked the beat)
M-A-D

Slide (yeah), slide (yeah
Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Catch him lackin', we gon' bust him (yeah)
.45, don't like to tussle (bap, bap)
I fucked his sister, if she try to fight me
Shoot her brother (yeah)
These diamonds hit like lightning
Shining bright, this drip a puddle
Walked in when I was countin' up
She gon' bite me, grab a muzzle
First spot just made two hundred racks
Can't wait to rent another
Shoot first, no room to hesitate
That's how they caught my brother

Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Hop out the car with sticks, Deebo just got the load
They in the back, shoot through the fence (go 'round that way)
You 'posed to be my brother, but you steal, it don't make sense (fuck is you doin'?)
Some of these niggas change for some change, I can't switch (I could never)
"I fucked her in the brain," what I'm thinkin' when they kiss (stupid)
She wanna ride the Range, I said, "Okay, no takin' pics" (true)
No lackin', got big Tyson in the back, you play, get flipped
You ain't slidin', you ain't built

Slide (yeah), slide (yeah
Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Catch him lackin', we gon' bust him (yeah)
.45, don't like to tussle (bap, bap)
I fucked his sister, if she try to fight me
Shoot her brother (yeah)
These diamonds hit like lightning
Shining bright, this drip a puddle
Walked in when I was countin' up
She gon' bite me, grab a muzzle
First spot just made two hundred racks
Can't wait to rent another
Shoot first, no room to hesitate
That's how they caught my brother

We came from taking shit
look at me now, hell of a hustler (I know they proud of me)
You scared to take a loss
how you gon' win without no struggle? (think about that)
Niggas get confronted by they sins and show they colors (rats, rats)
Beefin' 'bout these bitches, shoot a pistol 'cause he love her (quack, quack)
Fell in love with stackin', shoot a missile 'bout these hundreds (stacks, stacks)
My goal to get the money, boy, you play, we puttin' you under (slide)
On this soda, got me rollin', bitch, I'm loaded, check my jeans (slide)
Nigga folded, on my brodie, I'ma slide 'til he free (slide)

Slide (yeah), slide (yeah
Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Catch him lackin', we gon' bust him (yeah)
.45, don't like to tussle (bap, bap)
I fucked his sister, if she try to fight me
Shoot her brother (yeah)
These diamonds hit like lightning
Shining bright, this drip a puddle
Walked in when I was countin' up
She gon' bite me, grab a muzzle
First spot just made two hundred racks
Can't wait to rent another
Shoot first, no room to hesitate
That's how they caught my brother

Slide, slide, slide, slide
