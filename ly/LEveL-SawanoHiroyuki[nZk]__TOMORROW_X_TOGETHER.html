		  罠だらけの理想 慰めの口実
Gonna say I told you so
取り上げられる希望
Short cut to be a star
Wasn't born to raise the bar
誤魔化しの正義は 誰も起こせないアラームのようだ

Failing, feeling
喜怒哀楽をクリーンにしないで
声を free に
Let's get 'em

So givin' yourself
Ya givin' yourself the best shot
Be givin' yourself
Ya givin' yourself the best shot
Don't you gotta get solo?
What you gonna get? Swear it!
Don't you dare forget solo
Ya give it your best shot!

Go reach out to get ya
Gotta go reach out to get ya
Just go reach out to get ya
Get up, reach out for it
Go reach out to get ya
Gotta go reach out to get ya
Just go reach out to get ya
Just get in, get out, get on to it

Can't remember to forget
Little boy who lost the bet
Now I'm racking up the kills
I got to pay the bills, the bills
Be grateful what you get
Is a way to hit reset
Give you more than just a leg
Off the hook, I'm God level

Failing, feeling
All those days are dead, there's no railing, ceiling
Let's get 'em

So givin' yourself
Ya givin' yourself the best shot
Be givin' yourself
Ya givin' yourself the best shot
Don't you gotta get solo?
What you gonna get? Swear it!
Don't you dare forget solo
Ya give it your best shot!

Go reach out to get ya
Gotta go reach out to get ya
Just go reach out to get ya
Get up, reach out for it
Go reach out to get ya
Gotta go reach out to get ya
Just go reach out to get ya
Just get in, get out, get on to it

Ayy, game over but they gave him all the cheat codes
Little kiddy in the gutter with the bloody nose
On the cover but he doesn't even read those
The headlines, the headlines
So jacked but he hasn't got an ego
Local boy and he came up from a zero
Every battle we can watch him as the power grows
And grows, let's get 'em

So givin' yourself
Ya givin' yourself the best shot
Be givin' yourself
Ya givin' yourself the best shot
Don't you gotta get solo?
What you gonna get? Swear it!
Don't you dare forget solo
Ya give it your best shot!

Go reach out to get ya
Gotta go reach out to get ya
Just go reach out to get ya
Get up, reach out for it
Go reach out to get ya
Gotta go reach out to get ya
Just go reach out to get ya
Just get in, get out, get on to it
