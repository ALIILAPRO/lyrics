		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been broken down 
To the lowest turn 
Bein' on the bottom line 
Sure ain't no fun 

But if we should be evicted 
Huh, from our homes
We'll just move somewhere else 
And still carry on 

Oh 
(Hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) hold on 
Ooh, aah, baby 

(Hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) ooh ooh aah 

The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 
The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 

Aah 

Now we may not know, huh 
Where our next meal is coming from
But with you by my side 
I'll face what is to come 

Aah, boy I want to thank you
Yeah, for loving me this way 
Things may be a little hard now 
But we'll find a brighter day 

Oh, yeah
(Hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) hold on 
Ooh, ooh ooh 

(Hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) won't be long 
Ooh, yeah 

The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 
The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 
Ooh ooh ooh

Talk about the only way is up, baby 
Talk about the only way 

Talk about the only way is up, baby 
Talk about the only way 
Talk about the only way is up, baby 

(Hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) hold on 
Hey 

(Hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) won't be long
No no no 

The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 
The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 

The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 
The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now

The only way is up
For you and me now 
The only way is up, baby 
For you and me now 

The only way is up
For you and me now 
The only way is up
For you and me now 

The only way is up
For you and me now 
The only way is up
For you and me now
