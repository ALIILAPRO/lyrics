		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the blood from the bodies collect
Then irrigates through the soil
It flows through the cracks of the earth
Then drips to the demons below
Just waiting to be unleashed
By the blood of the chosen christ
His blood shall set them free
Beneath this sacred ground lies the gate to their dimension
Amidst the molten bowls of the earth
Once the chosen blood touches to their lips the gates open
Our dimensions amalgamate, transporting them to earth
To rule with me forever

Without the chains of their translucency
My flesh burns away to reveal my true form as god
I am Belial, the serpent has shed his skin
I have deceived the world as a servant of god
With the church I have prepared my own thrown
It was easy to fool them all with my
Disguise as they looked into my eyes
They never saw the serpent beneath the surface
Waiting for his moment to strike
I have brought forth hell to earth
Just to show god what it's worth
His kingdom shall rot forever
I have no sympathy for god
