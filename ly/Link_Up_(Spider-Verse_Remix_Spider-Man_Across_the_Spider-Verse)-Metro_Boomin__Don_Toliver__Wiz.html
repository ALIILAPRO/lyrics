		  Link up, link up, link up, link up
Link up, link up, link up, link up

Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up
Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up

You, you took me on for a fool
You, you took me on for a fool
Big flex like a Rolex, no time for the romance
Don't you catch no feelings
Don't you catch no feelings

Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up
Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up (yuh)

Dem a style a
Yeah I won't lie
Yeah, we gon' link up
Let's leave the romance
I dey we children
I dey fi love right
Make we no talk about the worries
Let's sync up
Big flex like a Rolex
No time for the romance (feelings)
(Don't you catch no feelings)
I go dey dere when you need me

Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up
Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up

Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Ah, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Ah, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Ah, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up

Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up
Come link up, sync up, link up, sync up
You a staller, overthinker
When I call up, you no pick up

Bibidi bibidi bibidi bam ska
You know, you don't know

Hate labels, I'm not a hero because calling yourself a hero 
Makes you a self apologizing narcissistic-
