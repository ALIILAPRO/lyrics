		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (AOD) are you mad? (In the building) only run from fed
Touch my watch, why you wan' get dead?
Yo, run up your mouth, get cheffed (ayy)
Yo, bun up the right and left
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno
When they ask in the interview room, I dunno (I don't know)
How many gyal in the room? I dunno (ayy)
Is that your girl in my coupe? I dunno (baow, baow, baow)

Still got the wap, no safety (bang, bang)
Lauren, Stacey (ayy)
Mad mix, brazy (mm-mm)
We dip up niggas daily (ayy, ayy)
Should I cuff Ms. Banks? (Oi)
Give her babies, mm-mm, maybe (ayy)
9 boys (brr), crazy (brr, baow)
Bad B, uh, let's meet in Edmonton
But I heard they got police intelligence (baow, baow)
Told he don't chef 'cause he's irrelevant
Free flow, that's me in element
My young boy, soon free, no evidence
But he phone me if he need anything
Mm-mm, love beef, adrenaline
Mm-mm, in the shard with melanin

Don't think 'cause I don't do fraud that ain't in the trap wit' the square and presser
Just put a thousand grams in the clamp, I whip magic like Penn and Teller (facts)
It's Dutch, I was broke, back when I had a thing for Ella (yeah)
Put three and a half on this wap, move back (baow), everything dead up (baow)
Genna, Genna (what's good, bredda?)
Just got the drop on both of my opps
I'm 'bout to get both of 'em down with this wetter (no pressure)
No pressure (mm-mm)
I'm back with a sick vendetta, Dutch, I was left back like Evra
Plug better gimme one extra, Velli (mm-mm)

Are you mad? Only run from fed (fed)
Touch my watch, why you wan' get dead? (Baow, dead)
Yo, run up your mouth, get cheffed (cheffed)
Yo, bun up the right and left
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno
When they ask in the interview room, I dunno (I don't know)
How many gyal in the room? I dunno (let's go)
Is that your girl in my coupe? I dunno (baow)

Is he sending for me? I dunno
What them boy there sell first week? I dunno (boy, boy)
When they ask for the fee let 'em know that's it 1.5 for the headline show
Little nigga, that's milli's not thousands
Stormzy the goat but they really been doubtin'
Came offline, I've been chillin' in mountains
How about you, bro? I really sell albums
Wait, look, I thought I heard shots but the shoe don't fit
Can't flex on me with Louboutin drip (come on)
'Cause my nigga, that's stupid shit (come on)
We all know that I'm stupid rich
Can't stand these neeks when they talk on the tune
'Cause it's, "wagwan bro?" When I walk in the room
That's Big Mike, the most paid, the most sold
And I still get love from all of the goons, like

Are you mad? Only run from fed
Touch my watch, why you wan' get dead? (Baow)
Yo, run up your mouth, get cheffed
Yo, bun up the right and left
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno
When they ask in the interview room, I dunno
How many gyal in the room? I dunno
Is that your girl in my coupe? I dunno (baow)

Yo, touch my watch, get dead up
Shell up, come here, pick your friend up (pick your friend up)
Some man just too friend up
That's how man get set up, wet up (yo)
Punch man's face off, one up (boom)
Shut up, beef my boys? I'll run up (bang)
Calm, still got my girl from Enfield
Because her pum-pum tun up
Ayy, free up my fifth side drillers
Yo, free up my Edmonton hitters
I was S-road boppin' on free flow
Yo, Edmonton, steppin' in prison (what?)
Bang him up in the visit in front of his missus, oh so vicious
All my G's on the road to the riches
Free all my G's, they're the realest (facts)

Are you mad? Only run from fed (fed)
Touch my watch, why you wan' get dead? (Baow, dead)
Yo, run up your mouth, get cheffed (cheffed)
Yo, bun up the right and left
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno
When they ask in the interview room, I dunno (I don't know)
How many gyal in the room? I dunno (let's go)
Is that your girl in my coupe? I dunno (baow)

Are you mad? Only run from fed
Touch my watch, why you wan' get dead?
Yo, run up your mouth, get cheffed
Yo, bun up the right and left
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno
When they ask in the interview room, I dunno
How many gyal in the room? I dunno
Is that your girl in my coupe? I dunno (baow, baow)
