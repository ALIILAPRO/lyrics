		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a fan dancer
Down in South Side Birmingham
She was running from a fat man 
Selling salvation in his hand
Now he's trying to save me
We'll I'm doing alright, the best that I can 

Just another fallen angel
Trying to get through the night

Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung 
Climbing Jacob's ladder

Coming over the airwaves
The man says I'm overdue
Sing along, send some money
Join the chosen few

Well, Mister I'm not in a hurry
And I don't want to be like you
All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung 
Climbing Jacob's ladder

All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung 
Climbing and trying

Step by step, one by one
Step by step

Step by step
Step by step
