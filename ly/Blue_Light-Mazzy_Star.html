		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a blue light, In my best friend's room
There's a blue light, In his eyes
There's a blue light, yeah, 
I want to see it, shine

There's a ship, that sails by my window
There's a ship that sails on by, 
There's a world under it
I think I see it, 
Sailing away

I think it's sailing, 
Miles crashing me by
Crashing me by, 
Crashing me by

There's a world , 
Outside my doorstep
Flames over, everyone's heart
Don't you see them shining, 
I want to hear them
Beating for me

I think I hear them
Waves crashing me by, 
Crashing me by, 
Crashing me by
