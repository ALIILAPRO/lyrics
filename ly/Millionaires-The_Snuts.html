		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spilling over the lines
Dreaming on the motorway
I got you by my side
Yeah, we could use a holiday

We talk about the lottery
Just a million to get away
In the four-letter kinda way
We're greener than we'll ever be

Alright, alright
Everything is so sweet, air-tight
Driving to the sunset, moonlight
I already know, know we got it all, so

Don't you worry, we'll be rich, I swear
If love was money, we'd be millionaires

And does it even matter?
If we never get to where we said we'd be?
That seven-figure sun at sea
Get away, we're free
We're millionaires, you and me

'Cause we're alright, alright
Everything is so sweet, air-tight
Driving to the sunset, moonlight
I already know, know we got it all, so

Don't you worry, we'll be rich, I swear
If love was money, we'd be millionaires

Lately, both our hands are shaking
Breaking bodies just to make some
Money, what a funny kind of
State of mind to make us happy

Don't you worry, we'll be rich, I swear
If love was money, we'd be millionaires

It doesn't even matter
If we never get to where we said we'd be
Yeah, it's alright 'cause love is free
