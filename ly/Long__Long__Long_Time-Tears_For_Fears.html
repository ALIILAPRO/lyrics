		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The higher the mountain, the harder the fall
Looking for blood at the scene of the crime
It's been running in circles or nothing at all
For a long, long, long time

Boxing at shadows and listening at doors
Pushing the buttons and pulling the blinds
We haven't been honest or clever or sure
In a long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long time

Funny how the heart of everyone
Is the part you'll never know
Funny how the heart of holding on
Is letting go

The higher the mountain, the harder the fall
Turning the corner and looking for signs
You leap in the dark while I wait for the call
It's been a long, long, long time

Out of the furnace and into the flames
Holding a candle and crossing the line
We haven't been playing with fire or rain
In a long, long, long time
For a long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long time

Funny how the heart of everyone
Is the part you'll never know
Funny how the heart of holding on
Is letting go

Funny how the heart of everyone
(Save me the last word)
Is the part you'll never know
Funny how the heart of holding on
(Save me the last word)
Is letting go

Funny how the heart of everyone
(Save me the last word)
Is the part you'll never know
Funny how the heart of holding on
(Save me the last word)
Is letting go

The higher the mountain, the harder the fall
(The higher the mountain, the harder the fall)
(The higher the mountain, the harder the fall)
