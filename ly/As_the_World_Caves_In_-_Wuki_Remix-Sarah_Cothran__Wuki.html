		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My feet are aching
And your back is pretty tired
And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
And set our grief aside
The papers say it's doomsday
The button has been pressed
We're gonna nuke each other up boys
'Til old Satan stands impressed

And here it is, our final night alive
As the earth burns to the ground

Oh boy, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh boy, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in

You've put your final suit on
I paint my fingernails
Oh, we're going out in style, babe
And everything's on sale
We creep up on extinction
I pull your arms right in
I weep and say goodnight, love
While my organs pack it in

And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground

Oh boy, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh boy, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in
