		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday's a memory
Another page of history
Sell yourself for hopes and dreams
That leave you feeling sideways

Tripping over my own feet
Trying to walk to my own beat
Another car out on the street
Trying to find the highway
Hey, are you going my way?

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white
And it's anything but gray

I know that no, I'm not alright
But I'll be okay 'cause
Anything can, everything can happen
That's the story of my life

I'm gonna write the melody
That's gonna make history
Yeah, and when I paint my masterpiece
I swear I'll show you first

There just ain't a way to see
Who, when, why or what will be
Ã¢??Til now is then it's a mystery
A blessing and a curse
Or something worse, yeah

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white
And it's anything but gray

I know that no, I'm not alright
But I'll be okay 'cause
Anything can, everything can
I've been thinking
Baby, you can help me write the story of my life
Hey, what do you say?

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
And I hope you're by my side
When I'm writing the last page

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white
And it's anything but gray

I know that no, I'm not alright
But I'll be okay 'cause
Anything can, everything can
I've been thinking, baby we can

This is the story of my life
The story of my life.
