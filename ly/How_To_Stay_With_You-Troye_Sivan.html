		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut my garden down
I've got no flowers, but it's the thought that counts
Wish you lived a little closer
Maybe when we're a little older
We can set up shop
Back where you are or I can take you home
I feel like my brother might like you
Just not in the same way I do, yeah

Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions impair my decisions
And I can't stop

I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you

I turn my out
It's been a sec, but I didn't forget
How to pull you in closer
In case it's not 'til we're older
That we reach the top
The pinnacle of everything we are
I feel like my mother might like you
Just not in the same way I do

Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions impair my decisions
And I can't stop

I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you, yeah

Starting again when I got all I wanted
Starting to feel a little bit despondent, yeah
Starting again when I got all I wanted
Starting to feel a little bit despondent
