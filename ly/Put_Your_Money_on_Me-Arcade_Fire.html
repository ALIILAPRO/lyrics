		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your money on me
'Cause I can barely breathe
Put your money on me

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Go tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

If there was a race
A race for your heart
It started before you were born
Above the chloroform sky
Clouds made of ambien
Sitting on carpets in the basement of heaven
We were born innocent, but it lies today
And baby you can give all the money away
But if there's a race, a race for your heart
It's over, before it starts
Singing put your money on me

If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Go tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

All my presents are broken, before they're open
And the promises, the second they're spoken
I know I've been different
My skin keeps shedding
My mother was crying on the day of our wedding
Trumpets of angels call for my head
But I fight through the ether and I quit when I'm dead
If you want to know who'll be there in the end
When you bury me baby, I'll still be your friend
Singing put your money on me

If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Go tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

Singing put your money on all your money on me
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on all your money on me
(Put your money on me) I know it's not easy

(To put your money on me)
('Cause I can barely breathe)
(When you put your money on me)
The Silicon Valleys melted back into silicon
We'll find a way to survive
Singing put your money on me

If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me (All your money on me)
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me (Put your money on me)
Go tuck me into bed, then wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free (I know that you gotta be free)
But I'm never gonna let it go

Singing put your money on all your money on me
(Put your money on me) I know it's not the last time
Put your money on all your money on me (put your money on)
I know it's not easy
Put your money on all your money on me
(Put your money on) I know it's not the last time
Put your money on all your money on me
I know it's not easy

(To put your money on me)
(All your money on me)
