		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You won't believe what I tell you,
White coats and clever minds will choose
You get a lot from this
Loose tongue and arrogance
It's not appropriate
Don't think that this is it

Now I can talk, no one gets off
(I know how you like to)
Now I can talk, no one gets off

A longer sentence brings no more
Than one that I had said before
It's hard to compromise
When I see through your eyes
It's just a common view
I guess it's lost on you

Now I can talk, no one gets off
(I know how you like to)
Now I can talk, no one gets off

Now I can talk, no one gets off
(I know how you like to)
Now I can talk, no one gets off

Now I can talk, no one gets off
(I know how you like to)
Now I can talk, no one gets off

Now I can talk, no one gets off
(I know how you like to)
Now I can talk, no one gets off
