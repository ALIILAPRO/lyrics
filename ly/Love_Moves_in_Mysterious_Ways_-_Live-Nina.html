		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who'd have thought this is how the pieces fit
You and I shouldn't even try making sense of it
I forgot how we ever came this far
I believe we had reasons but I don't know what they are
Some blame it on my heart, oh

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days

But still it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Heaven knows love is just a chance we take
We make plans but then love demands the leap of faith
So hold me close, never ever let me go
'Cause even though we think we know which way the river flows
That's not the way love goes, no

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days

Still it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Like the ticking of a clock, two hearts beat as one
But I'll never understand the way it's done, no

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days

Still it's a mystery
Of how you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways
Love moves in mysterious ways
