		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the run again
Threats all around me
I’m on the run again
Aku bersaksi

Atas padi milik rakyat di Wonogiri
My people our church under siege another city

Mom's on the phone again
Dek jaga diri
Media interview again
Kristenisasi

Stranger in my own land
Pariah for the Godsend
Taboo for my own fans
See me with your sixth sense

'Cause no one will find me
They can try rat me out and locate me
But no one will find me
Sniff me out where I lay GPS me
Yet no one will find me
Track me down Cerebro can’t afford me
But no one will find me
But no one will find

'Cause no one will find me
They can try rat me out and locate me
But no one will find me
Sniff me out where I lay GPS me
Yet no one will find me
I'm a ghost don't look at me
I am lost never find me
Yeah leave me here where I should be

Back on the track again
No one will miss me
They'll heed my words again
Come close come for me

Crown made out of thorns again
Body on the cross again
Dark Knight rises Mr. Wayne
Messiah Wordfangs born again

Rodents on the run again
Well they better be
Fire in the booth amen
Gotta confess my sins

When my deeds got done I know
Gotta reap what you sow
They'll be running back at me I know
By then I'll be long gone

And no one will find me
They can try rat me out and locate me
But no one will find me
Sniff me out where I lay GPS me
Yet no one will find me
Track me down Cerebro can't afford me
But no one will find me
But no one will find me

’Cause no one will find me
They can try rat me out and locate me
But no one will find me
Sniff me out where I lay GPS me
Yet no one will find me
I’m a ghost don't look at me
I am lost never find me
Yeah leave me here where I should be
