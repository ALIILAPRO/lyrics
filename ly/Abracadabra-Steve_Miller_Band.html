		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heat up, I can't cool down
You got me spinning
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burning flame
Burning flame full of desire
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher

Abra abracadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra abracadabra
Abracadabra

You make me hot, you make me sigh
You make me laugh, you make me cry
Keep me burning for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove

Abra abracadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra abracadabra
Abracadabra

I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin, leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face

I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

Abra abracadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra abracadabra
Abracadabra

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burning flame
Burning flame, full of desire
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher
Yeah, yeah

I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round

I heat up (I heat up), I can't cool down (can't cool down)
My situation goes 'round and 'round ('round and 'round)
I heat up (I heat up), I can't cool down (can't cool down)
My situation goes 'round and 'round ('round and 'round)
I heat up, I heat up (can't cool, can't cool down)

'Round and 'round
