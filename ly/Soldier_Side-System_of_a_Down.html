		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dead man lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when savior comes is he gonna be saved
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker
Maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth he's never going home

Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes are they gonna be saved
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner
Maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth he's never going home

Welcome to the soldier side
Where there's no one here but me
People all grow up to die
There is no one here but me
Welcome to the soldier side
Where there's no one here but me
People on the soldier side
There is no one here but me
