		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Movie screen
Can't help but see you in every scene
Guy gets the girl, I wish that was me
The way that they held on to love
Love, I

I don't wanna miss you, God, I wanna kiss you
I don't even wanna think about it
Running circles 'round the reasons that you left
And I can't even seem to get around it
Ending scene, I know this is how it's supposed to be 
And it's haunting me now

Tell me why I'm stuck in a time loop 
While the pendulum swings on by
Tell me why I see you in everything, everywhere

All the time, you follow me like a shadow
From you, there's nowhere that I can hide
Life here without you's so shallow
And I wanna call you
But I don't ever wanna be the reason for tears that you cry
Everything, everywhere, all the time
Wish I could forget you, but I won't
You're everything, everywhere

It's killing me
The end of us felt like the end of me
Can't even escape you inside my dreams
Wish I could put this to rest
Yeah, ahh

I don't wanna miss you, God, I wanna kiss you
I don't even wanna breathe
No, I'm not the person that I should've been
Never gave you what you need
Oh, I ended things, think I'll regret it eternally
And it's haunting me now

Tell me why I'm stuck in a time loop 
While the pendulum swings on by
Tell me why I see you in everything, everywhere

All the time, you follow me like a shadow
From you, there's nowhere that I can hide
Life here without you's so shallow 
(Life here without you's so shallow)
And I wanna call you
But I don't ever wanna be the reason for tears that you cry
Everything, everywhere, all the time
Wish I could forget you, but I won't
You're everything, everywhere

you follow me like a shadow
Everything, everywhere

(You follow me like a shadow)
