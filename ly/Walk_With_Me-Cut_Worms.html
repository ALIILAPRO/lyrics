		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you’re 
walking home alone, 
by all the houses and there’s no one home
Left to wonder at the 
night and dawn, why
everybody’s so afraid

When you’re 
walking in a crowd
all of the noises of the
city so loud
coming after you but don’t you think twice,
you just turn yourself away

come my love and 
walk with me
where the night wind’s howling and laughter 
won’t define us
make the sad and torn
undertaker smile
when he’s standing right behind us
he’ll never know \the things we know, 
we’ll watch them go
far away we fly
to the open sky
far from the Grade
and working all day
all just pageants
after all

Please don’t tell me to relax
when I’m tied up on the tracks
the train is gone, but I know it’s
coming back this way again
and it’s always on time

When we’re walzing in a dream
laughing at all we only thought we’d seen
by the time that we will open our eyes
then we won’t be so alone

come my love and walk with me
where the old world’s gone and the new one’s just beginning. I’d be sad and torn for the old routine where the bad guy’s always winning. They’ll never know the things we know, we’ll watch them go
far away we fly to the open sky
far from the Grade and working all day
all just pageants after all
all just pageants after all
all just pageants after all
