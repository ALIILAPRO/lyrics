		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Adverse to the pain,
And cold to the touch.
I never really knew, 
How it felt to become something other than dust.
I pray you see,
The potential in me.
I never really thought,
I would ever find someone worthy of my trust.

Every day we pray.
Something comes of this.
If we can't optimise.
This is all there is.

Mysterious skin.
Pending intention.
What's the use of being here
If all I can do is attempt to mask my fear.
What do you want from me?
Why did you save me?
When will I realise
With my knowledge contingent on what you decide?

Every day we pray.
Something comes of this.
If we can't optimise.
This is all there is.

Look up to the skyline.
Make way for the last light.
Does it feel strange at the bottom?
Strange at the end of our kind?

Every day we pray.
Something comes of this.
If we can't optimise.
This is all there is.

Look up to the skyline.
Make way for the last light.
Does it feel strange at the bottom?
Strange at the end of our kind?
I swear it's the last time.
We're edging to twilight.
I'm so scared at the bottom.
Scared of the thin blinding line.
