		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should know I'm a ways past the point where a mind can change
Nothin' I'd rearrange, you're the perfect combination
Of reckless, stubborn, and affectionate
And when you tell me we're steady, I know you mean every word of it

No one's ever loved me like that
Three AM in a hospital bed, runnin' high on my meds sayin'
No one's ever loved me like that
Tell me, "No, you don't have to be strong, you're allowed to be wrong"
No one's ever loved me like that
Mama cryin' 'cause your love is the kind she always wished I would find
No one's ever loved me like that
No one's ever loved me like that

When I'm a mess or at my best
You're the first thing I don't second guess
I've seen enough and I can say, you're the perfect combination
Of hectic, sexy, and irreverent
And when you tell me we're steady
I know you mean every word of it

No one's ever loved me like that
Three AM in a hospital bed, runnin' high on my meds sayin'
No one's ever loved me like that
Tell me, "No, you don't have to be strong, you're allowed to be wrong"
No one's ever loved me like that
Mama cryin' 'cause your love is the kind she always wished I would find
No one's ever loved me like that
No one's ever loved me like that

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

No one's ever loved me like that
Three AM in a hospital bed, runnin' high on my meds sayin'
No one's ever loved me like that
Tell me, "No, you don't have to be strong, you're allowed to be wrong"
No one's ever loved me like that
Mama cryin' 'cause your love is the kind she always wished I would find
No one's ever loved me like that
No one's ever loved me like that

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

No one's ever loved me like that
