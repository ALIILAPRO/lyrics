		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  W4ddles made the beat
I ain't come to mess around
Think I got a bounty I'm the baddest in my town
LBJ walk around with a crown
Bout to pop off matter fact get down
Can't participate I'll attract a whole crowd
Went up being me I done made my momma proud
If it's me and a baddie it might get a little loud
Just gotta let you know (Heads up)

Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body

First of all let's go to work
Back it up hop in reverse
She'll eat it up for a berk
And then, still leave some room for dessert
Girl, try not to move your body
I put in work like a colleague
She popped a squat like an Ollie
Then things got totally gnarly
So hotty, like Scotty
Want to party all night like Miley
Say she like bad boys Mike Lowry
Watch me put her on cam iCARLY
I like ranch but I'm stacking blue cheese
It's not a person who could stop me, wemby
I don't fear no man just test me
Gather up the whole gang like One Piece

Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body
Move yo body

Coming in yeah, he coming in (Go)
Coming in yeah, he (BODY)

Pat pat pat pat tap tap (YUH)
Pat pat pat pat  BODY)
What you working with girl what you working with
What you working with girl what you (BODY)

Get it get it get it turn up (let's go) all I wanna see you do is turn up (let's go)

Shouts out Ukraine

Shouts out Ukraine

Shouts out Ukraine
