		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poured my heart into a crowd
Didn't lift me up, just pulled me down
Now I'm dancin' on my own (mm-mm)
Fingertips are gettin' numb
Overthinkin' everything I've done
No more numbers in my phone

Oh, I used to think that they were right
On my side they wouldn't lie
So done with that
D-done with that
Talkin' shit behind my back
Build a castle made of glass
So done with that
(D-done with that)

I'm a fire burnin' on
I do what the hell I want
Middle finger to the sky
With my head held high
I am fearless, I am strong
Watch me rise along the dawn
Ain't no stoppin' me this time
Got my head held high

I was born to be alive
No more cryin' here tonight
I will never be this young (mh)
Kill the darkness in my mind
Grind the blade and raise the knife
'Cause I've only just begun

Oh, I used to think that they were right
On my side they wouldn't lie
So done with that
D-done with that
Talkin' shit behind my back
Build a castle made of glass
So done with that
(D-done with that)

I'm a fire burnin' on
I do what the hell I want
Middle finger to the sky
With my head held high
I am fearless, I am strong
Watch me rise along the dawn
Ain't no stoppin' me this time
Got my head held high

Used to think that they were right
On my side they wouldn't lie
(I'm done with that)
(I'm done with that) Oh, yeah, I'm

I'm a fire burnin' on
I do what the hell I want
Middle finger to the sky
With my head held high
I am fearless, I am strong
Watch me rise along the dawn
Ain't no stoppin' me this time
Got my head
I'm a fire burnin' on
I do what the hell I want
Middle finger to the sky
With my head held high
I am fearless, I am strong
Watch me rise along the dawn
Ain't no stoppin' me this time
Got my head held high
