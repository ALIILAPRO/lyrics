		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're near me I have difficulty respirating
When you're near me I have difficulty concentrating
When you're near me I have difficulty standing upright
When you're near me I have difficulty sleeping at night

I used to stand proud like a sphinx
In a noble immovable state
Then your heart nailed me under a jinx
Now I'm feeling like a jellyfish

Just a spineless wobbly jellyfish
And it's great, great, so great
I used to stand high like a pine
Just a piece of emotionless wood

When you put your body near mine
Now I'm feeling like a jellyfish
And it's good, good, so good
I used to be an iceman

Living in iceman town
So I'm warning all you cool cool icemen
You'd better be prepared to be melted right down
Down

When you're near me I have difficulty
