		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a little taste of your love the other day
And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
Then I see you wanna go down the other way
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Baby, I don't wanna play pretend
Either you want me or you don't
You want me or we go back to being friends

Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?

I can't keep giving you so much and getting back so little
I can't keep borrowing you a full cup and getting back just dribbles
Hmm, it don't work for me
Oh, baby, don't treat me this way

Lately, I feel like your love's pretend
Either you want me or you don't
You want me or we go back to being friends

Will I see you again? (Oh)
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again? (Oh)
Will I see you again?

'Cause I could be so good to you
If you would just take that chance (ooh)
Said I could be so good to you
If you would just jump that fence, baby (ooh)
Said I could be so good to you
If you would just take that chance (ooh)
Said I could be so good to you
If you would just jump that fence, hey
Ooh-ooh

Will I see you again? (Baby)
Will I see you again? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Won't you let me in your heart?
Will I see you again? (Oh)
Will I see you again? (Baby, yeah)
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
