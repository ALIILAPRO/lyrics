		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue eyed dressed for every situation 
Moving through the doorway of a nation 
Pick me up and shake the doubt 
Baby I can't do without 

Move out, don't mess around 
Move out, you bring me down 
Move out, how you get about 
Don't make a sound just move out 

I remember only for an hour 
Move right through me can you feel the power 
I don't know what's going on 
It scares me but it won't be long 

Move out, don't mess around 
Move out, you bring me down 
Move out, how you get about 
Don't make a sound just move out

Now he's in control he is my lover 
Nations stand against him he's your brother 
Been a long time, been a long time now 
I'll get to you somehow 

Move out, don't mess around 
Move out, you bring me down 
Move out, how you get about 
Don't make a sound just move out

Move out, don't mess around 
Move out, you bring me down 
Move out, how you get about 
Don't make a sound just move out
