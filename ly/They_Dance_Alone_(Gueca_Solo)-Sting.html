		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why are these women here dancing on their own? 
Why is there this sadness in their eyes? 
Why are the soldiers here 
Their faces fixed like stone? 
I can't see what it is they despise 
Dancing with the missing 
They're dancing with the dead 
They dance with the invisible ones 
Their anguish is unsaid 
They're dancing with their fathers 
They're dancing with their sons 
Dancing with their husbands 
They dance alone
They dance alone

The only form of protest they're allowed 
I've seen their silent faces, they scream so loud 
If they were to speak these words 
They'd go missing, too 
Another woman on the torture table 
What else can they do?
Dancing with the missing 
They're dancing with the dead 
They dance with the invisible ones 
Their anguish is unsaid 
They're dancing with their fathers 
Dancing with their sons 
They're dancing with their husbands 
They dance alone 
They dance alone 

One day we'll dance on their graves 
One day we'll sing our freedom 
One day we'll laugh in our joy 
And we'll dance 
One day we'll dance on their graves 
One day we'll sing our freedom 
One day we'll laugh in our joy 
And we'll dance 

Ellas danzan con los desaparecidos 
Danzan con los muertos 
Danzan con amores invisibles 
Con silenciosa angistia 
Danzan con sus padres 
Con sus hijos 
Con sus esposos 
Ellas danzan solas 
Danzan solas 

Hey Mr. Pinochet 
You've sown a bitter crop 
It's foreign money that supports you 
One day the money's going to stop 
No wages for your torturers 
No budget for your guns 
Can you think of your own mother 
Dancing with her invisible son 
Dancing with the missing 
Dancing with the dead 
They dance with the invisible ones 
Their anguish is unsaid 
Dancing with their fathers 
Dancing with their sons 
Dancing with their husbands 
They dance alone 
They dance alone

One day we'll dance on their graves 
One day we'll sing our freedom 
One day we'll laugh in our joy 
And we'll dance 
One day we'll dance on their graves 
One day we'll sing our freedom 
One day we'll laugh in our joy 
And we'll dance 

And we'll dance
(And we'll dance) we'll dance
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
(And we'll dance)
