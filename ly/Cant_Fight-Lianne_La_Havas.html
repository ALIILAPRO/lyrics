		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems that I won't be warned
And certainly, I saw a sign
I raged like a woman scorned
But something about you got me gone
You're pulling me back and now I'm going under

A little peace, a little love
A little bit, is that enough?
I can't fight away this love
I knew that I should give you up
I tried to run but got my heart stuck
I can't fight away this love
Can't fight away this love

The things that I want and need
But they always seem to be at odds with me
Oh, why?
When did Heaven get this heavy?
Everything's right until it's wrong
But something about you feels like home
Oh, baby, you know that you got me gone
You're pulling me back and now I'm going under, oh

A little peace, a little love
A little bit, is that enough?
I can't fight away this love
I knew that I should give it up
I tried to run but got my heart stuck
I can't fight away this love
Can't fight away this love

A little peace, a little love
A little bit, is that enough?
I can't fight away this love
I knew that I should give you up
I tried to run but got my heart stuck (I tried to run)
I can't fight away this love
Can't fight away this love

Can't, can't fight away this love
Can't fight away this love
Can't fight away this love (can't)
I knew that I should give you up (can't fight, can't fight)
(I can't fight away this love)
I tried to run but got my heart stuck
I can't fight away this love
(Can't fight away, can't fight away)
Can't fight away this love
This love
