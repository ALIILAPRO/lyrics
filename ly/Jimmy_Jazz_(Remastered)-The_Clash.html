		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said, "he ain't here, but he sure went past
Oh, you're looking for Jimmy Jazz"

Satta Massagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and chop off his head
Police come looking for Jimmy Jazz

So if you're gonna take a message 'cross this town
Maybe put it down somewhere over the other side
See it gets to Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, say

Now tell the tale
Police come in they said
"Now, where's Jimmy Jazz?"
I said, "hmm, he was here but, uh, he said, he went out
Who is it they're lookin' for?"
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz eh

Satta Massagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and they'll chop off his head
Oh, you're lookin' for
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

What a relief
I feel like a soldier
Look like a thief
It's for the Jazz

Police come lookin' for the Jimmy Jazz
He came in and he went out
'Cause now they'll get him hanged for that
Jimmy Jazz, Jimmy Jazz

In fact
Don't you bother me, not anymore
I can't take this tale, oh, no more
It's all around
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz

Z, Z, Z, Z
J-A-Z-Z, Z, Z, Z
J-A-Z-Z, J-A-Z-Z
J-A-Z, Jimmy Jazz
And then it sucks
He said, "suck that"

So go look all around, you can try your luck, brother
And see what you found
But I guarantee you that it ain't your day
Your day, it ain't your day
Chop, chop
