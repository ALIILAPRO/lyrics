		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What have I done?
Where have I come from?
When I burnt the backs with the sun through a glass
Did I seal the loss that's become me?

Feeling undone
What have I become?
When I turned my back on you
I turned my back on myself
And became this machine

Thoughtlessness (I feel)
Selfishness
Hopelessness (I feel)
Arrogant (I feel)

I feel it on the inside (inside)
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again

Still feel you on the inside (inside)
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Shadows in the sun filter through us
Still wrestle the demons
That arrested me as a child, confession rejected
We grow up to give up
People step on the cracks
For wounds owed, paid back
Through the words of surrender

Emptiness (I feel)
Loneliness
Listlessness (I feel)
Worthless (I feel)

I feel it on the inside (inside)
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside (inside)
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Oh, can you save me from myself? (Myself)
From these memories
Oh, can you save me from myself? (Myself)
From these memories

Surrender to the shadows
Haunting inside
Bleed through you
Surrender to the secrets, inside
Lies within you

I feel it on the inside (inside)
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again (inside)
Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Can't feel you on the inside (inside)
Set down the bag and left it
Lost memory has left me, one again
Open up the inside (inside)
Admission for the cleansing
Now that I've forgotten to remember

Surrender to the shadows
Haunting inside
Bleed through you
