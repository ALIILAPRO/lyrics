		  No cap and gown, I ain't go to class
I rather die before I come in last

I ain't felt like this in a long time
I ain't felt like this in a long time
I ain't have shit in a long time
Just to feel like this it took a long time (yeah)
Just to feel like this it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this it took a long time (yeah)

Hold up, I'm tryna do something right now
Just leave me alone
Just to feel like this it took a long time

Blue black jean jacket, yeah
Got VLONE on me, yeah
Got this bad ass bitch, yeah
Wanna fuck me and my homie, yeah
Got this bad ass bitch, yeah
Tryna fuck me and my homie, yeah
Shorty gon' suck 'til the morning, yeah
I can't wife no thotties, yeah
Pass that bih to the homie, yeah
I just fucked your thottie, yeah
I ain't even pass her to homie, yeah, huh
We might rob your homies
We might rob your homies
We might rob your homies
I'd rather get caught with it than without it
Wake up and smell the motherfuckin' coffee
I'm 'bout to put these boys in a coffin

I ain't feel like this in a long time
I ain't feel like this in a long time
I ain't had shit in a long time
Just to feel like this, it took a long time (yeah)
Just to feel like this, it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)

No cap and gown, I ain't go to class
I'd rather die before I come in last

I ain't had shit in a long time
I ain't felt like this in a long time
I ain't felt like this in a long time
I ain't have shit in a long time
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)

I ain't had shit in a long time
I ain't had shit in a long time
I ain't had shit in a long time
I ain't had shit in a long time
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)
Just to look like this, it took a long time (yeah)
