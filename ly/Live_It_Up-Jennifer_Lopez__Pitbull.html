		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the streets of miami
To presenting at the Grammys
Con el muslito de Jennifer
Maybe now you understand me

Clap your hands, go clap your hands

Mr Worldwide
Redone
And the beautiful Jennifer Lopez
Dale

We don't believe in defeat
That's why we're back for a three-peat
Hi Jenny, mira que esta loco,
Yo me lo como como pastelito coco
I get on stupid on a beach, she wowo
I got mamis, mamis by the boatload
Yo tengo la carne, y ella el mojo
I'm saying dale, she's screaming YOLO
She's little red riding hood, and guess who's the lobo, me la como
Who's name is globally known,
Who's name's on a check, and they adding an O
Who's name is on the Blimp with the world is yours
Who's name is on schools, huh
Slam for sure,
I know it's
Hard to understand how a boy grew to a man, man turned to a brand
But guess what here I am
Jenny from the block, let's rock

You push me harder
I do the same
Boy wanna feel ya
In every way
Don't even wonder
It's just a game
We rocking body to body, let's go insane
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow

Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up,
So live it up, live it up, go, oh
And we ain't stopping till we done, live it up oh
So live it up, live it up, go go go go go go go go go

Make love, don't fight
Let's fuck tonight

Let's fuck tonight

Turn up this motha' and let it play
I know you like my bumper
Don't be ashamed
Don't even wonder,
It's just a game
We rocking body to body, let's go insane
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow

Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up,
So live it up, live it up, go, oh
And we ain't stopping till we done, live it up
So live it up, live it up, go go go go go go go go go

Make love, don't fight,
Let's fuck tonight

Let's fuck tonight

You name it she's done it
She's the reason that women run it
Bet this on a Grammy
Maybe now you understand me

(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)

Oh, we can do anything we want, live it up
So live it up, live it up, go, oh
And we ain't stopping till we done, live it up
So live it up, live it up, go go go go go go go (Let's fuck tonight)

(Let's fuck tonight)
