		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You in gang territory, police wearin' green suits
Top model on the magazine, they just want powder they can toot
I'm out the trenches, bitches know I get flyer than a parachute
Fuck that bitch, I hit her bottom and top for a pair of shoes
I'm affiliated with them ones that's gon' bring hell through
Pour a 4 in a 16, I'm a real nigga, stand up
I throw on seven tennis bracelets just to go gamble
I'm a real street nigga, therefore I'm hard to handle

A mill 'cash in all twenties, shit look real sloppy
Introduce the world to juggin', let these rappers copy
All this ice all over my body, never play hockey
While the weed growin', I'm chillin' in the mountains, hikin'
I'm always ballin' in New York but never been to Dyckman
Twenty racks for when I stand, I don't need a bitch to like me
All I want is money, nothing else excite me
I get checks, no Nike, but I got plug prices
The streets hot, they spinnin' shit like a ceiling fan
If you get caught up, don't you tell to get up out the jam
Zone 1 and 6 in Atlanta, shit like Gangland
Everybody goin' crazy for the Freebandz

You in gang territory, police wearin' green suits
Top model on the magazine, they just want powder they can toot
I'm out the trenches, bitches know I get flyer than a parachute
Fuck that bitch, I hit her bottom and top for a pair of shoes
I'm affiliated with them ones that's gon' bring hell through
Pour a 4 in a 16, I'm a real nigga, stand up
I throw on seven tennis bracelets just to go gamble
I'm a real street nigga, therefore I'm hard to handle

Told my bitch to leave me 'lone, go home and count up some racks
I'm a certified street nigga, can't have me lookin' whack
When I come through I'm on two pills, slam that shit from the back
I got straight hair around my finger, hit her good then give her a check
I'm a rude nigga, I get screwed up and might buy a bitch a Ghost
I got two Glocks and the Drac on me at all times, I tote
Told her drive that double R, told her how to whip it like a boat
Got some shit from out of Paris, hittin' a whippet, doin' coke
Kickin' down a nigga door and then I took off out of sight
It's so hard for Pluto to love you, I been around prostitutes all my life
I was six years old, stand outdoors, seen a nigga nose get wiped
Grew up in that 6, a nigga get your bitch then fuck your wife
I been rock so many diamonds, think VVS's in my vein
I got bitches that can't post me so I throw 'em a lil' chain
She a real one. she gon' go all out about me like my gang
Got a her new bust down foreign and I don't even claim her (Pluto)

You in gang territory, police wearin' green suits
Top model on the magazine, they just want powder they can toot
I'm out the trenches, bitches know I get flyer than a parachute
Fuck that bitch, I hit her bottom and top for a pair of shoes
I'm affiliated with them ones that's gon' bring hell through
Pour a 4 in a 16, I'm a real nigga, stand up
I throw on seven tennis bracelets just to go gamble
I'm a real street nigga, therefore I'm hard to handle

I'm a real street nigga, therefore I'm hard to handle
I'm a real street nigga, therefore I'm hard to handle
