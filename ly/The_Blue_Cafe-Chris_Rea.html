		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My world is miles of endless roads
That leaves a trail of broken dreams
Where have you been
I hear you say?

I will meet you at the Blue Cafe
Because, this is where the one who knows
Meets the one who does not care
The cards of fate

The older shows
To the younger one, who dares to take
The chance of no return

Where have you been?
Where are you going to?
I want to know what is new
I want to go with you

What have you seen?
What do you know that is new?
Where are you going to?
Because I want to go with you

So meet me down at the Blue Cafe

The cost is great, the price is high
Take all you know, and say goodbye
Your innocence, inexperience
Mean nothing now

Because, this is where the one who knows
Meets the one that does not care
Where have you been?
I hear you say
I'll meet you at the Blue Cafe

So meet me at the Blue Cafe
