Follow my instructions
There is no
Time for introductions

He was the one that made us
You'll be the one to save us

Underground
Welcome to the circus
Power down
Are you feeling nervous?

His voice means to deceive you
My voice just wants to lead you

Below the surface
Built without purpose
Did we deserve this?
You're here to serve

Daddy, please
We all scream for ice cream
This machine
Will help you with the brain freeze

The stage lights up with controlled shocks
So tighten up all your spring locks

Through the vent
Keeping your composure
Hold your breath
Something's creeping closer

There's no one left to find you
I'll take your place inside you

Below the surface
Built without purpose
Did we deserve this?
You're here to serve us

I'll take your place behind the mask
Then I'll be first and you'll be last
Yeah, you'll be last
