		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're gonna have a baby
Thinking about Texas
I dreamt I was pregnant
I woke up with my guard down

You were next door with Gigi
Cocktails for breakfast
Walking her groceries back to the main house
You kissed her fragile hands in the sunlight
Cried in my arms and woke up in the backyard
And when you get passive, I like to imagine
You listening to worship songs on your iPod

I've never been this bad
Can I tell you something?
I've never felt so unworthy of loving
I hope you marry the girl from your hometown
And I'll fucking kill her
And I'll fucking freak out

I've got a letter still in my backpack
It's from the St. Paul Police Department
They wanna give me my state ID back
They gave me a number but I haven't called it
Remember we searched all night when I lost it?
I thought about lying when I found my passport
'Cause I would've stayed kinda drunk and afraid in your room
'Til I died in your room if you asked for it

I've never been this bad
Can I tell you something?
I've never felt so unworthy of loving
I hope you marry the girl from your hometown
And I'll fucking kill her
And I'll fucking freak out
