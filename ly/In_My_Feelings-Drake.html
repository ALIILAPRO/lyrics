This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yup

Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya (let's go, let's go, let's go)
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding? (You're the only one I love)
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when you get to shoppin' you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
Trapmoneybenny
I buy you champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya (let's go, let's go, let's go)
And I'm down for you always
JT, do you love me? Are you riding? (You're the only one I love)
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

Two bad bitches and we kissin' in a Wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in a Wraith, kiss-kissin' in a Wraith
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
I show him how the neck work
Fuck that Netflix and chill, what's your net-net-net worth?

'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always (yeah, yeah)
And I'm down for you always (yeah, yeah)
And I'm down for you always
D-Down for you always
D-D-Down for you always
(I got a new boy, and that nigga trade)

Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding? (You're the only one I love)
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me (pop-pop that ass, pop that ass)
'Cause I want you, and I need you (pop, pop, pop-pop)
And I'm down for you always (let's go, let's go)
KB, do you love me? Are you riding? (You're the only one I love)
Say you'll never ever leave (pop-pop that ass, pop that ass)
From beside me, 'cause I want ya, and I (pop-pop that ass, pop that ass, pop)

Skate and smoke and rap, now let me see you
Bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back (pop that ass, pop-pop that ass)
B-Bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back (pop that ass, pop-pop that ass)
Now let me see you
Young nigga that she with can't hit (pop that, pop that, pop that)
But shawty, I'ma hit it, hit it like I can't miss (pop that, pop, pop, pop)
Now let me see you
(Pop that ass, you're the only one I love)
Now let me see you
(Pop that ass, pop-pop that ass)
Bring that ass back
Now let me see you (clap that ass, you're the only one I love)
Now let me see you
Now let me see you (let's go, let's go)
Now let me see you (bring that ass back)

Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
I just gotta be real with it, yup

(Blaqnmild, you a genius, you diggin' me?)

"What are y'all talkin' about?"
"You know what? I don't even care, I need a photo with Drake
Because my Instagram is weak as fuck"
"What are you talkin' about?"
"I'm just being real, my shit look"
