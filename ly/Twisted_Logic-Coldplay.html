		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunlight, opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
It opened them up
And tonight, rivers will run dry
But not for the first time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers
Looking for life on Earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to?
It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards, again
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, again
You'll go forwards

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards
