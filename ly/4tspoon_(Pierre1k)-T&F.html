		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Peace I'm at my peace
Peace I'm at my peace
Peace I'm at my peace
Peace
Ma think I'm out in the streets
Giving these hoes some relief
Yeah yeah
I live in my bag so fuck what you mean
I did what I had to get what I need
But fuck what I had I know what I need
I stopped moving fast and let myself breath
I stopped getting mad at the littlest things
Yeah
And started to laugh at the similar things
Now you couldn't tell me to quit if you wanted
I flipped 50 cents, went ahead and did something
I been off the grid, Where he go?
I ain't rushin'
I swear ima shit on you hoes when I'm bussin'
I finally feel like I've grown and I love it
I been at my lowest
Back when I was posting my feelings
On snap just to see if they cared
2000 baby I'm only 18
And a Christian but surely I'm giving them hell
Thank god my life didn't play out in jail
My personal legend's to better myself
I been had this monster inside of my spirit
But I had to see it up close for myself
Freed it with bail
I looked in the mirror
Repeated I got this
I got this
Including myself
Bitch
Made peace with myself
Peace I'm at my peace
Peace I'm at my peace
Peace I'm at my peace
Peace
Ma think I'm mobbin' the streets
Giving these hoes some relief
Yeah yeah
I live in my bag so fuck what you mean
I did what I had to get what I need
But fuck what I had I know what I need
I stopped moving fast and let myself breath
Stopped getting mad at the littlest things
And started to laugh at the similar things
Now you couldn't tell me to quit if you wanted
I'll flipped 50 cents, went ahead and did something
I been off the grid, Where he go?
I aint rushin'
I swear ima shit on you hoes when I'm bussin'
I finally feel like I've grown and I love it
Yeah yeah
Peace I'm at my peace
