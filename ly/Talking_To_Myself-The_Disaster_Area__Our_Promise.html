		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will we keep on waiting
For the end to  come
Will our lives be jaded
Til the morning sun

Look into my face
Where you at now?
While our dream is racing by
Will you come around?

Will you ever feel this way?

Talking to myself but no one is listening
Am I speaking in tongues?
The silence is deafening

The sound is drowned out
Gets lost in echoes
What we have built hanging in gallows

Talking to myself
Are you listening?

My voice is lost within

How long will we keep on waiting
When it feels like the end has come
Our lives been breaking
Into pieces for too long
My screams are running out of breath now
Our dreams been dead have you been around
You will never feel this way

Calling out but can´t make myself heard
Silence is drowning out every word
Lost myself everything seems so blurred
How can I make my voice heard?
Calling out but can´t make myself heard
Feels like I´m choking on every word
Blinded by the silence all I see is blurred
My voice is lost within
