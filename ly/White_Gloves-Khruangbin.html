		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh)

She was a queen
She had a house
She was a fighter
She was a queen
Had a good dude
Brought me a rabbit
She was a queen
Wearing white gloves
But she kept 'em clean
Classy lady
But she wasn't quiet
She was a queen

(Ooh)

One day she was gone
She died in a fight
'Cause she was a fighter
But she was a queen

(Ooh)
She was a queen

She was a queen
(Ooh)
She was a queen
(Ooh)
