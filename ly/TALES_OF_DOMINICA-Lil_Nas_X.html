		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me
Feel like there's only now

I've been livin' at my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been livin' on an island made from faith
Can't go runnin' back to home, I can't face her face

(Oh)
Finally grown (grown)
Ain't nothin' like I hoped it would be
Out on my own (own)
I'm floatin' in an oceanless sea
Could I be wrong? (Wrong)
Was everybody right about me?
Scary things in my head
I can't dream, and I just

Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more (ooh)
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me
Feel like there's only now

I've been livin' at my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been livin' on an island made from faith
Can't go runnin' back to home, I can't face her face

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
