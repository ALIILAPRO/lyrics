		  There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
No there is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself

Never wanted to dance with nobody not you
Never wanted to dance with nobody but you
Never wanted to dance with nobody but you
Wouldn't take no for an answer you fucking bitch

Be nice
Be nice to me don't let me bleed
Be nice
Be nice to me don't let me go (don't let me go)
I am to cool for the second grade
I'm amazed I'm afraid
I am to cool for the second grade
There is nothing you can do
That I have not already done to myself

Hey

There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
No there is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself

Never wanted to dance with nobody not you
Never wanted to dance with nobody but you
Never wanted to dance with nobody but you
Wouldn't take no for an answer you fucking bitch

Be nice
Be nice to me don't let me bleed
Be nice
Be nice to me
Don't let me go (don't let me go)
I am to cool for the second grade
I'm amazed I'm afraid
I am to cool for the second grade
There is nothing you can do
That I have not already done to myself

Never wanted to dance with nobody But you 
Wouldn't take no for an answer you fucking bitch
Never wanted to dance with nobody not you
Never wanted to dance with nobody but you
Never wanted to dance with nobody But you 
Wouldn't take no for an answer you fucking bitch
