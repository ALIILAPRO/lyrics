		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's my day one, she like to have fun
Lil' super freak, she got that dump, dump
That's my day one, she like to have fun
Lil' super freak, she got that dump, dump
Whoa (whoa)
Dump, dump
Whoa (whoa)
Dump, dump

Bitch, I'm a star, lunar
No post by the bar, they know we are
Whoever said that I wouldn't make it far
It say it's my time on my Audemars
Hey, girl, come here, girl
Get introduced to my world
I like my girls in plural
She on my nut, she a squirrel
Ayy, what's your name?
Who you with? Glad you came
Can I buy you a diamond chain?
Treat it like it's a wedding ring, yeah

That's my day one, she like to have fun
Lil' super freak, she got that dump, dump
That's my day one, she like to have fun
Lil' super freak, she got that dump, dump
Whoa (whoa)
Dump, dump
Whoa (whoa)
Dump, dump

My bitch, underrated
Your bitch, overrated
She goin' X-rated
It's a sex party and I'm glad I made it
She gon' eat it up like feed me, baby
Now please stand up, you the real Slim Shadu
Let's get tricky, faded, naked
She break my heart, achy, breaky
My niggas goin' crazy
My section goin' brazy
That ass shakin', bakin'
That's your only obligation tonight

That's my day one, she like to have fun
Lil' super freak, she got that dump, dump
That's my day one, she like to have fun
Lil' super freak, she got that dump, dump
Whoa (whoa)
Dump, dump
Whoa (whoa)
Dump, dump
