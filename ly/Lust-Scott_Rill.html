		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nah' I don't usually smoke, but the night feel right
And I don't usually drink, but the lights so bright
But I'm scared of too much, but that'll light this place
She said "You can get it", so you know the right price
Lotta' time babygirl, could be somebody you love
They're really tryna' move slow, she told me "Nah', I don't rush"
I threw them dollar in the air, but I know I can't touch
I let 'em know champagne, I'm ashamed of the the thing that we know is lust, but I need it by tonight

Bottles, it rainin' so slowly
But it doesn't matter, I'm in too deep, and I know

Nah' I don't usually smoke, but the night feel right
And I don't usually drink, but the lights so bright
But I'm scared of too much, but that'll light this place
She said "You can get it", so you know the right price

Nah' I don't usually smoke, but the night feel right
And I don't usually drink, but the lights so bright
But I'm scared of too much, but that'll light this place
She said "You can get it", so you know the right price
Lotta' time babygirl, could be somebody you love
They're really tryna' move slow, she told me "Nah', I don't rush"
I threw them dollar in the air, but I know I can't touch
I let 'em know champagne, I'm ashamed of the the thing that we know is lust, but I need it by tonight

They're really tryna' move slow, she told me "Nah', I don't rush"
I threw them dollar in the air, but I know I can't touch
I let 'em know champagne, I'm ashamed of the the thing that we know is lust, but I need it by tonight

Nah' I don't usually smoke, but the night feel right
And I don't usually drink, but the lights so bright
But I'm scared of too much, but that'll light this place
She said "You can get it", so you know the right price
Lotta' time babygirl, could be somebody you love
They're really tryna' move slow, she told me "Nah', I don't rush"
I threw them dollar in the air, but I know I can't touch
I let 'em know champagne, I'm ashamed of the the thing that we know is lust, but I need it by tonight
