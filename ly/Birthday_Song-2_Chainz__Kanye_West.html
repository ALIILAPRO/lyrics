		  Yeah
Birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that Louis store

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die, bury me inside that Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside that Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr, scrr, wrists moving, cookin' to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a juug, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrt! hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer goin' on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm ballin', you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, 2 everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to 2 bitches

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die, bury me inside that Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside that Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh?
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh?
She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh?
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T.V. on
Y'all been together ten years, you deserve a m√©nage
'Specially if you put that BMW in her garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the Weston?"
How 'bout she hit the 'West Inn' and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
'Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die, bury me inside that Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside that Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the Mercys')
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl
I might switch it up and get you girl

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die, bury me inside that Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside that Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

Deuce and Ye
We like Snoop and Dre
Isn't this your birthday, baby?
You deserve a coupe today

(You in first place, you in first place)
(Bad bitches contest you in first place!)
