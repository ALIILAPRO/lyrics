		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Help me understand you love
Help me go the way you want me to go
'Cause I can't guess the things that you're thinking 
So help me understand you love
Tell me everything you want me to know
'Cause I can't fix it 'til I know that it's broken

Tell me you, tell me you do
Tell me you don't
Tell me you will
Then tell me you won't
Mmm baby
Tell me you, tell me you do
Tell me you don't
Tell me you will
Then tell me you won't, mmm

Tell me what you want
So I can understand your love

Help me understand you love
'Cause you're going 'bout this all the wrong way
And I can't figure out what you wanna say
Help me understand you love
Everyday you got a different excuse
For why you can't just come and tell me the truth

Tell me you, tell me you do
Tell me you don't
Tell me you will
Then tell me you won't
Oh baby
Tell me you, tell me you do
Tell me you don't
Tell me you will
Then tell me you won't
Can't take it

Tell me what you want
So I can understand your love

It's all out of my hands
I don't understand
'Cause I know you won't talk to me
Know you won't talk to me
And I'm right here standing my ground
But I'll walk out if you're never gon' talk to me
Never gon' talk to me

Tell me you, tell me you do
Tell me you don't
Tell me you will
Then tell me you won't
Oh baby
Tell me you, tell me you do
Tell me you don't
Tell me you will
Then tell me you won't
Can't take it

Oh, tell me what you want
So I can understand your love, help me understand you love
