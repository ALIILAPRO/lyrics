		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-woah

Woo (hit the weave)

Is it so hard to say the same thing?
And you're so weak to say the same thing
Burn a hole into your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me
Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you (love you)
And tomorrow you won't care

Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you (precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond (all the way)
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond
I leave it all to you (oh)
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
Let it come to you (shine for me, me)

You're in love with something bigger than love (something bigger)
You believe in something stronger than trust (than love)
Wanderlust
Wanderlust (oh)

Don't you shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
I'm on your side
Don't patronize
You know tonight
Is the only time we'll have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time?
'Cause tonight, we'll be right here
And tomorrow you won't care

Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
I leave it all to you (precious little diamond, I leave it all to you)
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond, ooh-hoo)
Precious little, precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you (I leave it all to you, to you)
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
Let it come to you 

You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

They're in love with this idea of love (ooh, they're in love, idea of love)
It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust

I want to leave it all, girl (precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you (precious little diamond)
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
Let it come to you (ow, hoo, ow, hoo, ow, hoo)
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
I leave it all to you 
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
Let it come to you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Precious little diamond (ooh)
I leave it all to you (ooh)
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
Let it come to you (precious little diamond)
Precious little, precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
I leave it all to you (I leave it all to you)
Precious little diamond (precious little diamond)
Let it come to you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Precious little diamond
