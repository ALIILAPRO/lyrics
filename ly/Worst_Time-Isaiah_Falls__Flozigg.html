		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night you told me you love me
For the first time
You chose the worst time
Why are you selfish
So selfish
Selfish
So selfish
I killed my ego just to love you better
Your such a Leo
Should have tamed you better
I got myself in this
Love so irrelevant
Girl you get on my nerves
Just for the hell of it
This time around
You not calming me down
If your such a queen
Then baby pick up your crown
I wish you'd fall in love with someone else
I wish you'd give up on what you felt
Baby I'm black and blue
My love
Baby I'm done with you
My love
Love
Last night you told me you loved me
For the first time
You chose the worse time
Why are you selfish
So selfish
Selfish
So selfish
So
So selfish
Why are you selfish
So
So selfish
Why are you selfish
Last night you told me you loved me
For the first time
You chose the worse time
Why are you selfish
So selfish
Selfish
So selfish
So
So selfish
Why are you selfish
So
So selfish
Why are you selfish
