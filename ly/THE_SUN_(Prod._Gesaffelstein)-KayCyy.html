		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)

I don't need the stars, the moon
The world, if you bring me the sun (yeah, uh)
I can be the spark, the start of something
That you really want
I ain't hesitate
Your eyes see further than you really thought
And she don't need no space for me
She'll rather be where I'm at

Yeah, yeah
And I keep her all safe, yeah
I can be your all-state
I can be on my off days (Yeah)
Uh, could you boost my heart rate, mm
Can you make the ground shake?
Yeah, can we do it for God's sake?
Can we do it from miles away?
I can make you feel the way (The way)
I can give you a tidal wave
It's never raining, babe

I don't need the stars, the moon
The world, if you bring me the sun (yeah, uh)
I can be the spark, the start of something
That you really want
I ain't hesitate
Your eyes see further than you really thought
And she don't need no space for me
She'll rather be where I'm at

No more, ain't no more
Nice and alone, 'cause I be right there with you
Can we share the same dreams if I be sleepin' with you?
Picture almost perfect, picture
Came from the skies, you brought a scripture
You sayin' you fly, I'm flyin' with you
If I get a minute, I spare it with you
Hmm, yeah, and you decide
Yeah, if I'm your type of guy
Yeah, open your eyes, yeah
I can be the one you turn to

I don't need the stars, the moon
The world, if you bring me the sun (yeah, uh)
I can be the spark, the start of something
That you really want
I ain't hesitate
Your eyes see further than you really thought
And she don't need no space for me
She'll rather be where I'm at
