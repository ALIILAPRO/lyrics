		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that you’ve packed your thoughts
I’ll wait here for the while
To catch your sideways glance I’ll stab you with this smile

Too scared to be open
I heard that you’re coping

All your pieces are broken
Sing your praises we’re all outspoken

Now that I’ve found my place 
I’ll wait here by the window

To catch your sideways stance 
I’ll stab you in the halo

And I thought that you were there 
And I thought that you still cared.

All your pieces are broken
Sing your praises we’re all outspoken

Sure I’d love to climb above these clouds where I’d be safe and no one else could hear these sounds 
So hold on to hope as she holds to you
And when you fall
You’ll fall
forever

Forever is where we fall
Forever is where we fall
All your pieces are broken
Sing your praises we’re all outspoken
