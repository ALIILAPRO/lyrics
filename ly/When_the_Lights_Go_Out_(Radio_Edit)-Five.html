		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I like that
You know what I mean?
You're looking kind of fly tonight, girl
What's up, check it

Baby, when the lights go out (uh, yeah)
I'll show you what it's all about
Comin' at you, girl, you're gonna like this, girl
Here we go
Check it

I ain't sorry for the way I feel
I know you think I'm being insincere
From the way I'm treatin' you
I never wanted to be so unkind
The only one thing on my mind
Is just kickin' it with you, girl

Baby, it's not the way I feel
You know you must believe me
Baby, it's not part of the deal
Oh, no, no

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me when the lights go out

Ah, yeah, check it, check it out
Second verse, girl

I know you think it may be just a lie
Ain't no good in puttin' up a fight
'Cause my heart is set on you
I see the truth is in your eyes
I ain't fooled by your thin disguise
I can see I'm gettin' through, babe

Girl, don't deny the way you feel
You know you gotta trust me (give me a try)
Give me a chance to prove I'm real
Oh yeah, yeah

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So baby, come to me when the lights go out

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So baby, come to me when the lights go out

When I flick the switch, make your hips wanna dip now
I can get you off 'cause I'm ready and equipped now
Swing for me baby, give me all that you got
Never wanna stop 'cause you make me feel hot
I know what you wanna do and that I feel the same way too
Give you what you want through the days and the nights
Yeah, it's about time that we turned out the light

Yeah, I like that, so what's up, check it

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So baby, come to me when the lights go out

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So baby, come to me when the lights go out

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
