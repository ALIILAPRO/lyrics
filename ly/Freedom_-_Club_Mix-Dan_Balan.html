		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She says love s*cks this way
Another year goes away
Night and day
Night and day 

She hates that feeling
I can't explain
I got a lot of love
Lot of love
Night and day
Night and day
She kills my feelings 

Chorus:
Freedom! Freedom!
All I want is one more night
Freedom!
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait
Not one more minute
Freedom! 

Freedom! Freedom!
All I want is one more night
Freedom!
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait
Not one more minute
Freedom! 

She says show me the way
To all the things that you say
Night and day
Night and day 

She needs that feeling
I won't complain 
I got a lot of love
Lot of love
Night and day
Night and day
She kills my feelings 

Chorus:
Freedom! Freedom!
All I want is one more night
Freedom!
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait
Not one more minute
Freedom! 

Freedom! Freedom!
All I want is one more night
Freedom!
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait
Not one more minute
Freedom! 

Not one more minute!
Not one more minute! 

Let's Go! 

Chorus:
Freedom! Freedom!
All I want is one more night
Freedom!
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait
Not one more minute
Freedom! 

Freedom! Freedom!
All I want is one more night
Freedom!
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait
Not one more minute
Freedom!
