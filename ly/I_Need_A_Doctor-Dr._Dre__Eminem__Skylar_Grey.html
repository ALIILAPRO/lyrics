		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers' ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'
I guarantee they'll scream, "Dre, don't leave us like that man" 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life
