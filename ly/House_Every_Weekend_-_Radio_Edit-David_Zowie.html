		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it comes to house every weekend
When it comes to house every weekend
House every weekend, house every weekend

I love you, there's no need to fake it
But staying in the house every weekend, I just can't take it
I work hard
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode, I just might explode
Let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode, I just might explode

When it comes to house every weekend
House every weekend, house every weekend
I work hard
House every weekend, house every weekend
House every weekend

And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode, I just might explode

House every weekend
I just might explode

House every weekend
I just might explode

I love you, there's no need to fake it
But staying in the house every weekend, I just can't take it
I work hard
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode, I just might explode
Let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode, I just might explode

When it comes to house every weekend
House every weekend, house every weekend
I work hard
House every weekend, house every weekend, house every weekend

And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode, I just might explode

I just might explode, I just might explode
