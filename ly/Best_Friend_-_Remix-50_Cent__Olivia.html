		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh
Yeah 
It's my tape, man (oh)
Listen to my tape
(I've waited, I've waited) I've waited
(Time went by) Yeah, yeah
(All I could do is cry)
(Silly, silly)
Woo

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (girl, promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (uh-huh)
Now, girl, let's not pretend (come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (haha) 
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

First we get to talkin', then we get to touchin'
If we get past the phone games we'll be (uh-huh)
I kiss like the French do, put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it, girl, and pull on your hair
For me, a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink, I improvise, now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool, I know money can't buy me love (haha)

You said that I could call you whenever I needed some one to listen to me
That's why I'm here standing by your side 'cause your always come through for me
So many others tried to be were you are but they just wanted to do me
But you took your time and now I'm satisfied, that's why I want you all to me
'Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me, baby)
Could I be your best friend? I promise, boy, you'll be mine (ooh, baby, be mine)
I said he's just a friend 
Baby, it's not pretend
Either he is or he ain't my man
I said he's just a friend

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (girl, promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (uh-huh)
Now, girl, let's not pretend (come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (haha) 
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

While you in your bubble bath, I'll come wash on your back
When you're puttin' on your lotion, I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from the heart to reflect my style
The slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused when I'm strokin', I could change how you walk
That's the swagger that you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler, I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate, come on

I'm not afraid you explore my body, ooh, give me that feeling 
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD, maybe that sexual healing
You try to sing to me, you're never on the key
But you do it just to appease me
I'd rather spend my time wasting time with you
Ooh, you make it so easy
'Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round all the time)
Could I be your best friend? I promise, boy, you'll be mine (please, baby, be mine, yeah)
I said he's just a friend (oh, oh)
Baby, it's not pretend (no, baby)
Either he is or he ain't my man (no)
I said he's just a friend

We been better than friends
For a long time
Ain't no need to pretend
You'll always be mine

We been better than friends
For a long time
Ain't no flipping or faking
You'll always be mine

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (girl, promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (uh-huh)
Now, girl, let's not pretend (come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (haha) 
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
