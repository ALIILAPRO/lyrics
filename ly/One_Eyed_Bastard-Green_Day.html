		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm making an offer that you cannot deny
You won't be laughing when I'm making you cry
'Cause, ay-oh, I hear the pleas get louder
You son of a bitch, you're gonna beg and cower

Vendetta is a friend of mine
Revenge is sweeter than wine
I never asked to hear your god damned feelings
Get on your knees when you are kissing my ring

Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom

Well, I can remember all the bad memories
I never forget a face that's quite so ugly
Ay-oh, lost years are wasted
I always liked you, but I'm glad that you're all dead

Vendetta is a friend of mine
Revenge is sweeter than wine
I never asked to hear your god damned feelings
Get on your knees when you are kissing my ring

Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom

I'm making an offer that you cannot deny
You won't be laughing when I'm making you cry
'Cause, ay-oh, I hear the pleas get louder
You son of a bitch, you're gonna beg and cower

Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
