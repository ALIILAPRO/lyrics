		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still awake tonight 
Broken up inside
I wanna run but I don't know where to go
I'm calling Your name through the pain
Will You turn Your face to me
I'm crying out I need a miracle

If You could make the sun burn through the night
And You could make the dead man come alive
If You could make the oceans all run dry
Then I know You can change my life
I know You can change my life

I wanna know who You are 
That You can fix my heart
And I don't have to run anymore
Open my eyes let me see
Give me hope and set me free
'Cause I don't wanna be the way I was before

If You could make the sun burn through the night
And You could make the dead man come alive
If You could make the oceans all run dry
Then I know You can change my life
I know You can change my life

Give me something to believe in
Something worth fighting for
Something that I can't ignore

You could make the sun burn through the night
You could make the oceans all run dry

If You could make the sun burn through the night
And You could make the dead man come alive
If You could make the oceans all run dry
Then I know You can change my life
I know You can change my life

I need you to change my life
