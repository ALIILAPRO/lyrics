		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Please don't go, please don't go
Please don't go, please don't go
Please don't go, please don't go
Please don't go, please don't go

Babe, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm going to miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

Please don't go, please don't go

(Please don't go)

Baby, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm going to miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

Please don't go, don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go, don't go
I'm begging you to stay

If you leave at least in my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
By someone as wonderful as you

Please don't go, don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go, don't go
I'm begging you to stay

(Please don't go)

Babe, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm going to miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

Please don't go, don't go
Don't go away
Hey, hey, hey
I need your love, I'm down on my knees

Beggin' please, please, please
Don't go, don't you hear me baby
Don't leave me now, oh, no, no

Don't go, please don't go
I want you to know
That I, I, I, love you so
