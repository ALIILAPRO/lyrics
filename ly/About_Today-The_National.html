		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today
You were far away
And I
Didn't ask you why
What could I say?
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say?

How close am I
To losing you?

Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away

How close am I
To losing you?

Hey, are you awake?
Yeah, I'm right here
Well, can I ask you
About today?

How close am I
To losing you?

How close am I
To losing?
