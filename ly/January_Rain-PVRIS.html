		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always forgive, but I can't forget
I'm stuck in a moment
There's things on my bed
You made permanent
An unspoken omen
Fell from the high
Cried through the nights
But you didn't know it
The psychic was right, a beautiful lie
Lost in emotion

Always knew you would leave me dry, I
Wasn't ready to say goodbye

January rain
It never really goes away
Still remember how you taste
Somewhere in the bitter and the sweet, a dream
Do you think of me?
Standin' in a summer haze
When we were gonna be okay
It'll wash out in the January rain

My eyes are red, the roses are dead
You know I still hold them
You're chasin' me down on my side of town
And now it feels stolen

Always knew you would leave me dry, I
Wasn't ready to say goodbye

January rain
It never really goes away
Still remember how you taste
Somewhere in the bitter and the sweet, a dream
Do you think of me?
Standin' in a summer haze
When we were gonna okay
It'll wash out in the January rain

Always wished we had one more night, so I'd
Think of you in a better light, I'd
Always knew you would leave me dry
Now I'm ready to say goodbye, my
January rain
It never really goes away (goes away, goes away, goes away)

January rain
It never really goes away
Still remember how you taste
Somewhere in the bitter and the sweet, a dream
Do you think of me?
Standin' in a summer haze
When we were gonna okay
It'll wash out in the January rain
