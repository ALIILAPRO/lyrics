		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One for the money, yes sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin' good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up, now everyday we looked up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go 'round, tryna catch that feelin'
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writin' rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowin' that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop, like "Freeze"
We makin' the crowd move, but we not makin' no G's, and that's a no-no (yeah, uh)

Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin'
Niggas say mothafuck that playin', they payin', we stayin' layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they makin' big noise"
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me, I'm out this bitch

Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors

Uh, back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Lookin' to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smokin' them white girls, before them blunts, got crunk, chunky asses
Passes gettin' thrown like Hail Mary's, and they lookin' like Halle Berry's
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin' wine
We's just chillin', I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin' freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, "Mama, I want to sin'
But mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin' dick now"
We movin' on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82, me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Yeah, yeah, like this, East Point and we gone

Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors

Got stopped at the mall the other day, heard a call from the other way
That I just came from, some nigga was sayin' somethin', talkin' 'bout
(Smoke somethin') "Ayy man, you remember me from school?"
"No not really", but he kept smilin' like a clown, facial expression lookin' silly
And he kept askin' me, "What kinda car you drive? I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made"
And I replied that I had been goin' through the same thin's that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man, but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat, like you live check-to-check
If you don't move your feet then I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue (continue)

Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors

Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors

Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up, slammin' Cadillac doors
