		  Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Held you for a little while
My oh, my oh, my
Held you for a little while
My oh, my oh, my

Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Held you for a little while (held you for a little while)
My oh, my oh, my
Held you for a little while (held you for a little while)
My oh, my oh, my 

All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
Held you for a little while (held you for a little while)
My oh, my oh, my
Held you for a little while (held you for a little while)
My oh, my oh, my 

Wasn't hard to love you
I didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Held you for a little while (held you for a little while)
My oh, my oh, my
Held you for a little while (held you for a little while)
My oh, my oh, my
