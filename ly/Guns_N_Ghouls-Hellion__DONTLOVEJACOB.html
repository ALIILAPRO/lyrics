		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here lay the ashes of your carcass
Baby I'll take it all at fault
We fell too far apart
Memories of the better road
I missed the only exit
Way too late to admits our wrongs
Here to finish what I started
So baby you can close the door
I'll play pretend
Play pretend
If it's one way I can feel again
It's paper thin
The will I have to love is gone
Losing grip
Do i cross you mind at all
I'd love to know if you could save me from myself

Oh You don't really wanna talk it out
Rather spend the night fighting
About shit way too out of your control
Fuel it up like a fire
Baby if you never truly knew
What you wanted to begin with
Why would you still keep me around
What's the message you were sending

I see through you
Guns and ghouls
Lost in space and time
An unknown cause
Baby take my life
What's left if any
It ends tonight
Let the curtains call
