		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (When you love somebody)
(When you love somebody)
Got to let somebody 

We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh, my other, oh, my friend

We talked around in circles and
We talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again

All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now without you, what on earth am I to do?

When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain

And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
(Yeah)

Oh-oh-oh
No, no, no
Oh-oh-oh
No, no, no
Oh-oh-oh
No, no, no
Oh
No, no, no
Oh-oh-oh
No, no, no
Oh
No, no, no
Oh-oh-oh
No, no, no
Oh
No, no, no
Oh-oh-oh

Oh, when you love somebody
When you love somebody
Got to let somebody know
Oh, when you love somebody
When you love somebody (no, no, no)
Got to let somebody know

No, no, no
Oh
No, no, no
Oh-oh-oh
No, no, no
When you love somebody
Got to let somebody go 
No, no, no
Oh
No, no, no
Oh
No, no, no
When you love somebody
Got to let somebody go

(When you love somebody)
(When you love somebody)
Got to let somebody go
