		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put all your angels on the edge
Keep all the roses, I'm not dead
I left a thorn under your bed
I'm never gone
Go tell the world I'm still around
I didn't fly, I'm coming down
You are the wind, the only sound
Whisper to my heart when hope is torn apart
And no one can save you
I walk alone
Every step I take, I walk alone
My winter storm holding me awake
It's never gone when I walk alone
Go back to sleep forever more
Far from your fools and lock the door
They're all around and they'll make sure
You don't have to see what I turned out to be
No one can help you
I walk alone
Every step I take, I walk alone
My winter storm holding me awake
It's never gone when I walk alone
Waiting up in heaven
I was never far from you
Spinning down I felt your every move
I walk alone
I walk alone
Every step I take, I walk alone
My winter storm holding me awake
It's never gone, when I walk alone
