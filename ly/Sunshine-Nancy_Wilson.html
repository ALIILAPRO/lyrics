		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know i know, I know, I know

Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
