		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "We've only just begun"

Oh, yes, indeed, I like this, I like this
Hey, yo, Hi-Tek, do me a favor, man
Speed it up a little bit

From the intro you know I'm so influential 'cause I'm glowing like a candle
The focus is so essential, dog, what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you, they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police want that info, they'll grill 'em like Portabellos
I'm murdering instrumentals 'cause I rap with the conscience
Of felons, killers, and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still feeling the promise, some nights I kill 'em with kindness
Hitting like Muhammad Ali, you more like Tatyana
All this is probably Karma, you dishonored the father
Whether it's God almighty or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor
Look in the scope, my people still a target

Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'?
Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge
Uh, I'm in New York now like Akeem and Semi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious B-U-M, uh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution
This that black Elohim, Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the coatroom, screaming "who that?" on the double
Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog, I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizing the ghetto

Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And, shorty, you straight, bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol, bet I'm about to ball
And never let up, look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention, this is clever, I'm Pau Gasol
Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign, boy, you know I'm-a shine
Flow is in Ramadan 'cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick, man, I should throw a condom on
'Cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas, I just lock and load, squeeze
Dog, I'm on a higher level, I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his glock, but won't squeeze
Please

Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble planted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master Jim, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shining out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon polish
All about nothing where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him, there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

You're welcome, thanks
Appreciation for your participation
Special dedication
Celebration, bitches
