		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself a summer fling or two
But remember I'm in love with you and
Save your heart for me

When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancin' under starlit skies
Please don't let stars get in your eyes, just
Save your heart for me

When you're all alone, far away from home
Someone's gonna flirt with you
I won't think it's wrong if you play along
Just don't fall for someone new

When the autumn winds begin to blow
And the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again I know, so
Save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me

Please remember I'm in love with you, so
Save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me
