		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryna figure out why you playin' games
What's this all about?
And I can't believe
You're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her
You ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make-believe

Oh, love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found
Love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found, found you

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty
My heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on, without you
My rainy days fade away when you 
Come around, please tell me, baby
Why you go so far away?
Why you go?

Love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found
Love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found, I found you

Who would have known I'd find you?
Ooh

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty
My heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on, baby, without you
Rainy days fade away
When you come around
Say you're here to stay
With me, boy
I don't want you to leave me
I, I need you

Love
Never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found (found love)
Love 
Never knew what (I never) I was missin' (never, never)
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found (I found, I found)

Love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found
