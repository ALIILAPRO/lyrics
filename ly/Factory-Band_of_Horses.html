		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The elevator, in the hotel lobby has a lazy door
The man inside is going to a hotel room
He jumped out right after seeing just the very sight of me
Decided he better hike it to the second floor

Its temporary, this place I'm in
I permanently wont do this again
My belongings scattered across the hotel floor

Now then later, I was thinking it over by the snack machine
I thought about you and a candy bar
The now and laters, now that I've got, stuck between my teeth
I fell asleep to the greatest movie of the year

A man gets lonely, for heavens sake
He's wondering only what did you do today
The worlds spinning around into an old, sad song

Well it's coming down outside like Ive never even seen before
I fell into some kind of sorry state
But looking back now, I think it's time for me to laugh about it
And get my things together and find something to say

Well I feel awful, and I believe
That time gets wasted in this misery
And darling, I never wanna come back home
