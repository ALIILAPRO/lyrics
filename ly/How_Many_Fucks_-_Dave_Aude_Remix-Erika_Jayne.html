		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Zero, zero, zero, done

How many fucks do I give?
How many fucks do I give?
None, not one, zero, zero, zero, done

How many fucks do I give?
How many fucks do I give?
None, not one, zero, zero, zero, done

Zero, zero, zero, done

Elevator, elevator gettin' me high
Tryin' to hit my level but ya can't even try
Diamonds & Chardonnay
See you next Tuesday

Number ones, yeah, number ones
Yeah I got eight
So everyone, yeah, everyone
Can suck on my dick
You play Monopoly, I play the real thing

Ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three, two
One, none

How many fucks do I give?
How many fucks do I give?
None, not one, zero, zero, zero, done

How many fucks do I give?
How many fucks do I give?
None, not one, zero, zero, zero, done

Zero, zero, zero, done

Collagen, yeah, collagen
Ain't signin' no checks
Keep on runnin', keep on runnin'
Runnin' them lips
What'd you just say my friend?
Money's making me deaf

Alligator, alligator
Drippin' in storms
Eighteen karat, eighteen karat
Up in my bones
Best things in life are free
So I'll keep on spending

I-I-I totally-ly sleeping these fools
No lie-lie, I-I-I sleepin' these fools

Ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three, two
One, none

How many fucks do I give?
How many fucks do I give?
None, not one, zero, zero, zero, done

How many fucks do I give?
How many fucks do I give?
None, not one, zero, zero, zero, done

Zero, zero, zero, done

Zero, zero, zero, done

Ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three, two
One, none
