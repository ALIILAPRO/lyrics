		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, she's gone, dear
Gone this morning, mmh yeah
Ow, see what a fool I've been - oh Lord
I say what a fool I've been
Yes, I did

Too much didn't leave me-me no letter
Didn't leave no warning
You naughty thing, you
Ooh - well I guess I am to blame oh lord
I guess I'm all to blame - see you later
Sailor boy child, right now you take it

Hope my little dog ainâ€™t too hungry
No, no, he just kept on barking
The vicious thing
Just don't seem the same, oh, no, no
It just, oh tantrums, it don't feel the same
Ooh, see you later now hit it, like that
Coming on strong

Oh, well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said "Ah ooh ooh ooh ooh" oh Lord
What a fool I've been
And she told what to do she said "Go home!"

Well she's gone - gone this morning
See what a fool I've been, oh lord
What a foo oo oo oo oo oo ool i've been

Thank you
