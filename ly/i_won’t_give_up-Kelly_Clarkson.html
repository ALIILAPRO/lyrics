		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It took a minute, forgiveness, some work
But I did it, now I'm standing here
Almost gave in to the dark, but it turns out
The light in me won't disappear

I can't be the one, I can't be the one to love you, no
Go find what you're looking for
And I won't let all the damage of what we were
Define what I deserve

I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up
Even if it kills me tonight
I'll give it up, I'll give it up, I'll give it up, I'll give it up
Give up on the dream of you and I
I see visions in my mind so close that I can feel it come alive
Count my blessings, learn my lessons and move on with my life
I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up
Even if it take a little time

Memories, like ghosts, tend to come as they go
And, well, I tried my best to believe
Kingdoms were built to protect what's within
But your walls were built too steep for me

I can't be the one, I can't be the one who's lonely for you
No, you're not the one I need
I want love that feels like home and deep inside of me
I feel the storm awakening

I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up
Even if it kills me tonight
I'll give it up, I'll give it up, I'll give it up, I'll give it up
Give up on the dream of you and I
I see visions in my mind so close that I can feel it come alive
Count my blessings, learn my lessons and move on with my life
I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up
Even if it take a little time

Ooh, I found the basement of rock bottom
Ooh, never doubt, never doubt, never doubt, never doubted (never doubted)
Ooh, people treat you how you let them
Ooh, I was down at the bottom, at the bottom, at the bottom

But I won't give up
We're all worthy of love in this life
No, it ain't enough
Some good things begin with goodbye

I see visions in my mind so close that I can feel it come alive
Count my blessings, learn my lessons and move on with my life
I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up, I won't give up
Even if it take a little time
