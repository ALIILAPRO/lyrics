		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So easy loving you
So call it what you want
Lost in a memory
Falling back in time, falling back in time
Can't feel it anymore
So what have I become?
Feed off your energy
The night is on your side, the night is on your side

The way you make me feel
No ordinary love
It's never been so real
No ordinary love

No ordinary love
No ordinary love

So what you gonna do?
Staring at the sun
Another melody
Yeah, you know I tried, yeah, you know I tried
Can't feel it anymore
So what have I become?
Feed off your energy
The night is on your side, the night is on your side

The way you make me feel
No ordinary love
It's never been so real
No ordinary love

Just can't do it
No, just can't do it (no ordinary love)
Just can't do it
No, just can't do it
Just can't do it
No, just can't do it (no ordinary love)
Just can't do it

The way you make me feel
No ordinary love
It's never been so real
No ordinary love

No ordinary love
No ordinary love
