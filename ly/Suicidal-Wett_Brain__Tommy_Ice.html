		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You wanna do something funky? Hahaha)
And this bed's too big for me without you
I doubt you'll ever feel the same
I got a massive hole inside my heart
Girl, it screams your stupid fuckin' name

And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wave happens to pull me under
I doubt I'd even scream for help no way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And now I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrists might help

Hoe, you wasn't nothing but
A Louis V fleshlight
Stylin' on them bitches like
A Louis print fleshlight i was in my bag
I was tryna get my cash right
Always wanna spazz out
I don't like to act right
And I'm feelin' suicidal
I don't pray to god
I ain't ever read the bible fuck that
If you catch me on a bad day
Down bad, gеt the fuck up out of my way!

And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wavе happens to pull me under
I doubt I'd even scream for help no way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And now I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrists might help

I don't need no help to take these drugs
I ain't suicidal, flexin' on my idols (Idols)
I was tellin' 'em all walk a mile in my shoes
But you just cannot afford them (yeah)
I did hella drugs 'cause of boredom
('Cause of boredom)
Straight out of Balenciaga (yeah)
She don't got a father (Uh)
Hennessey im sippin' like it's
Water like it's aqua
And I was suicidal, fuck that shit
I'm getting comments (Uhh)
Raised by streets
Only made it 'cause my mama

And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wave happens to pull me under
I doubt I'd even scream for help no way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And now I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrists might help
