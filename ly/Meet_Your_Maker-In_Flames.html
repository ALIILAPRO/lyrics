		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet your maker
Say something that makes sense
These are your last words
So make them worth the wait

Meet your maker
It's time to set things straight
These are your last words
So make 'em count or it's too late

In time we all disappear
Pushed to the edge
A countdown has begun

At the end of the masquerade
Your time's up, now there's hell to pay
It's only down from here
You think you have a choice but there's no other way
(You think you have a choice but there's no other way)

Meet your maker
As you receive the final key
These are your last words
Are you ready to see what lies beneath?

Meet your maker
Everything else is dead
This is the final moment
All is done, all is said

In time we all disappear
Pushed to the edge
A countdown has begun

At the end of the masquerade
Your time's up, now there's hell to pay
It's only down from here
You think you have a choice but there's no other way

Meet your maker
Say something that makes sense
These are your last words
So make them worth the wait

At the end of the masquerade
Your time's up, now there's hell to pay
It's only down from here
You think you have a choice but there's no other way
