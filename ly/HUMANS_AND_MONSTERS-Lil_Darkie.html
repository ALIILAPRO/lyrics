		  Hello everybody
Welcome to the fucking show
This is a story about us, a story about people
Humans, and monsters
Monsters, underneath the bed
One wrong move and you'll lose your head

Will you little motherfuckers stop jumping on the bed?

Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Yeah, uh, breaking down weed on my platinum plaque
Breaking down weed on my platinum plaque
Breaking down weed on a- uh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what you want, I don't give a crap
Breaking down weed on my platinum plaque
Smoking on this, smoking on that
Exotic weed, yeah it stick to the glass
When I light up a stick and hit it, I don't pass
I don't gotta sign a deal, I'ma pass
You workin' a 9-5, your life is ass
I'd rather die than be a slave to a corporation
(If you're working at your job right now, go quit)

You can say what you want, they don't give a shit
You are less than dirt, you are worse than spit
And fuck all you niggas, you can suck my dick
And if I was a woman, you could lick my clit
And if I was China, I would nuke this shit
And if I was water, I would still drip
And if I was you, I would just quit
And if I was me, I am me (I'm glad I'm me)

I never got no jewelry on me
I never got no expensive car
I never got time, most of the time I'm thinking
'Bout rhymes, I'm thinking 'bout bars
Thinkin' 'bout buyin' land for a farm
Big ass shotgun on my arm
Thinkin' bout growin' bees and corn
Thinkin' bout moving real far

Yeah, you can say what you want, I don't give a crap
Ever since I got this platinum plaque
I been caring less and less and less about that
I'm sure that there's a lesson in that
Yeah, if it ain't what I want, the election is happening
New American revolution on the track

You're telling me that the CIA got people addicted to crack?
You're telling me that the government isn't on our side?
Isn't that shit just a joke at this point?
Do we even really care that the government lies?
Do we even really hate what we say we despise?
Do we even really think what we think we think?
Is there fluoride in the water we drink?
Did the FBI calcify your third eye?

Hello, I hope you have been enjoying the song so far
Please take a moment to replenish your nutrients
And water and things like that before we- open up the pit here in a moment
(I can do whatever the fuck I want)
You know what, I'm gonna go get some water
Here to entertain you is my favorite musical group, its called sounds-
(No other rapper could do this)
A bunch of sounds, it's my favorite band, 'kay, goodbye
(Go fuck yourself)
(Random sounds)

Okay I'm back, I'm back, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Silver back gorilla when I'm breaking shit
Step up on the stage, and I'm breaking shit
This that get the ground shakin' shit
Tryna fuck with me, are you naked bitch?
I don't wanna wait, you can take it bitch

Say what you want, I don't give a crap
Ever since I got this platinum plaque
I been feeling like the Joker, don't give a fuck
I'm lonely, where is Batman at?
Uh, there's no competition, trap-metal is wack
You can only get this big in rap with a contract

Sell your soul, we promise we'll give your masters back
Lil Darkie, we want to take you out to a meal
We genuinely really care about how you feel
No one else has ever had this kind of deal
No one's ever had this kind of arrangement
Don't you want all your friends to be famous?
You don't want to remain nameless, do you?
We promise we won't screw you
Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah I like that one a lot, why did you tell them we have a platinum plaque though?
I don't know, it's like a metaphor, also it sounds cool
Did you have to like- did you have to lowkey lie to everybody to get that message across?
Oh no, but I guess I'd make a really good politician or news anchor if you know what I'm saying
