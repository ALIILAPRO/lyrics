Cardi

Tell me where you wanna go
I'll meet you with my bags at the door

(Ah I'm gon' make you go blind
Every time I walk, my hips they don't lie)

Take me to your paradise
'Cause I don't wanna wait anymore

(Ah, I'll say it one more time
Every time I walk, my hips they don't lie)

You wanna touch, wanna touch?
Of course, you wanna
You wanna run with my love
I know you wanna
From the club to the tub
You said you wanna
Give me an all night hug, I bet you wanna

I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna
I bet you, I bet you
I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna

Something 'bout me's takin you higher
And you ain't ever gonna come down
(You ain't ever, you ain't ever)

I'm lighting your fire
And it ain't ever gonna go out
(It ain't ever, it ain't ever)

Take the car keys
Drive me crazy (vroom)
Cardi a good catch
But you gotta chase me
Grab my waist line, but don't ever waste me (mm)
Turn on, please me, but don't ever play me (no)
One of a kind
You can't replace me
Time to shine, I bust down the A.P. (bing)
The stakes is higher (hey)
Let's do what we both desire (hey)
On God, like I'm in the choir
I bet you if you make me sweat, I'll still be on fire

You wanna touch, wanna touch?
Of course, you wanna
You wanna run with my love
I know you wanna
From the club to the tub
You said you wanna
Give me an all night hug, I bet you wanna

I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna
I bet you, I bet you
I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna

Something 'bout me's takin you higher
And you ain't ever gonna come down
(You ain't ever, you ain't ever)

I'm lighting your fire
And it ain't never gonna go out
(It ain't ever, it ain't ever)

If you want me (me)
Better bet higher
Wanna look down (down)
Up in the sky ah
(Higher, higher, higher, higher, high)
Boy, better take it up so damn high

Lookin so thick (thick)
Make you desire
I'm a whole bit (bit)
Keep you up higher
(Higher, higher, higher, higher, high)

Something 'bout me's taking you higher
And you ain't ever gonna come down
(You ain't ever, you ain't ever)

I'm lighting your fire
And it ain't ever gonna go out
(It ain't ever, it ain't ever)

Something 'bout me's taking you higher
And you ain't ever gonna come down
(You ain't ever, you ain't ever)

Bet you wanna love this, ah
