		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

You are the sun (you are the sun)
You make me shine (you make me shine)
Or more like the stars (or more like the stars)
That twinkle at night (that twinkle at night)
You are the moon (you are the moon)
That glows in my heart (that glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life (you are my life)

Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

You are the sun (you are the sun)
You make me shine (you me make me shine)
Or more like the stars (or more like the stars)
That twinkle at night (that twinkle at night)
You are the moon (you are the moon)
That glows in my heart (that glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You are the sun (you are the sun)
You make me shine (you make me shine)
Or more like the stars(or more like the stars)
That twinkle at night (that twinkle at night)
You are the moon (you are the moon)
That glows in my heart (that glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong (I wasn't strong)
You gave me hope when all hope is lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see (I couldn't see)
Love was always here waiting for me (for me)

You are the sun (you are the sun)
You make me shine (you make me shine)
Or more like the stars (more)
That twinkle at night (that twinkle at night)
You are the moon (you are the moon)
That glows in my heart (that glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world (you're my daytime, my nighttime, my world)

You are the sun (you are the sun, you are, yeah)
You make me shine (you make me shine!)
Or more like the stars (like the stars)
That twinkle at night (my daytime, I love you)
You are the moon (oh you're that)
That glows in my heart (you're my sun)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world (you're my daytime, my nighttime, my world)

You are the sun (you are the sun)
You make me shine (you make me shine)
Or more like the stars (more like the stars 
That twinkle at night (in the night, I love you)
You are the moon (you are the)
That glows in my heart (that glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world (daytime, world)

You are my life
