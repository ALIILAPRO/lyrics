		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car (ayy), she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club (oh yeah), know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

Beep-beep, is that my bestie in a Tessie?
Fresh blow out, skin on tan, ooh, she ready
Bitch, you look goodt, with a T at the end
I'ma hype her every time, that my motherfuckin' friend
She been down since the jellies and the Volvos
Got me steppin' out that Jeep in Manolos
When we pull up to the scene, they be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy (pop-pop-pop)
I hit her phone with the tea, like, "bitch, guess what?"
All the rich ass boys wanna fuck on us
All this ass sittin' up, you can look, don't touch
In our bag, bust some bands every time we link up

That my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car (ayy), she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club (oh yeah), know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

That my best friend, if you need a freak
I ain't dumb, but motherfucker, she my Tweedle-Dee
If she ride for me (ride), she don't need a key
If you sideways, she'll straighten you if needed be
And she so bad that I just can't take that bitch nowhere
She off her fish, I said, "mm-mm, don't go there"
Bitch, break her back, she protect and attack
Get that strap like them buckle, foot on neck, give no air
Whole world wanna be us
That my main bitch, she my day-one
On my way, bitch, let you get drunk
Let's celebrate, 'cause we the baddest in the club

That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car (ayy), she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club (oh yeah), know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

Hah, best friend, you the baddest and you know it (you know)
Uh-oh, girl, I think our booty growin' (ayy, yeah)
Fuck it up in the mirror, hit them poses (pose)
Best friends, and you motherfuckin' glowin' (woo, woo)
Best friends, and your wrist look like it's frozen (it's froze)
Uh-oh, girl, I think our booty growin' (uh-oh)
Fuck it up in the mirror, hit them poses (hit that pose)
Best friend, you my motherfuckin' soulmate
