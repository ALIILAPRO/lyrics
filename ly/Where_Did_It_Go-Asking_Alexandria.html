		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you're all stars now?
So you're what's in now?
Top of the world now
So you're the kings now?
There is only one throne and I'm not done with it
Still shitting, sleeping, eating, breathing it
Ten years and you're still hanging on my every word with baited breath
After a decade pushing boundaries proving impossible, possible
Making something from nothing
Creating larger than life
Always rejecting the herd
Always ahead of the curve
Writing the records your favorite band rips off in their records

You're all so fucking outrageous
I can't take it
Motherfuckers more than a little complacent
Where did it go?
Where did it go so wrong?
Just sit the fuck down, pay attention
There's too much noise, for a second listen
Where did it go?
Where did it go so wrong?

There was a first one a triple gold one
The stole by every fucking band on summer tours one
Then the second one the living reckless one
The knock the popstars off the charts one
And the third one, the fuck the world one
The arenas singing every fucking word one
Then the fourth one the wasn't me one
The we needed just a little space to breathe one
But now there's this one the I'm the king one
The I don't care, i'm gonna do my thing one
The breaking every fucking rule in the book one
The fuck you all

This shit is fucking outrageous
I can't take it
Motherfuckers more than a little complacent
Where did it go?
Where did it go so wrong?
Just sit the fuck down, pay attention
There's too much noise, for a second listen
Where did it go?
Where did it go so wrong?

Don't have to like it but you can't deny you needed me
To show you what comes next, what comes next
I've set the standard far too high for you to follow me
Feel free to try your best, try your best

You're all so fucking outrageous
I can't take it
Motherfuckers more than a little complacent
Where did it go?
Where did it go so wrong?
Just sit the fuck down, pay attention
There's too much noise, for a second listen
Where did it go?
Where did it go so wrong?
