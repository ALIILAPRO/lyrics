		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kinda strange, now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should 
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found
Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing 
And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should 
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found
Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing 
And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

And I thought I was yours (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Forever (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Or maybe I was mistaken (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
But I just cannot manage (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
To make it through the day (shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Without thinking of you lately 

I'm not sure if I should 
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found
Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing 
And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)

(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop)
