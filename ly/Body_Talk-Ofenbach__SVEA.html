		  (Talk, gonna let our bodies talk)

Hey, it's getting kinda late
Got nothin' left to say
So, let me change our conversation

Words only get in the way
So, take my breath away (away)
Let's not make it complicated

Oho-oho-oho-oh
Come baby, baby, pull me close

Gonna let our bodies talk
Gonna let our bodies talk
Le-le-let our bodies talk (hush, hush)
Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies talk
Gonna let our bodies talk
Le-le-let our bodies talk (hush, hush)
Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies

Ooh, the way you move your lips
Shut up, give me a kiss
The talk, the talk is overrated

You don't need to make a wish
I know it's on your list (list)
Just walk the walk, don't need to say it

Oho-oho-oho-oh
Come baby, baby, pull me close, ahh
Oho-oho-oho-oh
Come baby, what you waiting for?

Gonna let our bodies talk
Gonna let our bodies talk
Le-le-let our bodies talk (hush, hush)
Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies talk
Gonna let our bodies talk (uhh)
Le-le-let our bodies talk (hush, hush) (mmh)
Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies

Come baby, baby, pull me close, yeah, yeah
Come baby, what you waiting for?

Gonna let our bodies talk
Gonna let our bodies talk
Le-le-let our bodies talk (hush, hush)
Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies talk
Gonna let our bodies talk
Le-le-let our bodies talk (hush, hush)
Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies

Oho-oho-oho-oh
Come baby, baby, pull me close

Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies talk
Gonna let our bodies talk (yeah)
Le-le-let our bodies talk (uhh) (hush, hush)
Don't say, we're gonna let our bodies
