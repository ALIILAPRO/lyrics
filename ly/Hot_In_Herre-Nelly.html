		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot in, so hot in here, so hot in, hot, oh
With a little bit of, uh uh, and a little bit of, uh uh
Just a little bit of a-, just a little bit of a-
Just a little bit of a-, just a little bit of a-

I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious (uh)
Flirtacious, tryna show patience
I'm waitin' for the right time to shoot my steez (you know)
Waitin' for the right time to flash them keys, then uh
I'm leavin', please believe in, oh
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve and
No teasin', I need you to
Get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose
And I feel like touchin' you, uh uh
And can't nobody stop the juice
So baby, tell me what's the use? I said

It's gettin' hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am, gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am, gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off (uh, uh, uh)

Let it hang all out

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles? (c'mon)
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin', sports cars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I'll be damned, I do a hundred, top down and goggles
Got off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause baby, I can't talk it
Warm, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner, so baby, you can't lose
I got secrets, can't leave Cancun
So take it off like you're home alone
You know dance in front the mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, "Girl, I think my butt gettin big" (oh)

It's gettin' hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am, gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off (oh)
It's gettin' hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am, gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off (uh, uh, uh)

Let it hang all out

Mix a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
Give a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
(Let it hang all out)
With a little bit of ah, ah
And a sprinkle of that ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
I like it when ya ah, ah
Girl, baby make it ah, ah (oh)

Stop pacin', time wastin'
I gotta friend with a pole in the basement (what?)
I'm just kidding like Jason (oh)
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra, ayy, spread the news (check it)
Nelly took a trip from the Lou' to the Neptunes
Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in Sassoon's
Say she got a thing about cuttin' in restrooms, oh

It's gettin' hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am, gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off (oh)
It's gettin' hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am , gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off (uh, uh, uh)

Let it hang all out

It's gettin hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am, gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off (oh)
It's gettin' hot in here (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am, gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

Let it hang all out

Mix a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
Give a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
(Let it hang all out)
With a little bit of ah, ah
And a sprinkle of that ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
I like it when ya ah, ah
Girl, baby make it ah, ah, oh
