		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goin' home late last night
Suddenly, I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window and surprised what I saw
Fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf
Alright now

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright now

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright now

So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said, "Son, son, you've gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do"
Yeah
