		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just like him
To wander off in the evergreen park
Slowly searching
For any sign of the ones he used to love
He says he's got nothing left to live for
(He says he's got nothing left)
And this time I think you'll know

You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out
You will live to tell

She's just like him
Spoiled rotten confused by the life she's been fed
And she's searching for no one (but herself)
Her eyes turn to green
And she seems to be happy
That she is her
And this time I think you'll know

You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out
You will live to tell
You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out

(Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah)
(There is more to know)

We're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out
You will live to tell
(So tell me)

You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out (make it out)
You will live to tell (live to tell)
You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
(And I can) you can make it out
You will live to tell

You were not alone
You're not
You're not
Alone
