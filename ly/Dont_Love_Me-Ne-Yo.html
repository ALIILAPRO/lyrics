		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Mally Mal)

And I really wanna see you happy
I really wanna see you secure (mm)
Confident in your sexy
I know you don't feel that with me anymore

You should walk away
It'd be selfish of me to ask you to stay
When I know that I cannot love you the way you deserve
I can't sit and watch you make these same mistakes
Ones I know that you're willing to make

(Oh) please, oh, please, don't love me
Walk away, you'll be better for it (oh)
I can't be, your happy
Walk away, you'll be better for it, girl (ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'm only gonna hurt you (ooh, ooh)
You'll be better for it, girl (ooh, ooh-ooh)
Find someone that deserves you, babe, ooh (ooh, ooh)

Running after all these thots, steady telling you I'm not
Lying to your face done got, too easy for me to not
Even though I love you a lot (hey)
All I'ma wind up doin' is making you hate me
I broke your self-esteem and made you feel crazy

So walk away
I'm the reason that the tears run down your face
I'm the reason that you've felt so out of place as of late
And to stay with me, it would be a mistake
One I know that you're willing to make

(Oh) please, oh, please, don't love me (don't love me)
Walk away, you'll be better for it (oh, yeah)
I can't be (I can't be), your happy (I can't be your happy)
Walk away, you'll be better for it, girl (ooh, ooh-ooh, hey)
I'm only gonna hurt you (I'm only gonna hurt you)
You'll be better for it, girl (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Find someone that deserves you, babe, oh, oh-oh (mm mm)

(Ah, ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ah)
