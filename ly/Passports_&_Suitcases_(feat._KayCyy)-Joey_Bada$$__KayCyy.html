		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah
Passports, passports, yeah

Uh, sometimes, I trip just on how happy we could be
Fuck it, girl, let's take a trip, drop all your shit and let's leave
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, got everything that you need
Anything that you please
Girl, just follow my lead, baby, yeah
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, yeah
I got everything you need, baby, yeah
Tell me what it's gon' be, baby (be, baby), yeah

Let me know right now
Should we slow things down? (Slow things down)
Should I hold my ground?
You could hold me down
What's the hold up, now?
Need to know right now
Need to know right now
Need to know right now (oh, yeah, yeah)
She a Gemini (she a Gemini)
My little pudding pie (my little pudding)
Social butterfly (social butter')
Watch her flutter by (watch her flutter)
Let her sing to me (sing), like a lullaby (like a lullaby)
She like a dream to me (she like a dream), but I can't close my eyes (but I can't, but I can't)

Passports and suitcases (passports)
On to some new spaces
Tighten up like loose, tighten up like loose braces
Oh, no
They trip like it's their shoelaces
Trust me, on the first date, I sound too crazy
You say you love me on a first date, girl, you too wavy, oh, too wavy

Uh, sometimes, I trip just on how happy we could be
Fuck it, girl, let's take a trip, drop all your shit and let's leave
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, got everything that you need
Anything that you please
Girl, just follow my lead, baby, yeah
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, yeah
I got everything you need, baby, yeah
Tell me what it's gon' be, baby (be, baby), yeah

Girl, I want you to really want me more than I want you
You could trust me
I said, "I want you to really want me more than I want you, you could trust me" (you could)

Passports and suitcases (passports)
On to some new spaces
Tighten up like loose, tighten up like loose braces
Oh, no
They trip like it's their shoelaces
Trust me, on the first date, I sound too crazy
You say you love me on a first date, girl, you too wavy, oh, too wavy
