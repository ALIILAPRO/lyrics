		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The devil doesn't bargain

It's useless, don't do this
It's hubris to try
He's ruthless, you knew this
I told you, didn't I?
He's abusive, elusive
The truth is, he lies
I know you don't want to let go

And just like before
I can see that you're sure
You can change him but I know you won't

The devil doesn't bargain
He'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling
He's never gonna change
He'll never be Prince Charming
He'll only do you harm again
I don't mean to meddle
But the devil doesn't settle
No, the devil doesn't bargain

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Devil doesn't bargain
Mm-mm-mm-mm

I'm not one to lecture
Talk down to a friend
I don't mean to pressure
Mean to condescend
But I just want what's best for
You in the end
I know you don't want to let go

And just like before
I can see that you're sure
You can change him but I know you won't

The devil doesn't bargain
He'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling
He's never gonna change
He'll never be Prince Charming
He'll only do you harm again
I don't mean to meddle
But the devil doesn't settle
No, the devil doesn't bargain

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Devil doesn't bargain
Mm-mm-mm-mm

And I know you think
He'll change this time
But I think that you will find

The devil doesn't bargain
He'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling
He's never gonna change
He'll never be Prince Charming
He'll only do you harm again
I don't mean to meddle
But the devil doesn't settle
No, the devil doesn't bargain

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Devil doesn't bargain
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Devil doesn't bargain
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Devil doesn't bargain
Mm-mm-mm-mm
