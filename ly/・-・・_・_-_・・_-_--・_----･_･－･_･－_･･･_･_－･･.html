		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time when I fully embraced it
But now I can hardly face it
Face the truth of where I stand on this line
Curving up, bringing down what I see as natural time

I hope I can keep up
I hope I can keep up

It's not a race, now, to the end of the maze
But I see these machines eating up all of our days
cnd I'm pulled both ways
To leave it or stay

So should I try to keep up?
Oh will I try to keep up?

The old mystic in me wants to believe we don't need all this technology

cnd I know it's not in my hands
I'm just one little grain in all these shifting sands
There's a lot you don't see in this life
But sometimes you pick up on something in your strife

I hope I can pick up
I hope I can pick it up

There's no use in fighting against an inevitability
But if you don't listen to suspicions at all then you'll always agree
cnd I know there's no sense in trying to be the world's police
But I wanna see humans and cities as more than just a disease

There's a problem with the term 'nature'
cs if we're not a part of her
cnd this mindset to conquer
Comes to no good end, of that I'm sure

I hope we can let go
I hope we can let it go
