		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My words are lazy
My thoughts are hazy
But this is one thing I'm sure of
Everybody needs a best friend
I'm happy I'm yours

You got a double
Who brings you trouble
And though you're better without me
Everybody needs a best friend
I'm happy I'm yours

A fool could see decidedly
That you're a ten and I'm a three
A royal breed is what you need
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me?

You got a head full of someone dreadful
But how that someone adores you
Everybody needs a best friend
I'm happy I'm yours

A fool could see decidedly
That you're a ten and I'm a three
A royal breed is what you need
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me?

Oh, you got a head full of someone dreadful
And yet alas, that someone adores you
Everybody needs a best friend
I'm happy I'm yours

I'm just a clown
And I'll bring you down
But you just don't care 'cause your
Best friend is me
