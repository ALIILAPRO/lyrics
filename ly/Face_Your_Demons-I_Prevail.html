		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so incomparable, I want to know just how you did it
Was it with your words, are you willing it admit it?
Was it with your force, you took the fruit right from the source
You stole her innocence without remorse

Hear these words, I'm gonna make sure that you remember the night when you
Stole from her, the beautiful life, the only one she ever knew
How dare you, be the fire that burned the branches off the tree,
Be the storm that disrupts the sea
You are the reason, now face your demons

I'll make sure, the whole world knows your name
But for all the wrong reasons
I'll watch your body rest in flames
I'm gonna watch you rest in flames

Now that, I see the truth of the liar
I will, be the one to set the fire
Tied up, in the bed where you defiled her
Your time has expired
Expired
Open the fuck up

I'll make sure, the whole world knows your name
But for all the wrong reasons
I'll watch your body rest in flames
I'm gonna watch you rest in flames
I'll make sure, the whole world knows your name
But for all the wrong reasons
I'll watch your body rest in flames

It's time to face your demons, yeah
You are the reason
It's time to face your demons
