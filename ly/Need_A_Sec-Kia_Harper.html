		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just need a second
Yea
Yo I just need a
Yo I just need a second
Yea
Yo I just need a
Oh no no
This can't be the same life
I was looking forward to
Overly stimulated but
I be over bored too
Ain't got time for niggas
Cause these niggas ain't gone court you
Quick to criticize but don't do shit to support you
Plus it cost too much to live
I got traumas from my past
I passed down to my kid
I got fears of missing out
And shame from shit I did
I be all up in my mind
Overthinking
God forbid
Maybe I just need a second
It's been alot on my plate and I'm trying to digest it
I ain't giving up or in
I'm just in between a blessing
And lessons
Maybe I just need a second
Second
Maybe I just need a second
Ain't giving up or giving in
Yo I just need a
Kia Kia
You already know whats going on man
Look I'm just dropping in to tell you
Keep going
Keep pushing
Don't let life stress you out
Whatever you going through man
Remember to breathe
And remind yourself that you designed yourself
You know what I'm saying
You one of them ones
You my goat
You our goat
So just keep pushing forward
Keep doing your thing
We all proud of you
Keep representing
Keep putting on
