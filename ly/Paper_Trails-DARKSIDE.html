		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Better go back, rhythm inside
Better go back, here inside
I told you I would get you
The back of the hand
I told you I would find
A place to go

Paper trails on a mountain
And fruits on a table
A wooden house to live in
A baby to care

The grass green but the
The sun is blue
Better find a way
To get through to you
Where are you when I need you? Where did you go?
How can I find you when I need to? Where should I go?

Paper trail on a mountain and far away
A big trail on a mountain you'll find a way

The fire outside
It's burning up the place
But you're inside
Burning up ahead

Paper trails on a mountain
And fruits on a table
A wooden house to live in
A baby to care
