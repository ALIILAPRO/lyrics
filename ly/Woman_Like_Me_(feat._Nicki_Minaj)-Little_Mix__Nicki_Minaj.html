		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewelry dripping
Drink and I get all fired up (hey, hey, hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me?
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me? (A woman)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me (a woman)
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me

And baby, just be mine for the weekend
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, ayy, ayy
You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it
Love it when you turn me on
'Yoncé with a little bit of
"Love Drunk" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me?
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me? (A woman)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me (a woman)
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me

Yo, woman like me, yes, a woman like me (oh)
Soon as I brush up on him, I could tell he like me (oh)
You know all them mandem ah try fi swipe me (k'yuh)
Knotted up, he could afford to ice me (ahh, rhrr)
Tell 'em there's a bad Trini bitch inna your area (uh)
But the more bad bitches, then the more merrier (c'mon)
Baddies to my left and to the right a little scarier (uh)
Rude boy, tell me, can you handle all this derrière? (a so it go, rhrr)
Uh, a million, I'm getting my billi on
Greatest of all time 'cause I'm a chameleon
I switch it up for every era, I'm really bomb
These bitches really wanna be Nicki, I'm really mom (uh)
Apple cut the check, I want all this money
Seven Up, go grip the TEC,and leave all this bloody
I-it's the Queen and Little Mix, skated on 'em, sorry
My daddy is Indian (swish), a-all this curry (mh)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me

I've made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me? (like a woman like me, yeah)
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me?
(For a woman like me)

(Na, na, na, na, na, a woman like me, like me)
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me (fall for a woman like me)
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me (na, na, na, na, na, uh)
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me (I said)
(A woman like me) Young Money, rrrrh
