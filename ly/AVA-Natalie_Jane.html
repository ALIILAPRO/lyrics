		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who the fuck is Ava?
Is she the other girl?
I bet she's dyin' to date ya
And be your entire world

Thought that I was dumb
When you asked me to go blonde
'Cause I knew that's what you wanted
Yeah, you wanted
A girl who did it all
Didn't pick up on your faults
Someone who is always fallin'
For your charmin'

So why is there a red heart next to her name?

Who the fuck is Ava?
Is she the other girl?
I bet she's dyin' to date ya
And be your entire world
I'm sick and tired of fakin'
Like I don't see your phone
When I see her name and you can't explain

Who the fuck is Ava? Oh
Who the fuck is Ava? Oh
Who the fuck is

Blinded by the lights
Tell me, why you tryna hide it?
I wasn't even threatened
You got me second-guessin'

So why is there a red heart next to her name?

Who the fuck is Ava?
Is she the other girl? (She the other girl?)
I bet she's dyin' to date ya
And be your entire world (your entire world)
I'm sick and tired of fakin'
Like I don't see your phone
When I see her name and you can't explain

Who the fuck is Ava? Oh
Who the fuck is Ava? Oh
Who the fuck is Ava? Oh
Who the fuck is Ava? Oh
Who the fuck is
