		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah yeah

Oh lady when ya come on down
Won't ya come on down
I said to my town

Oh mama when ya come on down
Won't ya come on down
I said to my home

Oo lady won't you move my way
Can't ya move my way
I'm getting hazy

Oh mama when you give your lovin'
When you give your love
You drive me crazy

Ah mama what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart
Ah mama what you gonna say
About that love in your heart
Oh mama when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'
Oo mama what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart

See mama gotta feel your everything
Feel your everything
I really wanna know

See mama when you shine you're shinin' bright
Give you're given right
I really want our love to grow

See mama when your heart is in its place
See that smilin' face
It's all I wanna do

See mama every time that you are near
It's when your gonna fear
You're never gonna come back home

Ah mama what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart
Ah mama what you gonna say
About that love in your heart
Oh mama when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'
Oo mama what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart

Do you remember what I said
When I got down on my knees
Gotta get your lovin' baby
Lovin's all I need
Don't make me beg now baby
Don't make me bleed
I gave you all a man could give
And you still walked out on me

Ah mama what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart
Ah mama what you gonna say
About that love in your heart
Oh mama when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'
Oo mama what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart

Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Lovin'
Burnin
Fire

Aw yeah
