		  Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boy

Have you ever had the feeling you're drawn to someone?
(Yeah)
And there isn't anything they could of said or done?
And everyday I see you on your own
And I can't believe that you're alone
But I overheard your girls and this is what they said

Looking for a, looking for a
That you're looking for a boyfriend (yeah)
I see that, gimme time, you know I'm gonna be there
Don't be scared to come put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really want to be
Is your boyfriend (yeah)
Can't fight that
Knock me down you know I'm coming right back
I don't care at all what you done before
All I really want is to be your

Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend

Let me take a little moment to find the right words
(To find the right words)
So when I kick it to you it ain't something that you've heard
(Something that you've heard)
I don't know what kind of guy that you prefer
But I know I gotta put myself forwards
See I think got the kind of love that you deserve
And I heard

That you're looking for a boyfriend
I see that, give me time, you know I'm gonna be that
Don't be scared to come put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really want to be
Is your boyfriend (yeah)
Can't fight that
Knock me down you know I'm coming right back
I don't care at all what you done before
All I really want is to be your

Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend

If you tell me where, I'm waiting here
Everyday like Slumdog Millionaire
Bigger then the Twilight love affair
I'll be here
Girl, I swear

Looking for a, looking for a
That your looking for a boyfriend (yeah)
I see that, give me time, you know I'm gonna be that
Don't be scared to come put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really want to be
Is your boyfriend (yeah)
Can't fight that
Knock me down you know I'm coming right back
I don't care at all what you done before
All I really want is to be your

Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
(Your boyfriend)
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
(All I really want is to be your)
(Your boyfriend)
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
(Yeah) your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
(All I really want is to be your)
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boyfriend
All I really want is to be your
