		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what it is you wanna know
Finish up the bottle then we'll go, babe
Waste a little money on some blow
She said, "Won't you have a little?", I said, "No way"

I'm too phased, it's too late
But coming down is all I ever do, babe, yeah
And I'm so down if you're ready, and I'm floating but I'm heavy
And I'll show you if you let me, girl

I don't know if you already know how
But girl, I got the feeling that you know now
You're buried in the pillow, yeah you're so loud
But I'm about to show you, baby, slow down

Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down

Push a little further on the edge
Crawl a little further on the bed, babe
I'm burning up, yeah, all I see is red
She said, "Fuck me like I'm famous", I said, "Okay"

It's two-faced, it's too late
But coming down is all I ever do, babe
And I'm so down if you're ready, and I'm floating but I'm heavy
And I'll show you if you let me, girl

I don't know if you already know how
But girl, I got the feeling that you know now
You're buried in the pillow, yeah, you're so loud
But I'm about to show you, baby, slow, slow

Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down (yeah)
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down

Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Slow down, slow down, yeah
Won't you listen to me? Yeah
Drugs all in my system
Tell me what you heard
Tell me what you know
I've been rolling for days, yeah, this is so foreign
Already, no, listen, baby

I don't know if you already know how
But girl, I got the feeling that you know now
You're buried in the pillow, yeah you're so loud
But I'm about to show you, baby, slow down

Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
