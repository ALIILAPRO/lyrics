		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think she got what she wanted
Waited a week before she even responded
We had a couple friends in common when I met her
Wasn't worried, but I shoulda been
I think she knew what she was doing', gettin' into my car
Outside Amoeba Music or the standard bar
Independent when I met her, now she's my only medicine

When it gets quiet, I can hear her mind race
She's starin' at the ceilin', like she's seein' outer space
She could be the Mona Lisa if the Mona Lisa had a prettier face
This could be heaven if heaven was an actual place

(For the record)
This is not what I wanted
I wanted my heart to remain in my pocket
She took it out and wrote her name right on it
And now I'm only borrowing
How come every time I leave I can't breathe as deep
I'm always staying on the call while she falls asleep
Might call it codependency, look at me
Freezin' while she's showerin'

When it gets quiet, I can hear her mind race
She's starin' at the ceilin', like she's seein' outer space
She could be the Mona Lisa if the Mona Lisa had a prettier face
This could be heaven if heaven was an actual place

When it gets quiet, I can hear her mind race
She's starin' at the ceilin', like she's seein' outer space
She could be the Mona Lisa if the Mona Lisa had a prettier face
This could be heaven if heaven was an actual place
