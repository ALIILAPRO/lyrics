		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fucked around and went off the rails
Yeah
Me and my friends
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Fuck famous
We still do the same shit
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Go brain dead
Blowing every paycheck
Fucked around and went off the rails
But we still ended up in the hills
Yea
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Fuck famous
We still do the same shit
Came up from the east yea that's my ends
Got my cake up now I'm shining in the west
Fucked up when I double up a check
Golden halo hanging from my neck
Bitch I'm next
Yea I'm dripping Saint Laurent
Ros√© sippin in the sun
I'm still working every day
Till my pockets weigh a ton
Yea I got comma sutra the money turn me on
She say I'm a dog and I tell her she ain't wrong
I was faded with my jawnt
Vinnie caught me on film
I know she a lot but that body look slim
I got twenty bottles all pouring to the brim
Brand new whip
Shorty come and take a spin with
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Fuck famous
We still do the same shit
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Go brain dead
Blowing every paycheck
Fucked around and went off the rails
But we still ended up in the hills
Yea
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Fuck famous
We still do the same shit
Shining with my teeth out on Mulholland
We just left the beach and now we on the 405
Feel like 23 the way I'm ballin
I know it ain't cheap
But I'mma throw till I die
Saying
Fuck a day job bitch I need a Rover
Pour the pain out we ain't never sober
Cut the top off flames out the motor
Brand new whip
Shorty come and take a spin with
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Fuck famous
We still do the same shit
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Go brain dead
Blowing every paycheck
Fucked around and went off the rails
But we still ended up in the hills
Yea
Me and my friends
All train wrecks
Fuck famous
We still do the same shit
Whoop
Aye Yeah Oh
We still do the same shit
Whoop
Aye Yeah Oh
We still do the same shit
