		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can say hello
It's good to know that you don't carry hate
Like bricks inside your coat
Well it had to end

But endings lead to better things
Like sleeping again
Oh, 'cause it's a curse to be your friend

(I love you so you cause me pain)
Yeah and it's a curse to be alone
(You left me out here in the rain)
I miss you more the more I grow
(I love you so you cause me pain)
Oh, it's a curse to be your friend

Oh, you look the same
Did you stop smoking weed?
Or trying to please your dad?
He's not thinking about your pain
Oh, it had to end
But endings lead to better things
Like feeling again
Oh, it's a curse to be your friend

(I love you so you cause me pain)
Yeah and it's a curse to be alone
(You left me out here in the rain)
I miss you more the more I grow
(I love you so you cause me pain)
Oh, it's a curse to be your friend

Maybe when the earth starts to melt
We don't have to choose violence
And maybe when it all goes to hell
We can be
Maybe when the earth starts to melt
We don't have to choose violence
And maybe when it all goes to hell
We can be

Oh, it's a curse to be your friend
(I love you so you cause me pain)
And it's a curse to be alone
(You left me out here in the rain)
I miss you more the more I grow
(I love you so you cause me pain)
Oh it's a curse to be your friend

(Ooh-ooh)

Baby, maybe we could be even now (ooh-ooh)
(I love you so you cause me pain)
Oh, we could be even now (ooh-ooh)
(You left me out here in the rain)
Oh, baby, maybe we could be even now (ooh-ooh)
(I love you so you cause me pain)
