		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why am I with you now?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you

Yeah, it's perfectly clear love's not what you need
I tell you that I don't care, but I don't want to
Anything that you say I hear myself agree
And I don't recognize what I've turned into

I don't know why I want you so
'Cause I don't need the heart break
I don't know what addictive hold
You have on me I can't shake
No, I'm not in control
So let me go

Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you

I could sleep by myself, it would burn me alive
Find me somebody else, but I don't want to
Try to leave out the love that goes against the grain
But I can rationalize it if I have to

I don't know why I want you so
Hmm, 'cause I don't need the heart break
I don't know what addictive hold
You have on me I can't shake
No, I'm not in control
So let me go

Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you

I'm not in control
So let me go

Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you

Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you, ooh
