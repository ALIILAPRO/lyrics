		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be afraid of me
I'm what you need

I saw you on the screens
I know we're meant to be
You're starrin' in my dreams
In magazines
You're lookin' right at me (you're lookin' right at me)
I'm here around the clock
I'm waitin' on your block (I'm waitin' on your block)
But please don't call the cops
They'll make me stop
And I just wanna talk (I just wanna talk)

Bet I could change your life
You could be my wife
Could get into a fight
I'll say, "You're right"
And you'll kiss me goodnight

I waited on the corner 'til I saw the sitter leave
Was easy getting over and I landed on my feet
I came in through the kitchen lookin' for something to eat
I left a calling card so they would know that it was me

I tried to save you, but I failed
Two fifty thousand dollar bail (two hundred fifty thousand dollars)
While I'm away, don't read my mail (don't read my mail)
Just bring a veil (just bring a veil)
And come visit me in jail (visit me in jail)

I'll go back to the diner
I'll write another letter (I'll write another letter)
I hope you'll read it this time
You better

The cops around the corner stopped me when I tried to leave
They told me I was crazy and they knocked me off my feet (they told me I was crazy)
They came in through the kitchen lookin' for something discrete
I left a calling card so they would know that it was me

(Know that it was me, know that it was me)

I memorized your number, now I call you when I please
I tried to end it all, but now I'm back up on my feet
I saw you in the car with someone else and couldn't sleep
If somethin' happens to him, you can bet that it was me
