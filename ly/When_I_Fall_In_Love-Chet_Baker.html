		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
