		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		   True life....
True life... begins behind the borders...
You... will never reach deep waters

The sun arises but you can't see
There is no touch that makes you feel
You trapped yourself inside and awful dream
You locked the door, and lost the key

True life, begins behind the border
That exists inside your head
You will never reach deep waters
And get away from there
Take a look around
And look at what you have
But you will never reach deep waters
If you do not change yourself

Are you afraid to lose your shelter
(don't be too shy to take the risk)
Are you afraid to lose your strength
(maybe there's something you might miss)
But things can only turn out better
(can you imagine what it is)
When your dream comes to and end
(the end, this is the end)

True life, begins behind the border
That exists inside your head
You will never reach deep waters
And get away from there
Take a look around
And look at what you have
But you will never reach deep waters
If you do not change yourself
