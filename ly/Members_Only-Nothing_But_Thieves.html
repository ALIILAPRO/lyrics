		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been hearing this all my life
Sorry, sir, this is members only
Could you please make your way outside?
You can pick up your stuff in the mornin'

Saw it online, started to blind your heart
Now it's enshrined, given in to the dark

Daylight over, roll up, lonely
Ain't I told ya? Members only
And everybody suddenly
"You've got to let it go"

I don't wanna play politics
Sorry, miss, this is members only
I could swear I was on a list
Saw your face in the paper with a warnin'

On the same side all of my life, what gives?
Tolerance dies when it's performative

Daylight over, roll up, lonely
Ain't I told ya? Members only
And everybody suddenly
"You've got to let it go"

Daylight over, roll up, lonely
Ain't I told ya? Members only
And everybody suddenly
"You've got to let it go"
And everybody suddenly
"You've got to let it go"
