		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""I could be foreign forever To your otherland I could be foreign forevermore To your promiseland  One life was great but another No I don't want to live on the edge I won't follow you I found my own I will stay  I could be foreign forever To your hasteland I could be foreign forevermore To your neverland  One little brick then another And I will build that wall anyway You can find me there rested and calm Without mask This is where I will stay  Look around where we are who we are What we always want Twenty-four-seven-three-sixty-five Sometimes little more I was chasing your shadow Not knowing I'd become your slave  I could be foreign forever To your otherland I could be foreign forevermore To your promiseland  One life was great but another No I don't want to live on the edge I won't follow you I found my own I will stay I could stay forevermore  I've said a farewell To never-ending smiles I did not look good in red From my place I can finally See how much Of this shade I called Myself Was me And what was left behind  I could be foreign forever To your otherland I could be foreign forevermore To your promiseland  One life was great but another No I don't want to live on the edge I won't follow you I found my own I will stay I could stay forevermore  I've said a farewell To never-ending smiles From my place I can finally see How much of this shade Was me And what was left behind""
