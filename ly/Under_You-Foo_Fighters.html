		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up and walked a million miles today
I've been looking up and down for you
All this time it still feels just like yesterday
That I walked a million miles with you

Over it
Think I'm gettin' over it
There's no gettin' over it

There are times that I need someone
There are times I feel like no one
Sometimes I just don't know what to do
There are days I can't remember
There are days that last forever
Someday I'll come out from under you
Out from under you

Someone said I'll never see your face again
Part of me just can't believe it's true
Pictures of us sharing songs and cigarettes
This is how I'll always picture you

Over it
Think I'm gettin' over it
There's no gettin' over it

There are times that I need someone
There are times I feel like no one
Sometimes I just don't know what to do
There are days I can't remember
There are days that last forever
Someday I'll come out from under you
Out from under you
Out from under you

There are times I think it's over
There are times I can't recover
Sometimes I just don't know what to do
There are days I can't remember
There are days that last forever
Someday I'll come out from under you
Out from under you

Out from under you
Out from under you
Out from under you
Out from under you
