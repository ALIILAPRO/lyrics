		  Tehran kid man done that drill
Now in Uk you can still see man’s footprint
Don’t doubt that I’m still a Persian gang
You can go ask opps them there
Backroad we robbed their bandoo
Burnt that tracky now mans pissed
20 million plays on platform
Persian gang you know how we doing this shit
East Tehran my weapon was home made
just me and a fuck off shank
Them man wasent even outside
How They claiming to be part of the gang
If school expelled you on June 013
Then u know who got splashed on site
Mans was trapping
When you lot were class clowns
Persian gang the real ones know it
We Unplug them man on the mains
Ain’t no virtual opps out here
U lot listening too much Uk drill
My shit got popped im the hot topic
Cos I was blessed in my grind
We test them toys for a habit
My young gs swing and cheff
Opps them know man got 0 tolerance
If im on it then my brain fuse goes off
This time 4 opps got put in the pack
Cos they see man plugged in with fumez
We Mash up the oppblock with brucky
Watch how them man dash
Tehran We used to circle OT spot & make it Oppy 4 man in a 206 Peugeot Free up my one locked up in HM
Feds got him For GBH
We made Tehran hella Fucked up
Now trynna keep it cool In england
But roads ain’t the way anymore
Cos the route goes to the prison
Where I’m from you have to funds up first
The cope one from A jewellers
My man stressed over a bitch

 21 dumped her after a hit
Waste man ride with a pellet gun
Come and see my ting it says Wesson on it
Dickhead don’t chat shit you might get caught in the mix if I catch me a opp I’ll make him listen
Man swing this Ching in your fucking chest
My attorneys know how to defence
From Tehran I was raising the flag
Now it’s still up in London
I ain’t looking for no headache just make p’s
In my adidas pants
My pairs got left over in back
now they wanna see how I’m progressing
Since young I was trapping
You was a class clown
Joke man
4 blondies here with me
4 word registration plates here with me
Coming from west London to party with me
Nah ain’t no other making it lit like me
Them man vanished when the pack came in
Are they really on it I don’t think so
They just acting like Mehrad ** Since 3 years ago everything has changed
Cos I wanted to stay away from the shit
For my homies I got a “ Qeysari “ attitude
For my opps got no mercy
In the street I’m a badboy
But also a family guy like “ hamsafar “
Still doing roads here and there
And No fear from death
Early morning comes this bad b
But I’m going to sleep with sirens
Trust no one in the streets
Cos they call u bro but it ain’t real
I remember when my user was waiting
And I was stuck up in the traffic
But I wanted the money so in the

 Cold weather jumped on the ped 100g in mans jacket
And broski was no snitch
We both dash out from the feds Like a formula one driver
Like “ panjak’s “ 40 million celebration Everyone goin to eat
But my associates aren’t invited anymore Cos my friends became backsabbers
No invite I entered the rapgame
Just became the most heated like ledger Jumping from the heights with no fear Ain’t no way for me to safe play
Since the beginning it was us man attacking Them man opposite only defence
He didn’t wanted to become a cheff
But we still gave him cheffings
