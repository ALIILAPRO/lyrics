		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't get it (you did good $lick)
I'm just reckless with myself (it's a Smash)
Taking over 
Something only time will tell
Wetto, ayy

Already know what time I'm on, double R slidin' on autobahn
She tryna get my love, the best I can do is a trauma bond
Poppin' these pills got easier, but gettin' high been gettin' harder
Remember them days in maw-maw's house, holdin' on my grandfather
Remember them days in the Envoy, it was just me and Oddy
Now all of my homies got their own bus, but they ain't got time for bondin'
Tellin' myself that it's okay, knowin' that's a lie
Ayy, never at home, just passin' by
I was always told that boys don't cry, why am I so broke inside?
Waste time on an inner child, motherfucker been dead since five
Seen my dad OD at nine, was never the same again
I never had the chance to win

I keep reachin' out for help
I can't tell if I'm too concerned with myself
Feel like I'm just collectin' dust on the shelf (fuck it, fuck it)
I think it's time to bid farewell

Left all the lights on, but I ain't home, thirty thousand feet up
Got my ice on, but I ain't cold, thirty thousand degrees
Yup, I stashed thirty thousand in the freezer
Feel like a crooked congressman
I blame it on Percocets, amnesia, can't keep up with my tolerance
I'm tryna win this war on drugs, but I lost the battle by callin' up the plug
Got back in the saddle
Moth to the flame, I'm insane, all these voices rattle
Foggin' up my brain, numb the pain, locked up in my castle
I'm startin' to unravel, surrounded by all these snakes and jackals
They keep temptin' me to eat that apple
I need the top loose ends, form these threads into a tassel

I keep reachin' out for help
I can't tell if I'm too concerned with myself
Feel like I'm just collectin' dust on the shelf (fuck it, fuck it)
I think it's time to bid farewell
I keep reachin' out for help
I can't tell if I'm too concerned with myself
Feel like I'm just collectin' dust on the shelf (fuck it, fuck it)
I think it's time to bid farewell
