		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never knew this curious head of mine
Never knew what is love if kept inside
Nothing but an endless, empty heart
Like laying a seed within the dark

Give me a piece of your heart, of your heart
Give me a piece of your hands as we go

I wouldn't mind if I can't find, I can't find
Anything to save our kind
All the pieces of my body's gone
Look at me now and tell me how I feel inside
Every pieces that I lost, I have loved

Come, my wonders, after dawn restores
Waiting for the world to turn once more
Listening to the deep magnetic sound
Hunting for a victim, lying down
Come back to me after peace restores
Soulless creatures

Fearsome hearts, I wouldn't lie
I got memories that travels my mind
Fear not, fear not
When you go, I got pieces of your hate in my soul
Look at me now (look at me now)
I'm falling apart in daylight
All the pieces that I've lost, I have loved

Eh eh ah, eh eh ah, oh eh ah, oh
Eh eh ah, eh eh ah, oh eh ah
Eh eh ah, eh eh ah, oh eh ah
Ah
Eh yeah, oh, oi ah
Eh yeah, oh, oi ah
Eh yeah, eh yeah oh

I wouldn't mind if I can't find, I can't find
Anything to save our kind
All the pieces of my body's gone
Look at me now (look at me now)
I'm falling apart in daylight
All the pieces that I lost, I have loved

Look at me now (look at me now)
I gave both sides of me
I give both sides of me
I give both sides of me, oh
