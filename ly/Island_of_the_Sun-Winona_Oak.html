		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When was the light replaced?
Now it's all ice and rain
I used to know your face
Like second nature
When did the darkness come
In between this love?
When did our hearts become strangers?

Come with me, follow me now
I wanna turn this around
Give me a feeling like wow
Paint me with color again
Like it was summer again
I wanna love you like when

Kiss me, kiss me golden
Like our hearts were never broken
On the island of the sun
I-I-Island of the sun
Waves keep crashing over
And our skin tastes like the ocean
On the island of the sun
I-I-Island of the sun

I swear the stars will dance
My body's in your hands
We got the promise land
Why waste it?

Come with me, follow me now
I wanna turn this around
Give me a feeling like wow
Paint me with color again
Like it was summer again
I wanna love you like when

Kiss me, kiss me golden
Like our hearts were never broken
On the island of the sun
I-I-Island of the sun
Waves keep crashing over
And our skin tastes like the ocean
On the island of the sun
I-I-Island of the sun

Oh, take me back, take me back
I wanna feel you on my skin
Take me back, take me back
I wanna hold you like it's summertime
Like I never lost your light
Make it last, make it last, make it last, make it last

Kiss me, kiss me golden
Like our hearts were never broken
On the island of the sun
I-I-Island of the sun
Waves keep crashing over
And our skin tastes like the ocean
On the island of the sun
I-I-Island of the sun

(Island of the sun)
(Island of the sun)
(Island of the sun)
(I-I-Island of the sun)
