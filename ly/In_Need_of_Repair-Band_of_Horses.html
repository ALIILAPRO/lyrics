		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, hey you, what's the matter, you?
Can't do all the things that we used to do
And it sucks and it's bad

And who's a good boy? What's a killjoy?
Got some money, now we're fighting over new toys
Isn't it sad?

I'm sitting in my usual chair
Feeling the walls around me close in
I'm in a state of disrepair
And trying to make it 'til the morning

It's not enough, it's not enough
Every single day I hide from hurt

Staying friends is really fantastic
We'll be together from the cradle to the casket
Well, maybe
It's been a while since I talked with you
I heard about what you're going through
And it's crazy, shit's crazy

You're dealing with a dilemma
And running out of air
But holding it all together
With a piece of tape in need of repair

It's not enough, it's not enough
Even in the night I hide from hurt
The ones you love, you only hurt the ones you love
Every day and night I hide from hurt

I found my place back at the table
Back in my usual chair
And everything's gonna be fine
What's my problem? I need repair

In need of repair
(It's not enough, the ones you love, it's not enough)
In need of repair
(It's not enough, the ones you love, it's not enough)
In need of repair
(It's not enough, ones you love, the ones you love)
Need of, in need of repair
