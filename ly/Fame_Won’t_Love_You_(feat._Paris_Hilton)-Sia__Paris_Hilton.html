		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch children cry
The pageant sells the lie
Third place isn't winning, you know
And neither is first
The pressure and the thirst
For the skeleton's show

I am so thin skinned
Don't scratch the surface
Please let me live within
Within this circus

Little dreams come crashing
Let them wave in passing
'Cause fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should
And you may wish for Oscars, Grammys and blockbusters
Fame won't love you like a brother, like a lover should
Oh, no, no, fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should
Whoa-oh-oh, ohh-oh, fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should

I searched in your eyes for some glimmer of light
Tap dancing for one million miles
I looked for the smiles
Hoping in them I'd find validation for my futile existence

I am so thin skinned
Don't scratch the surface
Please let me live within
Within this circus

Little dreams come crashing
Let them wave in passing
'Cause fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should
And you may wish for Oscars, Grammys and blockbusters
'Cause fame won't love you like a brother, like a lover should
No, no, fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should
No, no, fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should

No-oh-ohh, fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should
Whoa-oh-oh, ohh-oh, fame won't love you like a mother, like a father should
Whoa-oh-oh
