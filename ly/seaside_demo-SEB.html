		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, baby do you wanna be mine
Maybe we can see the seaside
Wanna kick it with you (I cant even lie)

Cupid hit me with a bullseye
Hit hard so I wanted to cry
Girl, I wanna be with you

I wanna pick you up
Picnics in the back of my pick up truck
Got drinks and movies and snacks for us
Kissing on ya neck like Dracula

I need some blood
With some of your love
We can live forever
You don't ever got to run

Hi, baby do you wanna be mine
Maybe we can see the seaside
Wanna kick it with you (I cant even lie)

Cupid hit me with a bullseye
Hit hard so I wanted to cry
Girl, I wanna be with you

It's getting late
What you wanna do
It's already half past two
And baby girl just to tell the truth
I don't really like the sky
The color blue

With that said
Who are you on the phone
When you typing
Is ya man at home
Y'all be fighting
Girl you need something new
(Well, I said)

Hi, baby do you wanna be mine
Maybe we can see the seaside
Wanna kick it with you (I cant even lie)

Cupid hit me with a bullseye
Hit hard so I wanted to cry
Girl, I wanna be with you
