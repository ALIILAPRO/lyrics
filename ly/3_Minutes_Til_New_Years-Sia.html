		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whether you're partying out, whether you're partying at home
Partying together or partying alone
It's gonna be a happy New Year, not too long
Come with me, this is my New Year's song
Let's count, baby, I'll tell you when
I'll tell you when and then we're gonna scream

Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, balloons to burst
Balloons to burst

If you've had a happy year
Or a sad year
It's a new year, now there's nothing to fear
No, nothing to fear, now, no
Oh, there's nothing to fear, it's a new year
We got balloons to burst

Grab a boy now or kiss a girl, wow
Grab a dog or a cat or yourself right now
It's gonna be a happy New Year, yeah, no doubt
Yeah, it's New Year's Eve and we're gonna count down
One, two, three, I want you, baby
I want you and we're gonna scream

Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (woo)
Balloons to burst, balloons to burst
Balloons to burst

If you've had a happy year
Or a sad year
It's a new year, now there's nothing to fear
No, nothing to fear, now, no
No, there's nothing to fear
It's a new year
We got balloons to burst

It's a new year, now there's nothing to fear
No, nothing to fear, now, no
Oh, there's nothing to fear, it's a new year
We got balloons to burst

Okay, are you ready now?
It's time
Ten
Nine
Eight
Seven
Six
Five
Four, three, two, one

Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Yeah, let's kiss, kiss, kiss (ah-ah)
(Let's kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss)
Kiss, kiss, kiss

If you've had a happy year
Or a sad year
It's a New year, now there's nothing to fear
No, nothing to fear, now, no
No, there's nothing to fear, it's a New Year
We got balloons to burst
