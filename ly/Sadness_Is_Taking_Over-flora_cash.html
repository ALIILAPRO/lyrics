		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we were frozen you
You took the cold away
When we were primal love
You took the old away
And now we go to bed and then you turn away
Do you remember all we sacrificed?
The pain
Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth yeah
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind yeah
"And it's like nothing ever happened"
Don't you tell me
"And it's like nothing ever happened"
Don't you play with me
Minutes, hours, seconds, eons go
I don't, I don't, we don't need to know
We don't have it, every answer still
Could it be that we don't own the will
Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth yeah
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind yeah
"And it's like nothing ever happened"
Don't you tell me
"And it's like nothing ever happened"
Don't you play with me (yeah)
See life in the right light
It's a bright ride ain't it baby?
One time we were so high
See the bright side won't you baby?
Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth yeah
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind yeah
Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth yeah
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind yeah
"And it's like nothing ever happened"
Don't you tell me
