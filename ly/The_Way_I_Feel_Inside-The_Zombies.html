		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should I try to hide
The way I feel inside
My heart for you?

Would you say that you
Would try to love me too?

In your mind
Could you ever be
Really close to me?

I can tell the way you smile
If I feel that I
Could be certain then
I would say the things I want to say tonight

But 'til I can see
That you'd really care for me
I will dream
That someday you'll be
Really close to me

I can tell the way you smile
If I feel that I
Could be certain then
I would say the things I want to say tonight

But 'til I can see
That you'd really care for me
I'll keep trying to hide
The way I feel inside
