		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinkin' Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Tryna make it work, but man, these times are hard
She needs me now, but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doin' our best
Tryna make it work, but man, these times are hard

But we're gonna start by
Drinkin' old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Sayin' things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smilin' but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feelin' that we're meetin'
For the first time

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
And we both know how 
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up, you get kicked to the dirt
Tryna make it work, but man, these times are hard

But we're gonna start by
Drinkin' old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Doin' things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smilin' but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feelin' that we're meetin'
For the first time

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Yeah

Drinkin' old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Sayin' things we haven't for a while
We're smilin' but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feelin' that we're meetin'
For the first time

Ooh (yeah, for the first time)
Ooh (oh, for the first time)
Ooh (yeah, for the first time)
We just now got the feelin' that we're meetin'
For the first time

Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're makin' us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're makin' us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby

Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're makin' us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're makin' us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
