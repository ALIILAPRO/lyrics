		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One shot, one gun no, no I know I'm not
Two shots, one cop i'ma fight an opp
Yeah, I'ma yeah, I don't ever learn
If he is a fed, he get bled
He get fucking shot
Yeah, he get fucking shot
I like guns, I like dots
I like ripping body parts
I like when the body stop i'm tweaking
Every weekend this a nose shot
Have him leaking

Nightmare, it's a nightmare, oh
It's a living nightmare
It's a nightmare, it's a nightmare, oh
It's a living nightmare
It's a nightmare, it's a nightmare, oh
It's a living nightmare
It's nightmare, it's a nightmare, oh
It's a living nightmare



It's a nightmare, it's a nightmare
It's a living nightmare
Nightmare, it's a nightmare
Oh, night-night-night
