		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah-eah, yeah-eah (ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-ah (oh-oh)

She talkin' that noise, take her lovin' with the dawn 
All while I talk on the phone
After we fuck in the morn' she wake up, she wearin' my clothes
She always be callin' my phone
She always be stealin' my clothes, yeah
Askin' me, "how does it feel when you know you could buy you the store?" 
Ayy, I'm Bathing Ape down to the floor
Ayy, I'm droppin' the four in the foreign
Ayy, I came a long way on my own
Ayy, I'm doin' this shit on my own
Ayy, I don't give a fuck what I'm told
Ayy, I came a long way on my own
Ayy, like her pussy made out of gold
Ayy, I swear her pussy ownin' my soul
She got that sauce, yeah
Four days a hundred thousand
Forever like a diamond
She bring me back to life, yeah
I'm so fly I'm Martian
Quit talkin' all that nonsense
I'm just tryna fuck you 'til you don't know nothin', oh-oh-oh

I cross my T's and dot my I's, yeah, I'm for real (yeah, I'm for real)
He hold me down (she hold me down) 
That's my shield (that's my shield)
He buy whatever, he know the drill (know the drill)
Don't need no pill (no pill, no)
He whispered in my ear and told me 

Feel (feel, feel, oh-oh)
Feel (feel, oh, ah-ah)
Feel (feel, oh, feel)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (feel, feel, yeah, no)

He love that I say what I feel
He feel what I say 'cause it's real
You couldn't forget, I never changed up on my set
And I only make calls to collect, that's why we connect
We can go half on a jet, baby, we on to the next
Fuck all the stress
Fuckin' with bitches who's new to the game when you got you a vet'
I know you like it when I act like I'm still shy
Then turn around and put that thing in overdrive
I'm down to ride
I'ma keep you on my shoulder
'Cause every cold nigga need a bitch that's ten times colder

I cross my T's and dot my I's, yeah, I'm for real (yeah, I'm for real)
He hold me down (she hold me down) 
That's my shield (that's my shield)
He buy whatever, he know the drill (know the drill)
Don't need no pill (no pill, no)
He whispered in my ear and told me 

Feel (feel, yeah)
Feel, ayy (feel me, feel me)
Feel (feel), oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (feel, feel, oh)

Hey, fuck me 'til I can't see straight
Make me think that ho was a mistake
I just need to feel you all the time
Ride ho, ride ho, ride
