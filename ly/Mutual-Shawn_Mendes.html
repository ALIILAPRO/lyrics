		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want? Uh

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

This inconsistency
What doesn't mean you got me questioning
The way you act and take it back, do I mean anything?
Just tell me honesty

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want? Uh

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

Are you playing me
Is this a game?
When you show up late
Say love at 2AM
Then tell me you can't say
Girl, yeah
What do you want from me?

Baby oh, I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me
