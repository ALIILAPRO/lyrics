		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was looking at you
And you were looking at me
And then I asked you to dance
Until you wanted to leave
Then we went back to my house
And I asked what do you think
You told me you think it's nice and if there's
Something to drink
I told her I have some seltzers
You want yellow or pink
She said it really don't matter
Do you have any weed
I told her I got an eighth
But I ain't smoke In two weeks
She told me I'm such a light weight
You'll be higher than me
So then I rolled us a blunt
She started kissing my neck
I thought that we'd probably Fuck
And wake up late in my bed
Until we started just talking having so much in Common
Now my feelings are cautious cuz I know what it Is
I'm Probably
Falling Slowly
And you're getting to know me I'm getting to know you
You're Falling Slowly
This was not suppose to happen
We're
Falling Slowly
And you're getting to know me I'm getting to know you
You're Falling Slowly
This was not suppose to happen
Now we talk on the phone
And it's like every night
I should be working on music
But you're calling my line
I told you fuck all the talking
You should really just slide
You told me okay I will
I'll probably be there in five
You showed up late in a sweatshirt
And some leggings on tight
You asked if I had some cups because you stopped and got wine
You said I got us some red because I didn't want white
You cuddled up In my arms and you were holding on tight
I started moving my hands
You started kissing my neck
Then we went back to my bed
And I remember you said
That there's nobody better
I could fuck you forever
Tried to think it's whatever
But I Felt it Again
I started
Falling Slowly
And you're getting to know me I'm getting to know you
You're Falling Slowly
This was not suppose to happen
We're
Falling Slowly
And you're getting to know me I'm getting to know you
You're Falling Slowly
This was not suppose to happen
