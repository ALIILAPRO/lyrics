		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Barely made my flight, we were up all night
Now I'm thinking 'bout you
When you look to the sky in the middle of the night
Know I'm thinking 'bout you
When I'm up this high with the city this bright
Yeah, I'm thinking 'bout you
As the clouds go by and you're on the other side
Yeah, I think about you

It's never easy to leave you, leave you
Going back and forth
In and out the door
You can bet that I bleed too, take me back to shore
Where we were before
Where the waves were warm
I don't wanna be on my own again
When I'm far away and I need a friend to hold
I don't wanna play pretend right now, we just need to bend
We're ascending, barely hanging on
What's this planet that we've landed on?

Barely made my flight, we were up all night
Now I'm thinking 'bout you
When you look to the sky in the middle of the night
Know I'm thinking 'bout you
When I'm up this high with the city this bright
Yeah, I'm thinking 'bout you
As the clouds go by and you're on the other side
Yeah, I think about you

Heavier than metal
You been running for some time
Dreaming in a vessel
Do you ever wanna let go?
Faster than the devil
Sending signals in the sky
Never hearing back in time
Are you there baby?
Made me look the other way
No longer summer days
They see it in my face
I know it's just a graze
They got me in a maze
And I hope it's just a phase
I can't see you gone away
Never mending all the way
I don't want no longer days
I don't want no longer days, I pray

Barely made my flight, we were up all night
Now I'm thinking 'bout you
When you look to the sky in the middle of the night
Know I'm thinking 'bout you
When I'm up this high with the city this bright
Yeah, I'm thinking 'bout you
As the clouds go by and you're on the other side
Yeah, I think about you
