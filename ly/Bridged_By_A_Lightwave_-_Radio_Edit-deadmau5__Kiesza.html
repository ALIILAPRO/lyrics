		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I flew to Japan, and stood beside the waves with you
And danced across your face
Would we forget that we were strangers?
If I was there to take it in
And walk between the changing spaces
Danced through night in altered places
Would a fire begin?

Gone on a fast train
Oceans of blank space
High on an airplane
Bridged by a lightwave
All but a 3D place

If I went back in time
Removed the boulders that still chase us
Would we still let lust create us
Or would we start to climb?
If our dimensions were the same
If I could touch you in the flesh
Fold the time and space between us
Would yours fall into mine?

Shadows on our stage
Oceans of blank space
High on an airplane
Bridged by a lightwave
All but a 3D place
