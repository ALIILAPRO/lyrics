		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, yeah, you can do it

I couldn't give a damn what you say to me
I don't really care what you think of me
'Cause either way you're gonna think what you believe
There's nothing you could say that would hurt me
I'm better off without you anyway
I thought it would be hard, but I'm okay
I don't need you if you're gonna be that way
'Cause with me, it's all or nothing

I'm sick of this shit
Don't deny
You're a waste of time
I'm sick of this shit
Don't ask why

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone
So long
I can do better
I can do better
Hey, hey, you
I found myself again
That's why
You're gone
I can do better
I can do better

You're so full of shit
I can't stand the way you act
You just can't comprehend
I don't think that you can handle it
I'm way over, over it
I will drink as much Limoncello as I can
And I'll do it again and again
I don't really care what you have to say
'Cause you know, you know you're nothing

(I'm so sick)
I'm sick of your shit
Don't deny
You're a waste of time
I'm sick of your shit
Don't ask why

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone
So long
I can do better
I can do better
Hey, hey, you
I found myself again
That's why
You're gone
I can do better
I can do better

What'd you say?
I told you so
You know that 'cause I always know
Get outta my face
Hey, hey
You're not my taste
Hey, hey
I am so sick of you
You're on my nerves
I want to puke
Get outta my face
Hey, hey
You're not my taste
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone
So long
I can do better
I can do better
Hey, hey, you
I found myself again
That's why
You're gone
I can do better
I can do better

I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone
So long
I can do better
I can do better
Hey, hey, you
I found myself again
That's why
You're gone
I can do better
I can do better
