		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early in the morning 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Crying and pleading won't do no good
Come back, baby, I wish you would

I love you, baby, can't help myself
I wouldn't mistreat you with no one else
Tell me, baby, what you trying to do
Love me and another man too
Hugging and kissing late at night
Really makes my baby feel alright
Staying out drinking all night long
Drove my baby away from home
Please, pretty baby, give me one more chance
You know I love you, wanna be your man

Crying and pleading won't do no good
Come back, baby, I wish you would
I love you, baby, can't help myself
I wouldn't mistreat you with no one else
Hugging and kissing late at night
Really makes my baby feel alright

Easy, take it easy now

Early in the morning before the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Crying and pleading won't do no good
Come back, baby, I wish you would

I love you, baby, can't help myself
I wouldn't mistreat you with no one else
Tell me, baby, what you trying to do
Loving me and another man too
Hugging and kissing late at night
Really make my baby feel alright
