		  Well, that's alright now mama
That's alright with you
That's alright now mama, just anyway you do
That's alright, that's alright
That's alright now mama, anyway you do

Well mama, she done told me, papa done told me too
"Son, that gal you're foolin' with
She ain't no good for you"
But that's alright now, that's alright
That's alright now mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's alright, that's alright
That's alright now mama, anyway you do

Ah dala dee dee deelee
Dee dee deelee
Dee dee deelee, I need your lovin'

That's alright
That's alright now mama, anyway you do
