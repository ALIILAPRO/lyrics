		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Type of time you on (Metro)
Chanel cover, it's on my mother
Hot in the mall
Type of time we on
(All the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live)

Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Seven different days, yeah
365, all the way live, drop
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on

Shave my back against the wall (wall), I can't find no flaw (flaw, flaw)
If I ever fall, I'ma take the fall (yeah)
I can soar so high, don't need webs to crawl (webs to crawl)
I can soar so high, don't need webs to crawl (soar)
The world's in my hand, God powers my palm (in my palm)
Look over the city, 'cause I'm on my own (own)
Life can be so tricky, got my mind just gone (just gone)
Got my mind (go, go)
Got no time for mingling, my senses tingling (tingling)
Every time I save the world, I think about my friends
I wish that I didn't have to pretend
But if I take my mask off, I blend in

Type of time we on, type of time we on (yeah)
Type of time we on, type of time we on (let's go)
Seven different days, yeah
365, all the way live, drop
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
(All the way live, all the way live)

Trackhawk with the low suspension
Just so we can ride revengeful
High performance, so expensive
My gang, we the avengers
Solitaries, like venom
Too many racks stuck in my denim
All the way live, I swear we gon' get fast, hey
All the way live, I'm making you a habit
All the way live, 365
Seven days a week, we catchin' a vibe

Type of time we on, type of time we on (yeah)
Type of time we on, type of time we on (let's go)
Seven different days, yeah
365, all the way live, drop
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on

Got no time for mingling, my senses tingling
Every time I save the world, I think about my friends
I wish that I didn't have to pretend
But if I take my mask off, I blend in
I'm feelin' high, I'm feelin' high
I'm feelin' high, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-
I'm feeling high, I'm feeling high
I'm feelin' high, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-

(You know you're supposed to catch the bad guys, right?)
I always do, usually
