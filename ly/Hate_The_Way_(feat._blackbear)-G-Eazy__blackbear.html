		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I hate the way, the way, I always miss you
Yeah, I know I'm crazy, but you're sick too
Even after everything we've been through
Thought I was the one with all the issues
And every time I leave, it's too long
And every time I leave, it's all wrong (you know)
I hate the way, the way, I always miss you (ayy, yeah) 
(I hate the way, the way, I always miss you)
Yeah (yeah)

Made a promise to myself, a promise I should stick to
Talking to myself, I said I promised I would quit you
I've been trying to let go, but it's powerful, it grips you
First you think you got control, until I see you can't resist you
Know I got my issues, some I won't admit to
No one's got the answers, everybody wants to fix you
Got this Magic 8-Ball, but I ain't got no crystal
Just don't fall in Courtney Love, and don't go Cobain with no pistol
It don't take a psychic or a scientist to know that
And why the fuck the minute I see you, I always go back?
The definition of "insanity" is, yeah I know that
I had a hundred chances to move on I always, I always blow that
Yeah, I can't seem to find out what's the issue
See your face on my explore and then I miss you
Yeah, I said I was finished fucking with you
I said I hate the fucking way I always miss you (miss you)

Yeah, I know I'm crazy but you're sick too
Even after everything we've been through
Thought I was the one with all the issues
And every time I leave, it's too long
And every time I leave, it's all wrong
I hate the way, the way, I always miss you (yeah)
(I hate the way, the way, I always miss you) (ayy, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

Lie to myself every time I say that I'm done with you
Every day without you passes slower than one with you
Two days passed, this feelin' like a week, this shit is stressful
I swear all these helping hands ain't even helpful
Wishing I was closer to you, wish you wasn't distant
Wishing I was with you still, wish this shit was different
Wishing we could travel back in time and we can switch it
All this pain, wishing it was something that could fix it
Medicate myself, different substances I mix it
Set my limit, try to draw the line and then she sniffs it
Never lied, I give you my word and then you twist it
Fights outside the club, I think the paparazzi, think the paparazzi flicked it
Yeah, still can't seem to find out what's the issue
Hate the way you talking when you with your friends, too
Yeah, they don't know about the shit we've been through
I said I hate the fucking way I always miss you (miss you)

Yeah, I know I'm crazy but you're sick too
Even after everything we've been through
Thought I was the one with all the issues
And every time I leave, it's too long
And every time I leave, it's all wrong
I hate the way, the way, I always miss you 
(I hate the way, the way, I always miss you)
I hate the way, the way, I always miss you
(I hate the way, the way, I always miss you)
I hate the way, the way, I always miss you

I hate the way, the way, I always miss you
