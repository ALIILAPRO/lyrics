		  Shout out MIKA 
(Mad bruh)

New bands
Rap got me feeling like a new man (new money)
Same idea, new plan
I got it poppin', I ain't even have to shoot man
They don't do road or do gang
That's why it's peak when the truth lands
That's why it's deep when the truth speaks
Did it in a year, fourteen days
Now man are too weak
My flows are too unique
4AM, I'm cooking up new beats
Who's pushin' like Meekz? (No one)
Can't get stupid like Meekz
Leave the beat all duppied like me
Six figures on my new white tee
Right please, listen to me YGs (listen)
Until you clean your Ps
You will never find peace (trust fam)
Who am I to speak?
Fuck it, who am I to preach?
Need a new piece, a new time piece
Used to hit the motorway to find fiends
Flashing lights and when I hit the studio
I make the mic bleed
Can't stop until my mind's free

I can't believe they're making Meekz-type beats
It makes my knees quite weak
Shit they even tryna speak like me
They ain't deep like me
They ain't street like me (never)
I don't even wanna be like me (c'mon)

Now they go to YouTube and type me
But be like me? That's highly unlikely
I think I'm rich in my new Nike tee
New topic, don't cop it if you can't buy three (if you cna't buy three)
But you just wanna be that young fly G (real shit)
Before you buy weed
The runner's gotta run it by me (ask me man)
Ayy, no one in the game that's coming like me (no one)
Cook it straight out the oven like me
All they say is, "That how you're coming my G?" (like me)
I just think of fuck shit when I'm bunning my trees
'Cause I'm sick of seeing runners and fiends
Now I'm running my team
Ask the labels, ain't nobody stubborn like me (ask 'em)
Don't make me get blood on my jeans
I don't sell songs, they're never gonna buy Meekz (never)
So let me fly please
This life's deep, so let me catch a flight please
Let me smoke my weed
New money so clean, same routine
Cash your signature for Ps
They're never gonna sign me

On my block's where you'll find me
But you could never be like me
Can't believe they're making Meekz-type beats
It makes my knees quite weak
Shit they even tryna speak like me
They ain't deep like me
They ain't street like me
I don't even wanna be like me
Can't believe they're making Meekz-type beats
It makes my knees quite weak
Shit they even tryna speak like me
They ain't deep like me
They ain't street like me (yeah)

Catch me dipping in a go-kart
Gotta go home or go hard
Everything I touch so hard
Natural, now they wanna quote ours
Got me wishing on my own stars (for real man)
I just wish I dealt my own cards
Or maybe I did
Gotta get it how we live
No one to blame for this shit (no one)
And that's the craziest shit
Got me thinking 'bout my life while I'm blazing my spliff
No make up, my bitch
Now it's big, big, legit
Got me acting a prick
I feel broker than rich
I might ghost for a bit
And let 'em use my flows for a bit
I does speak the truth
I never hope for a hit (never)
Now all dem olders are pissed
Cah I stepped in with smoke on my hip
I got bros on my chain
And half a brick of coke on my wrist
I could have my phones going sick (brr)
Trap was colder than shit
I made a home with the nits
I sell stones and invest it in sticks
I cop big bits
Press ya tryna get rich
Would've thought I'm tryna make the rich list
Tell my missus I don't care about no daft bitches
So when the mask comes off, it's mad business (mad business)
But I still buy bits off the shoplifters (for real)
Top-notch hitters

On my block's where you'll find me
You could never be like me
Can't believe they're making Meekz-type beats
It makes my knees quite weak
Shit they even tryna speak like me
They ain't deep like me
They ain't street like me
I don't even wanna be like me
Can't believe they're making Meekz-type beats
It makes my knees quite weak
Shit they even tryna speak like me
They ain't deep like me
They ain't street like me
