		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This life feels hollow and mostly borrowed
The voices are screaming but where is the meaning?
Noisy crescendos behind closed windows
The floor is a ceiling, I can't find the feeling
Oh, tell me, love, tell me
Am I dreaming, and where is the meaning?
Oh, tell me, love

Let it happen, let it happen
Tomorrow knows what tomorrow knows
You can't make it get here sooner
Let it happen, let it happen
I don't hold what the future holds
But I know You're my future

The fever is breaking, my body is aching
What's worth defending if everything's ending?
The current is endless, the river relentless
Love, tell me, love
Oh, am I dreaming, and what is the meaning?
Love, tell me, love, tell me

Let it happen, let it happen
Tomorrow knows what tomorrow knows
You can't make it get here sooner
Let it happen, let it happen
I don't hold what the future holds
But I know You hold my future

Let it happen, let it happen
Tomorrow knows what tomorrow knows
You can't make it get here sooner
Let it happen, let it happen
I don't hold what the future holds
But I know you're my future
