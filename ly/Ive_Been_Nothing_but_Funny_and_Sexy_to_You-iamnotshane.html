		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop with the small talk
I don't wanna know what you did last night
Are you done pretending
Like I'm not the
Love of your life?
I know what you want
You know what I got
You know It's exhausting being this hot
This is how you treat me?
After all that I've done
Oh my God
Am I enough?
I'm so tired of waiting
I wanna be what you want
I've been nothing but funny and sexy to you
Like honey I sweeten the truth
My body I built just for you
And you cashed out
You withdrew
Your lovin' for somebody new
Who funded you out of your blues
And managed
To keep you amused
Now I gotta write this song for you
Funny and sexy to you
Like honey I sweeten the truth
My body I built just for you
Now I gotta write this song for you
All locked up
In your cell phone
You let the money trail lead you home
So many options
For you to pursue
You should know better
When the time comes
No one's gonna love you like I did once
Don't overthink it
I am the one
Oh my God
Am I enough?
I'm so tired of waiting
I wanna be what you want
I've been nothing but funny and sexy to you
Like honey I sweeten the truth
My body I built just for you
And you cashed out
You withdrew
Your lovin' for somebody new
Who funded you out of your blues
And managed
To keep you amused
Now I gotta write this song for you
Funny and sexy to you
Like honey I sweeten the truth
My body I built just for you
Now I gotta write this song for you
Funny and sexy to you
Like honey I sweeten the truth
My body I built just for you
I've been nothing but funny and sexy to you
Like honey I sweeten the truth
My body I built just for you
And you cashed out
You withdrew
Your lovin' for somebody new
Who funded you out of your blues
And managed
To keep you amused
Now I gotta write this song for you
