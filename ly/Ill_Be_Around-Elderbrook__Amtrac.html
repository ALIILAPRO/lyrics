		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll lend you water
And share my wine
For The glimmer in your eye
It's like a mother's daughter
Or December morning
Like beauty by design, yeah

I'll be here if you need me
Like a light in the evening
By your side when you're sleeping, oh

I'll be there if you need me
I'll be there if you need
I'll be there for you
Little love (little love)

Till they rest my bones on the cold ground
I'll be around
Till they rest my bones
Till they lay me down

I'll be around -round
I'll be around
I'll be around -round
I'll be around

I'll be around -round
I'll be around
I'll be around -round
I'll be around

I've seen an angel
We spoke a while
She stole me overnight
By the break of morning
I can see it all end
But you don't have to cry, love

I'll be here if you need me
Like a light in the evening
By your side when you're sleeping, oh

I'll be there if you need me
I'll be there if you need me

Till they rest my bones on the cold ground
I'll be around
Till they rest my bones
Until they lay me down

Till they rest my bones on the cold ground
I'll be around
Till they rest my bones
Till they lay me down

I'll be around -round
Even when I let go
I'll be holding onto you
I'll be holding onto you

I'll be around -round
Honey, when you get old
You'll be holding onto someone new
If they haven't got a heart then I do
If I could around for you, if I could be around for you

Till they rest my bones on the cold ground
I'll be around
Till they rest my bones on the cold ground
I'll be around

I'll be around -round
I'll be around
