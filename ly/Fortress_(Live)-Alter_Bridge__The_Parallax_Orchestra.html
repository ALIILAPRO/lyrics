		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I lost to wander forever
Perhaps for the rest of my days?
If all that has been surrounded will just go to waste

You left me out in the distance
To wander this world on my own
Sometimes it's so hard to admit it but I can't let go
I can't let you go

Go on and take it all, go on and take it all
Fortress coming down
I know we can't save it all I know we can't save it all
Everything is gone
Oh I have seen it all Oh I have seen it all
Fortress coming down
Go on and take it all, go on and take it all

One thing I know is for certain
We cannot have all we want
Still this will not stop the hurting, It is never gone

Now I hold on to the one thing
Too fragile to stand on its own
The fortress we built it is crumbling still I can't let go
I can't let you go

Go on and take it all, go on and take it all
Fortress coming down
I know we can't save it all I know we can't save it all
Everything is gone
Oh I have seen it all Oh I have seen it all
Fortress coming down
Go on and take it all, go on and take it all

Fortress coming down

Oh, there'll come a time, yes I know
There'll come a time you'll look back and regret when it's gone
You'll look back and regret when I's gone
Oh, here'll come a time yes I know
There'll come a time you look back and regret when it's gone
You'll look back and regret when I's gone

In the end, too far gone, this I can't deny
Still I keep holding on and on
There's still time
On the outside looking in everything seems fine
But the fortress caving in comes down
On me tonight

Go on and take it all, go on and take it all
Fortress coming down
I know we can't save it all I know we can't save it all
Everything is gone
Oh I have seen it all Oh I have seen it all
Fortress coming down
Go on and take it all, go on and take it all

Just take it all
Just take it all
Just take it all
