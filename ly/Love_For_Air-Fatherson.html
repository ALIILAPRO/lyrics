		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's harder now than it needs to be
And if our time runs out I want you to believe
That I waited so long for you
I guess I'll wait a little longer too

But I'm not scared
I'll keep running, running till you're there
Out from underneath it isn't fair
I'll be loving you so long I swear 
I'd replace your love for air

I want you closer now
Than we used to be 
We're on the road from doubt
To where we need to be
If you keep chasing in between the lines 
Then you hold your heart back all the time

But I'm not scared
I'll keep running running till you're there
Out from underneath it isn't fair 
I'll be loving you so long I swear 
I'd replace your love for air

But I'm not scared
I'll keep running, running till you're there
Out from underneath it isn't fair
I'll be loving you so long I swear 
I'd replace your love for air

I would

But I'm not scared
I'll keep running running till you're there
Out from underneath it isn't fair 
I'll be loving you so long I swear 
I'd replace your love for air

But I'm not scared
I'll keep running, running till you're there
Out from underneath it isn't fair
I'll be loving you so long I swear 
I'd replace your love for air
