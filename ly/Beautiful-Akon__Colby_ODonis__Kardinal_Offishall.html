		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see you
I run out of words, to say (ahh)
I wouldn't leave you
'Cause you're that type of girl to make me stay (ahh)
I see the guys tryin' to holla
Girl, I don't wanna bother you
'Cause you're independent, and you got my attention
Can I be your baby father?
Girl, I just wanna show you
That I love what you are doin' 'cause

I see you in the club, you gettin' down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin' thugs love
I wanna get with you
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful

Like the clouds you drift me away
Far away, yeah
And like the sun you, brighten my day
You brighten my day, yeah
I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie
Said I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie

I see you in the club, you gettin' down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin' thugs love
I wanna get with you
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful

Kardinal told you (you), whether the sky blue or yellow
This fellow ain't that mellow if it ain't about you (you)
Hourglass shape make the place go "oooh"
Waistline makes my soldier salute
I'm a brute (brute) high from ya high heel game
High heels push up ya ass last name
And you livin' in the fast lane, eyes like an angel
Goddess, watch my girl and how she undress
Spotless, hotness bad to the bone
Make me wanna bone, put me in a triple-X zone (zone)
Lames don't know how to talk to you
So let me walk, with you, hold my hand
I'ma spend them grands but after you undress
Not like a hooker, but more like a princess
Queen, empress, president 
Pull any way, you got my love 'cause you're beautiful, okay?

I see you in the club, you gettin' down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin' thugs love
I wanna get with you
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful

Where'd you come from you're outta this world
To me (oh oh)
You're a symbol of what a big beautiful woman should be (ooh wee) (oh oh)

I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie
Said I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry
And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie

I see you in the club, you gettin' down, girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin' thugs love
I wanna get with you
You're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
Said you're so beautiful, so damn beautiful
You're so beautiful
