		  This is called
The Bisexual Anthem
Bi pride stand up

I like girls, I like guys
I like to eat the pussy then again I like to ride
Yeah, I love kissin' on girls and then I put the dick inside
I'm bisexual, bitch, and I ain't got nothin' to hide

Yeah, these bitches hatin' on me 'cause I'm confident in me
Better not forget the B in LGBT
And y'all like to say we selfish, yeah, y'all say we like to cheat
But I don't date both at the same time, haters have a seat
I like girls, oh my gosh, big booty, big tits
I like guys too though, super sexy, big dick
And if you hatin' on me, ho, then I'm down, big shit
And if you curious I got you baby girl, quick fix

"How the fuck you date a guy when you're bi
You're a fake ass dyke I don't like you, I won't lie
You cannot date both, pick a side, pick a side
Do you like fuckin' girls or do you like fuckin guys?"
I like both, bi pride stand up
I like a girly little thing and my dude manned up
Walk into the strip club and then I throw my bands up
Then when he give me sloppy top he like to throw my hands up
If I wanna date a girl and we don't work out then it's cool
Sexuality is fluid, it's okay to date a dude
And if I date a fuckin' guy and we break up 
It's okay to date a pretty girl, ain't no fake love

I like girls, I like guys
I like to eat the pussy then again I like to ride
Yeah, I love kissin' on girls and then I put the dick inside
I'm bisexual, bitch, and I ain't got nothin' to hide

Yeah, these bitches hatin' on me 'cause I'm confident in me
Better not forget the B in LGBT
And y'all like to say we selfish, yeah, y'all say we like to cheat
But I don't date both at the same time, haters have a seat
I like girls, oh my gosh, big booty, big tits
I like guys too though, super sexy, big dick
And if you hatin' on me, ho, then I'm down, big shit
And if you curious I got you baby girl, quick fix

I met a cute little shorty way back in '08
I was really in denial I was like, "No, wait"
I met a dude up in high school, I was so confused
How the fuck do I like girls then I started likin' dudes
Then I realized, ain't no rules to this shit
Ain't a crime to like pussy, ain't a crime to like dick
Ain't a crime to be whoever, whenever, man, I'm sick
I'm a bi girl bitch, lil fly girl bitch
B-I to the S-E-X-U-A
It's a L if you hatin' on me, bitch, I slay
No I am not gay and no I am not straight
I'm the B in this bitch, bi pride all day

I like girls, I like guys
I like to eat the pussy then again I like to ride
Yeah, I love kissin' on girls and then I put the dick inside
I'm bisexual bitch and I ain't got nothin' to hide

Yeah, these bitches hatin' on me 'cause I'm confident in me
Better not forget the B in LGBT
And y'all like to say we selfish, yeah, y'all say we like to cheat
But I don't date both at the same time, haters have a seat (hell nah)
I like girls, oh my gosh, big booty, big tits
I like guys too though, super sexy, big dick
And if you hatin' on me, ho, then I'm down, big shit
And if you curious I got you baby girl, quick fix

Yeah, I'm bi, I'm bi
And I like 'em both, I got pride
Yeah, I'm bi, I'm bi
I'm the B in this, you know why (yeah)

Yeah, I'm bi, I'm bi
I'm the B in this, you know why (yeah)
