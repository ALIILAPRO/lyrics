		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it
It's coming
Rain

Feel it on my finger tips, hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like
Rain

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain
Feel it on my finger tips, hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like
Rain

When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye
Could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

Rain
Feel it on my finger tips, hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say never go away

Waiting is the hardest thing
I tell myself that if I believe in you
In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul
That by sheer force of will
I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound you'll appear
And surrender to me
To love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

Feel it on my finger tips, hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I'll stand out on the mountain top
Until I hear you call
My name

Rain
