		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been days and weeks and months
Feels like forever since I saw you 
I'm forgetting how you felt now 
I've never had this much time on my hands

Move the kitchen table out to the lawn
Roll up the rug the stereo's on 
All I can imagine is being in your arms
I want you to know 

I don't need anything fancy 
I just need me and you slow dancing 
Hell's bending keeping me captive 
Heaven's here it's right where you're standing 
Slow dancing

Ooh

Ooh

I've got my reasons to complain 
And they're tangled in red white and blue
The battle outside is blazing 
And all I'm thinking about is you 

Move the kitchen table out to the lawn
Roll up the rug the stereo's on 
All I can imagine is being in your arms
I want you to know 

I don't need anything fancy 
I just need me and you slow dancing 
Hell's bending keeping me captive 
Heaven's here it's right where you're standing 
Slow dancing with you

All I'm thinking about is you 
Dancing
All I'm thinking about is you 
All I'm thinking about is you 
All I'm thinking about is you, ooh
All I'm thinking about is you 
All I'm thinking about is you, ooh
All I'm thinking about is you 
All I'm thinking about is you 
All I'm thinking about is you
