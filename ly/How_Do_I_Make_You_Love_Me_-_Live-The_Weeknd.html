		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're going back in time
I'd like to see you try
Unpacking thoughts through tunnels in your mind
I'll fix you mushroom tea
And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality (reality)

It doesn't phase you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seeking approval
Begging for it desperately (desperately)
I said

How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? (Ooh)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me? (Ooh)
And make it last eternally?

I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And all the things you tolerated, made you cold inside
But I can light you up again like embers of a fire

It doesn't phase you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seeking approval
Begging for it desperately
I said

How do I make you love me? (Make you love me)
How do I make you fall for me? (How do I make you fall?)
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? (Ooh)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me? (Ooh)
And make it last eternally?
