		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every second counts
I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
All these little games
You can call me by the name I gave you
Yesterday, yeah
Every minute counts
I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
Can you figure me out?
Just doin' to waste more time on the couch

Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags

Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine, yeah
Cases under the bed
Spill it open, let it rush to my head
I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside of me
I'm not the type to run, I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed

Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me

Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
Walkin' out the door with your bags
