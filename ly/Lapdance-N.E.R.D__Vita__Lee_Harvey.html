		  Dirty Dog (uhh)
I'm a dirty dog (uhh)
I'm a dirty dog
I'm a, I'm a dirty dog
Dirty Dog
I'm a dirty dog
Dirty Dog

I'm an outlaw (I'm an outlaw)
Quick on the draw (quick on the draw)
Somethin' you've never seen before (never seen)
And I dare a mother fucker to come in my face
I got somethin' chrome (I got somethin' Chrome)
And I got it from home (I got it from home)
And it ain't a microphone (ain't it a mic)
And I dare a mother fucker to come in my face

It's so real
How I feel
'Cause this society
That makes a nigga want to kill
I'm just straight ill
Ridin' my motorcycle down the streets
While politicians is soundin' like strippers to me
They keep sayin' but I don't want to hear it

Ooh, baby you want me?
Ooh, baby you want me?
Ooh, baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Ooh, baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free

It's a raw night (it's a raw night)
Who wants to bar fight? (Who wants to bar fight?)
Well come on alright (yo, come on)
And I dare a mother fucker to come in my face
Baseball bats (baseball bats)
I got somethin' for that (I got somethin' for that)
It goes bla-ka-ka-kat (you know what that is)
So I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
It's so real, how I feel
'Cause this society, that makes a nigga want to kill
I'm just straight ill
Ridin' my motorcycle down the streets
While the government is soundin' like strippers to me
They keep sayin' but I don't want to hear it

Ooh, baby you want me?
Ooh, baby you want me?
Ooh, baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Ooh, baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free (Lee Harvey)

When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley
Blue denim, spiked wrists and 'Crombie
Slap screws and tattoos that's all me
Two guns, both arm's spinnin' like Fonzie
You can find me drunk, whip it it might crash
Or find me chillin with crackers, who like Thrash
Find me in court smokin' that nice grass
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm I'm gnarly baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly baby
And you know the flow ungodly baby
So let's party baby
Chicks nick-name me Pilot, they get high of my dick
I take 'em to my home, they call it the cock pit
Time for take off, their panties they drop quick
Now that's first class fuckin', ain't that some fly shit?

Ooh, baby you want me?
Ooh, baby you want me?
Ooh, baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Ooh, baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
They keep sayin', but I don't wanna hear it
