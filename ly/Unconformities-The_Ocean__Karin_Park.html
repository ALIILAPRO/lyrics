		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  soon. I cannot see the shore 
birds circling above 
nothing is like it was before 
I hear a voice talking, is it talking to me?
it says just a little moment longer and then I'll be free 

lift the curse 
baptise me 
the dream is broken  
I want to be reformed 
let the light shine bright 
I am just a child 
in a twisted lullaby 

my friend, the moon doesn't rise until late 
despite my sleepy eyes, I haven't slept yet 
half day and a night and now another day. 
I am clean and ready 
waves rise high around me now 
but my legs are steady 
arms to the sky

don't turn on the bright lights
don't turn on the bright lights
don't turn on the bright lights
don't turn on the bright lights
don't turn on the bright lights
don't turn on the bright lights

don't turn on the bright lights
just a wasteland
don't turn on the bright lights
just a wasteland
don't turn on the bright lights
just a wasteland
don't turn on the bright lights
just a wasteland

I'm clean and ready 
waves rise high around me now 
but my legs are steady 
arms to the sky
