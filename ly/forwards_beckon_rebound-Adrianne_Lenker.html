		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over the Dead Sea
Keepin' you company
Thinking, "I'm unafraid of you now
I'm not afraid of you now"
Letting my eyes close
Shedding my soft clothes
Wind blows
Wind that howls like a hound
Wind that laughs like a clown

Mystery of lack, stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound

Virtual bedroom
Rise like a full moon
Show me pictures that hang in you house
Pictures that hang in your mouth
Candescent insects
Crosses and fishnecks 
I have nothing to pray to you now
Nothing to pray to you now

Mystery of lack, stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound

Pulling your face close, wanting the inmost
Show me
I'm not afraid of you now
I'm not afraid of you now
Felling violent
Infant and innocent
Baby, both arms cradle you now
Both arms cradle you now

Mystery of lack, stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound
