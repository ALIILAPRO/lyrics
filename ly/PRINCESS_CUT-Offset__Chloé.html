		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flooded that bitch in some diamonds (yeah)
I call her Diamonds, she lookin' fine to me
She got a princess cut body (body)
Hop in the 'Rari, I told her, "Drive for me"
I like my bitches all stylish (style)
Dior her wallet, I told her, "Vibe with me" 
I told that bitch, "You gon' die for me (die, die)
Cry for me, but don't lie to me"
I tell her, "Clean up the house for me (ooh)
When I get back I'll fuck on the balcony" (down, down)
I like the way she go down on me (down)
Suck it, she swallow, devour me (swallow)
Get naked, get in the shower with me
Know I'm the king, baby, bow to me (vow)
That nigga broke, he a clown to me
Fuckin', I'm strokin' her sound to sleep

Go to sleep, go to bed
She flexible, put her leg over her head
I'm flexible, leave the racks on the bed
She do what I say 'cause I'm Simon Says
When I fucked her first time, it blew her head
When I play with the boss, better use your head
Bought her Marni, the scarf just to wrap her hair
Wish me well, I'm a real player
Put you in Channel, got a Dior smell
Diamonds hittin', singin' to me like Adele
It's the details, hair with the nails
When I dress you up, it's like a fairytale
When I bless you with these racks, don't never tell
I'm the Margiela, I done it left
In the ocean, let the boat sail
I be gettin', like for real
Goin' on with that nonsense
Bought a car and then I bought a crib
Gon' and put it up for content
She only got one life to live
Baby girl, I'm bein' honest
Thumbin' through it, told me, "Give it here"
She fuck with niggas with the money

Flooded that bitch in some diamonds (yeah)
I call her Diamonds, she lookin' fine to me
She got a princess cut body (body)
Hop in the 'Rari, I told her, "Drive for me"
I like my bitches all stylish (style)
Dior her wallet, I told her, "Vibe with me" 
I told that bitch, "You gon' die for me (die, die)
Cry for me, but don't lie to me"
I tell her, "Clean up the house for me (ooh)
When I get back I'll fuck on the balcony" (down, down)
I like the way she go down on me (down)
Suck it, she swallow, devour me (swallow)
Get naked, get in the shower with me
Know I'm the king, baby, bow to me (vow)
That nigga broke, he a clown to me
Fuckin', I'm strokin' her sound to sleep

Baby boy, yeah, I know what I'm doin'
Yeah, I touch you right, know I don't overdo it
Ride for you like there ain't nothin' to it
When you next to me, promise you never losin'
I call all the plays
You go when I say
I run and you chase
You fell in love with the taste, oh
Make me feel good in the midnight
You can spoil me, make me cum every damn time
Baby boy, yeah, you know what you doin'
Hit it right every time, nothin' can ever ruin it
I know, I know, I know

Better flood me in some diamonds
He call me Diamonds, he lookin' fine to me
I got a princess cut body
Hop in the 'Rari, I told him, "Drive for me"
I like my niggas all stylish
Dior my wallet, I told him, "Vibe with me"
Told that nigga, he gon' die for me
Cry for me, but don't lie to me
I tell him, "Clean up the house for me
When I get back I'll fuck on the balcony"
I like the way he go down on me
Suck it and lick it, devour me
Get naked, get in the shower with me
Know I'm the queen, baby, bow to me
Never go broke, hold it down for me
Fuckin', I'm strokin' him sound to sleep

I tell her, "Clean up the house for me (ooh)
When I get back I'll fuck on the balcony" (down)
I like the way he go down on me (down)
Suck it, she'll swallow, devour me (swallow)
Get naked, get in the shower with me
Know I'm the king, baby, bow to me
That nigga broke, he a clown to me
Fuckin', I'm strokin' him sound to sleep
