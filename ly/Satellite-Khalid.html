		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Satellite
I see you swimmin' through this open sky
I rest my head upon these dandelions
The stars are envious of you tonight
Broken dreams
I'm writin' poems of our memories, yeah-yeah-yeah
Wish I could hold you through computer screens
But all the static keeps us in between

La-da-da, we're walkin' on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you
You're like a satellite, crossin' through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you

Saw the news
Oh, what a sight, it left me so confused
They're tellin' stories that you're leavin' soon
They'll never know what you've been goin' through, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, shootin' star, uh
I watch you drift away into the dark
Sometimes I sit and wonder where you are
Sending me signals to my, sending me signals to my hollow heart, ah-ah-ah

La-da-da, we're walkin' on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you
You're like a satellite, crossin' through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you
La-da-da, we're walkin' on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you 
(Straight, straight, straight to you)
You're like a satellite, crossin' through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you

Satellite
Satellite
Satellite
Satellite

La-ah-ah, walkin' on a line
Line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you
You're like a satellite, crossin' through my mind
Straight, straight to you
La-da-da, we're walkin' on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you (straight)
You're like a satellite, crossin' through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you
La-da-da, we're walkin' on a line (walkin' on a line)
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you (like a satellite)
You're like a satellite, crossin' through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you
(It leads me straight to you)
