		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watch the current moving through her
And I regret when I don't share what I feel
I'm learning when I make the wrong move
Won't let 'em tell me that this love isn't real
Half a chance is all that we need
I've been looking for this all of my life
I didn't know that you could be real
I didn't know that you would be here tonight

Red, red roses
Sweet, sweet wine
Just like violets
In the sky
We keep growing
When our hearts are open

She's got a better taste
More than a pretty face
Tattoos around her waist
Something you can't erase
Where did we go wrong?
I'm ready to move along
I've been around 'em all
Baby, I'm coming home

She's got a better taste
More than a pretty face (more than a pretty face)
Tattoos around her waist
Something you can't erase (something you can't erase)
Where did we go wrong?
I'm ready to move along (ready to move along)
I've been around 'em all
Baby, I'm coming home (baby, I'm coming home)

I know you see potential in me
But they convince me that you've made up your mind
I've been holding on to what we were taught
But I'm learning to let go of the lies
Standing at the edge of the sea
I've been waiting for a change in my life
I never thought that this could be real
I used to dream about you every night

Red, red roses
Sweet, sweet wine
Just like violets
In the sky
We keep growing
When our hearts are open

She's got a better taste
More than a pretty face
Tattoos around her waist
Something you can't erase
Where did we go wrong?
I'm ready to move along
I've been around 'em all
Baby, I'm coming home

She's got a better taste
More than a pretty face (more than a pretty face)
Tattoos around her waist
Something you can't erase (something you can't erase)
Where did we go wrong?
I'm ready to move along (ready to move along)
I've been around 'em all (baby)
Baby, I'm coming home (baby, I'm coming home)

Baby, I'm coming home

Baby, can we work this out so this is worth it?
I don't want to take your love
I just want to earn it
I just want to learn it
I don't want to burn this down
So help me build a bridge
Tap into my circuit

She's got a better taste
More than a pretty face
Tattoos around her waist
Something you can't erase
Where did we go wrong?
I'm ready to move along
I've been around 'em all
Baby, I'm coming home

She's got a better taste
More than a pretty face (more than a pretty face)
Tattoos around her waist
Something you can't erase (something you can't erase)
Where did we go wrong?
I'm ready to move along
I've been around 'em all
Baby, I'm coming home (baby, I'm coming home)

(Baby, I'm coming home)
