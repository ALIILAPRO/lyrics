		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All right, Starr Park
We're the Bad Randoms
And we're ready to ruin your day
You want a good time
You're in your brawl prime
There isn't anything (YOU CAN'T DO)
From mystic mountain
To haunted haven
You'll feel the danger when you (MEET WICKED STU)
Got kicked out
Of the Snowtel
Threw the game and blamed someone else, wellâ€¦
Why does this have to happen?
It's just another day here with a random
No pass, no kill, no coordination
No hope, no aim, only damnation
We are the bad randoms
And we won't cooperate
A troll trio
We're impossible to tame
Bad randoms
You know the ones you love to hate
Not here to be your friends, just here to cause you pain
You think you're a one-man army
But we're the one who takes all of the glory
Get off the jump pad
You never ever collab
This is not my fight
I just ruin your night
Got a bounty on my head
But you'd rather just waste your ammo instead
Can't believe you're trick-shotting again
There's nothing I can do, no one here to befriend
No pass, no kill, no coordination
No hope, no aim, only damnation
We are the bad randoms
And we won't cooperate
A troll trio
We're impossible to tame
Bad randoms
You know the ones you love to hate
Not here to be your friends, just here to cause you pain
You're stuck with us (Us)
And we're stuck with (You)
Trash Poco, Born Bad Buzz, WICKED STU
When all hope is gone
Beaten down, looking dark
We'll troll you 'till dawn
We're the worst randoms of Starr Park
Yeah, we're the worst randoms of Starr Park
We brawl, we lose, no desperation
We die, we live, no separation
We are the bad randoms
And we won't cooperate
A troll trio
We're impossible to tame
Bad randoms
You know the ones you love to hate
Not here to be your friends, just here to cause you pain
