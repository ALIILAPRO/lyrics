		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep a pistol under my pillow at night (yeah, yeah)
I close the curtains and I sharpen my knife (oh oh)
I build my walls up and I build 'em up so high (yeah, yeah)
So no one's getting inside, I learned my lesson last time

Baby, just walk away, just walk away
You're heading straight for danger
Ayy, don't make a mistake
I'm just a little bit out of my mind

'Cause I'm cold as ice
I'm not the type to keep you warm at night
Better believe it that I'm cold as ice
I never stay for too long, too long, I'm gone
Cold as ice

Cold as ice
Cold as ice

At night I hit you up with bourbon and red (yeah, yeah)
Put on a fire when I take off my dress (oh oh)
We're such a match when I can live inside your head (yeah, yeah)
You swear you're gonna regret
You'll wish we never had met, no, no

Baby, just walk away, just walk away
You're heading straight for danger
Ayy, don't make a mistake
I'm just a little bit out of my mind

'Cause I'm cold as ice
I'm not the type to keep you warm at night
Better believe it that I'm cold as ice
I never stay for too long, too long, I'm gone
Cold as ice

Cold as ice
Cold as ice

La da da da, da da da
La da da da, da da da
La da da da, da da da

I never stay for too long, too long, I'm gone
Cold as ice
(Cold as ice)
