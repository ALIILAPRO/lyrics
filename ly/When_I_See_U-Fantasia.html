		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Mafia)

I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What's happenin' to me?
In the dark, can you tell me what it means?
I lay my head on my pillow
Got me starin' out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
It's the reason why

You're always on my mind (oh yeah)
When you come around, I'm shy (baby, when I see you)
When I see you, when I see you (baby, when I)
Never know when you might walk by (walk by)
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you (baby, when I, ooh yeah)

I scribble X and O's in my notebook
Checkin' how my hair and nails look
I feel my self in the zone
I get nervous when you call
So I say I'm not home
I see your face when I hear my favorite song
Should I send an email at home?
You're the number one topic on the phone
I wonder if you know, or do you have a clue? (yeah, yeah)
I lay my head on my pillow
You got me starin' out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
What's the reason why? (yeah, yeah)

You're always on my mind (you're always, hey)
When you come around, I get shy (hey, sexy boy)
When I see you, when I see you (you're sexy, boy, hey baby)
Never know when you might walk by (I don't never know)
So I gotta be right on time (baby when I)
When I see you, when I see you (when I, when I, when I, when I)

Somethin' now is takin' over me, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not goin' to run, I'm just gonna stand here and see
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh yeah

You're always on my mind (hey, baby)
When you come around, I get shy (hey when I see you)
When I see you, when I see you (you're so sexy, boy, you're so sexy, boy)
Never know when you might walk by (I don't ever)
So I gotta be right on time (but I get nervous)
When I see you, when I see you (around you, I love it, around you boy)

You're always on my mind (you're always)
When you come around, I get shy (hey)
When I see you (you, you, you), when I see you (I love it, I love it)
Never know when you might walk by (yes, I love it, baby)
So I gotta be right on time (but I don't know)
When I see you (for some reason), when I see you (I can't, I can't be around)

(Hey, hey)
(I can't)
(Only when I see you)
