		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's ten o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?

You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

Don't you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smelling like a bonfire
Lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe
I think it's great
But while in this world

I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know

But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong

You know you're bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
You can sit in a barrel
Maybe I'll wait
Until that day

I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
