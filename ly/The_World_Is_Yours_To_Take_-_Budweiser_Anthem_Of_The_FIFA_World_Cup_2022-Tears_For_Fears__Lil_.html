		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to your life
There's no turning back

I'm by far one of the hardest workers
Real firm believer in "Practice make perfect"
You can gather all the water, stay thirsty
Took a lot to get us here, we broke curses
Kill or be killed, the field show no mercy
Losers just lose while winners get worshiped
I came here for fun, let's get turnt up
Somebody pass me a Budweiser, a cold one
I wanna rule the world, I can't hold you
Hell of a life, I feel like I'm chosen
Head on tight, I feel like I'm focused
I ain't ever satisfied, I want more
COVID came and held us up, we back rollin'
Look at all the people in here, we got motion
Everybody back outside, that's somethin' to toast to
Whole bunch of real good vibes, it feel so cool
I think it's about that time, it's gettin' closer
Whole lotta fingers crossed, a lotta hopin'
Wishin' for the best, preparin' for the worst too
Got out here and bust my ass, I had to work too
Some stuff is out of my hands, I can't control it
If I don't know nothin', dawg, I know one thing

Everybody wants to rule the world
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world

I think I left all my feelings at home
It's okay, won't be usin' 'em anyway
I'm determined to win, each and every way
Give thanks to the Most High, each and every day
Even when it's a sport, I ain't come to play
I be serious, that's what works for me
Same swang every day, I can't switch routine
Tryna go see some places I never seen
I done said a whole lot, never said it's easy
Tryna climb to the top, I'm just steady creepin'
Could be better a lot but I'm more than decent
Kind of feel like a dream but I'm wide awake
They don't give you the title, you gotta take it
Lots of energy mixed with determination
I'm a goer, I don't like procrastination
I'm just growin', I feel like I need my space
When you really the truth, you don't gotta fake it
I'm so close to the finish line, gotta make it
Gotta go when it's crunch, I can't hesitate
Handle business on time, I ain't ever late
I'm with y'all but I come from another place
One thing we got in common is that

Everybody wants to rule the world
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
