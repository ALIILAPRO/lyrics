		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this isn't love
Can you lie to me
Got until the morning after
Why don't you ever come to me these days
And who you been under
When I'm way too far way
You did all this before
And I been searching for more
(cause it gets hard to be alone)
I guess we're two lost souls
Just trying to find ourselves
This just the life we chose
I guess we're two lost souls
Where do we go other than here
Can't even tell me what you feel
Numb the pain
Yeah that's a shame
We're just two lost souls
You the type that I be running from
Cause you one and done me
Like it wasn't nothing
But you got me stuck
You just do too much
Yeah you got me stuck
I might do too much
You did all this before
And I been searching for more
(Cause it gets hard to be alone)
I guess we're two lost souls
Just trying to find ourselves
This just the life we chose
I guess we're two lost souls
Where do go other than here
Can't even tell me what you feel
Numb the pain
Yeah that's a shame
We're just two lost souls
