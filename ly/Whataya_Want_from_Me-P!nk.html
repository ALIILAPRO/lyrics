		  Hey, slow it down, whataya want from me
Whataya want from me
Yeah, I'm afraid, whataya want from me
Whataya want from me

There might have been a time when I would give myself away
Oh, once upon a time, I didn't give a damn
But now, here we are, so whataya want from me
Whataya want from me

Just don't give up, I'm workin it out
Please don't give in, I won't let you down
He messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me
Whataya want from me
Whataya want from me

Yeah, it's plain to see (plain to see)
That baby you're beautiful
And there's nothing wrong with you (Nothing wrong with you)
It's me, I'm a freak (yeah)
But thanks for lovin' me
'Cause you're doing it perfectly (Oh, perfectly)

There might have been a time when I would let you slip away
I wouldn't even try, but I think you could save my life

Just don't give up, I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in, I won't let you down
He messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep comin around
Hey, whataya want from me (Whataya want from me)
Whataya want from me (Whataya want from me)
Whataya want from me (Whataya want from me)

Just don't give up on me
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

So, oh, just don't give up
I'm workin it out
Please don't give in, I won't let you down
He messed me up (He messed me up)
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me

Just don't give up, I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in, I won't let you down
He messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me (Whataya want from me)
Whataya want from me (Whataya want from me)
Whataya want from me
