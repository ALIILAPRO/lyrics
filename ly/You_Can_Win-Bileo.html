		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Movin' up now
To higher ground now
Can't lose my stride
When I get there, yeah
I'm gonna smile now
'Cause I'll be high
High on love
That's all I need, yeah
To make my day
I am happy
Happy now I'm
I'm on my way

You can be there
If you want to, yeah
You can be there
If you want to, yeah

You can win, you can win
You can win, you can win
You can win, you can win
You can win, you can win

You can win (you can win, you can win)
Sure can do (you can win, you can win)
You can do anything (you can win, you can win)
Anything you choose

You can win (you can win, you can win)
Sure can do (you can win, you can win)
You can do anything (you can win, you can win)
Anything you choose

Clap your hands, ah (clap your hands, yeah)
Clap your hands, ah (clap your hands, yeah)
Clap your hands, ah (clap your hands, yeah)
Clap your hands, ah, yeah

Movin' up now
To higher ground now
Can't lose my stride
When I get there, yeah
I'm gonna smile now
'Cause I'll be high
High on love
That's all I need, yeah
To make my day
I am happy
Happy now I'm
I'm on my way

You can be there
If you want to, yeah
You can be there
If you want to, yeah
