		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Then you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me, no
Say, say I'm so crazy, baby (I'm so crazy)

I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, yeah

They said you got high as the sky
Up all night just dancing, huh
I hit you like, "Please come home to me" (come home to me)
But you're not understanding, no
You gon' make me beg, make me plead (plead)
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
I just figured you could make time for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh, yeah

Race my mind, I got the keys, please

Picture me rolling through downtown in a A4
Picture my signature on a pair of some J 4s
Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for
Knew I needed love, but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no "K, sure"
Soon as I tell you that you the one I would wait for
You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love getting T'd up
Love showin' the cakes, you know that they eat it up
Love touching the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was
(Them niggas just can't understand it)
I want you to change my mind, I'm praying you pulling up
Know who you be around, I know that they teaming up
Telling you you better off leavin' me in the dust

I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind
