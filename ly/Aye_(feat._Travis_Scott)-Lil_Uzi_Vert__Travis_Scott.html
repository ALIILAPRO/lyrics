		  Yeah (I-I-I)
Lil Uzi, woah (I-I-I) 
Shit, turn the fuck up in this bitch (I-I-I-I'm working on dying) 
It's Lil Uzi in this bitch (BNYX)

Yeah, yeah (woah), yeah, yeah (rage)
Yeah, yeah (huh?), yeah, yeah (woah)
My neck is filled with the water, ayy (ayy)
I might just fuck around and take your daughter 
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Lil Uzi, woah), yeah, yeah (yeah, Lil Uzi)
Yeah, yeah (ayy), yeah, yeah (Lil Uzi, woah)
Sometimes I feel like the target, ayy (I feel like the target, huh?)
But fuck it, this time I go harder, ayy (woah, I'ma go harder)

Fuck on that bitch for free, ayy
This shit feel like victory, ayy
Money ain't shit to me, ayy
Marni gon' stick to me, ayy
Lil Uzi Vert on a roll, ayy (Lil Uzi)
I put them diamonds in my teeth, ayy 
Might put some diamonds my nose, ayy, ayy 
I put them diamonds in my teeth, ayy 
Might put some diamonds my nose, ayy (huh?)
We killed an opp and got low, ayy
Don't got no bullets, this pole (what? Yeah)
He called my phone, he need more, ayy (hello?)
My bitch don't want me no more, ayy
Now I look at her like, "Ho," ayy

Yeah, yeah (woah), yeah, yeah (ayy)
Yeah, yeah (ayy), yeah, yeah (Lil Uzi, woah)
My neck is filled with the water, ayy (ayy)
I might just fuck around and take your daughter 
Yeah, yeah, yeah (woah), yeah, yeah (ayy)
Yeah, yeah (ayy), yeah, yeah (Lil Uzi, woah)
Sometimes I feel like the target, ayy (I feel like the target)
But fuck it, this time I go harder, ayy (I'ma go harder)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (ooh)

I don't think they really hear me (yeah)
Walk around with it, that's clearly (let's go)
Hundred, mm, yearly (ha)
Hit her, make her do the griddy (yeah)
Hit her when I'm in the city (it's lit)
Snap on a nigga like Ray
Bang on a bitch like I'm 50 (uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, (huh?) Yeah (let's go)
I'm done with sinnin', you know
I keep the Christian Dior on the coat and the tote (Christian Dior)
And I keep the checks on my feet (wow)
Ain't no way I got the time to go check on a ho (yeah)
I put the gang on a boat (ayy)
Told 'em I'ma keep it afloat and keep it on go (Lil Uzi, ooh)

My neck is filled with the water, ayy (ayy)
I might just fuck around and take your daughter 
Yeah, yeah, yeah (woah), yeah, yeah (ayy)
Yeah, yeah (ayy), yeah, yeah (Lil Uzi, woah)
Sometimes I feel like a target, ayy (I feel like the target)
But fuck it, this time I go harder, ayy
