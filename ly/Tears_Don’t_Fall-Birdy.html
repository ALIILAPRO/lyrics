		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who knows where you begin
And where I end?
Particles collide
We're never the same again
And I know that we're hurtin'
But don't wish we never met
'Cause once you were my everything
And I'll never forget

Tears don't fall
We are standin'
Dust to dust
It was us
We were dancin', oh
Tears don't fall
We were happy
Look at us
We were dancin', oh

I remember you by my window
Smokin' your cigarette
With your eyes on me
The way that we felt, oh
And in time
Love's all that is left
So this is goodbye
No regrets

Tears don't fall
We are standin'
Dust to dust
It was us
We were dancin', oh
Tears don't fall
We were happy
Look at us
We were dancin', oh

(Ah)
We were dancin' (ah, oh, oh)
We were happy

Tears don't fall
Tears don't fall
Tears don't fall
Tears don't fall (tears don't fall)
Tears don't fall (tears don't fall)
Tears don't fall (tears don't fall)
