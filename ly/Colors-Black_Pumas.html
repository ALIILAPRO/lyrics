		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up to the morning sky first 
Baby blue just like we rehearsed 
When I get up off this ground 
I shake leaves back down 
To the brown, brown, brown, 'til I'm clean, oh my
Then I walked where I'd be shaded by the trees 
By a meadow of green 
For about a mile 
I'm headed to town, town, town, in style 

With all my favorite colors (yessir yeah)
I got all my favorite colors (right on)
My sisters and my brothers 
See them like no other 
All my favorite colors 

It's good day to be
A good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors (colors)
My sisters and my brothers
They see them like no other 
All my favorite colors

Now take me to the otherside 
Where the baby blues birds fly 
In grey clouds, or white walls
Or blue skies we gon' fly 
Feel alright, somebody help me feel alright today
Now we gon' woo ooh woo ooh woo ooh ya 
They sound like woo ooh woo ooh woo ooh ya 
The least I can say 
I anticipate a homecoming parade 
As we renegade in the morning, right now

With all my favorite colors, yessir
I got all my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers 
See them like no other 
All my favorite colors, oh my

It's good day to be
A good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors (colors)
My sisters and my brothers
They see them like no other 
All my favorite colors

On the otherside
Where the baby blues birds fly 
In grey clouds, or white walls
Or blue skies we gon' fly 
Feel alright, somebody help me feel alright today, now
Now we gon' woo ooh woo ooh woo ooh ya 
They sound like woo ooh woo ooh woo ooh ya 
The least I can say 
I anticipate a homecoming parade 
As we renegade in the morning, right on

With all my favorite colors, yessir
All my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers 
See them like no other 
All my favorite colors, oh my

It's good day to be
A good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors (colors)
My sisters and my brothers
See them like no other 

All my favorite colors
