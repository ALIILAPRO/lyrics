		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be
Alright

You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means
And finally obtain your dreams
On the come up, but they run up in a world of many fiends
I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream
Hard work and sacrifice, but not a lot know what I mean
Most these rappers, ain't got no class like bomb threats
And bein' the illest, the disease, is the on set
And it don't matter where you at
If you white or if you black
If you rich, or you poor, we gon' always want more
But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor
I'm 'gon use this power to paint a picture of unity
Yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like there's two of me
Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

One day (one day)
I'll be richer than I was before
One day (one day)
I'm 'gon have enough money to buy the store
One day (one day)
Like Sinatra said you know I'm finna do it my way
You on the road to success, I took the highway

And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be alright

Yeah, feelin' just like I'm at mass
Yeah, I'm comin' for that ass
Game been broken too long, so I guess I am the cast
Like my section 8 crib, finally found some greener grass
So ahead of my time, I wasn't born in the past
This right here a double-header with Logic and Ryan Tedder
Oh no, it can't get no better
And you know, we know we do it for the children
I never thought I'd see the day I made a million
A couple dozen later, feel like everybody feel 'em
I ain't mean to boast in that last line
But counting money's always been my favorite pastime
Especially with a past like mine
Drugs in the household
Never had a hand to hold
Even when I was homeless in the blistering cold, but I made it out
And if I can, you can no doubt
I know

One day
I'ma do it like I never did it
One day
I'ma have the courage to go out and get it
One day
Do what I love and support my girl
One day
I'ma shake up the whole world

And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be alright

(One day) Everybody tryna kill my light
Only thing I know it's gonna be all right (one day)
Everybody tryna kill my light
Only thing I know it's gonna be all right (one day)
Keep tryna tell myself in the morning things will be better (one day)
Keep tryna tell myself tomorrow's different weather

And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be
