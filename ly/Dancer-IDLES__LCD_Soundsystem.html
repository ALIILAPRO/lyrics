		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold the phone
Hip to hip, cheek to cheek
Push me away like I'm Lucifer
So to speak
My focus is on the cocoa butter
Running down your neck and the sweat
Feet touch, brush hands, feather's ache
We can swing if you prefer
So to speak
My breath moves your hair in a round at a glance
Like a pirouette and the sweat

I give myself to you
As long as you move
On the floor

Dancers, hip to hip (collide us as we work it out)
Dancing cheek to cheek
Dancers, hip to hip (collide us as we work it out)
Dancing cheek to cheek
Dancers, hip to hip (collide us as we work it out)
Dancing cheek to cheek
Dance, oh dance, goddamn dance, woo (collide us as we work it out)

Shoulders back, chest out, I'm poised
Like a goddamn ape
So to speak
I can taste the mood in my mouth
Like particles of punch drunk love
And the sweat
Bold moves, ice rink, lines cut
From the moves they make
So to speak
Somebody tell me where I go
Like a goddamn homing dove
And the sweat

I give myself to you
As long as we move
On the floor

Dancers, hip to hip (collide us as we work it out)
Dancing cheek to cheek
Dancers, hip to hip (collide us as we work it out)
Dancing cheek to cheek
Dancers, hip to hip (collide us as we work it out)
Dancing cheek to cheek
Dance, oh dance, goddamn dance (collide us as we work it out)

Cut waves, make change
Crop circles in my cage
Cut waves, make change
Crop circles in my cage
Cut waves, make change (collide us as we work it out)
Crop circles in my cage
I'm a dancer, you're a dancer
Let's dance, woo
