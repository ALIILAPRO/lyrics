		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm weary from my travels
I've come a long, long way
I haven't felt a woman
Since last that I was here
Oh, won't you bring me whiskey
And run your fingers through my hair?
Oh, won't you whisper sweet words
Oh so softly in my ears?

Oh-yodel-ee-eeh
Oh-yodel-ee-eeh
Yodel-eh

Can you always tell the sinner
From a saint that feeds the same
And is your thick skin growing thinner?
Have you found someone to blame?
She said, "You need not worry, child
Now is not the time"
And then she kissed me on the forehead
And turned my water into wine

My fair lady
My fair lady
Just let me hold you for a while
Just let me hold you for a while
My fair lady
My fair lady
Just let me hold you for a while
Just let me hold you for a while

Keep looking out your window
When the storms are raging on
Oh-oh, and before you know, girl
I'll be coming back ashore
Coming back to my hometown
Where I saw you first
I knew you were the one, I knew it all along
Go on, claim my heart

Some nights just seem forever lasting
Low lights make me know that you're there, oh

My fair lady
My fair lady
Oh, won't you lay by my side
Just let me hold you for a while
My fair lady
My fair lady
Oh, won't you lay here by my side?
Just let me hold you for a while
Won't you lay here by my side?
Just let me hold you for a while
