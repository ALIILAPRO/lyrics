		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, with passion, boy, yeah

Yo
Walking through the jungle
Move with light and heat like the sun do
With the world spinning round like a tumble
I can let the lion be king 'cause I'm humble
But I seen a big cat thrown in the air
That's 'cause the bull saw red, he don't care
All of this beef got the world in fear
Times get harsh gotta stay prepared

It might hurt, hurt, hurt your self worth, worth, worth
This a learning curve
Glory you deserve
Just remember our day will come
Sky's not the limit, go beyond the sun
Come with us, or you better go and run

When we come through, it's a stampede
We gon' wake you up, no sleep
When we come through, it's a stampede
Something you ain't never seen
Better hope you're on my team (my team alright, yeah)

It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
Get what you need, get what you need
It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
Set yourself free, set yourself free

Fly like a bird, tweeting to warn each other 'bout imposters
They underestimated we real hustlers
Mess with the kingdom we gon' do more than cuss words
We been walking miles (miles)
No more fake smiles (smiles)
They say that we wild
If this was you, you would throw in the towel (shh shh shh shh)

Just remember our day will come
Sky's not the limit, go beyond the sun
Come with us, or you better go and run

When we come through, it's a stampede
We gon' wake you up, no sleep
When we come through, it's a stampede
Something you ain't never seen
Better hope you're on my team (you should join this side)

It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
Get what you need, get what you need
It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
Set yourself free, set yourself free

I'm certain that something is calling
Wake up from a dream every morning
The meaning of it all
That's why we hit the road
If you shut your eyes to the calling
Will you wake up when you are falling
You gotta take control
Get back your heart and soul
Back your heart and soul (heart and soul)

It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
Get what you need, get what you need
It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
Set yourself free, set yourself free

It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
(We come to free you, this a preview, this a real you)
It's a stampede (whoa whoa)
(You can do it, I knew this, we the truest)
