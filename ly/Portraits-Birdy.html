		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Writin' you down like you're mine on the lines of my body
Call me obsessed but I'd die if you were to speak to me
(Dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more)
Dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more
Out on the street, you're in my dreams, wouldn't dare to embrace you
(Dancin' more, dancin' more)
No other choice but to watch you and then recreate you 
(Dancin' more, dancin' more)
Dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more

Dancin' for portraits of you
Portraits of you
Portraits of you in my room

(Dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more)
Baby, the fantasy ends with every imperfection 
(Dancin' more, dancin' more)
Started all over again just to keep your attention 
(Dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more)
Touchin' you, ooh
Dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more, dancin' more

Dancin' for portraits of you
Portraits of you
Portraits of you in my room
Portraits of you
(Too many) portraits of you
Portraits of you in my room

Portraits of you
Portraits of you
Portraits of you in my room (ah, ah)
Dancin' for portraits of you
Portraits of you
Portraits of you in my room (portraits)

Dancin' more, dancin' more
More
In my room
I wouldn't leave
In my room
Oh, my room
Portraits of you
Portraits of you
Portraits of you
