		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shot down by your bullets
They shatter my faith and my bones
If you listen to words, it hurts
They creep right under my skin, it cuts so deep

Can't you understand I don't want battles, battles, battles?
And if you lay them in my hand, I won't fight battles, battles, battles
Tell me why we work so hard to break these bones
Can we try to lay down these sticks and stones?
Sticks and stones

We crash and fall together, so sad
We don't remember
While we're tearing us apart
But I can feel the cracks, the cracks in my heart

Can't you understand I don't want battles, battles, battles?
And if you lay them in my hand, I won't fight battles, battles, battles
Tell me why we work so hard to break these bones
Can we try to lay down these sticks and stones?

Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will always hurt me
Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will always hurt me

Why does it have to be so hard to surrender?
When we got nothing left, nothing left to lose, lose

Can't you understand I don't want battles, battles, battles?
And if you lay them in my hand, I won't fight battles, battles, battles
Tell me why we work so hard to break these bones
Can we try to lay down these sticks and stones?

Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will always hurt me
Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will always hurt me
Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will always hurt me
Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will always hurt me
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Your words will always hurt me
