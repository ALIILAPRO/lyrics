		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, you give me the chills

Walkin' down a darkened hallway
Everybody turns to look at you
It's not because you're different
It's just because you're so scary cool

A sinister style, mystery with a smile
You're drop-dead gorgeous (drop-dead gorgeous)
High school gives me the creeps
But when I'm with my peeps
You can't ignore us
This is where the ghoul kids rule

Monster, Monster High
Monster High, Monster, Monster High
Come on, don't be shy
Monster High, the party never dies
Monster, Monster High
Monster High, Monster, Monster High
Freaky, chic 'n' fly, Monster High
Where student bodies lie

Ay, Frankie's got me fallin' apart, uh
Draculaura's stealin' my heart, heart
Clawdeen Wolf ya make me howl at the moon 
Lagoona, you're the finest fish in this lagoon, ah
Cleo de Nile, you're so beguile
Even though you act so vile (oh!)
And Deuce has stone cold style
These are my boos, my skeleton crew
A little strange, but so are you
Don't you wanna be a Monster too?

Oh, freaky just got fabulous
Everybody wants a piece of you
Best eyes, best smile, let's be realistic
Most characteristic, most hip & horrific

A sinister style, mystery with a smile
You're drop-dead gorgeous (drop-dead gorgeous)
High school gives me the creeps
But when I'm with my peeps
You can't ignore us
This is where the ghoul kids rule

Monster, Monster High
Monster High, Monster, Monster High
Come on, don't be shy
Monster High, the party never dies
Monster, Monster High
Monster High, Monster, Monster High
Freaky, chic 'n' fly, Monster High
Where student bodies lie

M-O-N-S-T-E-R
Monsters, monsters so bizarre
M-O-N-S-T-E-R
Monsters, monsters yes we are!
M-O-N-S-T-E-R
Monsters, monsters so bizarre
M-O-N-S-T-E-R
Monsters, monsters yes we are! (The party never dies)

Monster, Monster High
Monster High, Monster, Monster High
Come on, don't be shy
Monster High, the party never dies

We've got spirits, yes we do
We've got spirits, how 'bout you?
We've got spirits, yes we do
We've got spirits, how 'bout you?

Knock 'em dead!
