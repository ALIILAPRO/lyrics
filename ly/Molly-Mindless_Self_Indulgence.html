		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Molly was a good girl and she knew the reasons why 
So when she went back in the bathroom 
She would never come outside 
She was a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 
She's a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 
She's a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 

Oh! 
Liar! 
Ohh, ohh! 
Oh! 
Liar! 
Oh, ohh! 

Molly was a good girl and she knew the reasons why 
Molly was a good girl and she knew the reasons why 
She was a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 
She's a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 
She's a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 

Oh! 
Liar! 
Ohh, ohh! 
Oh! 
Liar! 
Ohh, ohh! 
Oh! 

Molly was a good girl 
Molly, Molly was a good girl 
Molly, Molly was a- Molly was a 
Molly, Molly, Molly was a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 
She's a good girl 
And it felt great to be a liar 
She's a good girl 
And it felt great to be a no good, lousy, motherfucking, stupid

Oh! 
Liar! 
Oh! 
Liar! 
Ohh, ohh! 
Oh!
