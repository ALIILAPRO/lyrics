		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unholy war
My demons are coming
Boy, you better run
Go take your freedom, oh no
Wade in the water
Be gone by morning
Don't you let them find you here
Oh no

Let love lead you home, oh no
Let redemption keep you warm
So, you better run
You better run

Time has come
Future is now, oh love
Steady on
Go take your bow
Weather the storm
Good times will pass you by
Hit the road
Leave your sorrows behind

Oh, would you let love lead you home, oh please
Let redemption keep you warm
So, you better run
You better run

'Cause I know it's killing you
Well, well, well, well
You gotta leave (you gotta leave me there now)
I know it's killing you, oh 
You gotta leave, oh no
I know it's killing you (I know it's killing you)
You gotta leave (oh you gotta leave here now)
I know it's killing you, yeah
You gotta leave

So, you better run
You better run
Oh save yourself, please
You better run
You better run
