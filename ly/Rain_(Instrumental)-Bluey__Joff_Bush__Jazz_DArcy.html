		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The rain washes in 

The boats start the race 

The humidity broke 

I still remember the taste

Mud squished through our toes 

And gave mum the blues 

I remember it all

Through rose coloured hues

And those boats went flying along 


We kept our socks on

White cotton turned to brown 

I turned to see mum. she was smiling with a frown. 

We didn't have a lot 

And didn't always have a say

But we were learning to grow

And knew how to play

We raced those boats down the road to the end.

And lived boldly in the pretend. 


As shoes were outgrown, 

We had new things to chase.

We were learning life's games,

And finding our place.

Summers went by

And we ran from the rain, 

Though we really did think. 

We'd all stay the same. 

As those boats kept flying along.


Now I race of to work,

And I step in some sand.

I brush the mud off, 

With the palm of my hand. 

I look up at the kids, 

As they play in the rain.

Their white socks (are) brown, 

We play the same game, 


We all race those boats down the road to the end

We all race those boats down the road to the end

And live boldly in the pretend.
