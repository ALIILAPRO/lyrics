		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a light relief from a bad habit
It's my mother's cookin' when I can't have it
It's the last train home from the day trippin'
It's the place I know when I start slippin'

Darling, won't you take me home?
Send me shivers somewhere I used to go
Wrap my name across your mouth when I let my feelings down
Darling, won't you take me home?
Yeah, won't you take me? 

Tell me, does your mother know?
I still love you head to toe, yeah
Like the back of my car on a sunny day
You're the song on the radio I never play
You're the words in my soul that I wanna say
Yeah, I wanna say
So won't you make me stay?

Won't you take me home?
Send me shivers somewhere I used to go
Wrap my name across your mouth when I let my feelings down
Darling, won't you take me home?
Yeah, won't you take me?
