		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't step on my toes, let the weather go
It's been a long wait in bed
Say what, we blow, let's go
This is the time to shine
Everything wrong should be right
Girls, you in control
Not the government, not the government

Nothing changes
Never stops
So what?
Breathe

We are more than machines
We are because we feel
When everything goes down
It is how we come around
We are more than a dream
But this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now
You are everything to me
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines

Don't forget the code, let the wind blow
You can't be assured of a window
Shame bro, we know you fall
Here is the news in blood
Everything wrong should be right
The Earth dies, it's a money thing
It's a money thing

Nothing changes
Never stops
So what?
Breathe

We are more than machines
We are because we feel
When everything goes down
It is how we come around
We are more than a dream
But this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now
You are everything to me
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines

We are more than machines
We are because we feel
When everything goes down
It is how we come around
We are more than a dream
But this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now
You are everything to me
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines (more than machines)
More than machines
