		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See, um
Heavy feelin' for you yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I will speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, I'll just choke the piece up
I ain't tryna keep up, because

I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore 
(I don't know what I should do with this shit, I'ma go) (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
But this might just be better for us, you know?

('Cause I don't love like I used to) Where the time go?
I gave location ('Cause you don't wanna talk about it, baby)
That's all that I know
Ah, ah, ah, ah, where the time go?

What now?
Movin' on the high, uh
somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck
(Forever and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever) ohh yeah
(And ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, forever, and ever, and ever)
(No) I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? (Heart back)

I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (more, more)
But this might just be better for us, you

Yeah, yeah
Thing wanna a thing, I'm in love oh
