		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I've been messed up
You never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You always had to call off
I am pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
Yet you understand
Yeah like no one can
Know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us

Sixteen and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
Yet you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Dark times, you could always find the bright side
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice
Just to be there for me
How you cringe when you sing out of tune
Yet it's everything
So don't change a thing
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army (ooh I'll be yours)
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
I'm standing with an army

Yet you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us

When I'm with you (when I'm with you)
When I'm with you (when I'm with you)
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you (when I'm with you)
When I'm with you (when I'm with you)
I'm standing with an army
They don't have a chance either

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing near you
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
When I'm with you
Standing with an army
