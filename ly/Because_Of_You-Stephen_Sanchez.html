		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like your curls and I like your eyes
I look up at you and just see the sky
Through streetlights I danced with my heaven at night
Ooh, ooh

I never knew what I felt like
But, I feel like him more
Because of you
Because of you

In the black and white, you paint the world 
And I ask if colors knew it's cause' of you
Now love is true because of you

I like your heart and I like it's size
If two hands are open, would one intertwine?
Please, be mine?

I never knew what I felt like
But, I feel like him more
Because of you
Because of you

In the black & white, you paint the world 
And I ask if colors knew it's cause' of you
Now love is true because of you

I never knew what I felt like
But, I feel like him more
Because of you
Because of you

In the black & white, you paint the world 
And I ask if colors knew it's cause' of you
Now love is true because of you
