		  (DT5 on the beat)
(Man like Ron, you know)

If you're in the bando, chasin' that money
One hunna, you split that prof' with your mummy
If your main ting said that she loves me
Would you love her? Would you call her hunny? Dummy
If bro-bro rise for that brucky
Are you gonna run a whole corn with your buddy? (Ha)
And if you hold corn with your buddy
I'm hopin' that you ain't gettin' corn in your tummy (no way)

If you're in the bando, chasin' that money
One hunna, you split that prof' with your mummy
If your main ting said that she loves me
Would you love her? Would you call her hunny? Dummy
If bro-bro rise for that brucky
Are you gonna run a whole corn with your buddy? (Ha)
And if you hold corn with your buddy
I'm hopin' that you ain't gettin' corn in your tummy (no way)

I got a youngin' same color as my jacket
He swore on his nannies, he'll grip it and bang it (normal)
Stop with the actin', stop with the cappin'
My guys pull up and tap it
My guys pull up and tap it
Close one eye and burned these- (burnin')
Two hands on a shotgun, wind down the window
You know it's gonna fuckin' happen (woo)
Gyalie wanna come 'round gang for the err
Drop your drawers, I'm smashin' (smashin')
Or open your mouth on badness
Splish, splash, you know I ain't braggin'
You ain't ever took it to the match like brannin'
Tried to bang it, and the ting kept jammin' (jammin')
Mad ting, mad ting
Bro used his cutter, now, he's on a landin'
Suttin' got touched, and they're blamin' us
Yo, don't blame my friends
Pick up your wap and fill it with bells (fill it)
And beat your gem, my browning's peng
The cats gone mad 'cah their light and dark is leng
(Leng, leng, leng, leng, leng)
We open shops and dodge these feds

If you're in the bando, chasin' that money
One hunna, you split that prof' with your mummy
If your main ting said that she loves me
Would you love her? Would you call her hunny? Dummy
If bro-bro rise for that brucky
Are you gonna run a whole corn with your buddy? (Ha)
And if you hold corn with your buddy
I'm hopin' that you ain't gettin' corn in your tummy (no way)

If you're in the bando, chasin' that money
One hunna, you split that prof' with your mummy
If your main ting said that she loves me
Would you love her? Would you call her hunny? Dummy
If bro-bro rise for that brucky
Are you gonna run a whole corn with your buddy? (Ha)
And if you hold corn with your buddy
I'm hopin' that you ain't gettin' corn in your tummy (no way)

Broad day bootings (normal)
Course it's my guys doin' the shootings
Course it's my guys jumpin' out and scratch these fuckings
And keepin it movin'
Every other day, I got a baddie
She wants to suck man, tell her, "Hold my swammy" (and again)
Best move mad with the rammy
Screw too loose, he gonna kill you, patty
Yo, put your hands like this
Put your hands like that
Yo, Siru dons, we crash
We picked up burners and lampton fuckers
If you know Trap, he's a shiesty man
He was chillin' in the left, bro came from the right
Crept up and made it bang (drop him)
(Bang, bang, bang, bang)
In the bando, gotta slang that crack

If you're in the bando, chasin' that money
One hunna, you split that prof' with your mummy
If your main ting said that she loves me
Would you love her? Would you call her hunny? Dummy
If bro-bro rise for that brucky
Are you gonna run a whole corn with your buddy? (Ha)
And if you hold corn with your buddy
I'm hopin' that you ain't gettin' corn in your tummy (no way)

If you're in the bando, chasin' that money
One hunna, you split that prof' with your mummy
If your main ting said that she loves me
Would you love her? Would you call her hunny? Dummy
If bro-bro rise for that brucky
Are you gonna run a whole corn with your buddy? (Ha)
And if you hold corn with your buddy
I'm hopin' that you ain't gettin' corn in your tummy (no way)
