		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, everything sucks, just kidding
Everything is great, no really
I haven't thought about my ex today
Oh, wait (fuck, I just did)
But I went outside for the first time 
In a few days and it felt nice
And I might try doing exercise (haha, not really)

I want to forget my bad days, all my bad days 
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade 
And then I'll say, I'll say 

Everything sucks, just kidding
Everything is better than it used to be
I didn't write a song about my ex today
(Oh, wait, um)
But I called my friends and I told them 
We should hang out if it makes sense
'Cause I miss them and I hate being alone (no, really)

I want to forget my bad days, all my bad days 
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade 
And then I'll say, I'll say 

I want to forget my bad days, all my bad days 
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade 
And then I'll say, I'll say 

I want to forget my bad days, all my bad days 
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade 
And then I'll say, I'll say 

Everything sucks 
Just kidding
