		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes and turn your back
What you don't see can't cause a heart attack
Forget what you thought you knew
It wasn't true
Monkey see and monkey do
We keep on lurking in the shadows
Look in the mirror till it shatters
Your wallet will tell you what that matters
Don't do anything that Jesus wouldn't tell you to
I thought he knew
Monkey see and monkey do
Guess I had to tell you motherfuckers two times
You either run the show or you stay on the sidelines
You're either on the bench or you're the starter
We kept evolving but stopped getting smarter
Monkey see and monkey do
We keep our finger on the trigger and pull it
No need to learn to use our words
We talk with bullets
We run in circles, we don't care if we're getting older
We put our lives onto our children shoulders
And make em live them for us
We keep our foot on the gas, no intent to make it last
We live 100 mph and we burn out fast
We put our burdens on our children's backs
Sit down and watch em crack
That's how they pay us back
