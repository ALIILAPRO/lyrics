		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well a hard headed woman a soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble ever since the world began
Oh yeah ever since the world began ah oh oh oh oh
A hard headed woman is a thorn in the side of man
Now Adam said to Eve listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you messin' round that apple tree
Oh yeah ever since the world began...

[Guitar ]

Now Samson told Delilah loud and clear
Keep your cotton pickin' fingers out of my curly hair
Oh yeah ever since the world began...

[Piano ]

Well I heard about a king who's doing swell
Till he started playin' with that evil Jezabel
Oh yeah ever since the world began...
