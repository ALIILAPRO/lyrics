		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man, when shit gets like this, man, the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gon' stop
You know shits gonna get a lot more worse 'fore it get any better

Look, mama hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days 'less I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)
(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)
(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)
(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)

All these hand outs, man, it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man, we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it, yeah
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)
(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)
(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)
(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas)

Make me feel afraid of how I'd been to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am
