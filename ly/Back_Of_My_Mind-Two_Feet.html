		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep on runnin' from my own life
Because I'd rather not fight
It chases me soon as it's daylight
And well through the night
Yeah

But I can never stop wasting all my time with you
Now I can never stop wasting all my time with you

I feel over when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I feel over when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind

My mind, my mind
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
My mind, my mind
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind

I'm tryin' to help myself feel ok
I know I won't be today
All of these thoughts will never go away
I guess I shouldn't complain
Yeah

But I can never stop wasting all my time with you
Now I can never stop wasting all my time with you

I feel over when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I feel over when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind

My mind, my mind
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
My mind, my mind
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind

I feel over when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I feel over when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind

My mind, my mind
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
My mind, my mind
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
