		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like you a lot
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
So I do what you want
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
Blue ribbons on ice
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
'Cause I like you a lot
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Pink flamingos, always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Colors with lights begin to mean
Oh, oh, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

I like you a lot
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
So I do what you want
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
Blue ribbons on ice
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
'Cause I like you a lot
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy you eternity
I, I, see you leaving
So I push record and watch you leave

I like you a lot
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
So I do what you want
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
Blue ribbons on ice
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
'Cause I like you a lot
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Nothing gold can stay
Like love or lemonade
Or sun or summer days
It's all a game to me anyway

I like you a lot
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
So I do what you want
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
Blue ribbons on ice
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
'Cause I like you a lot
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
