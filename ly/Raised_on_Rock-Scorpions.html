		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born in a hurricane
Nothing to lose and everything to gain
Ran before I walked
Reaching for the top
Out of control just like a runaway train

I never walked on the narrow path
I always wanted what I didn't have
All was not enough
Riding lady luck
Driving in the fast lane and just stepped on the gas

Cause I was raised on rock
My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
Yeah I was raised on rock
My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
And I was raised on rock

Shoot me up baby make me high
And hit the jackpot in the heat of the night
Wanna kiss your lips
Wanna move your hips
See my desire in your laser-beam eyes

You shake me up got me spinning Ã¢??round
You know what's going up must come down
Tomorrow I'll be gone
A million miles from home
The only road I know leads out of town

Cause I was raised on rock
My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
Yeah I was raised on rock
My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
And I was raised on rock

Growing up with the guitar men
Growing up way too fast
Follow the sound of a rock 'n roll band
This call will always last

Cause I was raised on rock
