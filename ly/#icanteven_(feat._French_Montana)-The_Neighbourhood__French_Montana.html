		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just got cheated on, no it's not my day
That's not my bitch, she's not my girl, she's not my babe
My stomach's in pain
I hope I don't throw up all over what you told
But it hurts oh no no

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting
I can't even, can't even hear your side
Shame on me, you fooled me twice
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night
Did I even ever cross your mind
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night
Did I even ever cross your mind
You like to say that you're ri-
You like to say that you're right

Drop head with a time hoodie on me
Bought a hundred chains now the bitches all linger
Walk by the crib, smell the kush all stanky
Floor seats, 4 quarter, spent a quarter on the link
Ridin' through Philly, Meek Milly never lost
Still ridin' through the strip catchin' licks with my dog
30 for the whole, 15 for the half
You could break it down, come and see me with the bag
Shorty fell in love with a young rich nigga
Blunt full of smoke and a cup full of liquor
Say what I mean and I mean what I said baby
Silk sheets, I be slippin' off the bed baby

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting
I can't even, can't even hear your side
Shame on me, you fooled me twice
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night
Did I even ever cross your mind
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night
Did I even ever cross your mind
You like to say that you're ri-
You like to say that you're right
