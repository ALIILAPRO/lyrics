		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all going to end

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (gonna to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, prayers

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

You can change the world
You can touch the sky, that's right (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight

Change the world
