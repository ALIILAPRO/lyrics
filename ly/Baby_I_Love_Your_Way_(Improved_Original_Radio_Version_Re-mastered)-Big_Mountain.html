		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day

Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night (ooh)
Far away from the city

But don't, oh no, hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait, ayy-yeah

Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day, yeah
I wanna be with you night and day

The moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
Well, I can see them under the pine

But don't, whoa no, no, hesitate, la-di-da
'Cause your love just won't wait, ayy-yeah

Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day, ayy-yeah
I wanna be with you night and day
Whoa baby, oh baby, please, every day

How I love, how I love you, oh
I love your way
Ooh, baby please

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey, and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season

But don't, whoa no, no, hesitate, la-di-da
'Cause your love just won't wait (ayy-yeah), just won't wait

Ooh, baby, I love your way, every, every day
I wanna tell you I love your way 
(I wanna tell you, how I love your little ways)
I wanna be with you night and day (every day and every way)

Billi-aboo-dee-dee-da-di-do-sta-da-bee-yeah

Ooh, baby, I love your way (ooh baby)
(How I love your little ways, yeah)
I wanna tell you I love your way (I wanna tell you how I)
(I wanna tell you how I love your little ways)
I wanna be with you night and day
(Biddi-aboo-see-da-ja-bee-da-di-yeah)
Ooh, baby, I love your way (ooh, baby, baby, baby)
