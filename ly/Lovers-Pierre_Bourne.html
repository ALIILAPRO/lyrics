		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
You can keep me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Yo, yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
You can keep me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever

I saw you were perfect, yeah, I had to love you then
I planned to be with you, yeah, 'til forever ends
You didn't understand, not hearing you every day
So much to think about, but you stay in my way
So much to think about, that's why she give me brain
But she gon' start missing me when she Uber away
My new bitch pulled up in a 'Rari, yeah, that's my bae
I need a bitch to motivate me to get my cake
I told her I'ma change, yeah, I told her

Forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
You can keep me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever

You were mine, I'm yours
Now I'm rich, you're poor
Got the wave like shore
Hoes have sex
Like I wonder what life would be like if I left you?
I wonder what life would be like if I kept you?
I told her no feelings, just rolled up my feelings
So high on the ceiling, I can't come down
All of these bitches, they just want a nigga
To buy them expensive and fly them out
Man, these hoes been doing this

Forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
You can keep me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever
Girl, you got me waiting on your love forever

Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Damn, I'm lost in the sauce
Ah, shit
