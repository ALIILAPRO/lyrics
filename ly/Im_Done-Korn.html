		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the pain, we are the shame
We've gone insane, inside where no one's around
I am to blame for everything
I like this game that you all make me play

I'm done being there for others
They have their pain, and so do I
Don't need to feel it all over
I try to hold on, and you bring me down

We are estranged, we are deranged
I can't explain how you all break me apart
I am to blame for everything
I like this game that you all make me play

I'm done being there for others
They have their pain, and so do I
Don't need to feel it all over
I try to hold on, and you bring me down

We wait, we hate
We try to get away
Mistake my pain
It has been let astray
I'm looking around, I drop to the ground
Why does this have to end this way?

Feeling numb so long
Oh God, it's just everything
It's everything
Now I pray for all 
Of them to go away

I'm done being there for others
They have their pain, and so do I
Don't need to feel it all over
I try to hold on, and you bring me down
