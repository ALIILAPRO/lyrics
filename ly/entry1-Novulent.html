		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where I'll stay, my mind is always racing
We're lovers for the day, but you hate me it's crazy
Just look me in the face, our distances getting crazy
Will I see you again, my baby, I'm tired of writing love songs
I need you far away, I slit my wrists for you girl
There's comfort in my pain, you say you'll always love me
But your actions aren't the same, I can't live like this baby
So I'll take my life away, now you'll care for me my baby
