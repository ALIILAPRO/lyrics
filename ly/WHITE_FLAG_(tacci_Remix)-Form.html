		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White flag,
Burnt down,
Now you're standing on your own,
The wilder, the road is,
The more you carry on,
Eyes wide open until you get there,
With your heart of stone,
No matter how familiar the face is,
You'll take it all along
Hold up,
Define the shadows coming over you,
And it won't stop,
Before you embrace it all and,
Breathe out to me, say
Will you shoot it all down,
I hope not

When it all comes down, you're staring at me
If I'm waving the white flag, you're onto me,
When it all comes down, you blame it all on me
Still I'm waving the white flag, the white flag

Trapped in your own maze,
You're definitely gone this time,
See I was hardly calling your name,
You were suffocating with deny,

You and your troubled mind,
I was only tryna help you,
You and your troubled mind,
I couldn't get there without you,
Cause I'm waving the white flag,
You were pointing at me,
Staring at me,
But I swear you got the wrong guy,
I'm waving the white flag

When it all comes down, you're staring at me
If I'm waving the white flag, you're onto me,
When it all comes down, you blame it all on me
Still I'm waving the white flag, the white flag

I was just waving the white flag
