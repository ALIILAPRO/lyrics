		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moved out to a new city
June is dawning down on me
And all that I can find's
A sickly romance in the air
Lovers stroll without a care in sight
Ooh, this can't be right

'Cause the sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friend's found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love
And I'm falling behind

Touched the ocean, fell right in
Stepped outside and burned my skin
My life won't go my way
Bossa nova in my room
Hope that I'll find someone too
To love, because

The sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friend's found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love
And I'm falling behind

Everybody's falling in love
Everybody's falling in love, oh
Everybody's falling in love but me

(One, two, three)
