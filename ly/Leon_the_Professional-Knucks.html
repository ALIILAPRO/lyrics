		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I needed this technique to hit a man from like change
(No-no, no days off, no days off, no days off)
Waitin', waitin', sat here wastin' my time, just waitin'
In the car parked outside of the station but came with two yutes older than me
I used to like when they tell man stories about all the highs and lows of the street
Who rose? Who fell? Who goes to jail? Who don't and is free?

Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?
I said, "Leon?", they said, "Leon"
He was from the flats that the jack kids be on
Before the cats there had the crack to fiend on
They say on the street he a phenom
When he squeeze dons it's phenomenal
Make a change off a name like a hitman
And will hitman if it's reasonable

They all have the same reason to call
Oh, what a big misfortune if blank ceases to breathe anymore
MAC on the mantel, teeth in the jaw
If you ask him, he'll call it his callin'
Courts is the one that's receivin' the call
If I price on your head in the mornin'
Call money up like there's P's on the wall
Wanna pay me the set 
Just say the name and address
A couple pictures never hurt
Man wanna be certain he aimin' correct
A scar on his arm and the nape of the neck
And a big one goin' along the torso
From when the boys tried snake him in west
That calass repaid in flesh

Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?
I said, "Leon?", they said, "Leon"
He was from the flats that the jack kids be on
Before the cats there had the crack to fiend on
They say on the street he a phenom
When he squeeze dons it's phenomenal
Make a change off a name like a hitman
And will hitman if it's reasonable

Logic and reason one thing he pree's 
Every man's got a code
Never hit children or women
And don't bring tings to your humble abode
He caught most of his bodies alone
Bodies in storage, bodies at home
Feds on the mission to catch man slippin'
By time they sniffin' along, man's ghost
Bro who do you suppose I could go to and talk 'bout a small little problem
My problems on Princess Road by the junction
My hunch is he holds, so don't hold and he punches
Hold what? Hold where?
Man flung on the all black Airs
Take out a man in his bando 
And end up wrappin' all that's theirs

Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?
I said, "Leon?", they said, "Leon"
He was from the flats that the jack kids be on
Before the cats there had the crack to fiend on
They say on the street he a phenom
When he squeeze dons it's phenomenal
Make a change off a name like a hitman
And will hitman if it's reasonable

He come back one evenin' 
Ain't even get 'round to put keys in the door
The ding of the lift when it came to the fifths sent a shiver 
The kid ain't feelin' before
"What, did they finally found my location?"
"Okay then, mans waitin'"
Then when he gradually opened the door 
Heard the voice say, "Don't move, mate, you're goin' to the station"
He always knew one day they would come
Would go out amazin', blazin' his gun
He reached for the piece that he kept on the landin'
But mans wasn't playin', and made him with one
When the fed tried radio it in
Man ran for the first window that was open
He couldn't survive that fall, are you jokin'?
But when he looked out, there was nobody posted

Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?
I said, "Leon?", they said, "Leon"
He was from the flats that the jack kids be on
Before the cats there had the crack to fiend on
They say on the street he a phenom
When he squeeze dons it's phenomenal
Make a change off a name like a hitman
And will hitman if it's reasonable
