		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like a ghost
I don't know why
I feel like a ghost
Looking for life

Floating, never in the daylight
Haunting, everything I lost

I feel like a ghost
I don't know why

All I want is a little hope
All I want is to fill my soul

Please fill up my soul
My tap is running low
Please fill up my soul
My life is in a hole

If I diagnosed
The pain in my life
Trying to find
A way to revive

Searching, for the antidote but
No ones telling me the cure

I'm just so alone
And I don't know why

All I want is a little hope
All I want is to fill my soul

All I want is a little hope
All I want is to fill my soul

Please fill up my soul
My tap is running low
Please fill up my soul
My life is in a hole

Please fill up my soul
My tap is running low
Please fill up my soul
My life is in a hole

Save me, you know you can
Lend me a helping hand
What you give, I'll take it
Promise I won't break it
Promise I can make it

All I want is a little hope
All I want is a little hope
All I want is to fill my soul

Please fill up my soul
My tap is running low
Please fill up my soul
My life is in a hole 

Please fill up my soul
My tap is running low
Please fill up my soul
My life is in a hole
