		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a good girl on the outside
But a bad girl when the mood's right
In the moonlight she becomes his naughty little thing
She's exclusive, she's elusive
But with him she's so inclusive
She's a giver, but only when fulfilling all his needs
Yeah, she's got those pretty eyes
But behind them lies
Thoughts of him at night she can't seem to fight
Feelings that she knows she's gonna have to feed
And ever since the day that he got a taste
She's his only chase, he cannot replace
Thoughts of her up in his mind, a curiosity

Yeah, she looks like a little angel
But at night's a different angle
Demon eyes looking fatal
Got a mind, dirty, playful

Yeah, she got naughty thoughts
That she can't control
She don't wanna tell, she would rather show
Red little heart, black little soul
Teeth that are sharp, bite that is cold

She got a secret little dirty mind
Lewd imagination in the night
She don't like to waste any time
She's so creative when you cut the lights

She just wanna make him feel good
She just wanna make him feel good
She know how to make him feel good

She's a good girl on the outside
But a bad girl when the mood's right
In the moonlight she becomes his naughty little thing
She's exclusive, she's elusive
But with him she's so inclusive
She's a giver, but only when fulfilling all his needs
Yeah, she's got those pretty eyes
But behind them lies
Thoughts of him at night she can't seem to fight
Feelings that she knows she's gonna have to feed
And ever since the day that he got a taste
She's his only chase, he cannot replace
Thoughts of her up in his mind, a curiosity

She's something worth holding on to
After everything she's gone through
Rose full of thorns
Hope through the storms
She's got stories that could haunt you

She knows things that she shouldn't know
Only see 'em when you're really close
In the dark it's a different show
Mirrors on the walls only know

She just wanna taste the forbidden fruit
She can't shake her lust, she likes being used
By someone she trusts, by somebody who
Is as hooked on her as she is to you
He don't want her to leave when
She's tangled in his sheets and
She gives him all he needs, mmm

Slowly falling
Cravings calling
I won't let you go

She's a good girl on the outside
But a bad girl when the mood's right
In the moonlight she becomes his naughty little thing
She's exclusive, she's elusive
But with him she's so inclusive
She's a giver, but only when fulfilling all his needs
Yeah, she's got those pretty eyes
But behind them lies
Thoughts of him at night she can't seem to fight
Feelings that she knows she's gonna have to feed
And ever since the day that he got a taste
She's his only chase, he cannot replace
Thoughts of her up in his mind, a curiosity
