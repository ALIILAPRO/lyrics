		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wonder what you taste like
Wonder how you fall asleep
Wonder how you'd kiss me
When you've had too much to drink

Let me do the dishes
Fold your clothes and make you tea
Let me love you senseless
Unapologetically

Why'd you make the same mistakes again?
No one else should be holding your hand
Let me in, I promise I won't disappear
Again

Let's throw out our cell phones
Drive around the countryside
Take a trip to Oak Grove
Plan for when we stay the night

Why you going out with her in mind?
I'm the one who's on the other line
Let me in, I promise I won't disappear
This time

Call me, say tonight, you'll be out late
I'll be waiting miles and miles away
Let me in, I promise I won't disappear
If you stay
