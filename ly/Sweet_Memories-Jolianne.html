		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  going through another phase
of drowning out the feels with booze
slept through a whole tidal wave
i don't recall seeing this view

i'm not one to let myself go
tiptoeing down the tightrope
where is that girl I used to know


i'm watching from the back seat
im forgetting all of my dreams
they've lost all meaning to me


take me to the sweet memories
take me to the sweet memories


days and weeks, they're all the same
when you've got nothing left to lose
someone took my place
and I can feel myself slipping from you(th)

im not one to let myself go
tiptoeing down the tightrope
where is that girl I used to know


and im watching from the back seat
im forgetting all of my dreams
they've lost all meaning to me


take me to the sweet memories
take me to the sweet memories


seeing everything go by, 
i watch from the backseat
wonder what it would be like 
if I didn't forget me
back when I was full of life
those sweetest memories


take me to the sweet memories
take me to the sweet memories
