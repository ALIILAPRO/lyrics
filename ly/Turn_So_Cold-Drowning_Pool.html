		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's too much, not enough
What you need I don't get
I don't know why you never say, you never do
Is this my luck again
Silent words never shed
All I get is you turning away
You turn

So cold
It's never enough it's
always too much
For what you never say
What you never go and say
You're so cold
It's never enough it's
always too much
What you never say
Never do
Never say

Is it me that you see changing
What you think you need
All I can say is I'll always
trade me for you
Is it my heart I break
Hard to give what you won't take
If you did would you throw it away
And turn

So cold

Our time is slipping away
Slipping away

Isn't my word enough
What I say is what you get
And all I get is you turning away
You turn

So cold

Our time is slipping away
Slipping away
