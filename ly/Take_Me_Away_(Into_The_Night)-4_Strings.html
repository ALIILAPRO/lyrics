		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shining light 
Another day turns in to rain 
Eternal fight 
I waited all my life 

Take me away 
Million miles away from here 
Take me away 
Find the place for you and me 
You're taking me higher 
High as I could be 
You take me away 
Forever you and me 
Take me away 

The tears I cried 
Kept them all inside
I needed time 
To make up my mind 

Take me away 
Million miles away from here 
Take me away 
Find the place for you and me 
You're taking me higher 
High as I could be
You take me away 
Forever you and me 
Take me away 

Take me away 
Million miles away from here 
Take me away 
Find the place for you and me 
You're taking me higher 
High as I could be
You take me away 
Forever you and me 
Take me away
