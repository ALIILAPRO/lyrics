		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Minimal fuss

Blvcksheep forever, Blvcksheep for life, IZGAAJU till we KPEME
You get me, ODUMODUBLVCK, Native

When I show you my love
I don't expect nothing
But minimal trust
She been Dey go hang with Boj
Him Dey give am doggy
She's a diligent toy (something like I'm ozomena)

Brother show me the way
How you take run am
Minimal fuss (MODU e no matter)

Mama
But why you dey wicked
Shenk that nigga
He's a diligent boy (with my speedometer)

When I show you my love
I don't expect nothing
But minimal trust (my dilemma)
She been Dey go hang with Boj
Him Dey give am doggy
She's a diligent toy (something like I'm ozomena)

Brother show me the way
How you take run am
Minimal fuss (MODU e no matter)

Mama
Why you dey wicked
Shenk that nigga
He's a diligent boy (with my speedometer)

Ronaldo de Lima
Na 13 leg over she count
100 niggas Dey her queue
As if I know I bounce
Before I know she count
All my loses amount
To me never losing my sound
I better be the man I said I am

Na for GIDI dem Dey love olonsho
E Dey show
Bojilos tell me how e be
I think I'm with a hoe
Came from britico
Now they tell me that I'm a pro
Modu Otilo
Nwanyo nwanyor
OTITAN
E better make I die by drive by
Before I go let that shawty go
And even if na early pai pai
I go rise up
Follow up e choke

When I show you my love
I don't expect nothing
But minimal trust (my dilemma)
She been Dey go hang with Boj
Him Dey give am doggy
She's a diligent toy (something like I'm ozomena)

Brother show me the way
How you take run am
Minimal fuss (MODU e no matter)

Mama
Why you dey wicked
Shenk that nigga
He's a diligent boy (with my speedometer)

I'm a big boy I be agbalagba
Carry your kele abracadabra
Blow her mind o
I am Osama
Enter colo
Mo salah

After we wine and dine
We go dance and wine
Johnny dey rise and shine
E wan dey do ein work
You know e no dey talk
Ey
I carry her go London
I carry her go Hong Kong
She no dey ask me where the money come from
She tell me say
Make I on the condom

When I show you my love
I don't expect nothing
But minimal trust (my dilemma)
She been Dey go hang with Boj
Him Dey give am doggy
She's a diligent toy (something like I'm ozomena)

Brother show me the way
How you take run am
Minimal fuss (MODU e no matter)

Mama
Why you dey wicked
Shenk that nigga
He's a diligent boy (with my speedometer)
