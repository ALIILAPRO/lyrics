		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess I'm still not in the grave
Pretty far from the cage you left me
Like I said, I'm not afraid
But for a minute I was lost and empty
And I admit that I was scared as Hell
Of the things that I might do to myself
But now I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I'm happy now

But seriously, I'm happy that you're, you're finally happy
You just have to, you know, follow your heart
And be with the people who feel right to your soul
You know 'cause all the people who stay stuff just don't matter
You know that, they don't know the real you
They don't know what's really going on
