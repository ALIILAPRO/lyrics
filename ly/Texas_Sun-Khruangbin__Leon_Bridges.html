		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you like the wind blowing through your hair
Come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down
Texas sun
Say you wanna hit the highway while the engine roars
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down
That Texas sun, oh yeah
Texas sun

Caressing you from Fort Worth to Amarillo
Come on, roll with me 'til the sun dips low
Texas sun
Texas sun, oh girl
Texas sun

When I'm far from home and them cold winds blow
Stuck out somewhere with folks I don't know
'Cause you keep me nice and you keep me warm
Wanna feel you on me, can't wait to get back there again
Texas sun
Texas sun
Texas sun, oh
Texas sun

You say you like the wind blowing through your hair
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down
Texas sun
Texas sun

Ooh baby, you're so gorgeous
How about you and me take a lil' trip
In the big body?

Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Oh, girl

Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Baby, oh

Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
