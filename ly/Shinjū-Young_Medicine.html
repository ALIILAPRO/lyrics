		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When your hopes are falling

Unite behind a safe bet
A killer in a slick dress
Shed your skin and regress
Your queen of static is a hot mess

Don't fight you'll have to take it
Sink lower into apathy
Suffer that it's meant to be
Embrace it, deface it all

Embrace it, deface it all

Would you fight
Would you die
To project the change you've buried deep inside
I'll take your pain and make it mine
When your hopes are falling

Unite behind a safe bet
A killer in a slick dress
Shed your skin and regress
Your queen of static is a hot mess

We're all fucking falling

Would you fight
Would you die
To project the change you've buried deep inside

Would you fight
Would you die
To project the change you've buried deep inside
I'll take your pain and make it mine
When your hopes are falling

When your hopes are falling
