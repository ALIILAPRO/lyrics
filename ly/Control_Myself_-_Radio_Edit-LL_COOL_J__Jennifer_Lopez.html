		<p>
		  No me puedo controlar 
Aquí con el señor LL Cool J 
Y aquí estoy
Ya tú sabe' (oh, oh)
1, 2, 3 muévete

The club was far from empty 
It was crowded at the entry 
I slide right through like how I do 
This girl began to tempt me
She said her name Shaiyeeda 
I could tell her mama feed her 
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit 
I'm L, nice to meet ya 
I could feel my body yearnin' 
The room just started turnin' 
Didn't wanna go out on the floor 
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance) 
My brain began to sizzle 
I'm sweatin' just a little 
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled, she said

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man 
It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself 
You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make this boy be bad 
It's hard to control myself, it's hard to control myself 

It's hard for me to control myself 
Get to hold myself 
Back from jumpin' on ya 
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another 
We barely know each other 
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh) 
The air is filled with passion 
The strobe lights are flashin' 
The hustlers throw cash in 
The bar tender keeps splashin' 
Her moves were so erotic 
Her games were so hypnotic 
I bet this girl could stop it 
But she continued to pop it 

You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your sidekick 
Cause the after party is at my body
Meet me, you're invited 

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man 
It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself 
You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make this boy be bad 
It's hard to control myself, it's hard to control myself 

It's hard for me to control myself 
Get to hold myself 
Back from jumpin' on ya 
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

She licked off 
Her lip gloss 
Her hips toss 
Back and forth 
Side to side and 
Up and down 
She touched the ground 
It turned me out
I'm battlin' desire 
Lord help me douse this fire 
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo (c'mon)
Her top was short and purple 
Belly dancin' in a circle 
When I feel like this I can't resist 
I don't make me hurt you, she said 

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man 
It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself 
You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make this boy be bad 
It's hard to control myself, it's hard to control myself 

It's hard for me to control myself 
Get to hold myself 
Back from jumpin' on ya 
Like I wanna like I wanna, wanna

Zih-zih-zih-zih-zih, zih-zih-zih
Zih-zih-zih-zih-zih-zih-zih
Zih-zih-zih, zih-zih, zih-zih
Zih-zih, zih-zih, zih-zih, zih-zih

Zih-zih-zih-zih-zih, zih-zih-zih
Zih-zih-zih-zih-zih-zih-zih
Zih-zih-zih, zih-zih, zih-zih
Zih-zih, zih-zih, zih-zih, zih-zih

Uh, yeah
I need everybody to report to the dance floor
Right now, woo-ooh
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
Shake it, shake it (haha)
Shake, shake it (y'all know what this is)
Shake, shake it
