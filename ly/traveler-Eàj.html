		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are your legs weary
jumping tear to the next
Or is it just merely
To feel The heat from your chest
Lemi buy you fabric highs yea
Whatever you like
maybe we might just
Catch a vibe
On the 405
Dont
Dont let us die

Watcha been away for
Cus everyone's home
You've always got a place here
And that's set in stone
Everybody's home
What you been hiding for
What you been hiding for

Are your legs not weary
Jumping tear to the next
Is it all too merely to feel the heat from my chest
Whats got you stuck in a Season
Been gone since the weekend
It started with summer
And spring leaves are grieving
And i fall into winter
Fall into winter
Would you be thinking bout me
Would you be thinking bout me
When you get cold
In the winter
Cold in the winter
Would you be thinking bout me
Would you be bout me

Watcha been away for
Cus everyone's home
You've always got a place here
And that's set in stone
Everybody's home
What you been hiding for
What you been hiding for
What you been hiding for
What you been hiding for
Dont keep you from loving
Dont keep you from loving
Dont keep you from loving
Dont keep you from loving
Dont keep me from loving you
