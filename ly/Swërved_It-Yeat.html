Yeah
Yeah, yeah

Turn up, swerved the coupe, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
Yeah, yeah, swerved the coupe, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
Yeah, yeah, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
Yeah, I'm on X, I'm going brazy, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
I just pulled up to the show, I had it jumping (yeahhh)
I just pulled up to the show, I had it jumping (yeahhh)
I just made another hit like it ain't nothing (yeahhh)
I be counting all these hundreds, it ain't nothing (yeahhh)
Yeah, they keep fronting 

If I told your ass to turn up, better turn up with me now 
Who the hell you listening to? Ain't shit to figure out (ooh)
Hit the bank with all my racks, yeah, I told 'em pull it out (ooh ooh, ooh)
Mix the percs up with the X, yeah, they try to jack my style (ooh ooh)

We were riding in the coupe, I hit the pedal, made a sound (ooh ooh)
Big ol' diamonds on me, all these bitches look at they size (ooh ooh)
Yeah, we knowing that we going up, they tried to pick a side (ooh ooh)
If you listen to what I tell you, then you'll probably learn to fly (ooh ooh)

I just told them boys the word, I just told them boys to slide (purr)
Give a fuck 'bout what you heard, yeah, probably all a lie
Since when did I tell you that I try?
Since when did I owe you? Bitch, you stupid fried

We're worldwide from the West Coast to the East Coast
I got Tonkas on me, baby, what you want and what you know?
I wanna hear what you been talking about me before you go
Tell me everything you heard but it ain't everything you know

When it's coming to the money, yeah, that's my hoe
Yeah, my bitch just pulled up on me and then she blow
I just told 'em, keep it coming, I'ma turn into a ghost
Bitch, it's been fuck what you wanted, get the money and let me go

Turn up, swerved the coupe, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
Yeah, yeah, swerved the coupe, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
Yeah, yeah, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
Yeah, I'm on X, I'm going brazy, swerved the coupe (yeahhh)
I just pulled up to the show, I had it jumping (yeahhh)
I just pulled up to the show, I had it jumping (yeahhh)
I just made another hit like it ain't nothing (yeahhh)
I be counting all these hundreds, it ain't nothing (yeahhh)
Yeah, they keep fronting
