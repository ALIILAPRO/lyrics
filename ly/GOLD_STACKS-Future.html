		  (DMC, you global now, nigga)
I just need some 'cause I already got one with the seal, nigga
Yeah, I got one in the cut with a seal, yeah
Yeah

Step on a nigga, nigga
Step on a nigga in some all white ones, nigga
Fuckin' on your bitch, holdin' on my gun, yeah (woo)
Fuck the plug, I just ran through a ton, uh

I don't wanna shoot no dice unless we bettin' gold stacks, nigga
Bet a ten, shoot a ten, my twin servin' dog food
Go and ask the promoter, I charge three-fifty for a walkthrough (Pluto)
Back to back in Saudi Arabia, I charged 1.5 (woo)
Three mil' just to talk, nigga, that's all I got
I just stepped on a bitch in Chanel No. 9
I just stepped up her swag, now she all buss down
I'm a rich junkie, yeah, all these drugs I buy

Bitch, blow a nigga top before you blow my high (a nigga top)
Had my scammers with me too, they lettin' these hundreds fly
Throw some hundreds like ones, make a straight girl bi
She just fucked me in front of her friends, told me she was shy
And she eat whatever I tell her, that's a gumbo vibe (eat it)
I ain't even gotta say nothin', this ho look at me like God
How much you paid for that Jumbo Patek? Four twenty-five
(No, that's four-fifty, for real)

I don't wanna shoot no dice unless we bettin' gold stacks, nigga
Bet a ten, shoot a ten, my twin servin' dog food
Go and ask the promoter, I charge three-fifty for a walkthrough
Back to back in Saudi Arabia, I charged 1.5
Three mil' just to talk, nigga, that's all I got
I just stepped on a bitch in Chanel No. 9 (yeah)
I just stepped up her swag, now she all buss down
I'm a rich junkie, yeah, all these drugs I buy

I done talked so much shit, my problems can't even think (what he say?)
I start talkin' so many numbers, they callin' me the bank (yeah)
Bought me a pay 'em card, Dr. Phil for that drank (yeah)
I give 'em a brick and uh, they gon' leave you stained (yeah)
Free my nigga Chuck, I told him we gettin' a billion off the top
We don't even wanna know who shot at you, we wipin' off a block
Over one thousand shells, they gon' hear 'bout it tomorrow
Ain't no time to negotiate, we got them bails, fuck a clock
I'm The Wizard, nigga, I can turn the trap into a star
I'm in the real rare, nigga, automobile, that's a double R
I done came out the field, I work a stick, fuck a guitar
You ain't got enough to gamble then you can put up your car

I don't wanna shoot no dice unless we bettin' gold stacks, nigga
Bet a ten, shoot a ten, my twin servin' dog food
Go and ask the promoter, I charge three-fifty for a walkthrough
Back to back in Saudi Arabia, I charged 1.5
Three mil' just to talk, nigga, that's all I got
I just stepped on a bitch in Chanel No. 9
I just stepped up her swag, now she all buss down
I'm a rich junkie, yeah, all these drugs I buy

(Yeah, step on a nigga, nigga)
(Step on a nigga in some all white ones, nigga)
(Fuckin' on your bitch, holdin' on my gun, yeah) (woo)
(Fuck the plug, I just ran through a ton, uh)

(Unless we bettin' gold stacks, nigga)
(I don't wanna shoot no dice unless we bettin' gold stacks, nigga)
(I don't wanna shoot no dice unless we bettin' gold stacks)
