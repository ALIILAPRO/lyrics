		  Blue Rondo A La Turk (Round, Round, Round)

Round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round a harmony
Round, round, round a melody,
Harmony, melody-steadily

Round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round a memory
Round, round, round a melody,
Memory, melody, merrily.

There's a melody I used to play
Counterpoint every yesterday.
Swiftly up and down I hasten and
Chasten my fingers and heart to play.

Round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round a memory
Round, round, round a melody
Memory, harmony-steadily

Round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round a mystery
Round, round, round a melody,
Mystery, mirror of history.

Taking over all my reveries
Hearing passions in the melodies
Play it up and down so wearily
Stumbling, fumbling, tumbling.

Round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round a harmony
Round, round, round a melody
Harmony, melody, memory

Round, round town I follow you.
Round, round town I'm calling you.
Round, round town I hasten to do
All the chasing you want me to.

Open up an opportunity,
For I know that you will be
Truly happy and content with me.
Measure me, treasure me, pleasure me.

Open up an opportunity.
Open up an offer. You will be
Truly happy and content with me.
Measure me, treasure me, pleasure me.

Round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round a you and me.
Round, round, round a melody
You and me, melody and harmony.

Round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round a harmony
Round, round, round a melody,
Harmony, mystery-you and me.

Don't you see
That we were meant to be,
One and the same.
Melody, married to harmony,
One and the same.
Change the score
We will be ever more
One and the same.
Melody, married to harmony
One and the same.

Here it comes, our symphony,
Measure by measure.
A melody and harmony,
You and me in harmony.
You and me so happy
Were making it
Shaking the blues ain't bothering me.

Here it comes, our symphony,
Measure by measure,
A pleasure.
A melody and harmony,
You and me in harmony
You and me so happy
We found a new rondo,
To end the blue rondo today.
