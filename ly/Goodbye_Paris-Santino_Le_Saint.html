		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye Paris
Kiss me before you go
Goodbye Paris
Sign this letter with my cologne
Oh Paris
Can't leaving you dancing on your own
Goodbye Paris
I'll be back before you know

Champagne and cigarettes
Hour glass figure perfect silhouette
Lingerie and some fresh sheets
Dressed to the teeth
She makes my fashion week, oh

If I leave tonight
Would you fall asleep alone
Or would you lay awake
With your head beside the phone

Goodbye Paris
Kiss me before you go
Goodbye Paris
Sign this letter with my cologne
Oh Paris
Can't leaving you dancing on your own
Goodbye Paris
I'll be back before you know

Told you I'll be back in a minute babe
And I swear I'll keep my promise to you
(To you)
Just promise not to love me any different baby
'Cause I seen time bend a heart out of tune

If I leave tonight
Would you fall asleep alone
Or would you lay awake
With your head beside the phone

Goodbye Paris
Kiss me before you go
Goodbye Paris
Sign this letter with my cologne
Oh Paris
Can't leaving you dancing on your own
Goodbye Paris
I'll be back before you know

Goodbye Paris
Goodbye Paris
Goodbye Paris
Goodbye Paris
Goodbye Paris
Goodbye Paris
