		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask you, ask you, ask you, ask you

Ask you, ask you, ask you, ask you

I saw you last night
Just watching you dancing
I couldn't stop thinking about you
How you move
How you groove, how you shake

I was hoping I see you tonight
So I'm wondering and hoping
That I see you tonight
Have only one dance with you
Just to dance the whole night through
You and me
Just to look into your eyes
And feel that
Feel that warmth, the love, the passion
The music and the rhythm
Get really high
Just to be with you, baby

Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me 
Touch me 'til I start to scream

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancing
Just to hold you
To get your smile

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancing
Just to hold you
To get your smile

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancin'
Just to hold you
To get your smile

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancing
Just to hold you
To get your smile

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancing
Just to hold you
To get your smile

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancin'
Just to hold you
To get your smile

Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me 
Touch me 'til I start to scream
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me 
Touch me 'til I start to scream
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me 
Touch me 'til I start to scream
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me 
Touch me 'til I start to scream

Ask you, ask you, ask you, ask you
Ask you, ask you, ask you, ask you
Ask you, ask you, ask you, ask you
Ask you, ask you, ask you, ask you

Music and the rhythm
Get really high
To get your smile

I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will

Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me 

I was, I was

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancing
Just to hold you
To get your smile

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancing (you'll ask for dancing)
Just to hold you
To get your smile

La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la
La, la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
La
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

I was hoping
You'll ask for dancin'
Just to hold you
To get your smile

I was hoping
You'll ask for, you'll ask for
You'll ask for dancing
To get your smile

I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will, I

Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me 
Touch me 'til I start to scream

'Til I start to scream
