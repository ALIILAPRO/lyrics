		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The things I'm about to tell you aren't so you
Change what's already on your mind
It's just that I keep thinking 'bout all the melodies
You made asleep at night

Every time I got out of bed to (oh no)
Start my day that's when I'd hear you
And with a tired yawn
You'd tell me that you loved me, I'll be fine
And that's what got me through the day alright

Beautiful
Just the way that you would look at me
Was so much I'd never wanna leave
I, I keep trying to forget how you were

Beautiful
Just the way that you were calling my name
But without you, it won't be the same
I, I keep trying to forget but you were beautiful

No matter what I do (I do)
I know that to you
Things will just stay the way they are
Just that I keep
Thinking 'bout how we used to be
God, I just hate this part

Every time I would get upset you'd 
You'd hold me tight and wouldn't let go
And with your head on mine
You'd make me realize I would be just fine
That you'd stay here until it was alright

Beautiful
Just the way that you would look at me
Was so much I'd never wanna leave
I, I keep trying to forget how you were

Beautiful
Just the way that you were calling my name
But without you, it won't be the same
I, I keep trying to forget but you were beautiful

Think I've cried more than I had imagined
If this is real, take me back to the start then
What I want but I know it can't happen
Baby I know, it's already over

I don't want you to hurt but can't help it
Every moment is thoughts of you back when
I saw you throw me a smile and that had me

Beautiful
'Cause the last time that you looked at me
I did all I could I watched you leave
I, I keep trying to forget how you were

Beautiful
All the things you gave to stay with me
All of your smiles when I would disagree
I, I keep trying to forget but you were beautiful
