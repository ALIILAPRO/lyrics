		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your cruel device
Your blood, like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

[Chorus]
I want to love you but I better not touch
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't want to break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

[Chorus]

You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't want to break these chains

Run deep inside my veins
Its burning deep inside my veins
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

[Chorus]

You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't want to break these chains

Poison

[Chorus]

You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't want to break these chains

Poison
