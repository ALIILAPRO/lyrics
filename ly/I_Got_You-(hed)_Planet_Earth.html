		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody's waiting for you
Nobody's home
Nobody's listening to you
'Cause nobody cares 
And they will never change
They are slowly dying
They will never go away
They have nothing to lose

All my people come on
Choose your side
You're a long way from home, but not alone

They are afraid of you
'Cause you know their secrets
I hear them praying for you
That you disappear
They are the enemy
We are the fallen
Now they have us on our knees
We have nothing to lose

All my people come on
Choose your side
You're a long way from home, but not alone
Keep your head up
Keep it real
Stay down
You're a long long way from home
You're not alone
I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you

Now who want to ride with me
Bring pain to the powers that be
Young rebel start a riot with me
Hear me, feel me

The sky was blood red on New Years Day
One thousand candles light the way
Ten thousand souls are restless
Ten million hungry
Yeah, eat the rich, but pay me!
In the next episode
I load and reload
It's kill or be killed
Sell or be sold
In this life, in this time, in my mind 
I gotta stay high, cause I got left behind 

All my people come on
Choose your side
You're a long way from home, but not alone
Keep your head up, come on
Keep it real
Stay down
You're a long long way from home
You're not alone
I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you
I got you

Now who want to ride with me
Bring pain to the powers that be
Young rebel start a riot with me
Hear me, feel me

Now who want to ride with me
Get buck, get wild with me
Who will jump into the fire with me
Hear me, feel me

I got you, I got you,
I got you, yeah I got you,
I got you, I got you,
I got you, I got you yeah
