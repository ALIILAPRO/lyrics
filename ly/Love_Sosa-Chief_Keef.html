		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuckers in school tellin' me, always in the barber shop
"Chief Keef ain't 'bout this, Chief Keef ain't 'bout that
My boy a BD on fuckin' Lamron and them
He, he, they say that nigga don't be putting in no work"
Shut the fuck up
Y'all niggas ain't on shit
All you motherfuckers talkin' 'bout
"Chief Keef ain't no hitta, Chief Keef ain't this, Chief Keef a fake"
Shut the fuck up
Y'all don't live with that nigga
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since, fuckin', I don't know when
Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there
If I catch another motherfucker talkin' sweet about Chief Keef
I'm fuckin' beatin' they ass
I'm not fuckin' playin' no more
Know them niggas roll with Lil Reese and them
(Young Chop on the beat)

Love Sosa, bitches love Sosa, ha

You know I got bands, boy, and it's in my pants, boy
Disrespect them O Boys, you won't speak again, boy
Don't think that I'm playin', boy, no, we don't use hands, boy
No, we don't do friends, boy, collect bands, I'm the landlord

Ridin' with 3hunna, with three hundred foreigns
