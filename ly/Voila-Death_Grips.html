		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My proper voilà shadow gander
My shadow stigmata often
Left, right, up, step right up
Get your crisis rock-bottom
Crack light priest wind fire dog
Melon impetered cellophane
Arms long as their legs
Even the greys can't
Oh

Voilà

Maybe I belong to you
I'm sure you want me to
My shadow's onto you
voilà, voilà
I can't make you like voilà
I'll make you love voilà
Make you make love to voilà
Hole
Make you place your faith with voilà
Hotel
Enough with what your temple knew
Help

I don't talk to the help
Help
Whose voilà suits you too well?
Don't talk to the help
Help
Oh

My proper voilà shadow gander
My shadow stigmata often
Left, right, up, step right up
Get your crisis rock bottom
Crack light priest wind fire dog
Melon impetered cellophane
Arms long as their legs
Even the greys can't voilà
Oh

Voilà

It's your lucky day, my shadow brûlées, voilà
Aren't you lucky fuck my shadow gush, voilà
You're a lucky spin my shadow spam voilà
My shadow slither my shadow whisper voilà
Live in my shadow while you wait to gasp in space
Gasp in my shadow like everything that lives
My shadow incubate everything that is
My shadow casts voilà through every one of its kids

I don't talk to the help
Help
Whose voilà suits you too well?
Don't talk to the help
Help
Oh

My proper voilà shadow gander
My shadow stigmata often
Left, right, up, step right up
Get your crisis rock bottom
Crack light priest wind fire daughter
Melon impetered cellophane
Arms long as their legs
Even the greys can't
Oh

Voilà
