		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something about her hair
The way she moves
The way she looks at you

She'll dance alone 
She'll dance for everyone
And while your heart is beating
She'll turn to someone new

You can see her now
Her pale blue eyes
And when you touch her skin
She'll pretend you're someone else

She'll dance alone 
She'll dance for everyone
And while your heart is beating
She'll turn to someone new

She'll dance for you
She'll dance for everyone
And to the beating of the drum
The fire rages on

When you see her on the edge
When you see her falling down
Will you pick her up again
And carry her back home

To a beating drum
To a beating heart
She'll dance for everyone
And pretend you're someone else
