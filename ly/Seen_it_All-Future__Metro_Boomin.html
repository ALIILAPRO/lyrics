		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
We done seen it all
And done it all
We don't trust these niggas
Word, word to my nigga, P

Blow these bitches back out, rockin' these platinum chains
She give it to a thorough nigga, that's my claim to fame
Chanel body suit, when it rain, diamonds galore
Get chauffeured under the stars, you can forget how you was livin' before
She keep it P with a player, so she never at me
I'ma get munyun, got my lawyer, hoes can't attack me
Lil' niggas run you down with a gun like he in a track meet
Sent through a cleanin' crew, they pressin' with that iron (ah)
Look a nigga in the eyes, see if he gon' cross
Coco Number Five, bitch eatin' up a boss
Keep my bitch close, but I keep the goons closer
Dom PÃ©rignon bottle, wasted bubbly on the floor
Came up from the block, sellin' the rawest coke
You might OD off this shit, nigga, it ain't never enough
Richard Mille cost a house, it ain't never enough
Seven hundred bucks on a truck, the seats brazy (ah)

Me and my brothers, we puttin' freaks in rotation
Sometimes they move on, they still can't replace
I'll lose a stone and get it replaced the same day
From trappin' out my granny house to rappin' on the stage
I want it all, I know these streets gon' have to feed me
These hoes sit down, I'm lettin' 'em hit it off the whole key
Got rich in this shit, got a clip hold a fifty
You tryna keep up with me, gon' be O-V (ah)

I cook that white girl uncut, you might OD
Drop thirty-six in a Pyrex, stay lowkey
Put a nigga on suicide watch, they try and play me
Spent a million dollars on the watch, chasin' a big B
Talkin' hip-hop, I'm talkin' 'bout drugs
Live like a shotta, I bring fire to the club
Lookin' up to mobsters as kids, that was us
Teflon Pluto, I'm not the nigga you can touch (ah)

Me and my brothers, we puttin' freaks in rotation
Sometimes they move on, they still can't replace
I'll lose a stone and get it replaced the same day
From trappin' out my granny house to rappin' on the stage
I want it all, I know these streets gon' have to feed me
These hoes sit down, I'm lettin' 'em hit it off the whole key
Got rich in this shit, got a clip hold a fifty
You tryna keep up with me, gon' be O-V (ah)
Me and my brothers, we puttin' freaks in rotation
Sometimes they move on, they still can't replace
I'll lose a stone and get it replaced the same day
From trappin' out my granny house to rappin' on the stage
I want it all, I know these streets gon' have to feed me
These hoes sit down, I'm lettin' 'em hit it off the whole key
Got rich in this shit, got a clip hold a fifty
You tryna keep up with me, gon' be O-V (ah)

That's just my opinion 
I don't listen to that bullshit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like some people think that's hot
Some people actually think that shit is hot
Like, come on, who you gon' listen to, them or P?
Who the veterans? Who the seasoned veterans at this shit
That can tell you what's hot and what's not?
You know what I'm sayin'? That's, there you have it, son
And I ain't on no hater shit, I ain't a hater
Do your thing, nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?
But personally, your shit is not poppin', son
