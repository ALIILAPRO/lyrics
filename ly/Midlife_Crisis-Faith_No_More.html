		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline 
For my pet genius

My head is like a lettuce
Go on and dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop giving
I'm thirty-something

Sense of security
Like pockets jingling
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity

Down through the family tree
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two

It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis
What an inheritance
The salt and the Kleenex

Morbid self attention
Bending my pinky back 
A little discipline
A donor by habit

A little discipline
Rent an opinion
Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument

Midlife crisis
I'm a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you

Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two 

(Yeah)

It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis

You're perfect, yes, it's true (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) but without me you're only you (go on and wring my neck) 
Your menstruating heart (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) it ain't bleedin' enough for two

You're perfect, yes, it's true (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) but without me you're only you (go on and wring my neck) (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) it ain't bleedin' enough for two

You're perfect, yes, it's true (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) but without me you're only you (go on and wring my neck) (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) it ain't bleedin' enough for two

You're perfect, yes, it's true (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) but without me you're only you (go on and wring my neck)

Your menstruating heart (go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet) it ain't bleedin' enough for two
