		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby girl when was it that you had decided 
You'd call it off and on  
You were just having fun  
With loving one last time 

Still I'd catch you when the days through 
At my side passing by 
Wishin' someday you'd make up your mind 

Alone alone again on valentine 

Honey bee was it your buzzin' I adored 
You've stung me twice before 
I kept coming back 
Kept coming back for more 

Always reminded 
Of the days when 
You were my 
Cherry lime 
Finding our own worlds getting lost 
You and I 
(Long gone an) old friend of mine 
A blue moons on the rise 
No one I'd rather have 
Beside me tonight
