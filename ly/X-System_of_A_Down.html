Tell the people that arrive
Tell the people
Tell the people that arrive
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
Die

Show your people
Show your people how we died
Show your people
Show your people how we died
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
No need to nullify
No need to nullify
No need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
Die

We don't need to
We don't need to
We don't need to
We don't need to

Ask your people
Ask your people what is right
Ask your people
Ask your people what is right
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
No need to multiply
No need to multiply
No need to multiply

We don't need to multiply
