		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're feeling restless
Like life's not on your side
It's weighing heavy on your mind
But when we stand united
Our hearts, they beat in time
I know we'll make it all alright

Let's bring it back to you and me
There's no one else around
Now don't get lost in gravity
'Cause I want you to

Hold me now
Nothing else matters
It's just the two of us
And if it all falls down
Nothing else matters
You know we're strong enough
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
I said I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on love

'Cause I feel it inside
Taking over tonight
I'll be there when the storm is breaking
In this moment I'm yours
You can always be sure
That together we're gonna make it
So baby, won't you

Hold me now
Nothing else matters
It's just the two of us
And if it all falls down
Nothing else matters
You know we're strong enough
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
I said I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on love

Hold me now
Nothing else matters
It's just the two of us
And if it all falls down
Nothing else matters
You know we're strong enough
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
I said I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on love
