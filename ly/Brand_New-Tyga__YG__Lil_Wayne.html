		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want some new nails
New bundles
New boobs
You know, hmm
Everythin' brand new, bitch
You know what the fuck this is
Why spend my money, when I could spend your money?
Hahaha

Way too cocky in the coupe feelin'- (brand new, ha)
Always in the press, why this bitch actin'- (brand new, yeah)
Spent one-fifty on a Prezi and it's-
(Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new)
Nigga, don't touch (yeah)
Smell like money and we smokin' on- (brand new, uh)
Honey in her pack, keep the B's waxed (brand new, tss)
Hermès bag got my bitch actin'-
(Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new)
AP bustin'

A lot of niggas had a chance, they was unlucky (yeah)
When it's so long, we don't even discuss it (nah)
Say you got hoes pullin' up, I don't trust it (shh)
Burn through the money, diamonds dance like Usher (ice)
You ain't gotta like it, but my bitch gon' love it (love it)
All about cake, got a mill' in the oven (I'm cookin')
Birdman hands, all this paper I'm rubbin'
(Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new)
Bitch, cry for me, like brand new onions

Way too cocky in the coupe feelin'- (brand new, ha)
Always in the press, why this bitch actin'- (brand new, yeah)
Spent one-fifty on a Prezi and it's-
(Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new)
Nigga, don't touch (yeah)
Smell like money and we smokin' on- (brand new, uh)
Honey in her pack, keep the B's waxed (brand new, tss)
Hermès bag got my bitch actin'-
(Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new)
AP bustin'

Brand new AP in HD
These diamonds be talkin' in they sleep
You know not to test me, like SAT
They pay me like Riri, A-S-A-P
Hotter than AZ, cool as an AC
Yeah, my diamonds gon' sing, like do-re-mi
Yeah, my diamonds gon' dance, like my bro CB
And I pop two X, that's dos Nicki (brand new, brand new)
Yeah, brand new money, brand new hundreds
Got a bunch of zeros, like a bag of new Funions
Brand new phone with a brand new number
On some brand new shit, need a brand new plumber (brand new, brand new)
I'ma be her brand new black cucumber
Love brand new, fat pockets lookin' like love handles
Brand new hoes
Come and snort this Michael Jackson, get a brand new nose, bitch

This motherfucker don't miss
No, he's fuckin' good
That motherfucker don't miss, man

Way too cocky in the coupe feelin'- (brand new, ha)
Always in the press, why this bitch actin'- (brand new, yeah)
Spent one-fifty on a Prezi and it's-
(Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new)
Nigga, don't touch (yeah)
Smell like money and we smokin' on- (brand new, uh)
Honey in her pack, keep the B's waxed (brand new, tss)
Hermès bag got my bitch actin'-
(Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, ayy)
AP bustin'

Brand new Glock-9, 'cause niggas give me opp vibes
Y'all niggas circle out of shape, y'all like a stop sign
Nigga, not even a stop sign gon' stop mine
Stop playin' before I cock a Glock and leave you cock-eyed
Giftin' all my hoes, I'm into sharin'
Bought the bitch a watch, she don't even wear it
Feelin' like Bugs Bunny, nigga, all these carrots (brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new)
Kick a white bitch out, actin' like a Karen

Way too cocky in the coupe feelin'- (4hunnid, brand new, ha)
