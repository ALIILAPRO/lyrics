		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
Do you ever get the feeling 
That you're missing the mark?
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

Written up in marker on a factory sign
I struggle with the feeling 
That my life isn't mine
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

See the arrow that they shot trying 
To tear us apart took the fire from my belly and 
The beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

You, ooh, ooh
Oh you, use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street, every car, every surface in nature
And at the streets are rising and you'd rather sing
Don't let them take control
No, we won't let 'em take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
I'm coming 'round to get us
I'm coming 'round when they don't know the facts

So on a concrete canvas and a glow in the dark
On a concrete canvas, I will make you a mark
Armed with the spray can soul
Let me out with the spray can soul

You, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 

'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Yeah, it's true, when you
Use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Oh and it hurts like heaven
