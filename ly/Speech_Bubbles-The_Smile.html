		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We run for the hills
We run like fools
Our city is in flames
The bells ringing
The bells ringing

Devastation has come
Left in a station with a note upon
Now there's never any place
Never any place to put my feet back down
No, there's never anywhere
The scene is rolled away, lights are taken down
On a newspaper stand
Any feeble branch to put my weight upon
Well, I lie to myself
Anywhere I dare to put my feet back down

Who fell again?
In the pouring rain
Who'll find the vein
Put the needle in?
And who hears that voice?
It's like bells ringing

How will I know you?
How will I know you?
How will I know you?
