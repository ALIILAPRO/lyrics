		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is his lair
I've seen the old fox around
He keeps himself to himself
He's staying close to the ground
I smell profit here!

Ten years ago
He came and paid for Cosette
I let her go for a song
It's time we settled the debt
This'll cost him dear

What do I care
Who you should rob
Give me my share
Finish the job!

You shut your mouth
Give me your hand

What have we here?

Who is this hussy?

It's your brat Eponine
Don't you know your own kid?

Why's she hanging about you?

'Ponine, get on home
You're not needed in this
We're enough here without you!

I know this house, I tell you
There's nothing here for you!
Just the old man and the girl
They live ordinary lives

Don't interfere
You've got some gall
Take care, young miss,
You've got a lot to say!

She's going soft

Happens to all

Go home, 'Ponine
Go home, you're in the way!

I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna warn them here

One little scream and you'll regret it for a year

What a palaver
What an absolute treat
To watch a cat and it's father
Pick a bone in the street

Not a sound out of you!

Well I told you I'd do it, I told you I'd do it

Make for the sewers, don't wait around
Leave her to me, go underground!
You wait my girl, you'll rue this night
I'll make you scream, you'll scream all right!

It was your cry sent them away
Once more 'Ponine, saving the day
Dearest Cosette, my friend 'Ponine
Brought me to you, showed me the way!

Somebody's here
Let's not be seen
Somebody's here
