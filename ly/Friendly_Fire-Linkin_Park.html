		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me the words I've forgotten
What we were fighting for
Staring right into the darkness
Through an empty open door

Can't put back what's been broken
Can't change the moment
We went too far

We're pulling apart for no reason
We're pulling a trigger in a useless war
And if we come back and go into the black
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?

I was supposed to protect you
No matter what's to come
Somehow forgot when they told me
We hurt the ones we loved

Can't put back what's been broken
Can't change the moment
We went too far

We're pulling apart for no reason
We're pulling a trigger in a useless war
And if we come back and go into the black
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting?
It's just friendly fire
Fire
Fire
Fire

We're strangers in between the darkness
Diving underneath
I'll find you out on the horizon
We'll never be enemies

Can't put back what's been broken
Can't change the moment
We went too far

We're pulling apart for no reason
We're pulling a trigger in a useless war
And if we come back and go into the black
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting?
It's just friendly fire
Fire
Fire
Fire

Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
