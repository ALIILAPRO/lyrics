		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are those happy days they seem to hard to find?
I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love?  I wish I understood
It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
 
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out. I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
 
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
