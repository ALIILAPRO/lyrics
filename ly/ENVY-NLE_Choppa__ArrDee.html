		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm (CashMoneyAP)
Yeah, ayy, ayy
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, brrt
Gotta watch up, I look both ways 'fore I cross the street, ayy (brrt, bop, bop, bop, brrt)
Ayy

Gotta watch these niggas I fuck with
Your friend might be the enemy (be the enemy)
Every day nigga lose they life 'cause a four letter word that's called envy (envy)
He fake, we cut the heads off snakes (off snakes)
Ayy, Ali boombayah, ayy, spray, ayy

Tell your homie come pick his face up
Draco beat his face up just like makeup, yeah (just like makeup)
I ain't never took no pay cuts
What his life cost? I'ma make him pay up, yeah (make him pay up)
God told me, "Shorten your days up" (days up)
In the cut with a fully loaded banger (brrt)
Everywhere I go, twist my fingers (let's go)
Like I can't understand a thin', yeah let's go)
Reach if you want to, you ain't gon' take shit 
Soon as you reach, I'ma frame your pic' (bop, bop, bop)
Hatin'-ass ho, bitch, get off my dick
Said what I said and I said what I meant
Overseas, I'm with Central Cee in a BNB with a hundred somethin' hoes (hundred somethin' hoes)
I took the Wock' to Poland, I'm in the UK with them bowls (like Yachty)
I got the key, the key, the key
This not for the door, it got up her nose (like Future)
I gotta feed the, feed the streets
Remember them days I was down below (like Roddy)
Fast on my feet, but I walked him down (brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Can't get up, now he down for the count 
Bitch, we dodgin' RICOs, so let me watch my mouth (come here, let's go)

Gotta watch these niggas I fuck with (fuck with)
Your friend might be the enemy (be the enemy)
Every day nigga lose they life 'cause a four letter word that's called envy (that's called envy)
He fake, we cut the heads off snakes (off snakes)
Ayy, Ali boombayah, ayy, spray, ayy

They can lead horses to the water
Can't teach moles, that's how they was brought up
Know what he's thinkin' before the thought come (what?)
Try schemin' like a Lambs of the Slaughter
Success just gave me the sore one
Kids from the same place, yeah that's torture (fuck that)
NLE strapped up, can't get your jaw touched (boom)
Spinnin' the T, MV while I bore one
In the DM they hate on the geezer
But see 'em and they want a feature
I brought mace, was tryin' to flee but (what?)
Had their eye on my plate when the meat come
That's a snake if I ever did seen one
Only day ones that I want to see now
And the money so mind corruptin'
Still got my eye out for anythin' suspect

Gotta watch these niggas I fuck with (fuck with)
Your friend might be the enemy (be the enemy)
Every day nigga lose they life 'cause a four letter word that's called envy (that's called envy)
He fake, we cut the heads off snakes (off snakes)
Ayy, Ali boombayah, ayy, spray, ayy

Your friend might be the enemy
'Cause a four letter word that's called envy
We cut the heads off snakes
Ayy, Ali boombayah, ayy, spray, ayy
