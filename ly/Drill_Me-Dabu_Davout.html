		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drill me, kill me, but don't leave alone
Scoff me, torment but my mind's for you to own
I desire you to come, I become Numb

And I feel like I've never felt
And I feel like I'll never feel
And I feel like I've never felt
And I feel like I'll never feel
And I feel like I've never felt
And I feel like I'll never feel

Hit me, beat me i'm not scared to fall
Touch me, hurt me, i'll still be your doll
Get away, drugs save me from this role

And I feel like I've never felt
And I feel like I'll never felt
And I feel like I've never felt
And I feel like I'll never feel
And I feel like I've never felt
And I feel like I'll never feel
