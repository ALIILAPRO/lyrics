		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  mm, mm

We've yelled words we shouldn't
We fought for the best
Those tears we were crying
Both happy and sad
Oh, time, it stops and people fade when you step in a room
I don't love anyone the way I love you

We don't fear the silence, you read like a book
I last a decade on one of those looks
I would give the ocean up to swim in your blues
I don't love anyone the way I love you
The way I love you
The way I

If I know what love is it's because of you
You light my fire, yeah, that's the whole truth
I know it's easy to get lost in all of the issues

I'll tell the whole world
Top of my lungs
Past, present, future
They know you're the one
Doesn't take a diamond ring to say that I do
I don't love anyone
No, I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone the way I love you, mm
Da, da da da, da da da, mm, mm
