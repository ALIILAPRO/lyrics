		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Can you hear the people singin'?)
(Can you feel the love out here tonight?)

It's so hard to see
What's right there in front of me
So would you come and set me free, my love? Yeah
Take me deep
'Cause Heaven's below our feet
There's nothin' else we'd ever need, my love

Can you hear the people singin'?
Can you feel the love out here tonight?
This is what we all been waitin' for
The good life, good life, yeah, ayy
Even if the times are changin'
Remember that it's gonna be alright
This is what we all been waitin' for
The good life, good life, ayy, ayy

Can you hear the people singin'?
Can you feel the love out here tonight?
This is what we all been waitin' for
The good life, good life, yeah, ayy
Even if the times are changin'
Remember that it's gonna be alright
This is what we all been waitin' for
Good life, good life

So let it go
Just dive in the deep unknown (Yeah)
You will never be alone again, oh, oh
The highs and the lows
Connect in the afterglow
I'll meet you somewhere in the cloud, my friend

Can you hear the people singin'? (Yeah)
Can you feel the love out here tonight?
This is what we all been waitin' for
The good life, good life, yeah, ayy

Can you hear the people singin'?
Can you feel the love out here tonight?
This is what we all been waitin' for
The good life, good life, yeah, ayy
Even if the times are changin'
Remember that it's gonna be alright
This is what we all been waitin' for
The good life, good life, ayy, ayy

Good life, good life
Good life, good life, yeah, ayy
