		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a lightning in your eyes I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, running out of time
Without you I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright

There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine

This time I'm ready to run (oh-oh)
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours
Don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (oh-oh)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free
And I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run

There's a future in my life I can't foresee
Unless of course I stay on course
And keep you next to me
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright

This time I'm ready to run (oh-oh)
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours
Don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (oh-oh)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free
And I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run

This time I'm ready to run (ready to run)
I'd give everything that I got for your love

This time I'm ready to run (oh-oh)
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours
Don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (this time I'm ready to run) (oh-oh)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free
And I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run
