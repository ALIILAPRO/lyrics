		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please just take the mixed bouquet and leave, just leave

Dawn
I will never let you let me leave
I promise I'm not lying
Go ahead ask anybody who has seen me trying
I'm not going, if it seems like I did
I'm probably waiting outside

Such a stubborn man you'll likely never meet another
When we have our family dinner you can ask my mother
She's the best, you'll learn more about her on our family history test

I'm gonna do this right
Show you I'm not moving
Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow
Oh, I'm gonna love you so
You'll learn what I already know
I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me

You can try, oh, but I
I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me

Ready for your check?

Not quite, pie for everybody

What?!

I grew up an only child in the suburb of the city
Spent my days alone my only friend was a stray kitty called Sardine
I thought it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish
She played hard to get hissing while she scratched me
What she was trying to say was "Ogie come and catch me"
I learned quickly, that perseverance stood between a cat and her new best friend, me

Oh, I'm gonna do this right
Show you I'm not moving
Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow
Oh, I'm gonna love you so
You'll learn what I already know
I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me

When you say never

You can try, oh, but I

I love you means blah blah blah yip yap yap yap now get back to work!

I can try, but I
I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me
