		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted
And I can drink until dawn, dawn, got a hangover, oh

Ooh oh oh
Drink until dawn, dawn, got a hangover, oh, oh

I got a hangover, oh, I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, oh, I got an empty cup pour me some more
I got a hangover, oh, I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, oh, I got an empty cup pour me some more

So I can go till dawn, dawn, riding up, up (throw up, up)
Drink until dawn, go, gotta a hangover now (throw up, up)

(So I can, I can, I can) go until I go up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on

I got a hangover, oh, I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, oh I got an empty cup pour me some more

Go until I go up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on
