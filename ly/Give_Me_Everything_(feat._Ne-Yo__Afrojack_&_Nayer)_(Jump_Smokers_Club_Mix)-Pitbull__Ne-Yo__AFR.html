		  Me not working hard?
Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak
Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til they handle love (let's do it tonight)

I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)

Take advantage of tonight (yeah)
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai
To perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless (yeah)
It's insane the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin'
Hustlers move in silence
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep blowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan (woo)

I put it on my life, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But, I promise tonight, dale (woo)

Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight (should tonight)
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight (could tonight)
And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight (good)
'Cause we might not get tomorrow (woo)

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til they handle love (let's do it tonight)

I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)

Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab 'em
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it 'cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top yo' girl (ha ha ha)

What I'm involved with 
Is deeper than the Masons
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba
But I'm an American Idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest (yeah)

Put it on my life, baby (baby)
I make you feel right, baby (baby)
Can't promise tomorrow (nah)
But, I promise tonight, dale (woo)

Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight (should tonight)
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight (could tonight)
And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight (good)
'Cause we might not get tomorrow (woo)

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til they handle love (let's do it tonight)

I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)

Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight (should tonight)
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight (could tonight)
And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight (good)
'Cause we might not get tomorrow (woo)
