		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Braveheart, you are my Braveheart,
Take me in your arms,
You are my Braveheart.

Fighting so we can be free,
Fighting for our dignity,
Fighting for the truth and then,
We can go and live again.

Fighting for the way that's right,
Fighting for our truth at night,
Fighting up until the dawn,
He won't stop until he's won.

This is where he's going to start,
This is my one true Braveheart.

Braveheart, you are my Braveheart,
Hold me in your arms,
You are my Braveheart,
Braveheart, you are my Braveheart,
Hold me in your arms,
You are my Braveheart.
