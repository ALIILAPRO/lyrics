		  (Metro)
Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah
Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah

Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah, I'm fried
I just blew a check in the strip club on a Wednesday
She ain't goin' then I'ma ask her what her friend say
Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah, I'm fried
I'm still high from the night before and I popped another one
Do you roll, roll, roll, like the stone?
Do you got more than two or three phones? Do you?

I'm fried, yes, fried
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe

I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty
Hold a nigga down and she tote my Glock 40
Bust her down, ice her out just like my artists
Every time we link, it's like we throwin' a private party
Yeah, yeah, walk inside the strip club, I'm just a walkin' bankroll
I don't want my old hoes 'cause them hoes all old
Lookin' for that young shit, twenty-four
Baby have buns, shit, I'm bendin' it over
Big pimpin', rockin' with her like I'm Dame Dash
She waitressin' at Starlets, ain't too many I ain't had
She Spanish, she can't call me, "Papi," I make her call me, "Dad"
Her panties off, she come through every time when I smash
She ain't try to charge, but anyway, I gave her a lil' cash
I'm poppin' it off, I'm tryna make her ex-nigga mad
Leaned up, just took two pills, damn, a nigga throwed
Underhand, overhand, the money gettin' blowed

Yeah, I'm fried
Yeah, I'm fried
I just blew a check in the strip club on a Wednesday
I don't care if she ain't goin', I ask her what her friend say
I bet she say, "Comprende"
Yeah, yeah, fried
Yeah, I'm fried
I fuck with shorty 'cause shorty is a vibe
Right
To my left and my right
And my front
I got blunts and I love puttin' on stunts, yeah

Take a shot every day, we gon' get high every day
Told my girl, "I'll be cuttin' off, shorty," wouldn't hit her anyway
Save the day, anyway, then had to make sure she sign an NDA
Pretty girls all across the world, they know sensei
This money got my mind goin', this a tax bracket, different time zone
Drink out the Styrofoam, I ain't never been this high though
I just got my roll on, I ain't popped up like this in so long
I just like to vibe on her, went plain Jane, two-tone
Took a couple uppers, downers, mixed 'em up together
Runnin' through this money like it never felt better
I just went to Cleef and bought the store from overseas
Shorty got me blowin' money fast like Meech

I'm fried, yes, fried
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe
I'm fried, yes, fried
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe
I'm fucked up 'bout lil' shorty, she a vibe

You know
We the best in the business
What you think I mean when I say that
What the fuck you think I mean when I say that, man
We the best in this business
There is no competition for us, man
