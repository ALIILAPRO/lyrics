		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What does friend mean to you?
A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused?
All included but you
Alone

The sounds of silence often soothe
Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen, change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue

Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way

Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon

Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way

At 7 AM
On a Tuesday in August
Next week I'll be 28
I'm still young, it'll be me
Off the wall, I scraped you
I gotta wake, it comes this way
I can't wait no more
It comes this way (it comes this way)
To drown this ache
To reinstate (Everyone dead, everyone)
(You put me through) Take your place (Put me through hell)
Heaven direct your shape (Heaven direct)
You see I can do it so well
Your expiration date
Your expiration date
Fate, date
Expiration date
This one is gonna last too, hate
Never gonna fuck with me again
My own clean slate
Don't fuck with me again
Makes your eyes dilate
Makes you shake
Irate
