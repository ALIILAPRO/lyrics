		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You left without no goodbye in the night 
Walked out for miles, I'm not surprised 
You said it was not about you and I 

And I wish somehow, somehow you could stay 
Can you stay for a while? 
Stay for a while just the way we are 
In the great divide 
Inside, I will know when to let you go 
Stay for a while just the way we are 

You left without no goodbye in the night 
Lost in a long forgotten dream 
You masquerade all you feel inside 

Wherever you go somehow you find ways 
To slowly keep on stealing 
Concealing love that is left behind 

And I wish somehow, somehow you could stay 
Can you stay for a while? 
Stay for a while just the way we are 
Will I ever know when to let you go? 
Just the way you are 
Iâ€™ll let you go just the way you are 

You said it was love 
Love was not enough for you and I 
You said it was love 
Love was not enough for you and I 
You said it was love 
Love was not enough for you and I 
You said it was love 
Love was not enough 
Enough
