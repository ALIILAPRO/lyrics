		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My sanity has left me
My trust died with you
What is left are only pieces
My tears fall for you

I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna roll
I'm gonna thunder

So I place the roses
So gently on your grave
And I still remember
I can feel the flames
And I know I have failed
and my promises nothing worth
I see it all so clear
But my words mean nothing

I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna roll
I'm gonna thunder

My sanity has left me
The trust I once had has died
What is left are only pieces
All my words been proven lies
Been proven lies
If I could I would
Fly roll thunder
All for just another chance to speak with you
Show you
But my words...
But my words mean...
Nothing
