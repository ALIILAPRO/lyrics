		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the ladies of court gather round
Joined in heavenly fair
Gathering promises of future heroes
Young faith it is all as you go
Red light and green light and men in their armor
And fight for the queen if you dare
It's a long way to go to test out your mettle
Long way to go to go down
We go round and round
We go down
Go down

Courier says we lost our family
There's 21 left, that's all
We were given no quarter because of thy art
Leaving us nothing at all

Tell me what would we do
What would we say
They'll be killing us all in the wild
Taking our homes, killing wives and children
Leaving us nothing at all

And I'll write them a letter
I said forgive us our wrong
And please grant us this favor, sir
Forgive us quick, or run
Or run, or run,
Or run

All the ladies of court gather round
Joined in heavenly fair
Gathering promises of future heroes
Young faith it is all as you go
Red light and green light and men in their armor
And fight for the queen if you dare
It's a long way to go to test out your mettle
A long way to go to go down
Go down
You better go down, down, down
You better go down
