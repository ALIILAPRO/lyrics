		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little row boat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on movin'
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on movin'

You're on the road and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

Never let another girl like you work me over
Never let another girl like you drag me under
If I meet another girl like you, I will tell her
Never want another girl like you, have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on movin' (whoa)

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
