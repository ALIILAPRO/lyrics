		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Why do you build me up (build me up) buttercup, baby
Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around?
And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby
When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still
I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin'
You know that I have from the start
So build me up (build me up) buttercup, don't break my heart

"I'll be over at ten," you told me time and again
But you're late, I wait around and then (bah-dah-dah)
I went to the door, I can't take any more
It's not you, you let me down again (hey, hey, hey)

Baby, baby, try to find (hey, hey, hey)
A little time and I'll make you happy (hey, hey, hey)
I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 

Why do you build me up (build me up) buttercup, baby
Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around?
And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby
When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still
I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin'
You know that I have from the start
So build me up (build me up) buttercup, don't break my heart

To you, I'm a toy, but I could be the boy you adore
If you'd just let me know (bah-dah-dah)
Although you're untrue, I'm attracted to you all the more
Why do I need you so? (Hey, hey, hey)

Baby, baby, try to find (hey, hey, hey)
A little time and I'll make you happy (hey, hey, hey)
I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 

Why do you build me up (build me up) buttercup, baby
Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around?
And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby
When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still
I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin'
You know that I have from the start
So build me up (build me up) buttercup, don't break my heart

I-I-I need you more than anyone, baby
You know that I have from the start
So build me up (build me up) buttercup
