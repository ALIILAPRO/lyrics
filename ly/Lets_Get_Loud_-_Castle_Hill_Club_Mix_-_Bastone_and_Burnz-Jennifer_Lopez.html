		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up, let's do it
C'mon people let's get loud
Let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do

If you want to live your life
Live it all the way and don't waste it
Every feelin' every beat
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

Life's a party, make it hot
Dance don't ever stop whatever rhythm
Every minute, every day
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em ('cause I'm going to live my life)
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do

Let's get down,Let's get down,Let's get down
Let's get loud, let's get loud,let's get loud

Life is meant to be big fun
You're not hurting anyone
Nobody loses
Let the music make you free
Be what you want to be
Make no excuses
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do
