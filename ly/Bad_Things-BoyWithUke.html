		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, shit, here we go again
It's the same old lies, same instrument
Like la-la-la, I'm broken and I'm dead
(Doesn't ever really happen to me, anyway)
If I'd known I'd be where I'm at today, I think I'd give it all away
I wish I'd never left my home

But when I hear you say my name, tell me, everything's okay
I forget about the world, I forget about the pain
'Cause when I see you wear my shirt, listen to your calming words
I remember that the rain doesn't hurt me when I say, ayy ayy

I love it, I love it, I love the fear
I love the way you make the bad things run away (ayy ayy, ayy ayy)
I love it, I love it, I love the tears, I love the pain
You make the bad things run away

Shut the fuck up, I don't wanna hear your voice, no
Save your breath or you gon' give yourself a sore throat
I need a little bit of space, I wanna lay low
It's okay, I'll make it one day, oh
Guilty, I'm a counterfeit musician
I only say the things I say so you will listen
Some say it's the product of a vision I don't fuck with
It's not my decision

But when I hear you say my name, tell me, everything's okay
I forget about the world, I forget about the pain
'Cause when I see you wear my shirt, listen to your calming words
I remember that the rain doesn't hurt me when I say, ayy-ayy

I love it, I love it, I love the fear
I love the way you make the bad things run away (ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy)
I love it, I love it, I love the tears, I love the pain
You make the bad things run away

I'm better off all by myself
No one to call, no one will help
No one at fault, no one can quell
No, I'm not well
No, I'm not well
Irrational, inadequate
Unnatural, inanimate
I'll never change
I wanna quit
So full of rage
So full of shit

I love it, I love it, I love the fear
I love the way you make the bad things run away
I love it, I love it, I love the tears, I love the pain
You make the bad things run away

But when I hear you say my name
I know everything's okay
I forget about the world, I forget about the pain
When I'm struggling to breathe
And all I think are bad things
I remember that you're mine, I remember everything
