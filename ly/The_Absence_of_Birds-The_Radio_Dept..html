		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a drum beat and a verse
Flooding my street
And the girls they seem ecstatic
This time, it's not on them 
To take the blame for the commotion

In the front seat of the car you left out here
I've spent far too many hours, still can't drive
Just playing through these tapes 'til it gets light outside

These are things I shouldn't do
Just wish I was close to you
Instead a block party with neighbours
These amplified words
And the absence of birds

Roll down the windows
Not a choice, find the endo
I bet these boys will keep on dancing all night
For once they're not the ones being blamed for the commotion

It's like the drum beat, like the noise
Loves the concrete
I hope this voice while it still lingers this song
Escapes the tape to reach your distant ears where it belongs

These are things I shouldn't say
These are things I shouldn't do
These are things I shouldn't say
Just wish I was close to you
Instead this block party with neighbours
These amplified words
And the absence of birds
