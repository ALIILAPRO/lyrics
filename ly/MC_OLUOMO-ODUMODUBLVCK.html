		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Craze)
Odumodu, on your feet, run
E no go run for where? (Native Records baby)
'Luomo (Odumodu, on your feet)
Ayy-ayy, 'Luomo (e no go run for where?), Ayy

Do you want more or do you want less? (More)
Kilos, bands (craze, yes)
How many, how many
How many rocks did I trap in the bando? Me sef I don't know
How many fiends did I put on a kilo? Go ask Gustavo
He go touch your rico, MC Oluomo
Me, I don flip their script oh, MC Oluomo
How many rocks did I trap in the bando? (Prra) Me sef I don't know
How many fiends did I put on a kilo? (Ten) Go ask Gustavo (ten)
We don dodge your rico (prra), MC Oluomo (ODUMODUBLVCK)
Me, I don flip their script oh (yeah), MC Oluomo

Ho-ho-how many times did they try to come back like Kylian, but I kwack them down
Many men wan try mess with Messi on a big stage, oh, I call them clowns
Jagaban antics, run trap like Lagos, so the bando babies call on us
Bank on Dons, bank alert for my friends on tour (eh)
Akube Balenciaga, hide my skunk for my baby Magana (Lord)
Container boku, Apapa na where Illy bury the rabba
Down to Gbagada, they know say na me be agbalagba (prra)
Buro'ubanka, Eruku Makanaki (ayy, ayy)
Odogwu tender your ladder

How many, how many, how many
How many rocks did I trap in the bando? (Ten) Me sef I don't know
How many fiends did I put on a kilo? (All) Go ask Gustavo (yeah)
He go touch your rico (God), MC Oluomo (God)
Me, I don flip their script oh, MC Oluomo
How many rocks did I trap in the bando? (Trade by barter) Me sef I don't know
How many fiends did I put on a kilo? (Prra, never) Go ask Gustavo (ten)
We don dodge your rico (yes), MC Oluomo (ayy)
Me, I don flip their script oh, MC Oluomo

Ayy, MC Oluomo
Their script oh
