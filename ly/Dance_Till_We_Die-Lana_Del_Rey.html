		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm coverin' Joni and dancin' with Joan
Stevie's callin' on the telephone
Cory almost burned down my home
But, God, it feels good not to be alone

But sometimes this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it movin', babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

I'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

Troubled by my circumstance
Burdened by the weight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancin', babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night
(We keep dancin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step high and bright
(We keep movin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die

We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

I went down to Woodside
I left Berkley, out of city, out of mind
Killin' it, talkin' shit
Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearin' it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step

I left San Francisco, I've been coverin' Joni
And I'm dancin' with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rollin' like a rollin' stone

So we made it back in the middle of the night
(We keep movin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step high and bright
(We keep dancin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die

We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
