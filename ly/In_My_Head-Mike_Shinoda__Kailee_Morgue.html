		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (In my head)

Let it begin (begin)
Push it away but it's pulling me in (me in)
Try to pretend (pretend)
I'm not aware when I do it again (again)
I know the signs (signs)
I see the pattern in front of my eyes (eyes)
Something inside me opens up wide (wide)
Stretching and coming alive (alive)

I can't stop it when it starts
Trying not to fall apart
Building up until it all goes dark

(In my head) I can feel it getting closer
(In my head) breathing heavy on my shoulder
(And I'm trying to fake it but there's no way to escape it)
(In my head) buried underneath the noises
(In my head) there's a million little voices
(Saying "You'll never make it and there's no way to escape it")
(In my head)

Coming around (around)
Thoughts are intruding, I'm pushing them down (down)
Stopping it now (now)
Blocking out, in fact I'm blocking it out (out)
Holding too tight (tight)
Kidding myself, turn a wrong into right (right)
Thief in the night (night)
I've been the one putting gas in the lights (lights)

I can't stop it when it starts
Trying not to fall apart
Building up until it all goes dark

(In my head) I can feel it getting closer
(In my head) breathing heavy on my shoulder
(And I'm trying to fake it but there's no way to escape it)

'Cause I'm swirling in the panic of a shaking confidence
No, I don't have an answer when the questions don't make sense

(In my head) I can feel it getting closer
(In my head) breathing heavy on my shoulder
(And I'm trying to fake it but there's no way to escape it)
(In my head) buried underneath the noises
(In my head) there's a million little voices
(Saying "You'll never make it and there's no way to escape it")
(In my head)
