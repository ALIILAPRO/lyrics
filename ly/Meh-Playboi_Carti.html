		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What? 
What?
What?

Fuck her up, fuck her up (yeah)
Fuck her up (yeah), fuck her up (yeah, yeah)
Fuck her up, fuck her up
Fuck her up, fuck her up
All these niggas talkin' 'bout me (me)
All these niggas dressin' like me (me)
Niggas tryna disrespect me (me)
Bitch, that's gon' come with a fee (fee)
I grab a bitch I fuck on for free (bih)
I grab the bitch, I fuck on, she a freak (what?)
I got this Rick Owens, yeah, for free (bitch, yeah)
I got this bottega, yeah, for free (yeah)
I'm rockin' on Givenchy, yeah, for free (Givenchy)
This shit not on sale, I'm not cheap (what?)
Got a brand new Aventador (what?)
And it's not leased (bih)
Rockstar shit but I'm not Machine Gun
And I feel like I'm the only Rockstar, the only one 
The only one, the only one
The chosen one, the chosen one
My bitch got her nails done, uh
My bitch got her hair laced (slatt)
But I only take her to tour dates (bih)
I'm a Rockstar, bitch, I can't date 
I can't tell if I love her
Johnny cage, beat it up under covers (slatt)
Gotta have a rubber
Or I'm in trouble (slatt)
Heard you had a bag, but you fumbled (yeah)
All my opps dead
But I'ma continue to be humble
Oh yeah (slatt)

What? (slatt, slatt, slatt)
What? (slatt, slatt, slatt)
What? (slatt, slatt, slatt)
What? (slatt, slatt, slatt)
