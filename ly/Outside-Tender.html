		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold on a minute
I don't want to go outside
I don't want to face my pride
There's a limit
To how long I can wait
To how long I can take before I start to show
How close I am to letting go
Of myself?

I've been waiting so, so long
But here we are now
Here we are now
I will judge myself
Guilty of loving you too much
I will smother you just to feel your touch
I will offer you my whole self, not just my best

You can take me as I come or discard me like the rest
And take me by the hand
And show me to the world
I am nothing but a man
You are nothing but a girl

Oh, how long can I take before I start to show?
How close I am to letting go
Of myself?

Hold on a minute
I don't want to go outside
I don't want to face my pride
There's a limit
To how long I can wait
To how long I can take before I start to show
How close I am to letting go
Of myself
