		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is for my mother, from the older brother of your children made of three
Now you found your lover 'cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy
It's been a long five years, I've cried a thousand tears 
And here we are after the war
But we're so much better now the skies are clearer
Now there's no more slamming doors

Now I say
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

This is for my father, from the older brother of your children made of three
Yeah you've been so good to us and showed us how to live and taught us to be free
But when mother told you that she didn't love you all these bridges hit the sea
So you built another one and helped us cross it even though you were in need

Now I say
Dear Father, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, father, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
Cleared up my scars

Dear mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say
You cleared up my scars
