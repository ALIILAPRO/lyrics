		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ay, yeah

I'ma put on for the whole squad
Couldn't sell my soul for the wad
Still out getting guap though
Got to wonder
Why nobody singing gospel-

O.G, your boy
Been kicking it lowkey
Why they all look so pleased?
Do you even know me?
Smell no money
From the nosebleed
Like coke fiends, oh me
Oh my lord willing
To take it all away
As much as give it
So what's a million
I been chilling
Just abide my time
While billies stack up
Side by side
Hope y'all can hear me like-
(Sheesh)

O.G, O.G, balling like he playing OT
O.G, O.G, don't sleep on me
O.G, OG
On God, I'ma put on for the whole squad
Couldn't sell my soul for the wad
Still out getting guap though
Gotta wonder why nobody singing gospel

Bro we lit, get a little bit smokey
Roll in a whip with a swisher blowin'
Dipping police, my own OG
Can't nobody tell me shit (no)
Hatching plans
To crack and I'll blow boy
Equip the fam and gang, with old joy
Make them happy they ain't gotta work
No more what I'm working for-
Ain't tryna let them slave
Where the money slow
Bust their fucking ass off
For the bosses in their office
Copping bucketloads
I know there's a way, but don't say it
Cause not many feel the same
And I can't let them knock my vibe
I'ma chase it, fuck you saying (uh)
I wake up still dreaming
Stay up through the PM
Writing all these throwaways
I barely get a wink of sleep in
Overwork my body, till it's weak
And doing drugs
And shit on weekends, cup of drink
I'm leaning crazy
My shit wavy, let it sink in
O.G, O.G, slaving
I got chains on me, O.G, OG
Stay awake no sleep
Cause no one paved
The way for me

On God
I'ma put on for the whole squad
Couldn't sell my soul for the wad
Still out getting guap though
Gotta wonder
Why nobody singing gospel

OG
Your boy been kicking it lowkey
Why they all look so pleased?
Do you even know me?
Smell no money
From the nosebleed
Like coke fiends, oh me
Oh my lord willing
