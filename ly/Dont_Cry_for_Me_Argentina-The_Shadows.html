		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Could'nt stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying ev'rything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

[Chorus]

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep my distance
