		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I'm looking lonely, waiting for somebody
Waiting for somebody carefree
Hey, wanna get high with me? Uh
I see you looking at me, so I turn my charm on
Hoping you think I look awesome
Wanna feel your hands on me, yeah

Gotta play it off my way, ooh
Gotta play it off 'cause I want you
Wanna run away, run away for the night, night, night

E-Equally lost
We got drunken hearts and we're dancing more than enough
E (e) equally lost (la-la-la, la-la-la)
But we own the night and the hearts are wild in love (in love)
Used to be so down, down, yeah
Now my heart goes dum-dum for ya
Used to be so down, down, yeah
Now my heart goes dum-dum for ya

Come undone with me with that rum, hun
I got you with the drinks in abundance
I ain't tryna get to know none of your loved ones
'Cause I'm a whole other bitch when I'm fucked up
Ayy, and tell me what ya want, what ya into
Ayy, and I can tell ya raw, what ya been through
Ayy, and mi nah want it soft, nah a gentle
Ayy, just wanna get lost in ya rental

E (ooh), equally lost (yeah, yeah)
We got drunken hearts and we're dancing more than enough
E (E) equally lost (yeah, la-la-la, la-la-la)
But we own the night and the hearts are wild in love (in love)
'Cause I be so down, down, yeah
When my heart goes down, down, yeah
'Cause I be so down, down, yeah
When my heart goes down, down, yeah

Oh yeah
Ayy, okay
Ayy, okay
Ayy, okay
Ayy, okay
