		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's been some long nights in my life
I think it's 'bout time I caught you slippin'
I know I got you itchin' (yeah)
Don't hear you talkin' now?
Since road times in my life (road times, road times)
Empathy's not what I've been given
You better get to dippin', uh
Before you get called out

You didn't expect how we'd end
You thought I'd wait out to the weekend, huh? (To the weekend, to the weekend, to the weekend)
And save you from cryin' (cryin')
But you were never my bredrin (bredrin)
I should of got rid of you two years prior
Yes, I found out, you wild (you wild)

To know I never loved you, really fucked with my head (it fucked with my head, oh, baby, yeah)
But that don't justify those things that you do (don't justify those things that you do, no)
But listen I was willin' and gave all that I had, oh
But now I bet you big mad (mad, oh-oh-oh)

There's been some long nights in my life
I think it's 'bout time I caught you slippin'
I know I got you itchin' (I got you itchin')
I don't hear you talkin' now? (Don't hear you now)
Since road times in my life (road times, road times)
Empathy's not what I've been given
You better get to dip dip, dippin', uh
Or you're gonna get called out

Oh, you think you'll keep on movin' with no problems? (Oh, ooh-woah, oh, ooh-woah, oh, ooh-woah)
Stop bringin' up my friends, it don't involve them
Go fix your busted smile (fix your busted smile)
Oh, man, you got some issues, I mean goddamn (goddamn)
Been hirin' all these babies just to solve them
But you've been grown for a while
(We all know that)

To know I never loved you, really fucked with my head
But that don't justify those things that you did to me 
(Don't justify those things that you do to me, baby)
But listen, I was willin' and gave all that I had, oh (I gave all that I had, oh, baby)
But now I know you big mad (oh, you big mad, huh?)

It's long nights in my life
I think it's 'bout time I caught you slippin' ('bout time I caught you slippin')
I know I got you itchin' (I got you itchin')
I don't hear you talkin' now?
Since road times in my life (road times, road times)
Empathy's not what I've been given (empathy's not what I've been given)
You better get to dip dip, dippin' (empathy's not what I've been given)
Or you're gonna get called out

Oh what, you think (bye, bye, bye)
I'd still fight for you and stress my life?
What brings that conclusion?
Oh, you've lost your mind
I'm ready as always
My goons in the the hallway
Oh, I'm sure you will be fine
You better save that shit for someone who's got the time

To know I never loved you (to know I never) 
Really fucked with my head (it fucked with my head, baby)
But that don't justify those things that you do to me (justify those things that you do)
And listen I was willin' and I, I gave all I had (all I had)
So no I don't feel bad, no, oh (yeah, yeah)

There's been some long nights in my life (hey, hey)
I think it's 'bout time I caught you slippin' (poh, ooh)
I know I got you itchin' (da-da, da-da, da-da)
I don't hear you talkin' now?
Since road times in my life (since road times in my life)
Empathy's not what I've been given
You better get to dip dip, dippin'
Or you're gonna get called out

You're gonna get called out
You're gonna get called out, called out, called out, called out
You're gonna get called out, oh, ooh-woah

You out of pocket, bro
I don't know who you need to get phone to get to a mentor
But you've been fuckin' up since the jump, bro
