		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another Friday where the freaks hide
Another venue where we can unwind
We're all waiting for the lights
We're all waiting for the fight, yeah

We're only waiting for the mosh pit
We're only waiting for the

Kicking and screaming, breaking down
Feels like I'm dreaming when
I'm in the crowd
Thrashing with the drums crashing
We are all black sheep who just want to be
Yeah

We're only waiting for the mosh pit
We're only waiting for the

My clothing drenched in cigarette smoke
Tattoos covering arms like walls
Black jeans and a band tee cover me
Now it's just a memory leaving me

We're only waiting for the mosh pit
We're only waiting for the
