		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Funny when I think about the months that I could not get out of bed
Going back and forth over the letters that I wrote but never sent
Wake up and repeat it, but I was barely sleepin'
Swimmin' in the memories, I'm floatin' in the deep end
How come you're not still in my head?

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up in the things we had planned
I'm not chasin' feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater, but I'm over you

Thought that I'd be good the day I took down all your pictures in my room
How'd it go from easier to everything still leadin' back to you?
Can I be honest? I think about you constantly
You're closin' every door, but now I'm lookin' for an opening
Maybe I'm just getting confused

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up in the things we had planned
I'm still chasin' feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater, am I over you?
