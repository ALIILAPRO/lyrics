		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be all alone when I'll be coming home
I'll be all alone sitting by the phone
Waiting for your call waiting for your call

I don't wanna talk right now
Just leave me all alone
Wanna stay away from people
But i still stare at my phone
Wish that i could make
All these scary thoughts just go away
Figured maybe if i didn't have those now
You would've stayed i don't know how
Nor i know why but being next to you
Makes me feel so alive
Come back and fix this
You're all that i lack my mind is now blue
But it's becoming black

I'll be all alone when I'll be coming home
I'll be all alone sitting by thе phone
Waiting for your call waiting for your call

And what's left of us now
I'm herе sitting in my room alone again
Talking to the loneliness my only friend
I can't even go outside
Cause everything reminds me of us and
I don't know why
But every time that i pass our place
The truth's the only thing
That i cannot face pretend it doesn't hurt
And i can replace you

I'll be all alone when I'll be coming home
I'll be all alone sitting by thе phone
Waiting for your call waiting for your call

I'll be all alone when I'll be coming home
I'll be all alone sitting by the phone
Waiting for your call waiting for your call
