		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
Lost your C notes
Cabbed all day, took the bus back home
Evictions on your door
Blame it on the weed
Blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you
Yeah, just don't blame it on me
That you wanna come and party, with a nigga like me
'Cause I get it
You're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you've been stressin'
'Specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke you need more bread
Now you got no rent
You blow that money, money
You try to window shop
You blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day
Hipster nights downtown
And your daddy don't know you're out

If they don't let you in
You know where to find me
'Cause if you wanna go again
You can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up your mind, you can find the love
Girl, you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest

(XO) Oh, don't you forget
(XO) Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(XO) We'll be everything you need, just believe
(XO) ay, (XO) ay whoa

I love it when your eyes are red, ah yeah
Are you on my cloud yet?
'Cause I got a brand new cam
Can we video feed, can we POV, oh why
I wanna catch you at your best, oh
When your hair's a mess
You look so depressed
And you're filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home, oh
'Cause these nights pass, so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up, you need money for your facelift
Lust over love is your mindset
Wakin' up with most of your side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
'Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

If they won't let you in
You know where to find me, oh
And if you wanna go again
You can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up your mind you can find the love
Girl, you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest

(XO) Ooh, don't you forget
(XO) Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(XO) We'll be everything you need, just believe, yeah
(XO) ay, (XO) whoa, whoa

I need (I need)
I need something from you (something from you)
Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love, oh
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me, but I remember who you are
Girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far, uh

Well, I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I
Need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
We can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ride it out
Oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ooh
Just ride it
