		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
Well, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Well, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know enough already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
Well, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Well, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Well, nothing's better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
Well, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Well, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
