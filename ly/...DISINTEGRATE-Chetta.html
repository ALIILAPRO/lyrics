(HOOK)
WHATS WORTH
I BE ALONE YEAH
WHATS WORSE
THAN ONE AND ONLY
I KEEP SMOKING OUT THE POUND
WHEN IM LONELY
IM JUST TRYNA HOLD YOU DOWN
WHEN YOU LONELY

(VERSE 1)
ALL I NEED IS MINE
JUST GO LEAVE ME LONELY
LIKE AN ANCHOR
HOLD ME DOWN
SINK ME SLOWLY
DONT KNOW WHY
YOU MESS AROUND
WHEN YOU KNOW ME
OFF THE MUD
LIKE THE GROUND

THAT YOU AINT
GONE COME AROUND
BUT IM KNOWING
I JUST ROLLED IT OUT
THE POUND

IM BREAKING MY HEART
FOR THE MILLIS
THEY WATCHING THAT MOVE

I WISH YOU WOULD KILL ME
WRAP ME UP BABY
AND SMOKE SMOKE
THINK IMA NEED YOU TO GO GO

HIT THE ROAD ROAD
WRAP YA LITTLE FINGER
IN ROSE GOLD
IMA JUST NEED YOU TO FIND ME
OFF IN THE WHIP
SMOKING BOMBAY
TOO MUCH OF XANAX INSIDE ME
THINK IMA NEED YOU TO REMIND ME
ALWAYS HITTING ON A LATE NIGHT
I AINT LYING WHEN I SAY
I NEED MY HEAD RIGHT
ALL THESE GUNS IN THE FOREIGN
I COULD GET LIFE
ALL THIS PAIN
AND ITS POURING
I CAN FEEL THE SPITE
YEAH
(HOOK)
SEE ME

THEY WANT ME
THEY NEED ME
SPEND ME LIKE TEN ON AMIRIS
THESE PUSSIES DONT LOVE ME
THEY FEAR ME
IM BREAKING MY HEART
FOR THE MILLIS
THEY WATCHING THAT MOVE
WANNA BE ME
BE TALKING THAT SHIT
WANNA KILL ME
YEAH
I WISH YOU WOULD KILL ME....
AND IM PRAYING THAT
YOU DIE SLOW
I GET HIGHER
