		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I loved my aunt, but she died
And my uncle Lou, then he died

I'm searching for something which can't be found, but I'm hoping
I still dream of dad, though he died

Everything dies, everything dies

My ma's so sick, she might die
Though my girl's quite fit, she will die

Still looking for someone who was around, barely coping
Now I hate myself, wish I'd die

Everything dies, everything dies
Everything dies, everything

No why, oh God I miss you
No why, oh God I miss you, I really miss you
No no no no

No why, oh God I miss you
No why, oh God I miss you, I really miss you

Everything dies, everything dies
Everything dies, everything, no no no no

Everything dies, everything dies
Everything dies, everything
