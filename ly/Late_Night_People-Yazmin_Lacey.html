		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the back seat of the taxi
On the road of no return
I set out early and in my throat it starts to tell
Flittering tales of my yearnings and my learnings
We here all seek the same things, but we cover it well

Dabbling escapists
Just to feel weightless
Don’t need no encouragement
Late night people

Decompress I came here to feel the bass from head to toe
Met a person, turned a friend who also wanted to let go
Flittering tales of their yearnings and their learnings
They here all seek the same things, but we cover it well

Dabbling escapists
Just to feel weightless
Don’t need no encouragement
Late night people

Blurry as we dream
These nights will set us free
Liberated beings
Late night people

Late night people
Late night

Flittering tales if our learnings and our learnings
All seeking the same things - surface we cover it well
Dabbling escapists
Just to feel weightless
Don’t need no encouragement
Late night people
Blurry as we dream
These nights will set us free
Liberated beings
Late night people

Late night people
Late night

Late night comes guess we pitched up for the ride
Pleasure seekers abstainers alike
Boots on guess were out to the light
Like minds explore in delight
Late night
Late night
