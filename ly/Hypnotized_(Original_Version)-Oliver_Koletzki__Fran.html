		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I catch your eyes, try not to smile
I track your style I feel your vibes
We have a drink, then go outside
Talk for a while and then we kiss
And then we kiss and then we kiss
We play the game, we start to move
I feel my heart, you feel the beat
I take your hand, you turn round slow
We start to feel it's time to go

Right, morning will hit the sky
And it's no surprise I'll wake up with you
Right, I shouldn't compromise
I don't have to think twice what to do

You got me hypnotized, you got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized, so you know what to do
You got me hypnotized, you got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized, so you know what to do

So we slide into the night and to the wild open flow
Oh stary eyes, you see me glow, so will I hide or will I show
You watch me dance, I feel you move, you pull me near, nothing to fear
We drift outside, dream aside until we slide into the light

Right, morning will hit the sky
And it's no surprise, I'll wake up with you
Right, I shouldn't compromise
I don't have to think twice what to do

You got me hypnotized, you got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized, so you know what to do
You got me hypnotized, you got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized, so you know what to do
