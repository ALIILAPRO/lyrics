		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it's lovely, I believe in anything
What does love mean when the end is rolling in?
Oh, let it go, let it stay, give me love when I'm not there
Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?
Who knows? (Who knows?)
I said who knows?

Ooh
Teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long
No one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know
Let you know

This is your world
(This is your world)
This is your world
(This is your world)

Quietly still, in a lie
Oh, goodnight
I don't mind

Ooh
Teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long
No one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know (let you know)
