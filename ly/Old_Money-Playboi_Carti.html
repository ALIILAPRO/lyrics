		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Old money, new hoe (beep)
Old money, new hoe (what?)
Old money, new hoe (what? What?)
Old money, new hoe
Old swag, new flow
Old swag, new flow (flow, flow)
new flow (flow), old flow (old flow)
Old money, new hoe (beep)
Old money, new flow (flow what)

Bad bitch, love the pole (what)
Sip the four, Actavis (woah)
Sip it slow, kickin' shit (lean, woah)
Oh Pi'erre, come in here
Got some hoes, they upstairs
I need two hoes, need two pairs (what? What?)
My chain too cold, chandelier
Pretty boy, huh, manicure
You need a code just to come in here (oh)
Only 21, feel like a bachelor (Playboi)
Pretty bitch, baddest thing in here (uh)

Old money, new hoe (what?)
Old money, new hoe (what?)
Old money, new hoe (what? What?)
Old money, new hoe

Ooh ooh, damn I feel myself
Left my bitch at home (Playboi), told her fuck herself
Did it on my own (huh), made it by myself (Playboi)
And I keep a tec, boy I keep the stare
Leave a nigga wet, boy I got the well
Grab it off the shelf (huh, Playboi, Playboi)
She said she need a pair, spend it on myself (cash)
Got like three phones (phones), Apple not a pear
Got like three hoes (brrr), I do not compare
In the trap we selling crack, come here (huh)
Momma shed a tear (ooh)
In the trap we cookin' up a meal (ooh)
Cookies in the shelf
My diamonds target self, diamonds Michael Phelps

Old money, new hoe (what?)
Old money, new hoe (what?)
Old money, new hoe (what?)
Old money, new hoe
