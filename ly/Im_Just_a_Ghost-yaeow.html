		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a ghost
Floating around
I don't have a place to go
I feel so left alone
In this town
I used to have friends
But now I don't
And it's hard to find some new
I don't know what to do
Without you
Oh I miss our days
When everything felt ok
When the rain wasn't as heavy as it feels right now
Oh I miss our days
When you were here with me
We could watch the stars and forget about the world
Yeah I'm just a ghost
Empty with holes
Looking for a special place
Maybe somewhere far away
From here?
And if you feel it too?
Then you are not alone
Yeah we are one big family
Broken but honestly
Way too kind
(Way too kind)
Oh I miss our days
When everything felt ok
When the rain wasn't as heavy as it feels now
Oh I miss our days
When you were here with me
We could watch the stars and forget about the world
