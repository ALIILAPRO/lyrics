		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I don't say this now, I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I want to take
Forgive the urgency, but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you

There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you won't you, be the one I always know?
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you
And I'll look after you

If ever there was a doubt
My love she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you
After you

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
Oh, oh

It's always have and never hold
You've begun to feel like home yeah
What's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
Oh, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
Oh, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
Oh, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Be my baby
Oh, oh
