		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who is she?
She got this way about her
She's pretty, but watch what you say around her
I heard that she killed a man, didn't feel a thing
She got bloody hands with some diamond rings
Who is she?
She's got this way about her

I wonder where she goes at night
Wonder if I really wanna roll that dice, yeah, yeah
Lose my sleep, wonder why she always got a new id, yeah, yeah
here she comes
Wonder why she never tell me where she's from?
Wonder why she always wanna make me run?
I, I, wonder why wonder why

I got a death wish (ooh)
She leave me breathless (ooh)
She wears a cross 'round town and it's upside down, I'm helpless (ooh)
I got a death wish (ooh)
I love her reckless (ooh)
She got two horns on her head and a tail by her legs, she's precious (ooh)

She's evil, that's all I know about her
She's lethal, I don't feel safe around her
I heard that she killed a man out in Hollywood
Now we're holding hands, pray to God she's good
But she's evil, that's all I know about her

I wonder how she got this way?
Wonder why she never has a lot to say?
Hmm, hmm, mom's to blame
It's always back home where the monsters lay
Hmm, hmm, been through hell
No wonder I wanna try and get you help
Tryna save you, I'ma kill myself
I, I, wonder why, wonder why

I got a death wish (ooh)
She leave me breathless (ooh)
She wears a cross 'round town and it's upside down, I'm helpless (ooh)
I got a death wish (ooh)
I love her reckless (ooh)
She got two horns on her head and a tail by her legs, she's precious (ooh)
