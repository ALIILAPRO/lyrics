		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, girl, with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Hey, girl, I'm tryin' to figure you out
I wanna know you, I wanna know you

Held her as close as the dress
Pressed against my chest
I was seeing stars
Held her right in my left
Tryin to catch my breath
Where the feelings are

Ooh, la-da-da-da-da
Ooh, heaven's above

Hey, girl, with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Hey, girl, I'm tryin' to figure you out
I wanna know you, I wanna know you
Oh, good God I'm tongue tied
I'm a landslide when you move
Hey, girl, with your head in the clouds
I wanna love you, I wanna love you

Wrapped up in her again
I was starting to spin
A record I can't pause
An all time heroin
With an angel's skin
And a human's flaws

Ooh, la-da-da-da-da
Ooh, heaven's above 

Hey, girl, with your head in the clouds?
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Hey, girl, I'm tryin' to figure you out
I wanna know you, I wanna know you
Oh, good God I'm tongue tied
I'm a landslide when you move
Hey, girl, with your head in the clouds
I wanna love you, I wanna love you

Ooh, ooh 
Ooh, heaven's above

Hey, girl, with your head in the clouds
I wanna love you, I wanna love you
