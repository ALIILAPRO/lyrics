		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like dominoes, I can make your walls fall down
This woman knows how to make the world go round
And just like gravity, we breakin' ground
I'll be your home, I can be your kingdom

When the rhythm make it vibrate
Tell me how much can you take
When the rhythm make it vibrate
Tell me how much can you take, take, take
Tell me how much can you take, take, take of

My love, my love
My love, my love
Not a heart on Earth can beat
My love, my love
My love (my love), my love (my love)
My love (my love), my love (my love)
Not a heart on Earth can beat
My love, my love

It runs so deep, nothing's gonna stop my love
It's like a flood, rainin', comin' from above
And just like gravity, we breakin' ground
I'll be your home, I can be your kingdom

When the rhythm make it vibrate
Tell me how much can you take
When the rhythm make it vibrate
Tell me how much can you take, take, take
Tell me how much can you take, take, take of

My love, my love
My love, my love
Not a heart on Earth can beat (can beat)
My love, my love (my love)
My love (my love), my love (my love)
My love (my love), my love (my love)
Not a heart on Earth can beat
My love, my love

Tell me how you want it, supersonic? How ironic
Like a (?) got your pon mi body sa sa sa (woo, woo)
And it's only on ja, ja , ja (woo)
You know I'm bougie like that, that, that
A fit to make you detach your cable
Melody fire, sweet pasi sewu
Kilo desire, willin' and able
So if ya ready for me, let's go

When the rhythm make it vibrate
Tell me how much can you take
When the rhythm make it vibrate
Tell me how much can you take, take, take
Tell me how much can you take, take, take of

My love, my love
My love, my love
Not a heart on Earth can beat (my love)
My love, my love
My love (my love), my love (my love)
My love (my love), my love (my love)
Not a heart on Earth can beat
My love, my love

Ta-ki-ti-ti-ti, ti-ki-ti-ti
Ta-ki-ti-ti-ti, ti-ki-ti-ti
My love
Ta-ki-ti-ti-ti, ti-ki-ti-ti
Ta-ki-ti-ti-ti, ti-ki-ti-ti
My love
