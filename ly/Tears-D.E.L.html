		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m half way to heaven
It’s like a dream
The number was 7
When I fell asleep
Many confessions
But I couldn’t speak
Life is a blessing
But it’s time to leave

I see you dance from the sky
Let go of wondering why
I’m there with you in your mind
So wipe the tears from your eyes

I hear conversations circling me
I feel at home
And I feel at peace
My eyes are the clouds
And my hands are the sea
My body is here
But my mind is the breeze

I see you dance from the sky
Let go of wondering why
I’m there with you in your mind
So wipe the tears from your eyes

Wipe your tears now
Wipe your tears now

So wipe the tears from your eyes

I hear conversations circling me
I feel at home
And I feel at peace
My eyes are the clouds
And my hands are the sea
My body is here
But my mind is the breeze
