		  Alright, you motherfuckers
Let's get this party started

Uh
Come on

If I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand fucking times
The voices in my head keep telling me I'm doing fine
I say it with a straight face that it's just another line
But it's more than that
'Cause there's no way back

Here I go, I'm trippin', where have I been?
I got a feelin' like I'm slippin', I'm on my knees
Just wanna run, will I ever, ever be free
It's now or never
It's time to sink or swim

'Cause I'm going off the deep end
Yeah, I'm drowning inside
And it doesn't feel important if I'm dead or alive
Feeling fifty shades of fucked up
Going out of my mind
I don't wanna face my demons
So let's get the party started

Yeah

God damn, this'll make me sick
Fuck my life, 'cause I'm done with it
Can't fix me 'cause you don't know shit
Better be scarred than to not have lived

Now I'm trippin', where have I been?
I got a feelin' like I'm slippin', I'm on my knees
Just wanna run, will I ever, ever be free
It's now or never
It's time to sink or swim

'Cause I'm going off the deep end
Yeah, I'm drowning inside
And it doesn't feel important if I'm dead or alive
Feeling fifty shades of fucked up
Going out of my mind
I don't wanna face my demons
So let's get the party started

I'm so happy, I could die right now
I'm so happy, I could die right now, yeah
I'm so happy, I could die right now
Will someone fucking kill me?

I'm so happy, I could die right now
I'm so happy, I could die right now, yeah
I'm so happy, I could die right now
Will someone fucking kill me?

Get the party started

Get the party started

Going off the deep end
And I'm drowning inside
And it doesn't seem important if I'm dead or alive
Feeling fifty shades of fucked up
Going out of my mind
I don't wanna face my demons
So let's get the party started

Yeah
Motherfucker
Come on
