		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The light is gone for now,
Inside we write alone.
Could we craft a sundance through the night,
Coals aglow,
In our eyes, free of souls,
In our hearts?
Red blood beat forever,
Tired as we are.
When I wake, steal the dawn,
Lead my mind, hear me call,
I see no other, said I belong to you.

Divided coast surrounds me now,
In lines below.
cnd my thoughts are hijacked out of sight,
Left to roam,
In a sky full of stars,
Let alone, could they shine forever?
Tired as they are.
When I wake, steal the dawn,
Lead my mind, hear me call,
I see no other, said I belong to you.
