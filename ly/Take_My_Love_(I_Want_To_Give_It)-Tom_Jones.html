		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my love, I want to give it all to you
You can, you can, you can take
My lips, take my arms, Too
My love is your love, Darling
No one else will do

Take my hand
I need you when the day is through
Why don't you take my dreams and
Make them all come true
No, nothing else matters if I can't have you

Yes, I really love you
And, baby, you love me too
So, darling, believe in me
For you know my love is true
Take my heart and take my very soul
Why don't you take my arms
For which I've no control
My life, my lovin', my soul
Never let it run cold

Yes, I really love you
I believe that you love me too
So, darlin', believe in me
For you know my love is true

Take my heart and take my very soul
You can take my arms
For which I have no control
My life is your life never let it run cold

My life, my love is your love
Never let it run cold

My life is your love never let it run cold
