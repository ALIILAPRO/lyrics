		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come take my hand
You should know me
I've always been in your mind
You know I will be kind
I'll be guiding you

Building your dream
Has to start now
There's no other road to take
You won't make a mistake
I'll be guiding you

You have to believe we are magic
Nothing can stand in our way
You have to believe we are magic
Don't let your aim ever stray
And if all your hopes survive
Destiny will arrive

I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you
I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you

From where I stand
You are home free
The planets align so rare
There's promise in the air
And I'm guiding you

Through every turn I'll be near you
I'll come anytime you call
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll be guiding you

You have to believe we are magic
Nothing can stand in our way
You have to believe we are magic
Don't let your aim ever stray
And if all your hopes survive
Destiny will arrive

I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you
I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you

Hey, you have to believe we are magic
Nothing can stand in our way
Have to believe we are magic
Don't let your aim ever stray
And if all your hopes survive
Destiny will arrive

I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you
I'll bring all your dreams alive
For you
