		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunset, sundress, so high I'm blessed to be here
No stress, I'm not impressed with more
Simple but I adore it.

Life with you is 
Feeling all the rain
Never running away (never never)
Never losing face, you don't ever play

It's you unlocked a secret
To living like you're free-er than now (ohoh)

Baby you're my bliss
From the moment you first kissed me I knew
Baby you're my bliss
So safe in your arms in a world so dark 
I choose you, I choose you
Baby you're my bliss

If ignorance is bliss then I'm a fool every time we kiss
Making out in front ya friends, a fiend getting his fix
Swore your friends engineers, how they all in the mix

Don't wanna say it's good as it gets 
But if this aint' cloud 9 than the sky aint shit
If this a waste of time don't know what time is
Spend a whole 365 not a moment to miss

You've been looking for somebody not anybody 
Got a ticket to real love and you're invited 
You're good for me like water, hot yoga, or the sauna 
after giving anaconda in the presidential suite
now we look like Obama's
You my lover and a friend we ohana
It feels like (bliss)

Feeling all the rain
Never running away (never never)
Never losing face, you don't ever play

It's you unlocked a secret
To living like you're free-er than now (ohoh)
Baby you're my bliss
From the moment you first kissed me I knew
Baby you're my bliss
So safe in your arms in a world so dark 
I choose you, I choose you
Baby you're my bliss

Baby you're my bliss x2

Yeah
