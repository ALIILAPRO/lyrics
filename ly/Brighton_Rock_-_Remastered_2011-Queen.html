		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say?"
"Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"

Oh Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays"
