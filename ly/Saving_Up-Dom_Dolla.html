		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I need is for you to be mine, you to be mine, you to be mine (oh)
All I need is for you to be mine, you to be mine

Some people save for a diamond
Some people save for a ride
Breaking backs for a place in the city (oh-oh)
That'll keep them satisfied
I don't need your bread or your butter (no, I don't)
What I want don't cost a dime (don't cost a dime)
I need this more than a number (number)

All I need is for you to be mine, you to be mine, you to be mine (oh)
All I need is for you to be mine, you to be mine, you to be mine (oh)
All I need is for you to be mine

If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (oh-oh)
If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (ooh, ooh-ooh)
If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (oh-oh)
If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (ooh, ooh-ooh)

Save your love for me, ayy
Save your love for me (oh, if you're gonna be saving up, yeah)
Save your love for me (save your love on me)
Save your love for me

Some people save for a diamond
Some people save for a ride
Breaking backs for a place in the city (oh-oh)
That'll keep them satisfied
I don't need your bread or your butter (no, I don't)
What I want don't cost a dime (don't cost a dime)
I need this more than a number (number)

All I need is for you to be mine, you to be mine, you to be mine (oh)
All I need is for you to be mine, you to be mine, you to be mine (oh)
All I need is for you to be mine

If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (oh-oh)
If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (ooh, ooh-ooh)
If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (oh-oh)
If you're gonna be saving up
Save your love for me (ooh, ooh-ooh)

Save your love for me, ayy
Save your love for me (oh, if you're gonna be saving up, yeah)
Save your love for me (save your love on me)
Save your love for me
