		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm waiting for life full of torment within
An evil intention lies under my skin
And leads me astray

In empty romance I am losing myself,
Delusional chance, I'm embracing silence,
And all shades of grey

Hopeless, I'm drowning,
Helpless, I'm trying
Desperate to find the reason I can believe

There you are, my melancholy angel
Taking me from grace to sorrows
Lust has gone and future is a stranger
Buried are all doves and swallows
I can see through the shadows of your mind
Poisoned tongue, magnetic monster
I will kill my melancholy angel
Waking from my darkest nights

I see in the mirror the void I've become
The joys and the horrors keep turning me numb
A taste of despair

The more that I grieve and the less that I care
The less that I give and the more that I bear
The price that I pay

Hopeless, I'm drowning,
Helpless, I'm trying
Desperate to find the reason I can believe

There you are, my melancholy angel
Taking me from grace to sorrows
Lust has gone and future is a stranger
Buried are all doves and swallows
I can see through the shadows of your mind
Poisoned tongue, magnetic monster
I will kill my melancholy angel
Waking from my darkest nights

Hopeless, I'm drowning,
Helpless, I'm trying
Desperate to find the reason I can believe

There you are, my melancholy angel
Taking me from grace to sorrows
Lust has gone and future is a stranger
Buried are all doves and swallows
I can see through the shadows of your mind
Poisoned tongue, magnetic monster
I will kill my melancholy angel
Waking from my darkest nights
