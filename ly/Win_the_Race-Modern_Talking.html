		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can win the race
We can win the race

We have a dream, you win tonight
Take a chance, take a chance, God is on you side
We pray for you, you like a hurricane
You can win, you can win, you can win the game
Try the impossible, we want a miracle
There's a million fans around
Our dreams free, we want the victory
The hero's back in town

Ohh come on We, we can win the race
Ohh he, fights us face to face
Ohh see, we will win the game
Again, again, and again
Ohh come on We, we can win the race
Ohh we, we will take the chance
Ohh Only the strong survive
We'll stay by your side

We have a dream, we don't give up
We can win, we can win, right from the start
The price is high, time is on your side
Take the chance, take the chance, you'll win tonight
You know you are the best, you can beat the rest
We never let you down,
You have the energy, we want the victory
The hero's back in town

Ohh you can win the race,
You win again, and again
Again, again, and again

We can win the race!
