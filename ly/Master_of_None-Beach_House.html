		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always go to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
On your knees
I would not beg you please

I want your picture but not your words
You know they'd want it
But there's no first
On your own
You cannot call it your home

We always wrung our hands too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own
You will not catch your own bone

We run our fingers together
You know it's easy
The devil's plan
On your own
You can not call me your own

Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
'Cause I'm not having fun

You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
You cannot
You are not for free
