All I see is propaganda
In the world
See is propaganda
Uh

And all I see is propaganda, propaganda
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda

Yeah, united we stand, divided we fall (uh)
New Year's Eve, they've been droppin' the ball (uh)
Independent, how we dentin' the game
We don't write to the sound of applause (we don't)
Hidden truths, dotted lines, ain't never signed
Stood and remained a boss (a boss)
In a world that is full of facades
Where if you speak, you get nailed to a cross
I won't be silent, I am outspoken
I am the product of pain, so when you see my name
Know fame could never break
Down a brain, that is already broken
Every wound is a pain devotion
They fill words as I purge emotion
Scabs tear as I drop hits
That bleed lies from demonic omens
The system decides what we spend and we buy
While most of our time is spend in bed (yeah)
And dreams we have all stay inside
We sleep and wake, then live with regret (oh man)
The price of life is half the cost
The price of fame could cost your head (your head)
If infamy is what you seek
And propaganda's what you spread (uh)

And all I see is propaganda, propaganda (all I see is propganda, all I see is propganda)
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda (all I see is propganda)
(All I ever saw was propganda)
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda (all I see is propganda, all I see is propganda)
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda, oh whoa

Look what they did, indoctrinated
They convinced us all that everything we say is racist, and blood will change it
That's what happens, y'all need balance
y'all need blacks and whites and lefts and rights to stop the madness
they planned it (they did)
It's Trump or Biden, we all been divided, riot in the streets (yeah)
Elections always been rigged, I ain't surprised if somebody cheats
All I see is pentagrams of the propaganda, but our priority's a vaccine (yeah)
It ain't hard for wolves to find a flock when the sheep are fast asleep (wake up)
Too many people lack character, too many journalists scarin' ya
Too many pencils attemptin' to rewrite the Constitution, they probably gon' tear it up
I love the country, but I don't trust the people takin' care of us
We went to bed with the American dream, we woke up in Night-merica

And all I see is propaganda, propaganda (all I see is propganda, all I see is propganda)
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda (all I see is propganda)
(All I ever saw was propganda)
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda (all I see is propganda, all I see is propganda)
And all I see is propaganda, propaganda, oh whoa
