		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rock 'n roll, save your soul
And I got it
Give it to me loud and free
And don't knock it
Let me hear it 'til the end of time
It's the only way
Send shivers up and down your spine
You can't stop it

I'm tellin' you one more time
It ain't no crime
Rock it

It's the only way to fly
Gotta have it
Break through, gonna break you too
You better grab it
Let me hear it 'til the end of time
It's the only way
It'll stop you on a dime
You can't stop it

I'm tellin' you one more time
It ain't no crime
Rock it

Rock 'n roll music gonna stop the world
Can't lose it
It'll make your toenails curl
You can't defuse it
Let me hear it all the time
It's the only way
Gonna make ya feel alright
You can't excuse it

I'm tellin' you one more time
It ain't no crime
Rock it, rock it, rock it
Yeah, rock it, yeah
