		  Jason Derulo
Tesher (haha)
Sheesh

You know I came here for the cake (cake)
Liquor and the money ain't the only thing I chase now
She ain't see the stars in the Wraith (skrrt)
Soon as she got in that motherfucker, had her face down
That my type (that my type), my sweetie 
Could be wifey if she freaky
Hell of a night, blowing money like Monopoly
I'm a dog, kill the kitty no apology 

I know that you wanna get crazy, crazy
Shawty take it slow then cheti, cheti 
Come on baby be my Jalebi Baby
Ayy

Baby let me me see it
Jalebi Baby
I just wanna eat it
Jalebi Baby
Baby let me see it 
Jalebi Baby 
Oh, I really need it
Jalebi, oh
Baby let me see it
Jalebi Baby
I just wanna eat it
Jal-
Jalebi, I
I know the things, the things that you like
I know the things, the things that you like

Tell me how you feel
Lookin' like a movie star doing it for Reels
Lookin' like a snack, lookin' like a whole meal
Gucci and Chanel with your red bottom heels
Ice drip, like paani
Ban ja tu meri rani
Shawty bad, she my Deewani Mastani
Light it up from Hollywood to Mohali
Tesher and Derulo, it's a worldwide party 

I know that you wanna get crazy, crazy
Shawty take it slow then cheti, cheti (ayy, girl)
Come on baby be my Jalebi Baby
You know what I'ma say
Ayy

Baby let me me see it
Jalebi Baby
I just wanna eat it
Jalebi Baby
Baby let me see it 
Jalebi Baby 
Oh, I really need it
Jalebi, oh
Baby let me see it
Jalebi Baby
I just wanna eat it
Jalebi, I
I know the things, the things that you like

Baby let me me see it
Jalebi Baby
Girl, I just wanna eat it
Jalebi Baby
Baby let me
Jalebi Baby
You know I really need it 
Jalebi, oh
Baby let me see it
Jalebi Baby
I just wanna eat it
Jalebi Baby 
Baby let me see it 
Jalebi 
I know the things, the things that you like 

Ha, yeah!
Jalebi Baby
Young Tesher and Derulo
Bollywood Hollywood duo
I know the things, the things that you like
