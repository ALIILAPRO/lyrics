In this bitch
Got a blade on my hip
Hollow tips in the clip
Baby bite on my lip
Feel the bass in the beat
Her whole body is in heat
I make cash while you sleep
We make cash on repeat
Spit in my pretty face
Trust we will be okay
Scars hid in CDG
Love me
And make me bleed
Spit in my pretty face
Trust we will be okay
Scars hid in CDG
Love me
And make me bleed
Load up my big nine
Now I'm trying to shoot to kill
If you pussys slipping
It's this 50 trying to do the deal
Load up my big nine
Now I'm trying to shoot to kill
If you pussys slipping
It's this 50 trying to do the deal
Dance
Dance
Dance
In this bitch
Got a blade on my hip
Hollow tips in the clip
Baby bite on my lip
Feel the bass in the beat
Her whole body is in heat
I make cash while you sleep
We make cash on repeat
Spit in my pretty face
Trust we will be okay
Scars hid in CDG
Love me
And make me bleed
Spit in my pretty face
Trust we will be okay
Scars hid in CDG
Love me
And make me bleed
Load up my big nine
Now I'm trying to shoot to kill
If you pussys slipping
It's this 50 trying to do the deal
Load up my big nine
Now I'm trying to shoot to kill
If you pussys slipping
It's this 50 trying to do the deal
Spit in my pretty face
Trust we will be okay
Scars hid in CDG
Love me
And make me bleed
Spit in my pretty face
Trust we will be okay
Scars hid in CDG
Love me
And make me bleed
