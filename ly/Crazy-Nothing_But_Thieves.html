		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
And even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably

I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, bless your soul
You really think that you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably
