		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I Got The Answer To All Of Your Deepest Desires 
Come Let Me Heal Ya Of Your Past Baby
I’ll Free Your Mind 

Where Ever You Go, Whatever You Do
No No One Can Love You, Just Quite Like I Do Through Power, Through Pain
My Touch Ain’t The Same, You Know I’m Saving Grace
Saving Grace
Saving Grace
Saving Grace

Where Ever You Go, Whatever You Do
No No One Can Love You, Just Quite Like I Do Through Earth, Through Hellfire
I’ll Take Ya Higher, You Know I’m Saving Grace
 
Saving Grace 
Saving Grace 
Saving Grace 
You Know I’m 

It’s No Illusion, I’m All Around You At Once Tracking Your Movements
When I Call How Fast Will You Come
I Need You Now, Now More Than Ever You Know Ya Self, But I Know You Better Patiently Pray, You Get It Together
This Only Takes As Long As You Let It 

Where Ever You Go, Whatever You Do
No No One Can Love You, Just Quite Like I Do Through Power, Through Pain
My Touch Ain’t The Same, You Know I’m Saving Grace 

Saving Grace 
Saving Grace

Where Ever You Go, Whatever You Do
No No One Can Love You, Just Quite Like I Do Through Earth, Through Hellfire
I’ll Take Ya Higher, You Know I’m
Saving Grace
