		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had
A chance to

I've stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all these changes came about my ways
And I wonder if I'd see another
Highway

I had a lover
I don't think I'd risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing
So long

La, la, la, la, la
La, la

I've stopped my dreaming
I won't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
Please don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them
