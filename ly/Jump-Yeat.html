		  Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(I need you to) jump, jump, jump
(I need you to) jump, jump, jump (yeah)
I tell you to turn this shit up and you better jump (yeah)
If I see that fence you know I'ma do it, you know I'ma jump (yeah)
I just been high, I don't get drunk, yeah
We just be drivin', yeah, with a Glock in the trunk, yeah
We just been flyin', yeah, feel like the sun

Woke up on, took me an X, feel like the warden I took me some
Yeah, I don't even know you, who they is? I don't know nothin'
Yeah, talk to my demon, told him what's up, he just be gone (oh)
Walked inside the building trippin', killed it like a mink coat, yeah
Someone said I'm 'bout the greatest, I'm 'bout a mean flow (yeah)
Fuckin' on your thot, fuckin' on your thot, she a team ho (ho)

Ridin' round with the bugs, yeah, we got the pole (yeah)
Ridin' round with the goats, yeah, we in control (yeah)
Ridin' round, we just ridin' round with a hunnid round, yeah
Bitch I touched a milli', yeah, ridin' by my self now (self)
Pulled up on the fuckin' scene, but it's not a playground (ah)
I don't give fuck 'bout what you sayin', yeah, what you said now?
You don't make more money than me, you gotta sit down, yeah
You tried to steal my swag from me, you gotta sit down
The Tonka fit so many, it still can't fit in (yeah)
What's that shit? Oh, that's my nut your bitch was drinkin' (yeah)
I ain't even readin' his posts like that, I rap what I'm thinkin' (yeah)
My twizzy pull up with a hundred round drum (brrt)
And he cook his ass just like some bacon (yeah)
And you don't be doin' 'bout none of these drugs 
That you rappin' 'bout, you just be fakin' (yeah)
I hop on the beat, and I turn this shit up 
Then I take a Perc, go on vacation (yeah)
This shit that I'm doin' not difficult now 
So I don't be havin' celebrations (yeah)

Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(I need you to) jump, jump, jump
(I need you to) jump, jump, jump (yeah)
I tell you to turn this shit up and you better jump (yeah)
If I see that fence you know I'ma do it, you know I'ma jump (yeah)
I just been high, I don't get drunk, yeah
We just be drivin', yeah, with a Glock in the trunk, yeah
We just been flyin', yeah, feel like the sun

Woke up on, took me an X, feel like the warden I took me some
Yeah, I don't even know you, who they is? I don't know nothin'
Yeah, talk to my demon, told him what's up, he just be gone (oh)
Walked inside the building trippin', killed it like a mink coat, yeah
Someone said I'm 'bout the greatest, I'm 'bout a mean flow (yeah)
Fuckin' on your thot, fuckin' on your thot, she a team ho (ho)
