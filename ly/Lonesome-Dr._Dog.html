		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all
What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all

My thoughts are wicked and rotten
My goat don't wanna be gotten
And I had my fill of the whippoorwill
When he broke into song I shot him
Leave me alone

What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all
What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all

Well the train is loaded and leaving
And the Lord only knows I don't need it
And I snub my nose when the whistle blows
But it's never enough to get even
Get out of here and leave me alone
Get out of here and leave me alone

The moon can do what he pleases
He can cry so much that he sneezes
And if a falling star falls in my yard
Well I'll pick up the pieces
Get out of here

What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all
What does it take to be lonesome?
Nothing at all
