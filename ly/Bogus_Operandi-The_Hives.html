		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit, damn, overslept, I go to work
(Like I say, like I say, like I say, like I say)
I'm never coming, you never feel adored
(Like I say, like I say, like I say, like I say)

I told ya, you mend it
Bogus operandi
My motive's so handy
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah

Foul play, DNA, that is to say
(Like I say, like I say, like I say, like I say)
My personality is rotten all the way
(Like I say, like I say, like I say, like I say)

Mmm, stand to the side when my shit starts wrecking
You're gonna think you've gone blind
I only need a moment, a moment's come around
You're gonna think you've gone blind

I told ya, you mend it
Bogus operandi
My motive's so handy
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah

You're gonna die
Like I say, like I say

Like I say, like I say, like I say
Well, like I say, like I say, like I say, like I say (come on)
Well, like I say, like I say, like I say, like I say

I told ya, you mend it
Bogus operandi
My motive's so handy
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah
Nothing but bogus operandi, yeah
