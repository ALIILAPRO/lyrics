		  Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay, okay, okay
Big 4L, the biggest 4L
Pussy, 21
21

G-block savage with the criminals (21)
Niggas throwin' shots, they subliminal (21)
Say that its a problem then we spin on 'em (on God)
Get the whole drum 'cause I'm generous (sprayed out)
Put your name on the bullets while I'm fillin' 'em (pussy)
All the opps scared 'cause we killin' 'em (pussy)
Eastside vet, I'm a general (pussy)
All my niggas twins, we identical (pussy)
I put all the beef on the meat rack (straight up)
Holes in his face, pull the sheet back (facts)
His mama threw a candlelight, skeet that (phew, phew)
Stepped on her son call DFAC (pussy)
Paradise the wrong place to creep at (on God)
He tellin' on the news, he a street rat (21)
Shoot the whole hunnid, nigga, keep that (pussy)
Pass the opp pack so I can chief that (pussy)

Wet 'em, umbrella (yeah)
Clutchin' glizzys with the fellas (yeah)
Choppa sing like it's Adele, uh (yeah)
Money, violence go together (yeah)
Bottega labels on my sweater (21)
Can't name a bitch that made me sweat her (say what? Yeah)
Cold-hearted, I'm a stepper (21)
These bullets hot, jalape침o pepper (hot)

Give me more shooters, I need it
Give me more plates know we greedy
We catchin' bodies, we fiendin'
They catchin' bodies, they dreamin'
And I just caught a body with your bitch, she ate semen (uh-huh)
Suck me up, baby girl, ooh, she's a demon (wow)
Say she love the money, I say she fiendin'
Set up her nigga, I'm plottin' and schemin'
Slimeball (slime), bitch (bitch)
Rich as a bitch and they broke like her nigga (huh)
Sit in L.A., sendin' shots to the nigga
Cross the country, nigga sendin' them hitters (kill 'em)
Nigga actin' country, play with me, nigga (kill 'em)
Stick right here make some noise (boom)
Grip on that bitch, hunnid round, can't avoid (wow)
Bitch shake the ground and attached to that boy (mm)
We shook the crowd when we step on that boy
Different breed, different hitters, different killers (yeah)
Glock-23 and it come with extendo (yeah)
Switch on the bitch, finna whoop me a nigga (brr, brr, brr)
Think I was his mom when I get done (brr)
Leavin' no prints on the block (yeah)
Leavin' a snitch on they block (yeah)
We left some opps on our block (yeah)
These niggas turnin' to cops (yeah)
They be makin' song when their partner drop (damn)

Wet 'em, umbrella (yeah)
Clutchin' glizzys with the fellas (yeah)
Choppa sing like it's Adele, uh (yeah)
Money, violence go together (yeah)
Bottega labels on my sweater (21)
Can't name a bitch that made me sweat her (say what? Yeah)
Cold-hearted, I'm a stepper (21)
These bullets hot, jalape침o pepper (hot)

Nigga say it's up, they be hidin' though (21)
I can put it on but I still got a stylist though (on God)
Party in the hills, all the bitches got a powder nose
Call 'em bent over on the counter hoes (straight up)
Came from the bottom, nigga, I done reached a lot of goals
Reach for my chain, you get a lotta holes
Big 4L get 'em gone like, "Adi칩s"
Knock your hood down, nigga, domino (21)
I ain't really friendly, nigga, fuck 'em all (pussy)
Clip full of hollows, I'ma bust 'em all (pussy)
Send 'em out to God with a fuckin' call (pussy)
Only time I ran, it's from the fuckin' law (pussy)
Big 4L, she wanna suck us all (pussy)
I got too much cash for a fuckin' mall (pussy)
If she ain't my bitch then I ain't fuckin' raw (pussy)
If she for the streets then I ain't fuckin' raw (pussy)

Wet 'em, umbrella (yeah)
Clutchin' glizzys with the fellas (yeah)
Choppa sing like it's Adele, uh (yeah)
Money, violence go together (yeah)
Bottega labels on my sweater (21)
Can't name a bitch that made me sweat her (say what? Yeah)
Cold-hearted, I'm a stepper (21)
These bullets hot, jalape침o pepper (hot)
