		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn the lights up
Nothin' to hide from
Let's see those eyes
Turn your glance up
Girl just man up
And be alright

Let's be old souls
And sweep the low lows
Here unto dust
'Cause I'd take every bullet
And fire one through
Well I'd die for you
Die for your love

If I'm gonna give myself up
I will give myself up
Even if I let myself go
I will let myself go
Got the lust my life
Got that will to survive
But I'd die for your
Die for your love

I would die for your
Die for your
Die for your love

New beginnings
Never-ending
Let's take vow
To the living
Forever giving
I can see that now

Let the time run
We'll let the warm sun be enough
'Cause there's no chance I won't take
I'd burn at the stake
I would die for your
Die for your love

If I'm gonna give myself up
I will give myself up
Even if I let myself go
I will let myself go
Got the lust my life
Got that will to survive
But I'd die for your
Die for your love

I would die for your
Die for your
Die for your love

At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven

At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven

(Die for your
Die for your love)

At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven

At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
At least I'll go to heaven
