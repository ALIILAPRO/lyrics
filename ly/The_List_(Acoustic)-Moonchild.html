		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate you make me nervous
I always say the wrong thing
It doesn't matter anyway
Ain't nothing gonna change, no

I hate the situation
I'm always runnin' into you
And when I don't I'm hopin' to
I hate feeling so confused, oh

Don't wanna feel the way I do
Just what I'm goin' through
Don't wanna feel the way I do
Just what I'm goin' through

I hate that you're perfect
No way your ass comes out so clean
Somebody's playin' tricks on me
Can't see what I wanna see
I hate that you still call me
Just when I done made up my mind
To leave your perfect ass behind
I hear you soundin' so fine

Don't wanna feel the way I do
Just what I'm goin' through
Don't wanna feel the way I do
Just what I'm goin' through
(I know it's just what I'm goin' through, baby)
Don't wanna feel the way I do
Just what I'm goin' through
(Feel the way I do, for you)
Don't wanna feel the way I do
Just what I'm goin' through

How else can I let you go?
When the man I know
Makes me wanna be your girl
(I wanna be)
Outliving the love I've saved
Fighting the dreams away
Oh, I wanna be your girl
Just wanna be, just wanna be
Your girl, your girl, oh

I hate that I can't tell you
Left guessing if youâ€™ll ever know
I'm tryin' not to let it show
Mind game just to let you go
I hate that you don't want it
I hate that I'm still so sweet
As if it might change somethin'
When you're ready, you'll remember me
I hate I know your birthday
I know all of your favorite shit
When you were talkin', I was listenin'
Yet I still can't win
And I hate that you don't call me
Like to think that we're still cool
And now I'm feelin' like a fool
Every time it rings. I hope it's you
(I hate the way...)

I was so good to you, to you
I'd be good for you, for you
I know I'm good for you, for you
Because I'm good to you
I was so good to you, to you
I'd be good for you, for you
I know I'm good for you
Because I'm good to you
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
(Like the love I was savin')
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
