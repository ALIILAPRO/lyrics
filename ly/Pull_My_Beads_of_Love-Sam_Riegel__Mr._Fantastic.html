		  2,3,4gimme a tughaaaa!

Now I don't really know whatcha thinkin'
When ya lookin' at a gnome like me
But I can show ya somethin' special
You lordies and you ladies can't see

Got a twinkle in my eye...that's right!
Hit the lights and you'll find a surprise,
Cuz there is something underneath my drawers
Come on let your fingers explore...

Pull on my motherfuckin' beads - of love - of love
Pull on my motherfuckin' beads - of love - of love - owww!


Well I know that you're thinkin' about me
Cuz your curiosity has been piqued
I may be forty-two inches of sexy
But I'm sixty-nine feet of freak!

I'm not go'n tell you to stop
Feelin' good goin' in, goin' out
You wanna hear somethin' pop?
Well gimme a tug! And good god! I'll shout!

Pull on my motherfuckin' beads - of love - of love
Pull on my motherfuckin' beads - of love - of love
Wooo! Goodnight, Emon!
