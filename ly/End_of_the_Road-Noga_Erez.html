		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we get some more sub so he can feel it?

Dumb, dumb, dummy, I'm no bunny
I'm no slobby boy, I never beg for no money
Fun, fun, funny
You'll run from
No irony, no
I pardon no one, nobody
Chop, chop, chop it right hand
Chop it like a pickpocket
You had the mic, now you can't drop it
Dumb, dumb, dummy
Once nobody, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming, sit down

I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
But my trip is mad
I ain't finished, I got loads

I think I'm up for the challenge
To show I got me some mileage
I bought a car and a cottage
I got Suzanne in my baggage
Got a list in my bucket
Squeeze the sponge, drop the pocket
I fit in any socket
Close the door, I'ma knock it

I got my ticket, I'ma flee
Selling overseas
I just blink and get a fee
Watch out
Whatca think of me?

I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
But my trip is mad
I ain't finished, I got loads

Lately, I got ceilings but I burn in the sun
I never miss one shot, I'm sick as a gun
I got mortal friends, I'm dead as they come like
Hey, I'm on the way
I left my body in the mattress by the San Francisco Bay
Now there's a cop named Mordecai behind my pirated Mercedes
When we crash I hit the ER, this is a thriller
I did it for the PR, I did it for the fear
I did it knowing there's a D'animal pack in the back of the fridge
I go pack it up might triple attack
And battery-acid my stacks in the cab
Menagerie cracked and my doggies run packs
I just tell 'em to back it up, back it up, back it up

I don't, I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't (okay, now repeat that one more time)

I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
I don't know what really, really happens at the end of the road
(Maybe nothing)
But my trip is mad
I ain't finished, I got loads
