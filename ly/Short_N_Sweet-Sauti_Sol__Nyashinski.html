		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think you fell in love too fast
African night and a cool rush
And I remember you refused to kiss me
And now you using my toothbrush
You say you think I talk too much
That I’m not your type and you don’t like the hype
Cause your daddy is a preacher
Now you wearing my t-shirt
And I don’t want this night to end
Before you know I love you
I don’t want this night to end
Before you know I need you
Na muda usiniishie nikuambie ''I love you''
I don’t want this night to end
Before you know I need you
So I'ma keep it

Short and sweet
DJ play this song on repeat
Odi odi dance to the beat
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Short and sweet
DJ play this song on repeat
Odi odi dance to the beat
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet

Yeah, you wanna do the right thing
You find this too exciting
Your friends tell you, “Ku-date mtu ka' mimi ni high risk”
Throw that shit behind me (Yeah)
Come sit beside me
If you got too much class, then do me like assignment (Yeah)
Please don’t remind me of the bad times
Your sugar sweet, you're icy, bad in my eye
It shouldn’t be so hard to make up your mind
Just do it one time for the one time
Huh, itakuwa fair uki-participate
Vile nimejitolea ungejua unge-appreciate
Lighting intimate
One plus 68
Usi-rush hata ukitoka saa hii you'll still be late
Tusiache chance ya ku-feel regret
How much higher than this can you ever get?
Hii ni Mount Everest
And by sunrise I’m gone
I’m not here that long
Keep it

Short and sweet
DJ play this song on repeat
Odi odi dance to the beat
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Short and sweet
DJ play this song on repeat
Odi odi dance to the beat
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet

Hii crib ni bedsitter
Na sina kiti so utakalia kitanda
Na, hii kitanda na ni four by six
Usingizi wa pono ka' uko six feet deep
Kabla nizame six inch deep
Acha ni-seti mood na maudi
Na ngoma za Kabaka Daudi
Na ngoma za Oliver Mtukudzi
Can we
Getting closer let's get warmer
Lose attention be together
I know how to treat you better
Take this moment unforgettable
With this feeling's undeniable
Moyo ushajipa kwani
Na nafsi imekukubali
Nimekimbiza nyuki nile asali
Oh, Lord
I'ma keep it

Short and sweet
DJ play this song on repeat
Odi odi dance to the beat
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Short and sweet
DJ play this song on repeat
Odi odi dance to the beat
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet
Hapo ulipo kamata na-feel so sweet

You wanna do the right thing
You find this too exciting
Your friends tell you, “Ku-date mtu ka' mimi ni high risk”
Throw that shit behind me
Come sit beside me
If you got too much class, then do me like assignment
