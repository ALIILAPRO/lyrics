		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
With a heavy heart, and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish man, God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus, hoping he will understand

I had a woman once, she was kind and she was gentle
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job, 'til I started into drinking
Started playing music travelin' with the devil's band

Oh the years flew by like a mighty rush of eagles
My dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
It's a lonesome life, when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus will they take me back again

If I give my soul, will He stop my hands from shaking
If I give my soul, will my son love me again
If I give my soul, and she knows I really mean it
If I give my soul to Jesus will she take me back again

If I give my soul, will He clean these clothes I'm wearing
If I give my soul, will He put new boots on my feet
If I bow my head, and beg God for His forgiveness
Will he breathe new breath within me, and bring her back to me
