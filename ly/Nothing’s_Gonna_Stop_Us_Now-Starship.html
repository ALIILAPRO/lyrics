		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
This world that I've found is too good to be true
Standing here beside you, want so much to give you
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you

Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care about that
Put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now, oh no

I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes, I will stay here with you
Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times
Whatever it takes here's what I'm gonna do

Let 'em say we're crazy, what do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Oh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever, and ever and ever
Hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(And we can build this dream together)
(Standing strong forever) whoa
(Nothing's gonna stop us now)
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(World runs out of lovers)
(We'll still have each other)
(Nothing's gonna stop us now) oh, now
(And we can build this dream together) hey, baby
(Standing strong forever) I know
(Nothing's gonna stop us now) hey, baby
Nothing's gonna stop us 
(World runs out of lovers) hey, baby, ooh-ooh
(We'll still have each other)
(Nothing's gonna stop us) nothing, baby
Nothing's gonna stop us now, yeah
(And we can build this dream together)
(Standing strong forever)
(Nothing's gonna stop us now)
