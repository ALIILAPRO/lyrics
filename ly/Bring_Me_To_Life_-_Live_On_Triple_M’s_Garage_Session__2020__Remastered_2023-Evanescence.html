		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core 
Where I've become so numb (become so numb)
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold 
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up inside 
Wake me up inside 
Call my name and save me from the dark 
(Bring me to life)

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me 
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life (to life, to life)

Wake me up inside 
Wake me up inside 
Call my name and save me from the dark 
Bid my blood to run 
Before I come undone 
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

(Bring me to life)

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

(Bring me to life)
Bring me to life
Bring me to life
