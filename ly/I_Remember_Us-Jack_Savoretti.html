		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember me?
And how you used to look at me?
Things I didn't have to say
To make you fall in love
'Cause I remember you
And how I used to look at you
All the little games you'd play
To make me fall in love

Maybe time has turned our diamonds into dust
Looking for a love we thought was lost

I remember us
Every single part of us
That feeling that we used to know
I'm never gonna let it go
I'm not giving up
I'm never giving up on us
I tried to let you go
But you're the only love I've ever known

You tried to walk away
But in the end, you'd always stay
You can't make sense of anything
When you fall in love
We didn't ask for much
All we ever needed was a touch
Nothing looks like everything
When you fall in love

Maybe time has turned our diamonds into dust
Looking for a love we thought was lost

I remember us
Every single part of us
That feeling that we used to know
I'm never gonna let it go
I'm not giving up
I'm never giving up on us
I tried to let you go
But you're the only love I've ever known

Blinded by the love we used to feel
But I know that after all
Our love is still so real

I remember us
Every single part of us
That feeling that we used to know
I'm never gonna let it go
I'm not giving up
I'm never giving up on us
I tried to let you go
But you're the only love I've ever known
