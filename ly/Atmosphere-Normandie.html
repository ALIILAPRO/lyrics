		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the middle of the night
I saw It all so clear
I was so alone
In your atmosphere
Blinded by the light
Take me anywhere
You pull me in, I push me out and disappear

But I need somebody
Honestly, I don't know who I'd be without it
Misery loves company and I'm surrounded
Honestly, I'm tired of feeling numb

I think I lost myself
Feels like I'm burning up but still my heart is cold
I try to scream it out but still nobody knows
No they can't see, cause I can't seem to show
That I can't be alone

In the middle of day I see you everywhere
I let my mind escape In your atmosphere
But no one even notice
And you don't even care
I shut you down, you shut me out and disappear

I think I lost myself
Feels like I'm burning up but still my heart is cold
I try to scream it out but still nobody knows
No they can't see, cause I can't seem to show
That I can't be alone

In the middle of the night
I saw It all so clear
I was so alone
In your atmosphere
