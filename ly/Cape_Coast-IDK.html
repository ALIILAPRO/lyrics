		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you wanna be a rogue (it's lights out)
The consequence is pretrial (it's lights out)
If you wanna be a pimp (it's lights out)
Then never fall for a pretty smile (it's lights out)
I got a whole lot of exes (it's lights out)
That got a whole lot of questions (it's lights out)
Like, why would you fight for me (it's lights out)
Then go runnin' for the exit? (It's lights out)

A therapist once said that I could be up next
To live my life upset, I said, "Enough said"
I never came back, I guess that I felt attacked
Hope I don't go back
I try to stay refrigerated
The bad apple hurt your belly 'cause you ate it
I said the apple fell close to the tree
I looked up, my mama lookin' down at me, like

Sometimes the feelings are blind
Sometimes I can't even give it a try
Sometimes (it's lights out) 
I keep it inside (it's lights out)
But still I cry (it's lights out) 
Still I cry (it's lights out)

It's lights out and away we go
Racing here in cape coast, what a race
