		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel alive again
Started with the fear of falling
Into an hourglass
Voices in the void are calling
Wrap me in your arms
Waterfalls, endless as they drag me down into the dark
Of it all, can your heaven help me?
Is this the end or is this the beginning?

There are stranger things I've learned on the outside
Separated by an open door
I find it hard to reach the end of my timeline
Salivating 'cause I wanted more
Is this the end or is this the beginning?

Am I allowed again
To call out what I need to hear?
To be a conduit
Conditioned by the fear of fear?
Wrap me in your arms
(Waterfalls, endless as they drag me)
Down into the dark
(Of it all, can your heaven help me?)

Is this what you want me to be?
Perfect and clean
Float on a temporary
Empire built in a day
To throw it away
And now I can tell you, there are

Stranger things I've learned on the outside
Separated by an open door
I find it hard to reach the end of my timeline
Salivating 'cause I wanted more
Is this the end or is this the beginning?

I know where I wanna go
But it's too close
And it's too late this time
I know where I wanna go
But it's too close
And it's too late this time

There are stranger things I've learned on the outside
Separated by an open door
I find it hard to reach the end of my timeline
Salivating 'cause I wanted more
Is this the end or is this the beginning?
Is this the end or is this the beginning?
Is this the end or is this the beginning?
