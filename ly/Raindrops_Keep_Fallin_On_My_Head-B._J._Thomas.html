		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet
Are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops
Are falling on my head
They keep falling

So I just did me some
Talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way
He got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops
Are falling on my head
They keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long
'Til happiness
Steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me 'cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long
'Til happiness
Steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me 'cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
