		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No no they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No no they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you've changed my life
No no they can't take that away from me
No they can't take that away from me

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No no they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No no they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No no they can't take that away from me
No they can't take that away from me
Swing it boys

We may never never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Swing it
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
Yeah man

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No no they can't take that away from me
No they can't take that away from me
Would you repeat that again deary please
No they can't take that away from me
