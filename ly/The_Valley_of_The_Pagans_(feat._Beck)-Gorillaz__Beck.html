		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the land of the permanent sun
Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun
The freeway lizards are not feelin' so good
On a one-way trip back to West Hollywood, let's go

I feel so good to have a perfect song
I feel so good to be in total control
I feel so good to have a perfect song
I feel so good to be in total control

There were spotlights flying, through the sky
From a winter wonderland, catching out
The beasts hiding in the clouds, no future, Batman
Not before Christmas, not very likely
One hundred million Viagra tablets
Stored in a warehouse in a valley

I feel so good to have a perfect song (uh huh)
I feel so good to be in total control (uh huh)
I feel so good to have a perfect song (uh huh)
I feel so good to be in total control

It's so convincing, but something's missing
The sun is kissing my face and erasing my doubts
I'm going out with a bang, and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright
Alright, all night, alright, alright, alright

I'm chasing dreams, etcetera and forever
I hope, said no one

She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a hemophiliac
With a dying battery light
Candy-colored fingers and schadenfreude eyes
Thinkin' airbrushed thoughts with a logo on her mind
It's so delightful, it's so insightful
It's so frightful, and I'm feeling it
Every single fucking day (yay yay yay yay yay)
It's time to party
It's time to party (woo)

In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
Valley made of mirrors
Oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a pagan
You can feel like a pagan

In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
Valley made of mirrors
Oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a pagan
You can feel like a pagan

In the valley (you can feel like a pagan)
Yeah, I live in the valley
In the valley (you can feel like a pagan)
I heard there's a sauna out in the desert
In the valley (you can feel like a pagan)
Where you can get really transcendental and high key
In the valley (you can feel like a pagan)
I'm on a cleanse
In the valley (you can feel like a pagan)
Yeah, the hot tub is really chill

Can feel like a pagan
