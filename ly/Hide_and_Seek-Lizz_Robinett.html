		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Ding dong
I know you can hear me
Open up the door
I only want to play a little
Ding dong
You can't keep me waiting
It's already too late
For you to try and run away
I see you through the window
Our eyes are locked together
I can sense your horror
Though I'd like to see it closer
Ding dong
Here I come to find you
Hurry up and run
Let's play a little game and have fun
Ding dong
Where is it you've gone to?
Do you think you've won?
Our game of hide and seek has just begun
I hear your footsteps
Thumping loudly through the hallways
I can hear your sharp breaths
You're not very good at hiding
Just wait, you can't hide from me
(I'm coming)
Just wait, you can't hide from me
(I'm coming)
Just wait, you can't hide from me
(I'm coming)
Just wait, you can't hide from me
Knock knock
I am at your door now
I am coming in
No need for me to ask permission
Knock knock
I'm inside your room now
Where is it you've hid?
Our game of hide and seek's about to end
I'm coming closer
Looking underneath your bed but
You're not there, I wonder
Could you be inside the closet?
Ding dong
I have found you
Ding dong
You were hiding here
Now you're it
Ding dong
Finally found you, dear
Now you're it
Ding dong
Looks like I have won
Now you're it
Ding dong
Pay the consequence
Ding dong
Looks like I have won
Now you're it
Ding dong
Pay the consequence
