		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pour me the liquor, fill up the vial
You're stuck in here for a little while
Hallucinations to help you drown
No one can hear you scream without a sound
No need to teach you my native tongue
Savor your brain, my favorite drug
A lucid dream, a croupy cough
You're tryin' to fall asleep but now you're falling off

I got shot in the face, now I can't move
Don't get attached, movin' too fast
You know how time moves
'Cause the demon knows my vice
Yeah, I'm see through
I got put in a trance, stole my front tooth

Stunt double
My spinal door is open for my
Stunt double
Fell off the bed, I broke my leg
Wake up, wake up

Misery loves company
I'll be back, remember me?
Cheap imitation, hypnotic touch
Invite myself inside to make your body numb

I got shot in the face, now I can't move
Don't get attached, movin' too fast
Yeah, I'm that dude
'Cause the demon know my vice
Yeah, I like boobs
How am I in Dubai? When did I move?

Stunt double
My spinal door is open for my
Stunt double
Fell off the bed, I broke my leg
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

Stunt double
My spinal door
Stunt, stunt double
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up-
