		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah (ooh)

Baby, hit that back and burp
Then pour a four of purp'
We got his and hers
Toolie in that Birkin
Close the window curtains (curtains)
Right up in your skirt (skirt)
Take off, hit the curve (curve)
Toolie in that Birkin

When I pop out, this a blicky
We roll up, we roll up sticky
The other bitties, they be shifty
I pay for my shit, ain't shit free
Take some time with me
I know how I get when I make that mine
Shawty, I'll break that spine

Roll that dice, no covers, sex on ice (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no lock and key, just beep, beep, beep up in my jeep
Baby, take off the belt of the seat
Touch-free, I brought some ones
Shawty have fun with funds
Tongue out on camera
Stretchin' out that Saint Laurent
She brought two friends, twin-twins
Casamigo killer
Fucked her off that liquor

Baby, hit that back and burp
Then pour a four of purp'
We got his and hers
Toolie in that Birkin
Close the window curtains (curtains)
Right up in your skirt (skirt)
Take off, hit the curve (curve)
Toolie in that Birkin

When I pop out, this a blicky
We roll up, we roll up sticky
The other bitties, they be shifty
I pay for my shit, ain't shit free
Take some time with me
I know how I get when I make that mine
Shawty, I'll break that spine

Toolie in that Birkin (Birkin)
You and me, I got you, that's for certain
We split a G6, it feel like surfin' (surfin')
Talkin' to that Big Guy, tryna wash out my sins (wash out my sins)
She was massagin' me (me), catered to a G (G)
I don't gotta turn up her body, she already got a physique (physique)
Left from Croatia and landed in Greece (Greece)
I took her heart off her sleeve (sleeve)
Love how you keep it a hundred
And that's really all that I need (that's all that I need, need)
I'm a big dog and she my turf
I just hope you know your worth
Baby, hit that back and burp

Baby, hit that back and burp
Then pour a four of purp'
We got his and hers
Toolie in that Birkin
Close the window curtains (curtains)
Right up in your skirt (skirt)
Take off, hit the curve (curve)
Toolie in that Birkin

When I pop out, this a blicky
We roll up, we roll up sticky
The other bitties, they be shifty
I pay for my shit, ain't shit free
Take some time with me
I know how I get when I make that mine
Shawty, I'll break that spine (Lil Uzi)

Huh, I know how I get (yeah)
I'ma break your spine, next spot
I'm gon' break your ribs (break your ribs, ayy)
Oh (yeah), you know how I live (yeah)
So just cool out, baby (baby, cool out)
I was born up in the nineties (ayy)
Swag came from the eighties (yeah, Lil Uzi)
I was sweatin' (ayy), she on fire, we hot like it's Haiti (ayy)
And you know I stay with bands on me like my name Katie (what?)
So much smoke coming out my blunt, it looked like I was vaping (yeah)
I can't share none of my drugs (ayy), know that I'm gon' face it (yeah)
Any problem that I have, you know I'm gon' face it (yeah)
Pop a Perky, Perc' in lean, and I barely taste it (yeah)

Baby, hit that back and burp (yeah)
Then pour a four of purp' (Lil Uzi)
We got his and hers
Toolie in that Birkin
Close the window curtains (curtains)
Right up in your skirt (skirt)
Take off, hit the curve (curve)
Toolie in that Birkin

When I pop out, this a blicky
We roll up, we roll up sticky
The other bitties, they be shifty
I pay for my shit, ain't shit free
Take some time with me
I know how I get when I make that mine
Shawty, I'll break that spine
