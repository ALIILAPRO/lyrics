		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is where I draw the line
Seen this war a million times
Looking for a peace of mind
Now you hate what we've become
Say the word, let's be done
There is something in the way
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again?

幸せの定義は誰にもわからない
決める必要はない
その溢れた感情が
幸せと呼べる日々を作れ

I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again?

I know, I know, I know it's not easy
You can leave here anytime
You know, you know, you know it's just not right?
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again?
