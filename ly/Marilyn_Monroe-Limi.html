		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I met you
It felt like we were one
Twin souls living worlds apart
When I loved you
Oh, it felt like the two of us
Found the world in each other's arms
I wanna be where you are
With every moment gone
The deeper we fall
Lost in a maze of thought
Waiting for a call
The distance gets heavy
With every new low
Alone in a cold bed
I miss you and you know that
I need you to come back home
Home
Yeah
So hold me like the girl you used to know
I'm your Marilyn Monroe
Trust me like you've never been hurt before
Tell me that you've never felt so sure
Mon amour, je t'adore
Love me like you'll never let me go
I wanna be the only one
You could ever love, I
Wanna be the only one
Running through your mind
All day
Like a house of cards, I give in
Set on fire, lost in your skin
When the pictures take me back again
Ooh, oh
Alone in a cold bed
I miss you and you know that
I need you to come back home
Home
Yeah
So hold me like the girl you used to know
I'm your Marilyn Monroe
Trust me like you've never been hurt before
Tell me that you've never felt so sure
Mon amour, je t'adore
Love me like you'll never let me go
