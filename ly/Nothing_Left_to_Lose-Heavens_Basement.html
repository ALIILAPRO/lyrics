		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cover your eyes, you're not ready to see this
Better to be blind than to try and resist
Say your prayers and cease and desist, We all have secrets

Everyone nods, so what's the meaning in all this
We have a choice to live and to exist
You are mark, take it again this
We don't have regrets

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Pushed close to the edge , I can't go any further
Tear me apart with mechanical murder
Ignorant bliss in a time of disorder
God save some bastards

Nightmares come and I can't open my eyes
Running from the best, I know that I can't hide
I get knocked down shout up to the sky
I've got no regrets

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out and confiscate our bones
We stand alone

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out, and confiscate our bones
We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

I know how it feels to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone in silence
How it feels with the anger and the rage
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Save up the world that we once knew
