		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion, but it wasn't hate
For once
Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along
With me
Life is moving, can't you see?
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly

But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you

I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change, but that's bullshit
They do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I found
At last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name
And it's calling yours

Girl, it's calling yours too
It's calling yours too
It's calling yours too
It's calling yours too

It's calling out for you
Arise and walk on through
The world beyond that door
Is calling out for you
Arise and walk on through
It's calling out for you
Arise and walk on through
The world beyond that door
Is calling out for you
