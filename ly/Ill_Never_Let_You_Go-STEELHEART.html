		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angel eyes
You have angel eyes
Such a smile that lights up my life oh
You're a dream come true
Now I'm holding you
And I'll never, never let you go
I will never let you go

First time I laid my eyes upon you
All my dreams were answered
First time I kissed your tender lips
My love to you I surrendered

I'll never let you go
You're always on my mind
You're the only one for me
You're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go

Angel eyes
My heart relies
On the love you give to me
You never let me down
You're always by my side
And I'll never, never let you go
I will never let you go

When my heart starts to crumble
And the tears start to fall
You hold me close with tender lovin'
And give me strength to carry on

I'll never let you go
You're always on my mind
You're the only one for me
You're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go

I'll never let you go
You're always on my mind
You're the only one for me
You're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go oh ooh
And I'll never, never let you go
