		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trust in me in all you do
Have the faith I have in you
Love will see us through
If only you trust in me

Why don't you, you trust me
Come to me when things go wrong
Cling to me daddy oh yeah and I'll be strong
We can get along, we can get along
Oh if only you trust in me

While there's a moon, a moon on high
While there are birds, a bird to fly
While there's you, a you and I
I can be sure, but I love you

Stand beside me, stand beside me all the while
Come on daddy face the future with a smile
Trust in me
And I'll be worthy of you

Oh yeah why don't you, you trust me
In all you do and all the faith that I, I have in you
Oh and love will see us through
If only you trust in me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Why don't you, you come to me when things go wrong
Cling to me oh and I'll be strong
We can get along, we can get along
Oh if only you trust in me, yeah
