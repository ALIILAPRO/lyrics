		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fought until the sun rose
And I still ain't been to bed (bed, bed)
And while you got your eyes closed
The devil wakes up in my (head, head)
He told me that you hate me
And you blame me
And you said that you wish that you were dead
So I write a little note out
Suicidal love roulette

You make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
I'd rather a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
Just like a fool
Just like a fool

I walk up to the edge, yeah
And say a prayer before I let go (let go, let go)
I'll probably see you through the window
While I'm falling past the fifth floor (fifth floor, fifth floor)
Then you get there just in time
To save me and apologize
And maybe we can go back to bed
But you run past me instead
And hit the ground before I can

I had to watch you
Jump off the roof
Boy, I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
Just like a fool

Maybe Buddha's got it right
We reincarnate every time
And I'll find you in another life
Maybe Buddha's got it right
We reincarnate every time
And I'll find you in another life

I don't really wanna fight (nah)
I just wanna spend the night (yeah)
But I don't wanna spend the night
Actin' out, "Love the way you lie"
But this shit just went awry
Hit me in the eye, bit me in the thigh, then begin to cry
I'm at the end of my wits
Let's end this, ma (it's over)
Then begin again tomorrow
Fresh start, let you spoil me
Pledge your loyalty, treat me like a king 
Just to (royalty), fuck me over royally
Boy, are we water mixed with oil
See another shouting match
'Bout to have it out
But no matter how, mad I get
I'm so mad about you
Forgot what I was even mad about ('bout)
I know we've had our challenges still (still)
I keep trying to salvage it you (you)
Wanna sabotage it, I'm down to the hill
But you think I'm fucking around on you, chill (chill)
It never changes, I doubt if it will (will)
Cheat on me then say how does it feel? (feel)
I feel like blowing my fucking head off
After I write you out of my will (will)
Bitch how could you? (huh?)
Almost had a child with you
Would've settled down with you
Now put you in the ground and bury myself with you
I don't get you, it's as if you're drowning
I stick my hand out, but you fool me
You're just trying to pull me down with you (down with you)
Thought it was you my world revolve around ('round)
I should aim a revolver round at you (at you)
180 proof, as I'm making my way to the roof (roof)
You're a traitor I say that we're through (through)
You hop in the elevator then you
Say the coffin they better make it for two (two)
'Cause if you jump I'm jumpin' with you (you)
And neither one of us have nothin' to lose
But each other we're just a couple of fools

'Cause you make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool

You make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
Just like a fool
Just like a fool
