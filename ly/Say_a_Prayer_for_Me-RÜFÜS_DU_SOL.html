		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say a prayer for me
Let my body sleep tonight
You were there for me, girl
Standing by my side
Turn the page for me
I'll see you on the other side
Know that, there's a place for me, girl
Alright

Say a prayer for me
Would you do it? I could use it
Say goodbye for me
I'm moving, alright
Say a prayer for me
Would you do it? I could use it
Say goodbye for me
It's time, alright

Say a prayer for me
Give me love and peace of mind
Leave me gracefully, girl
I pay my debts tonight
Time has come for you
To place your hand in mine
Know that, there's a place for me, girl
Alright

I'll take you further
I'll take you further down tonight
I'll take you further
Further

I'll take you further
I'll take you further down tonight
I'll take you further
Further

I'll take you further
I'll take you further down tonight
I'll take you further
Further

Say a prayer for me
Would you do it? I could use it
Say goodbye for me
I'm moving, alright
Say a prayer for me
Would you do it? I could use it
Say goodbye for me
It's time, alright

Alright
Alright
