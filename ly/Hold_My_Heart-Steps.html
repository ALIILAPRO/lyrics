		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We went through heaven to hell
We know it all too well
We couldn't figure us out
And that's what we're all about

What we don't understand
To breathe we need a hand

'Cause every single time you hold my heart
I give up, I give up
Forget about how we've been set apart
I give up, I will not
Surrender to the world that knocked us down
No, I don't mind to leave it all right now
'Cause every single time you hold my heart
I give up, I give up

(Hmm-mmm)

I sail a cloud 'round the globe
Can't even reach you by phone
No, nothing's ever enough
Yeah, as long as we're not in touch

What we don't understand
To breathe we need a hand

'Cause every single time you hold my heart
I give up, I give up
Forget about how we've been set apart
I give up, I will not
Surrender to the world that knocked us down
No, I don't mind to leave it all right now
'Cause every single time you hold my heart
I give up, I give up

Baby, I know that what we have is true (ah-ah)
See, nothing matters if I ain't got you (ah-ah) 
And you should know that all the things I do (ah-ah)
I do it all for you (ah-ah)
And it's all for you (ah-ah)

'Cause every single time you hold my heart
Forget about how we've been set apart
I give up, I give up
Surrender to the world that knocked us down
No, I don't mind to leave it all right now
'Cause every single time you hold my heart (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I give up, (I give up)

'Cause every single time you hold my heart
I give up, I give up
Forget about how we've been set apart
I give up, I will not
Surrender to the world that knocked us down (down)
No, I don't mind to leave it all right now
'Cause every single time you hold my heart
I give up, I give up

Ooh
