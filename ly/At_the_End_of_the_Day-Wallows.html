		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please lay your head here on my shoulder
The night is young, but we're still getting older
Can you see ourselves in love like this forever?
Or are you afraid that's too much pressure?

At the end of the day, I'm not far away, I'm staying
A face in the crowd and you're not around, it's fading
If you wanted I would never call you (ooh)
Never think about you, never let you go (ooh)
But at the end of the day, are we on our way, breaking

There's a place you used to take me almost twice a week
And at first you made me nervous, I could hardly speak
I don't really think about it anymore
Is that a problem or just something to ignore?
Time on my hands
Falling like sand
Just take it back if you need an escape plan

At the end of the day, I'm not far away, I'm staying
A face in the crowd and you're not around, it's fading
If you wanted I would never call you (ooh)
Never think about you, never let you go (ooh)
But at the end of the day, are we on our way, I'm breaking

Please just see
That you are not alone, you are not alone
I'll never let you go, unless you want me to
Your words could never be criminal
My love's subliminal
Oh, you know
That if it's day or night, if it's day or night
When I look in your eyes, forever sounds alright
Don't blame yourself if they look away
Why fuck with fate 'cause

At the end of the day, I'm not far away, I'm staying
A face in the crowd and you're not around, it's fading
If you wanted I would never call you
Never think about you, never let you go
But at the end of the day, are we on our way, breaking
