		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, watching this weak ass, fake ass Fast and Furious
Oh (oh), yeah
Oh
Uh

Fill my lungs with ganja (ganja)
When they fill my brain with drama (drama)
From my past, I have all this trauma (trauma)
Gettin' cash, hope the racks solve my problems
But it don't work, uh, no, it won't work out (work out, yes)
But it don't work, no, it won't work out (yes)
Yeah, it don't work, now the pain's worse (pain's worse)
Yeah, it's gon' hurt (gon' hurt)
Hope it all works out (all works out)

Um, I'm stuck in my head too much (I'm stuck in my)
I'm stuck in my head, um (head, um)
I'm stuck in my head too much (I'm stuck in my)

Tryna see where I fell from (fell from)
Feels like I'm in hell, um
Shibuya to Belgium
Yeah, I seen it all
Came a long way, walkin' limp from a crawl

Um, I'm trapped in my head too much (my head)
I'm trapped in my head (my head)
Um, I'm stuck in my head too much (my head)

They wonder why I get high as fuck
They wonder why I get high so much
Um, it's because
Um, I'm trapped in my head too much
I'm trapped in my head (my head, in my head)

Fill my lungs with ganja (ganja)
When they fill my brain with drama (drama)
From my past, I have all this trauma (trauma)
Gettin' cash, hope the racks solve my problems
But it don't work, uh, no, it won't work out (work out, yes)
But it don't work, no, it won't work out (yes)
Yeah, it don't work, now the pain's worse (pain's worse)
Yeah, it's gon' hurt (gon' hurt)
Hope it all works out (all works out)

Broken machine, no, it won't work (won't work)
But I get cash, so she gon' twerk (yeah)
Heartbreak Hotel (yeah), leave a ho hurt (oh, yeah)
'Cause I been hurt (yeah), had a hole first (oh, yeah)
In my chest, it made my life lifeless
Like God, how could this happen?
Losing my traction (losing my traction)

Um, I'm stuck in my head too much (much)
I'm stuck in my head (head, um)
Um, I'm trapped and I can't run (I'm trapped and I can't run)
In my head, um

Fill my lungs with ganja (ganja)
When they fill my brain with drama (drama)
From my past, I have all this trauma (trauma)
Gettin' cash, hope the racks solve my problems
But it don't work, uh, no, it won't work out (work out, yes)
But it don't work, no, it won't work out (yes)
Yeah, it don't work, now the pain's worse (pain's worse)
Yeah, it's gon' hurt (gon' hurt)
Hope it all works out (all works out)
