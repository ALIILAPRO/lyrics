		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it true?
You've been feelin' sort of low these days
Just don't have a place to go these days
Must be bringin' you down
If it's so
Then come on, give this loverboy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

Well, for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

Is it wrong
To think my love could really help you out?
It's simply just my stubborn heart, no doubt
Rambling away
If it's not
Then come on, give this loverboy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

Well, for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do
For one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

Oh
Ah
