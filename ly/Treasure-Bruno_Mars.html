		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Baby squirrel, you's a sexy motherfucker)

Give me your, give me your, give me your attention, baby (attention, baby)
I got to tell you a little something about yourself (self)
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you a sexy lady (sexy lady)
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else (else)

(Oh, oh) I know that you don't know it
But you're fine, so fine (fine, so fine)
(Oh, oh) oh, girl I'm gonna show you
When you're mine, oh, mine (mine, oh, mine)

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Oh, oh, oh

Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl
You should be smiling (you should be smiling)
A girl like you should never look so blue (blue)
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true (true)

(Oh, oh) I know that you don't know it
But you're fine, so fine (fine, so fine)
(Oh, oh) oh girl I'm gonna show you
When you're mine, oh mine (mine, oh mine)

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure
Oh, oh, oh

You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you, you, you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you, you, you, you are

Treasure, that is what you are (you are my treasure)
Honey, you're my golden star (you are my treasure)
You know you can make my wish come true (you are my treasure)
If you let me treasure you (you are my treasure)
If you let me treasure you (you are my treasure)
Oh, oh, oh
