		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Worried that I'll be one phone call too late
Fear's turning years of love into hate
Empty attempts when we meet in my sleep
Embarrassed for caring 10 fathoms too deep
Why do I still feel like I should be sorry?
Droplets of thought keep on causing tsunamis
Now I'm a reminder of your locked-up past
Overthinking for over-loving you too fast
Stars above us, lying closely
Promising me I will never be lonely
Talking bout loving me every tomorrow
Man of your word but there's nothing to follow
Sometimes I wish I could just call you
Sometimes I wish I could stop falling
Sometimes I wish you could just hold me
Oh, Sometimes I wish I could just call you
Sometimes I wish I could stop falling
Sometimes I wish you could just hold me
But right now I wish I never loved you
Someday you will be one phone call too late
You should know how it feels when fates suddenly change
Floating away in your oceans of liquor
Blaming yourself for the things that you didn't
Yet consciously burying me in the distance
In a blink of an eye pain ceased your existence
Maybe I lost you but you lost yourself first
Now I'm stuck between trying and letting you go
Each encounter's getting harder
I'd give up years to relive seconds of summer
Eyes are useless when the mind is blind
I sold my sight to the mind of a gemini
Sometimes I wish I could just call you
Sometimes I wish I could stop falling
Sometimes I wish you could just hold me
Oh, Sometimes I wish I could just call you
Sometimes I wish I could stop falling
Sometimes I wish you could just hold me
But right now I wish I never loved you
Until you're ready
To share pieces and parts of your heart that were taken away from you
Until then I choose to separate myself from you
Still hearing your name has me gasping for air
Finding someone who'll stick around is apparently rare
You taught me friendships cause heartbreaks too
Hope you're fulfilled by the things you chose to do, chose to do
