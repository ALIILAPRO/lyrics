		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me to a place where I can just break free
And forget the fears I've been facing
Find my wings and I will be chasing
All the highs in my dreams

Take me to a place where I can just break free
And forget the fears I've been facing
Find my wings and I will be chasing
All the highs in my dreams

Take me to a place where I can just break free
And forget the fears I've been facing
Find my wings and I will be chasing
All the highs in my dreams

All the highs in my dreams

Late at night
I'm thinking 'bout the demons that I have to fight
So I can change myself and fly
Everytime I'm going blind
Still here waiting for a sign
Let me know where to go

Take me to a place where I can just break free
And forget the fears I've been facing
Find my wings and I will be chasing
All the highs in my dreams

Take me to a place where I can just break free
And forget the fears I've been facing
Find my wings and I will be chasing
All the highs in my dreams
