		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I made a grave mistake 
When I let you in my space
But I won't be picking peddles I am not one to replace

I'm done as hell with your shit
You can try that with a new bitch 
Shuffles on the pavement 
Pack it up like you ain't through with it 


I can give a damn less about your intentions
Baby it's the impact look how you left us
I can give a damn less, you did the damage 
I hope you vanish, i hope you


cnd i didn't expect this shit to be so light 
Now i'm living with your mistakes i'm up all night 
the way you play around in my face it ain't alright 
From cradle to the grave now 

tryna sell a dream I can't afford (what)
standing here with one foot out the door (you outta your mind)
Betrayed me, why you play the victim for? (Look how your crying)



I can give a damn less about your intentions
Baby it's the impact look how you left us
I can give a damn less, you did the damage 
I hope you vanish, i hope you vanish (x2) 

I'm so over u and how you're movin
show me who you were when you were choosing 


I can't give a damn less
You the one that took advantage 
Why you so fuckin careless 

I can give a damn less (I can give a damn less)
Baby it's the impact 
(look how you left us)
I can't give a damn less
you did the damage 
I hope you vanish, i hope you
