		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Takers of humanity, elders paranoid
The time is now
Give up this world you once destroyed
Society versus the underground
Their battles fought and lost
The time has come
To rule the world at any cost

For the past it's too late
Cause the world can't control fate
Shadows cast loud and clear
Tell the world the new order's here

Cities turn to battlefields
A deadly spell is cast
Corpses falling one by one
Until the last
The preacher speaks of prophecy
So many years before
No one escapes their punishment
The gods of war

For the past it's too late
Cause the world can't control fate
Shadows cast loud and clear
Tell the world the new order's here

[Guitar Solo]

Death is like an empty space
Fell no thoughts of fear
The future cries
As mother nature sheds a tear
The world becomes a prisoner
A victim of its crime
The human race is now a race
Against time

For the past it's too late
Cause the world can't control fate
Shadows cast loud and clear
Tell the world the new order's here
