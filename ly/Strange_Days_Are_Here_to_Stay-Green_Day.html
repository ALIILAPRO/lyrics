		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We stumble down the avenue
Like fairy dust, and ballyhoo
They promised us forever
But we got less

There's no such thing as promises
Just secret codes from alphabets
They promised us forever
But we got less

These are the best of times
Twisted and borrowed times
These are the loneliest of times

Strange days are here to stay
Ever since Bowie died
It hasn't been the same
All the madmen are going mental
Grandma's on the fentanyl now
Strange days are here to stay

This is how the world will end
When superheroes play pretend
They promised us forever
But we got less

It's the return of the blob
And Jesus is gonna quit his job
He promised us forever
But we got less

These are the best of times
Twisted and borrowed times
These are the loneliest of times

Strange days are here to stay
Everyone is racist
And the Uber driver is running late
I just lost my sense of humor
Gen-z killing, baby boomer now
Strange days are here to stay

Lonely boy
With a heart made of hate
Baby Babylon
And making guns out of clay

Are we in hell?
Or is this just a fantasy
I can't see this ending well
Now it's too late

Strange days are here to stay
Ever since Bowie died
It hasn't been the same
All the madmen are going mental
Grandma's on the fentanyl now
Strange days are here to stay

Strange days are here to stay
