		  Hey, uh
What's up?
Just calling to see if you're still up
But straight to voicemail, uh
Yeah, no biggie, um
If you're up or whatever, just, just hit me up

Why you calling 3 AM
My head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is
Have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time

Either way, I'm gonna lose
But I just wanna give
I can't stop starin' at it
I just can't resist

I'm floatin' away, keep floatin' away
Floatin' away, floatin' away
I'm floatin' away, keep floatin' away
Floatin' away, floatin' away

Now you're calling, 3 AM
My head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is
Have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time

(What are you doing?)
You and I don't have to meet
But it's fun to think we could
On the screen and in my jeans
Just make me feel good

I'm floatin' away, keep floatin' away
I'm floatin' away, floatin' away
I'm floatin' away, keep floatin' away
Floatin' away, keep floatin' away

Now you're calling, 3 AM
My head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is
Have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time

It's 3 AM
(Hey, what's up?) Now you're calling, 3 AM
(Hi, I promised myself I wouldn't call again, but, uh) now you're calling
(Just lookin' through all these photos on my phone) now you're calling, 3 AM
Now you're calling, 3 AM
