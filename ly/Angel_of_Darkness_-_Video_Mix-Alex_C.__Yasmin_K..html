		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angel of Darkness
Angel of Darkness
The world is in your hand
But I will fight until the end

Angel of Darkness
Angel of Darkness
Don't follow your command
But I will fight and I will stand

When darkness falls pain is all
The Angel of Darkness
Will leave behind and I will fight

The love is lost
Beauty and light
Have vanished from garden of delight
The dreams are gone
Midnight has come
The darkness is our new kingdom

Angel of Darkness
Angel of Darkness
The world is in your hand
But I will fight until the end

Angel of Darkness
Angel of Darkness
Don't follow your command
But I will fight and I will stand

Hunt goes on deep in the night
Time to pray down on your knees
You can't hide from me
Etern the light
Until my last breath I will fight
(I will fight, I will fight, I will fight, I will fight)

Now realize
The stars they die
Darkness has fallen in paradise
But we'll be strong
And we will fight
Against the creatures of the night

Angel of Darkness
Angel of Darkness
The world is in your hand
But I will fight until the end

Angel of Darkness
Angel of Darkness
Don't follow your command
But I will fight and I will stand
