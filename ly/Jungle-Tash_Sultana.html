		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the way you move
It's fluid
Be here by my side
Got nothing to hide

I know that you're hurting
I see the tears behind those eyes
And I can't wipe them clear
Your love is like gold to me
But you hold me closer to the light
With the final bullet inside
Oh, I'm surrounded by

But you throw me into the deep end
Expect me to know how to swim
And I put my faith in someone else
'Cause I will be just fine

Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes and see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Well, hold on, well, hold on

Suit and tie with the black jeans on and I'm paralyzed
'Cause I think you got something like the biggest soul I've ever seen
And I think you're the one
Suit and tie, with the curly hair making your way with that step and stare
So tell me real, do you feel anything

Ashes to ashes
And the embers are ablaze
Oh, I gotta rise among you, though then I think about your face every day

But you pull me closer to the light
You wouldn't find a bullet inside
Only if you magnify

Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes and see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Well hold on, well hold on
