		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Can't believe that I found my sunshine

Hey
Everyone's tryin' to be the same, yeah
Until I met you I was on that wave
But you really on somethin' different
You do you, it must be nice
And I think it's rubbin' off on me

Oh yeah, step to the left, step to the right, do what you want
What really matters is the journey that we're on
Yeah, riding with you, I finally know where I belong
I belong

You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Can't believe that I found my sunshine

Oh, uh, I was feeling so invisible, yeah
I didn't know this could be possible (no)
Alright, but you really on somethin' different
You do you, just work it out
And I think it's rubbin' off on me

Oh yeah, step to the left, step to the right, do what you want
What really matters is the journey that we're on
Yeah, riding with you, I finally know where I belong
I belong

You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Can't believe that I found my sunshine
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Pullin' me out, never lettin' me down
And I wanna make sure you know it
You're like a sunshine, only givin' good vibes
Any, any time that you roll in
Can't believe that I found my sunshine

You're my sunshine
Only good vibes
You're my sunshine
Sunshine
