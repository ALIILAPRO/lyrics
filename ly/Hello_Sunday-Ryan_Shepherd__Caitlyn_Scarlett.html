		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Perfect morning, I’ve been waiting for ya
I’ve been reaching, I’ve been living for your love
Hello Sunday
I’ve been waiting for your light
I’ve been waiting for your light, all my life

Don’t mind the banging on the walls
You better go ahead and focus on yourself, ya
You can have anything you want
You better go ahead and focus on yourself

And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself

Hello Sunday, day, day, day
Day, day, day, day
Day, day, day, day
Day, day, day, day

Hello Sunday day, day, day
Day, day, day, day
Day, day, day, day
Day, day, day, day
Hello Sunday day, day, day
Day, day, day, day
Day, day, day, day
Day, day, day, day

Don’t mind the banging on the walls
You better go ahead and focus on yourself, ya
You can have anything you want
You better go ahead and focus on yourself

Perfect morning, I’ve been waiting for ya
I’ve been reaching, I’ve been living for your love
Hello Sunday
I’ve been waiting for your light
I’ve been waiting for your light, all my life

Don’t mind the banging on the walls
You better go ahead and focus on yourself, ya
You can have anything you want
You better go ahead and focus on yourself

And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself
And focus on yourself

Hello Sunday, day, day, day

You better go ahead and focus on yourself, ya
You can have anything you want
You better go ahead and focus on yourself

Don’t mind the banging on the walls
You better go ahead and focus on yourself, ya
You can have anything you want
You better go ahead and focus on yourself
