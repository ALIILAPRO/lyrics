		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be hostile
I don't want to be dismal
And I don't want to rot in an apathetic existence
See I want to believe you
And I wanted to trust you
And I want to have faith to put away the dagger

But you lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
And I tolerate you

You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
I cannot tolerate

Veil of virtue hung to hide your method
While I smile and laugh and dance
And sing your praise and glory
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
As I smile and laugh and dance
And sing your glory

While you lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
How can I tolerate you?

You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
I cannot tolerate

Our guilt, our blame
I've been far too sympathetic
Our blood, our fault
I've been far too sympathetic
I am not innocent
I am not innocent
You are not innocent
No one is innocent

You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
I cannot tolerate

I will not longer tolerate you
I will grow down inside you
I must go down beside you
No one is innocent
