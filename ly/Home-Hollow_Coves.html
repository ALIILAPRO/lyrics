		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a wide ocean and a tight emotion
And our homes are chosen, yet still we're all broken
It's been a while now since that old town
Down by the water picking stones from the ground

Take me home
To the friends I've always known
Take me home
Back to the place where I belong

That distant coast line
What peaks insight
Washed away with that ocean's tide
Need to slow down and look around
Not that far from that place we call home

Take me home
To the friends I've always known
Take me home
Back to the place where I belong

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
