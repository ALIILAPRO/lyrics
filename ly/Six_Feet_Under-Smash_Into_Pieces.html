		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm six feet under
Like I'm buried alive
We're so game over
But we keep holding the line

You fight me and I fight back
And when you come back
We get up and we do it again
I'm turning to a shadow, I can't let go
Though it's wrong, I don't want it to end

Better safe than sorry
Better safe than sorry
Felt so right now what are we?
So turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

We're on the edge
We're miles apart
And I'm six feet under
Diggin' down my heart
We're on the edge
We keep falling down
'Til I'm six feet under
Diggin' down my heart

'Til I'm six feet under
'Til I'm six feet under
'Til I'm six feet under

We're in a maze now
Playing arcade and I'm lost 
Counting our days now
I'm in a straight jacket no matter the cost

You fight me and I fight back
And when you come back
We get up and we do it again
I'm turning to a shadow
I can't let go
Though it's wrong, I don't want it to end

Better safe than sorry
Better safe than sorry
Felt so right now what are we?
So turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

We're on the edge
We're miles apart
And I'm six feet under
Diggin' down my heart
We're on the edge
We keep falling down
'Til I'm six feet under
Diggin' down my heart

'Til I'm six feet under
'Til I'm six feet under

We're on the edge
We're miles apart
And I'm six feet under

We're on the edge
We're miles apart
And I'm six feet under
Diggin' down my heart
We're on the edge
We keep falling down (keep falling down)
'Til I'm six feet under
Diggin' down my heart

'Til I'm six feet under
'Til I'm six feet under
'Til I'm six feet under
