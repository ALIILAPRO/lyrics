		<p>
		  Stircrazy, slaphappy
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Stircrazy, slaphappy
I been losing my mind
Got frenemies
Tryna fuck with me
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Hahahahaha
All these bitches tryna be friends with me
They be boring as hell it's hereditary
Same old house moms at the supermarket
Same old boys smoking trees in the Honda
All the uggs and the low rise denim shorts
Make me feel out of place it's uncomfortable
They all watch me crumble like cereal
Babe these are the reasons I gotta go
Stircrazy, slaphappy
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Stircrazy, slaphappy
I been losing my mind
Got frenemies
Tryna fuck with me
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Hahahahaha
In this town it's not cool to be different
So I look up other towns on the internet
Fantasize bout a life with no limits
God damn why am I such a misfit
I'm playing stadium in the shower, yeah
You should hear the audience shouting, yeah
I gotta go be cool but it won't be here
Stircrazy, slaphappy
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Stircrazy, slaphappy
I been losing my mind
Got frenemies
Tryna fuck with me
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Hahahahaha
Stircrazy, slaphappy
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Stircrazy, slaphappy
I been losing my mind
Got frenemies
Tryna fuck with me
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Hahahahaha
Stircrazy, slaphappy
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Stircrazy, slaphappy
I been losing my mind
Got frenemies
Tryna fuck with me
All I'm doing is hahahahaha
Hahahahaha
