		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See if I say I love you
will you think it's too soon?
(unless the king has entered
sooner isn't better yeah, yeah)

See if I say I love you
will you think it's too soon?
(unless the king has entered
sooner isn't better yeah, yeah)

See if I say I love you
baby don't change,
no I don't want nothing new
please stay the same

The same as in the girl that you have always been with me,
tryna get this off my mind with ease
please don't you change cause I just said that,
no I ain't got nothing left to take back, yeah

See if I say I love you
will you think it's too soon?
(unless the king has entered
sooner isn't better yeah, yeah)

See if I say I love you
baby don't change,
no I don't want nothing new
please stay the same

I know there's no rush in telling you that I'm falling
I won't think you don't care if you don't say it back like you owe me
I don't need you to reciprocate
I'm asking, asking that you stay the same,
lowe me my affection,
no I just can't help it,
I just wanna ask if

See if I say I love you
will you think it's too soon?
(unless the king has entered
sooner isn't better yeah, yeah)

See if I say I love you
will you think it's too soon?
(unless the king has entered
sooner isn't better yeah, yeah)
