		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First thang first, baby girl let's get acquainted
My name Gucci Mane, baby tell me what you dranking
Devil wears a lane, you don't got no super cane
My name Gucci Mane and baby girl that's just a name
Tell me who you came with and the reason that you came
You don't need to be here baby you should be ashamed
Baby let me help you, I'll be your shelter in the rain
Let me be your doctor tell me where you feeling pain
I can be your pill baby, I can keep you sane
And I can be your whiplers, I can whip you off the chain
I know you hurt, I grew up and my boys we off the chain
I'm the boss and spilling sauce
'Cause Gucci don't know how to sang

I'm in this point of my life, and put a part of my life
I'm in this part of my life, that I don't really have time
Come at this point of my life, girl would you set me aside
I'm at the point of my life, I'm having sex with your mind

It's a lot of hustlers pour the water, from coast to coast
Put your glasses in the air, I propose a toast
Grab the pretty girl that you love the most
Ladies grab your boyfriend, baby hold him close
I got a girl flowing 'that she love me most
Got another girl and she love my boat
Got another girl to sell my dope
Got another girl off to buy me clothes
But ain't you babe, now that ain't you babe
It's just someone I can do it then do you babe
See it ain't you babe, it's me and you babe
And there ain't nothing else I can do but be with you, babe

I'm in this point of my life, and put a part of my life
I'm in this part of my life, that I don't really have time
Come at this point of my life, girl would you set me aside
I'm at the point of my life, I'm having sex with your mind.
