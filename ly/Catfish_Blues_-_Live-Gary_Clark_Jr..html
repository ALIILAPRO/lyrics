		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I wish
I was a catfish
Swimmin in a oh, deep, blue sea
I would have all you good lookin women,
Fishin after me, fishin after me, fishin after me yeah

Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry
Well, I'm Ragged and I'm dirty too
If I clean up now, tomorrow
Can I come home with you
Come home with you, yeah
Come home with you

Well, I love
Well, I love my baby
Yeah, she's gone, scream and shout
When my train comes rollin' in
And I come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Come walkin' out

Well, I love
But I'm leavin' you baby
Yeah, your crying won't make me stay
Well, the more you cry, lil' Momma
Further I'll go away
Further I'll go away
Further I'll go away

And I know, well I know you don't want me
But I wanted you darlin'
You told me so
When you ain't got a word well, I'll be there
Hangin' round' no more
Hangin' round' no more
Hangin' round' no more
Hangin' round' no more
Hangin' round' no more
Hangin' round' no more
