		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked into the room
I saw things I'd never seen
The world was different then
We were so young

But oh, how we change
Our lives
They can sometimes seem so strange
How could you do this
We were so young

Hold on
I wish that you had held on
I wish that I had been the one
To help you hold on

Asleep in the bath
You watched the New Year passing by
The fireworks in your hands
You never questioned why

But oh, tired, weary
This life can sometimes seem
How could you do this
You were so young

Hold on
I wish that you had held on
I wish that I had been the one
To help you hold on

Hold on
I wish that you had held on
I wish that I had been the one
To help you hold on

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on…

I wish that you had held on, and on, and on, and on…

Hold on…
