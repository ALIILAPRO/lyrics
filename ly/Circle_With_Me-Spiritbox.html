		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours
Cut down the altar

Visionare and deepest fake
Dirty gold, the colors change
Hands are frozen, feel no pain
I just want to hold the flame

Negative feedback loop
I'm spinning out of control
The sickly sweetness is crushing me
But I want to know
If there's no heat when I escalate the fire is cold
They echo, "This could all be yours"

Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame

Nothing sacred, nothing lost
When birds of prey invade my thoughts
They promise I will feel the pain
Not strong enough to hold the flame

Negative feedback loop
I'm spinning out of control
The sickly sweetness is crushing me
But I want to know
If there's no heat when I escalate the fire is cold
They echo, "This could all be yours"

Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame

I held the power of a dying sun
I climb the altar and I claim my place as God
Circle with me
Circle with me
This could all be yours

Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame

Feel the weight of a martyr
A traitor watching me as birds of prey never falter
This could all be yours
This could all be yours

Circle with me
