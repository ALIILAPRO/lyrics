		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you seen
the moment your heart breaks
completely in the past?
Have you heard
the cry of your soul?
I've never done it before
I threw away
everything I had behind
Anything and everything
Pain, fear, and loneliness
I don't know anything
Starry sky and kindness
Memory and promise with you
Taking lie, hatred,
and everything you have,
I just, I just keep running
Burn away, burn away everything
Your past, your dream,
your memory
You burn them away like a sunset
That is burning red
Burn away, burn away even tears
Your future, your love,
your hate
You don't have to be afraid
Only you can do is
just to keep running

All living things
Everything is shining bright
There's nothing useless
Before it is too late,
You just, you just keep running
Burn away, burn away everything
Your past, your dream,
your memory
You burn them away like a sunset
That is burning red
Burn away, burn away everything
Burn away, burn away
your sadness
This is not the time to cry
Live strong
Live strong
You just keep running
