		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Skinny little skater boys
They only wanna play
They jump around all day
But you can never make them stay
Pretty girls in overalls
Are everywhere these days
Talking up their game but they only go away

All of this to say it's just an ordinary day

Little birds might sing to you
As if they were your friend
But don't be fooled again
They only want what's in your hand
Couple with the silver hair
Kissing on the bench falling in love again
Guess it never ends

All of this to say it's just an ordinary day
All the world to stay on an ordinary day
