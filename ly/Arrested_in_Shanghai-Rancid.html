		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah?
They were sure I was guilty, but I committed no crime
They said: confessions bring lenience, so that put me on the line
So I, protest the massacres at the Talliman Square
My friends say yo, stay away man, you better not go fucking back there
Oh.
Watch this
One night I might write about my opinions about the state
And the freedom of expression they would never tolerate
And the, military secrets that I never did steal
I didn't start no violence, no, and there was nobody that I killed
No.
So I had a clear account of all abusers of power
And the memories of homeland all gone sour
And I only got one weapon, it's so plain for me to see
My only weapon I call, poetry

And I don't even know why
The truth seems like a lie
In my cell there is no sky
When I was arrested in Shanghai

Now, in a world of privilege I was not born
But, the devotion of freedom and liberty I was sworn
So, every emotion is studied, watched their control
Who gets paid, who gets disciplined, who gets born
So, transmitting beams my coordinates, anywhere on Earth
And, as radio waves, surveillance, satellite bursts
Open up your skull and let some knowledge come in
Yeah, crack open the cranium and let awareness begin
Oh.

And I don't even know why
The truth seems like a lie
In my cell there is no sky
When I was arrested in Shanghai
When I was arrested in Shanghai
When I was arrested in Shanghai
Woo!
