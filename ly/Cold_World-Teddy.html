		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
I don't wanna let you go
'Cause this world’s so cold
And my thoughts so froze
Faded off the forty, tell my friends I'll be alright
Codeine and I overdose
Slippin' and I let you fall
I been faded, up for two damn nights
Got my mind fucked up, I been losing sight

[Verse 1]
So we pray that we'll see another day
And she don't say why she calling out my name
Feel no pain, left my heart cold in the rain
And so we pray that these pills will ease our pain

[Chorus]
I don't wanna let you go
'Cause this world’s so cold
And my thoughts so froze
Faded off the forty, tell my friends I'll be alright
Codeine and I overdose
Slippin' and I let you fall
I been faded, up for two damn nights
Got my mind fucked up, I been losing sight


[Verse 2]
Yellow brick roads but the skies are blue
Someone sold my soul and I got back two
My eyes go gold when I look at you
And my heart so cold but I'll break through
Seasons come and seasons change
I see red when I see your name
You can break the curse but it ain’t the same
Devil call me, laughing, say he left no trace

[Chorus]
I don't wanna let you go
'Cause this world’s so cold
And my thoughts so froze
Faded off the forty, tell my friends I'll be alright
Codeine and I overdose
Slippin' and I let you fall
I been faded, up for two damn nights
Got my mind fucked up, I been losing sight
