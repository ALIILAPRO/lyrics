		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moon shines bright 
And the stars give a light
In a little while it will be day 
The voice of love it calls upon us all
And bids us awake and pray

Rise, arise wake thee arise
Life she is calling thee
For it might be the mothering of your sweet soul
If you open your eyes and see

That the life of a man it comes with little plan 
It flourishes like a flower
As tender in the heart into which you're born
So cherish your every hour

For the summertime has come
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Will you go, lassie go,
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain Thymethyme
All around the blooming heather

For our time is not long
Time's an old folk song
No longer can we stay
Those that remember say
Blessed are you all
Who make it through this brawl
Long life and another good year
Blessed are you all
Who answer to the call
Long life and another good year
Long life and another good year

The moon shines bright 
And the stars will be our height
Life she is calling thee
Rise, arise wake thee arise
And ever more watchful be

From the singing of Freda Black and others
