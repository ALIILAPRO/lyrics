		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With lips closed and eyes sealed
You're sculpture with a pulse
I wanna capture your essence and keep it here forever little one
And I feel good about you not telling anyone

You'll just lie motionless, emotionless
You're beautiful asleep
Motionless
Emotionless
You're beautiful asleep

You'll feel nothing as I send your soul away
How long will you last
And how long will you stay
As guilty as I feel, I'm making you beautiful forever
Until you rot away to nothing
We'll be perfect here together
I feel good about you not telling
I feel good about you

You'll just lie motionless, emotionless
You're beautiful asleep
You're just lie motionless, emotionless
You're beautiful asleep

'Cause you're falling apart
'Cause you're falling apart
At your seams

You are falling apart
You are falling apart

You'll just lie motionless, emotionless
You're beautiful asleep
You'll just lie motionless, emotionless
You're beautiful asleep
You'll just lie motionless, emotionless
You're beautiful asleep
You'll just lie motionless, emotionless
Disgusting now I see

You're falling apart at your seams
