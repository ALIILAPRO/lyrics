		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If looks could kill 

Baby, I'm the fashion demon 
Ridin' down Candler Road and I'm speedin'
I got hella hoes tryna fuck me and my bros (my bros)
I got hella shows lined up, I'm on the road (on the road)
I get hella green, yeah, I get hella 'chos (hella 'chos)
These niggas green as fuck, I'm 'bout to get over (get over)
No, bitch, I'm not greenin' out, you can not get over (can't get over)
I just like to ball hard, ball like Dellavedova (Dellavedova)
Don't shop at Dover's, don't shop at Nieman's (nah, nah)
Don't commit treason (nah)
Everything I do is for a reason 
Everything I do is so strategic (is so strategic)
Baby, please don't leave me, I don't need you
And I know that you don't need me
I done got the flyest, I'm on a date with the moon this evening 
She act cool but I know she evil, so deceiving (so deceiving)
If looks could kill that makes every day Halloween, man (it's Halloween)

I get bitches, I don't need no wingman (no wingman)
I get riches, I don't sell no weed, man (not right now)
I smoke dope by the pound, yeah, for real, huh
I'm on the top of the mountain, king of the hill, uh (we top floor)
I don't like no Swisher, I like Grabba Leaf, lil' nigga (grabba, grabba, grabba)
Real deal codeine sipper, walk 'round with a purple liver, huh
I'm a fashion killer, I'm a shit popper, babe (shit popper, popper)
I'm a real big baller but won't let no lil' bitch play with me
I'm a pussy killer after I hit it, might let her lay with me 
She a fashion killer, check out how she walkin'
Yeah, look, she slayin' it
My boy got a trigger finger 
He ready to pull it, so please don't play with him
I smoke 'til my lungs black, lil' bitch
I take that lil' blunt and I face that shit (face it)
I look at my demons and face 'em (face 'em)
Take the Chrome Heart Timbs and I lace 'em 
I'm walkin' through Hell
I got an FN loaded up with a laser 
My bitch rockin' Chanel, I put on Balenciaga for all of my haters
I gotta go, bitch, I'll see you later (go)
I'm the Dark Lord, real soul taker
I'm the Top Floor Boss, a lil' player (boss)
I put on big pants, real deal raver (real raver)
(Rave, raver)

Baby, I'm the fashion demon 
Ridin' down Candler Road and I'm speedin' (speedin')
I got hella hoes tryna fuck me and my bros (my bros)
I got hella shows lined up, I'm on the road (on the road)
I get hella green, yeah, I get hella 'chos (hella 'chos)
These niggas green as fuck, I'm 'bout to get over (get over)
No, bitch, I'm not greenin' out, you can not get over (can't get over)
I just like to ball hard, ball like Dellavedova (Dellavedova)
Don't shop at Dover's, don't shop at Nieman's (nah, nah)
Don't commit treason (nah)
Everything I do is for a reason 
Everything I do is so strategic (is so strategic)
Baby, please don't leave me, I don't need you
And I know that you don't need me
I done got the flyest, I'm on a date with the moon this evening (yeah)
She act cool but I know she evil, so deceiving (so deceiving)
If looks could kill that makes every day Halloween, man (it's Halloween)

(Ayy, Clayco, cook that motherfucker up)
