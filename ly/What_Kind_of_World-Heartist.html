		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there anybody left to save,
Or just vultures watching over me?
I'd like to think that we will be okay,
But hate won't lose its hunger until it drags us under.

I'm left to wonder:

What kind of world would that be?
Where greed and anger fill their eyes,
Where people can't find compromise?
What kind of world would that be?
If love fades and hope dies, we'll never make it out alive
Tell me, what kind of world would that be?

I look around at all I see: blank faces scarred by apathy
They say the world has changed as they regurgitate
Until the darkness takes me, I'll fight for better days

It's safe to say I've found my place. I've found a better way
