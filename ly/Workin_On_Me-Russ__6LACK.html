		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you stay by my side
When I'm working on me? Hey
I understand it's hard when none of this is your fault
But I'm hoping you don't leave
Would you stay by my side (would you?)
When I'm working on me? (When I'm working on me?) Yeah
I'm unlearning some things, I don't expect you to stay
But I'm hoping you don't leave (but I'm hoping you don't leave), yeah

And all I can say I'm committed to change things I learned growing up
But you don't have to wait
Sorry, baby, I'm falling
Falling, falling down
And that's why I'm calling, calling
Calling now for you

Boo-hoo, childhood trauma
Fucked-up dad and a fucked-up mama
Taught me that love means drama
Hostility was the problem solver
Sad nothin' ever got solved
Go figure, tryna reconfigure my brain
I'm triggered by arguments
Reactive, I'm on defense
Course my girl is on defense
(Course my girl is on defense)
(Course my girl is on defense)
(Course my girl is on defense)
(Course my girl is on defense)
(Course my girl is on defense)
(Course my girl is on defense)
(Course my girl is on defense)

Would you stay by my side
When I'm working on me? Hey
I understand it's hard when none of this is your fault
But I'm hoping you don't leave
Would you stay by my side (would you?)
When I'm working on me? (When I'm working on me?) Yeah
I'm unlearning some things, I don't expect you to stay
But I'm hoping you don't leave (but I'm hoping you don't leave), yeah

And all I can say I'm committed to change things I learned growing up
But you don't have to wait
Sorry, baby, I'm falling
Falling, falling down
And that's why I'm calling, calling
Calling now for you

(Calling you, oh, yeah, yeah)
Put up with my shit, huh
Fixed to a real misfit, huh
You been too legit through the times I had you tired and sick
When we really coulda split, uh
I'm under construction, I see the foundation
You holdin' us up like a beam, I'm sorry
Who would have known that my past would haunt me?
I should have known that this change would cost me
It's Wednesday night and I'm lookin' for a flight
I can make it to your side by the PM
I'll spend more time, and I'll make up for the time I treated the love like a per diem
I bottled a lot of my pain
And mixed it with things I couldn't explain and then I sip
I tried to contain, but then I flip, shit

Would you stay by my side
When I'm working on me? Hey
I understand it's hard when none of this is your fault
But I'm hoping you don't leave
Would you stay by my side (would you?)
When I'm working on me? (When I'm working on me?) Yeah
I'm unlearning some things, I don't expect you to stay
But I'm hoping you don't leave (but I'm hoping you don't leave), yeah

And all I can say I'm committed to change things I learned growing up
But you don't have to wait
Sorry, baby, I'm falling
Falling, falling down
And that's why I'm calling, calling
Calling now for you
