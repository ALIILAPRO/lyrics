		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know

This is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe its just because you didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please, kiss me
But kiss me out of desire, babe, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry
'Cause I know that in time, I'll only make you cry
This is our last goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ih, ih, ih, ah

Did you say, "no, this can't happen to me"
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
Saying, "maybe you didn't know him at all"
You didn't know him at all, oh oh, you didn't know
Ooh, didn't know

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
And the memories offer signs that it's over, oh-oh
It's over
