		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Tell me what it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
Tell me what it's worth

Tell me what it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
I came from the dirt, know I put in work
Like I'm A$AP Ferg, like I'm A$AP Ferg
Know I put in work
Know I put in work
Know I put in, yeah
Know I put in, yeah
Know I put in work
Diamonds different colors, so my neck look like Starburst
Kicked it one time, with your girlfriend
And she fucked me for a purse
I could hit that thing forever, when I'm on the Perc

I used to put in work
Now my young boys do the dirt (Brown boy)
Fully automatic, pull up hit you with a burst
Put you on a shirt, you a lil' boy, you a smurf
She used to put me down, and now she lifting up her skirt
Pull up and I swerve, leave her feelings hurt
She fucked me for a purse, she fucked me for a XO shirt
I see you wearing Off-White, but you know I bought it first
I've seen you post a picture, and I had to change my shirt
I can't punch him in his face, he gonna sue me now
Took your bitch to Noble, fucked me for some sushi now
I hit it once and now I can't stand her now
They pay me fifty thousand just to stand around

What it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
I came from the dirt, know I put in work
Like I'm A$AP Ferg, like I'm A$AP Ferg
Know I put in work
Know I put in, yeah
Know I put in, yeah
Know I put in work
Diamonds different colors, so my neck look like Starburst
Kicked it one time, with your girlfriend
And she fucked me for a purse
I could hit that thing forever, when I'm on the Perc

Heard you got that AP swerve, that was my watch first
Heard you got that Lambo', skrt, that was my drive first
Chopper beat that bitch to spurs, clip hang to the curb
That girl know I put in work, like I'm A$AP Ferg
Your girlfriend say I'm handsome
Fuck any girl, so random
Rock any clothes, I'm random
I wrap that VLONE on the sandal
Don't give me the top then cancel
My momma said these niggas can't stand you
And I'm laughing right to the bank
All my chains on like I'm Shabba Ranks

What it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
I came from the dirt, know I put in work
Like I'm A$AP Ferg, like I'm A$AP Ferg
Know I put in work
Know I put in, yeah
Know I put in, yeah
Know I put in work
Diamonds different colors, so my neck look like Starburst
Kicked it one time, with your girlfriend
And she fucked me for a purse
I could hit that thing forever, when I'm on the Perc

Came up from the dirt, yeah
Came up from the dirt, yeah
Put in work like A$AP Ferg, yeah
You're getting on my nerves, yeah
No pancakes, I want syrup, yeah
Mix some molly with the Percs, yeah
Diss me, take you off this earth, yeah
I came up from the dirt, yeah
I came up from the dirt, yeah
Came up from the dirt, yeah
Came up from the dirt, yeah
Put in work like A$AP Ferg, yeah
I got Vs on all my shirts, yeah
No pancakes, I want syrup, yeah
Mix some molly with the Percs, yeah
Diss me, take you off this earth, yeah
I came up from the dirt, yeah
I came up from the dirt, yeah
