		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We sat on a roof
Named every star
Shared every bruise and
Showed every scar

Hope has its proof
Your hand in mine, singing
Life has a beautiful, crazy design
And time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
And here I just want to stay

Amazing day
Amazing day

We sat on a roof
Named every star and
You showed me a place
Where you can be what you are

And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I drifted away
And in your arms
I just want to sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh

And I asked can the birds in poetry chime?
Can there be breaks in the chaos of the times?
Oh, thanks God
Must have heard when I prayed
'Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Yeah, today
