		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For the last time 
I watched Old Man Took bait his hook 
And then throw his line 
Pick up his wine 

He's a friend of mine 
Known him all my life and his wife 
'Neath the swayin' pine 
And the clingin' vine 
Just before he left 

He said now young man 
Take good care don't let the bugs bite 
Please make sure to say a word at night 
For all your brothers feeling blue 
Blue, blue, blue 
All the time 

So I stayed awhile 
Took my tea alone, called it home 
Like a playing child 
Running wild 

Heard a bluejay call 
Said we got you now 
Hope you bow 
To the old man's word 
I'm sure you heard 
Just before he left 

He said now young man 
Take good care don't let the bugs bite 
Please make sure to say a word at night 
For all your brothers feeling blue 
Blue, blue, blue 
All the time 

Now young man 
Take good care don't let the bugs bite 
Please make sure to say a word at night 
For all your brothers feeling blue 
Feeling blue 
Feeling blue 
Feeling blue 
Feeling blue 
Feeling blue 
Feeling blue 
Feeling blue 
Feeling blue ..
