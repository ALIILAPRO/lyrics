		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like love

I feel like love's killin' me slowly (I feel like love's killin' me slowly), yeah-yeah-yeah
Love's killin' me slowly, woah-woah
Love's killin' me slowly, ooh, yeah
Love's killin' me slowly, ooh, oh-oh
Love's killin' me slowly, yeah, ooh
Love's killin' me slowly
I feel like love's killin' me slowly (I feel like love's killin' me slowly), yeah
I don't know, oh
I don't wanna know, oh-oh
I don't wanna know, woah, ayy
I don't wanna know, woah
I don't wanna know, woah, uh
I don't wanna know, woah
I don't wanna know, woah
I don't wanna know, woah, yeah-yeah

Callin' my phone at four in the morning, she wanna make this sexy for me
She wanna take me to euphoria, she wanna yeah, yeah
She want me to take her somewhere she can be a foreigner, yeah, yeah
Magical military time, walkin' the streets like a warrior, yeah-yeah
If she fell in love, call the coroner
All of this fake love got me stressed out, got me pouring up, yeah-yeah
I see red on my tux and it remind me I'm good on my own
2C-B, two tabs and the mushrooms, I'm in my zone
I feel like love's killin' me slowly, yeah
I feel like love's killin' me slowly, yeah
Yeah, love's killin' me slowly

(Yeah-yeah)
(I feel like love's efe)
