		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell 'em this boy was meant for loving
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothing
It's all I know, never learned much more

Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it ruined me one day, yeah
'Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
Seemed to push them away

That's real life (real life), oh woah oh
Real life (real life), ooh
Mama talking that real life (real life), oh woah oh
That real life (real life) 
Real life, real life (yeah), real life

I know you don't really understand it
I'm not allowed to regret my choice
I heard that love is a risk worth taking
I learned to know never been that boy

Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it ruined me one day, yeah
'Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
Seemed to push them away

That's real life (real life), oh woah oh
Real life (real life), ooh
Mama talking that real life (real life), oh woah oh
That real life (real life) 
Real life, real life, real life

Heaven only lets a few in (Heaven only lets a few in)
It's too late for me to choose it (it's too late for me to choose it)
Don't waste precious tears on me
I'm not worth the misery
I'm better off when I'm alone

That's real life, oh woah oh
Real life (real life), ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh woah oh
That real life
Real life, real life, real life (ooh)

That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life (ooh, mama), oh woah oh
Yeah, yeah, real life (real life)
Real life, real life, real life
