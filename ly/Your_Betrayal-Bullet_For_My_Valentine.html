		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I going insane? (Insane)
My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks (attacks)
My body shaking there's no turning back

So take your eyes off the trigger
I'm not to blame if your world turns to black
As your eyes start to blister
There's just no hope for our final embrace
So here we are, I'm in your head
I'm in your heart

You were told to to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal

I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal

Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding as I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name

You said that we'd be forever
How could you kill me and lie to my face
Now that we can't be together
There's just no hope for our final embrace
So here we are, I'm in your head
I'm in your heart

You were told to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal

I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal

Go

So here we are (so here we are, I'm in your head)
(I'm in your head)
I'm in your heart

You were told to to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal

I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal
