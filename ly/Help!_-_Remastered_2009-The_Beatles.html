		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Help) I need somebody
(Help) not just anybody
(Help) you know I need someone, help

(When) when I was younger 
(When I was young) so much younger than today 
(I never need) I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) but now these days are gone 
(These days are gone) I'm not so self assured 
(And now I find) now I find I've changed my mind 
And opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now) and now my life has changed (my life has changed)
In oh so many ways
(My independ-) my independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But) but every now and then 
(Now and then) I feel so insecure 
(I know that I) I know that I just need you like 
I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) but now these days are gone 
(These days are gone) I'm not so self assured 
(And now I find) now I find I've changed my mind 
And opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Help me, help me, ooh
