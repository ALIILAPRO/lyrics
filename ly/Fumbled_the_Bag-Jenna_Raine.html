		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you out with your friends
Same old cologne on your skin
You said I miss you and how you been?

You know I'm no good at this
My stomach's doing front flips
I used to know you, it makes me sick

So don't call me overdramatic
Pretending the story of us isn't tragic

What if the best thing you had is
Somebody that you want back?
What if the moment you walked away
You wish you'd turned around

What if you got it all wrong
And I was the one all along?
Hate to say I told you so, but baby ain't it sad?
You fumbled the bag

You said your sister's engaged
She found love, you can't say the same
Thought that would be us one day
Small talk is hard to maintain
When my heart's in 2019
You stood close and I just looked away

So don't call me overdramatic
Pretending the story of us isn't tragic

What if the best thing you had is
Somebody that you want back?
What if the moment you walked away
You wish you'd turned around

What if you got it all wrong
And I was the one all along?
Hate to say I told you so, but baby ain't it sad?

Oh, now you've gotta watch me
Give the world to someone else
You're throwing matches on the flame
But you're the one who burned it out
When you left, I should've said

What if the best thing you had is
Somebody that you want back?
What if the moment you walked away
You wish you'd turned around

What if you got it all wrong
And I was the one all along?
Hate to say I told you so, but baby ain't it sad?
You fumbled the bag
You fumbled the bag
