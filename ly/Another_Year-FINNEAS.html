		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It never snows in LA
You'd never know it was a holiday
I don't believe that Jesus Christ was born to save me
That's an awful lot of pressure for a baby

But here we are again, with family or friends
Some extra time to spend and I'm not mad about it
Don't waste a dime on me, just want your company
Beside a Christmas tree, if the dog allows it

Hurry home, please, I don't belong without you
Your ice-cold feet, write all my songs about you
I love you more and more each day
Can't find poetic ways to say
"I hope it lasts another year"

Don't have a clue where I'll be
Except for next to you on New Year's Eve
I don't believe a resolution's gonna change me
That's an awful lot of bullshit, ain't it, baby?

But here we are tonight, drunk by the firelight
The future could be bright, though no one's sure about it
And if the ending's sad, at least these time's we've had
The good outweighs the bad, you wouldn't know without it

Hurry home, please, I don't belong without you
Your ice-cold feet, write all my songs about you
I love you more and more each day
Can't find poetic ways to say
"I hope it lasts another year"
