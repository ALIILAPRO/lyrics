		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day after day
Arms reach to salvation
I'll leave the parade
Watch me and wait

I felt you leaving
Your eyes deceived me
You left me bleeding
In the garden of Eden

Lucid, violent root
Release your hate
I believe you're next
It's inside your head
Where you create your own world
One more way out of this

I'm afraid I don't know
I'm afraid I don't know

I have become this past
That could not wholly be me
This fucking hate interact within your scene
I'll set this fire to everything in sight

I felt you leaving
Your eyes deceived me
You left me bleeding
In the garden of Eden

One more thing
If it should all cave in
Remove your name
Make your promises

It's inside your head
Where you create your own world
One last way out of this

I'm afraid I don't know
Know-know-know-know-know, hey
I'm afraid I don't know
Know-know-know-know-know, hey
