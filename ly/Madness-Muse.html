		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad) mm
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad) yeah
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you mean
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh

And now, I need to know, is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad) mm
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness was taking control
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad) yeah
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)

And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you need
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)

But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no (expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized (realized)

I need your love
I need your love

Come to me just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes, I know, I can't be wrong
And baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is

(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m, mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m, m-m-m, madness)
