		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Funny how it disappears
The second you give in
When the world comes to terms with the way that it spins
Funny how you rearrange
How your mind begins to change
Hold yourself a little tighter in the arms of your old age
And when nothing else is working
And the air is getting thin
I will hold on like the first time
Feel a pulse beneath my skin

I can feel it
I know it's true
I can't heal what I hold on to

I wish I could make the promise
I am this and nothing more
But there's holiness in finding
I was something else before
And I held my head in water like I wasn't scared to drown
Like I knew when it was over
I'd be finished looking down
Am I someone you believe in?
Can I trust what I can't see?
I'm still alive and breathing
You won't take the rest of me

I can feel it
I know it's true
I can't heal
What I hold on to

Give me a minute
I need another quiet day
My hands are shaking in the worst way
Give me a minute or two
Maybe a year would be enough
I'm still deciding if it's worth it
For all this stuff

I can feel it
I know it's true
I can't heal what I hold on to

Give me a minute or two
Maybe a year would be enough
I'm still deciding if it's worth it
