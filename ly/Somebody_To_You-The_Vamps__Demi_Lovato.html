		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you
Yeah, you

I used to wanna be
Living like there's only me
But now I spend my time
Thinkin' 'bout a way to get you off my mind (yeah, you)
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike (yeah, you)

Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground of mine keeps shaking
Oh, oh, oh, now

All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
Everybody's tryna be a billionaire
But every time I look at you, I just don't care
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (yeah, you)

I used to ride around
I didn't wanna settle down
But now I wake each day
Lookin' for a way that I can see your face (yeah, you)
I've got your photograph
But baby, I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this (yeah, you)

Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground of mine keeps shaking
Oh, oh, oh, now

All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
Everybody's tryna be a billionaire
But every time I look at you, I just don't care
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (yeah, you)

Look at me now, I'm falling
Can't even talk, still stuttering
All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (yeah, you)

All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (yeah, you)

All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (somebody to you)
All I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (yeah, you)
Everybody's tryna be a billionaire
But every time I look at you, I just don't care (I just don't care)
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (is somebody to you) (yeah, you)

'Cause all I wanna be, yeah, all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (yeah, you)

Yeah, you
