		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think you know
I think you know
That I'm not one for letting go
It goes to show
Sometimes the ones we love
We tend to hurt the most

Yeah, with every hit
We're closer to the break
But you might be surprised
How much a heart can take
Blow after blow
I just might be the one to say
I told you so
I know it feels like

It's like the world has left us behind
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
We've always had to fight to survive
Kicking and screaming, but never running

No, no, no
No matter what they say
I promise you it's not for nothing
No, no
No matter what they say
I swear to God, it's not for nothing

Yes, I believe
That there are sides of you and I
We've never seen
Oh, there's nothing to hide
We wear our scars as proof
That we are still alive

Yeah, with every hit
We're closer to the break
But you might be surprised
How much a heart can take
Stone after stone
We're getting stronger that you know
So let 'em throw
I know it feels like

It's like the world has left us behind
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
We've always had to fight to survive
Kicking and screaming, but never running

No, no, no
No matter what they say
I promise you it's not for nothing
No, no
No matter what they say
I swear to God, it's not for nothing

So don't look back now
We've come too far
To look back now
To look back now
I know it feels like

It's like the world has left us behind
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
We've always had to fight to survive
Kicking and screaming, but never running

No, no, no
No matter what they say
I promise you it's not for nothing
No, no
No matter what they say
I swear to God, it's not for nothing
No, no
I swear to God, it's not for nothing
No, no
No matter what they say
I swear to God, it's not for nothing
