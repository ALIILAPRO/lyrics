		  Where Did Your Heart Go
Written by: Orianthi / Jacob Bunton

You said take my hand and I won't let go
So I followed you down that winding road
There's nothing you could
That could make me run
You're safe with me
You've never been this loved

The writings on the wall but I didn't wanna read it
The voices in my head but I didn't wanna hear them
I fell so far into your arms
Never thought you'd leave me so messed up
 
Chorus
So where did your heart go
I guess I'll never know
I should've known from the start
Your gonna tear my world apart 
And leave me in the dark
So where did your heart go

You said I'd love you till the end of time
Nothing could make you leave my side
It was you baby all along
It's like you took the words right out of a love song

Chorus
So where did your heart go
I guess I'll never know
I should've known from the start
Your gonna tear my world apart and leave me in the dark
