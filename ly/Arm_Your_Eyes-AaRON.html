		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to walk just as far as tomorrow
Until the dawn seizes my hand
Where can our shadows go lay down their sorrow
When our souls take the wind

Did you know the sun
Was made out of our cries 
Each tear we drop is gold and
This is how it shines

The world leans in a sense that I can't follow
Too many rules for one man (I wonder)
How can we fit in a place that we don't know
Life has no master no plan
(Hey stranger)

Did you know the sun
Was made out of our cries 
Each tear we drop is gold and
This is how it shines

My skin is young, and my eyes were full of hope
But I've seen the dark of the day
(I wonder)
I need a shore, just one trail I could follow
Far from the fog in my head
(Hey stranger)

Did you know the sun
Was made out of our cries 
Each tear we drop is gold and
This is how it shines
(This is how it shines)

Arm your eyes, to see through mine
Arm your eyes, to see through mine
Arm your eyes, to see through mine
Arm your eyes, to see through mine
