		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darlin'

Ridin' high, when you were king
Played it hard and fast, cause you had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
You don't have to try
To be a man
The kind of man I want in the end
Only then can we begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hangin' over me
A broken girl
Without a now
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darlin'

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black

I'm beggin', I'm beggin', I'm beggin'
(Put your loving hand out, baby)
I'm beggin', I'm beggin', I'm beggin'
(Put your loving hand out, darlin')

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darlin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
