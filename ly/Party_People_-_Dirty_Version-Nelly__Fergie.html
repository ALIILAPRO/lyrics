		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go
St. Louis
Yeah.
Let's go
I told ya I gon' change the game
LA all day
They cant stop ya boy
I get money
Ya m*f*'s ain't ready

Just walked thru the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Boys all over me.
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?

Just walked thru the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Girls all over me.
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?

It's Nelly(Wait a minute)
Comin' straight up out the Lou
And all you New Edition rappers better cool it now
For I make a fool of y'all,
Paper stacked as tall as Yao Ming
Look at the bling, settings in rings
Lookin' like basketballs

It's Nelly (Wait a minute)
Comin' straight up out the Lou
And all you New Edition rappers better cool it now
For I make a fool of y'all,
Paper stacked as tall as Yao Ming
Look at the bling, settings in rings
Lookin' like basketballs

Just walked thru the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Boys all over me.
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?

Just walked thru the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Girls all over me.
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?

Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at

Well it's Fergie I'm the Dutchess
Comin straight from California
Stuntin in my loc locs.
Dreamin bout me M.I.A.,
Boyfriend wonderin where I'm at,
Cause I'm in the spot spot.
Why he always tryin to be puttin me down on lock lock?

Well it's Fergie I'm the Dutchess

Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?

Patiently waitin' & takin my time
Watchin' these haters don't come with they rhymes
Watchin' these suckers are mimickin', gimmickin'
Then they start fallin' off one at a time.
You can go search but you never could find,
I promise you derity I'm one of a kind.
Mold is broken, the formulas mine.
I killed the idea and destroyed the design.

I was patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Now that I'm here I'm gettin' my shine.
All of you haters can kiss a behind,
Specifically speakin' I'm talkin' bout mine.
Don't need you to tell me, I know that I'm fine.
I'm killin' it baby so call it a crime.
Yea you watch it I'm stealin' my time
I told you before that big girls don't cry.

Where my party people at

Just walked thru the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Boys all over me.
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?

Just walked thru the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Girls all over me.
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?

Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at

Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
Where my party people at
