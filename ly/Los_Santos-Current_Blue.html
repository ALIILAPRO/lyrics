		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move

Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move

East coast, west side, flying out to my place
Sleeping till a quarter past three, still sideways
Driving downtown in a white-tee
Gym shorts with the Nikes
One sec, running back to the old you
Jetlag in the back of an '02
New days in the Ville hope you roll through
One call, one text and I told you

Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move

Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move

Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move

Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move
