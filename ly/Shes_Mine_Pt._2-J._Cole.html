		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you, catch me, I've fallen in love
For the first time

For you I drop the tough guy shit
On this bus I sit
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you

Damn, it feel good to have you
Damn, it feel good to have you
Damn, it feel good to have you
Damn, it feel good to have you

Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special 
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed and the need
To purchase shit from corporations that make a killin'
Because they feed on the wallets of the poor
Who be knockin' on they door, every Black Friday
Just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell, where's your diaper? Shit, here
Lay on your back, don't pee right now or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking

Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to live? (Am I strong enough to live?)
Into a place that I can see (to a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important)
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to live? (Am I strong enough to live?)
Into a place that I can see (into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me)

They gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
That's the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made
She's mine
Catch me
Don't you, (she's mine) catch me
Don't you, (she's mine) catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I'll dry your eyes, I'll dry your eyes

There is a God
It is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you, catch me
I've fallen in love
For the first time
