		  Jiggle up yuh body
Jiggle up yuh sinting

Love me, love me like that
Love me like we ain't never let go (how you mean?)
Love me, love me like that
Poco a poco, muy, muy lento (sing)
Take your time and do it just like we were in Jamaica or New York
Love me, love me like that
Love me, give me some mad love

Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Love me, give me some mad love

Baby girl, cah me lovin' how yuh body fat, gimme some ah dat
Lovin' how yuh booty pop when di beat drop
For me, my baby, way you do it is a wrap
Love the energy when you fling it up back
Steppin' in, gyal, yuh pepperin', yuh ever look hot
Epic win, gyal, yuh know seh yuh never yet flop
I know I see weh me wan' fi attack
Mi eye deh 'pon she, precise and exact

Good Lord
Girl, you going so hard
Girl, your legs look the best
When I'm spreadin' the two apart (ooh, yeah yeah yeah)

Good Lord, why you going so hard? (Do it, girl)
Boy, I'm tryna be good but you're making me disobey (bidi bang bang bang)

Love me, love me like that
Love me like we ain't never let go (how you mean?)
Love me, love me like that
Poco a poco, muy, muy lento (sing)
Take your time and do it just like we were in Jamaica or New York
Love me, love me like that
Love me, give me some mad love

Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Love me, give me some mad love (bang)

Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Love me, give me some mad love (bidi bang bang bang)

Spin like propeller, you ah da in ting
Spin my girl, 'cah you know how fi swing
Jiggle up yuh body, jiggle up yuh sinting
Unquestionable, you ah run the sinting

Stepping in, 'bout to get it but you ever look hot
I'm the queen, boy, you know that I never yet flop

Are you ready fi a night of loving?
Wid the stamina king, me hear you body callin'

Good Lord
Girl, you going so hard
Girl, your legs look the best
When I'm spreadin' the two apart (ooh, yeah yeah yeah)

Good Lord, why you make it so hard? (why you make it so hard?)
Ain't it good enough for you?
You already broke down my guard (bing, bing, bing)

Love me, love me like that
Love me like we ain't never let go (never letting go)
Love me, love me like that
Poco a poco, muy, muy lento (blaze it)
Take your time and do it just like we were in Jamaica or New York (bidi bang bang bang)
Love me, love me like that
Love me, give me some mad love

Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Love me, give me some mad love (bidi bang bang bang)

Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Watch the tempo, watch the tempo
Love me, give me some mad love
