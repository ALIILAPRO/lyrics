		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Passion dripping
Off the tip of my tongue
Bad decisions
I don't know how to stop
Running right into the flames
For the heat of your embrace

We're burning 
In desire
Oh let's fuel the fire
Just keep taking me higher
Two bodies on fire
Burning in desire

Pain and pleasure
Bringing you to your knees
There's forever (forever)
c hunger we must feed
It's running deep inside our veins
c love that can't be tamed

We're burning
In desire
Oh let's fuel the fire
Just keep taking me higher
Two bodies on fire
Burning in desire

Oh desire
Oh desire

I feel you holding on to me
While we're burning in the heat of
Your skin against my skin (my skin)
Yeah we're so deep in sin
Heaven's so close but out of reach (out of reach)
We're destined for what's underneath
Burning, burning, burning

In desire
Oh let's fuel the fire
Just keep taking me higher
Two bodies on fire
Burning in desire
