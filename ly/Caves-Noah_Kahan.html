		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been running in place
whole year's been one of those days
I know we're close to an edge
Oh, I don't wanna be blamed
I know you hate to cause to pain
I hope the silence will end

Oh, and we hold onto this for whatever reason
Oh, and we're too far to fix it up

I want to break this to you honestly
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I know you're ready to move on from me
But you stay and you stay and you stay
And we wait and we wait 'til one of us caves

Oh, 'til one of us caves
Oh

Long game but none of us win
Afraid of shedding our skin
We keep on playing pretend
This fear's a rope on our wrists
These years of life that we've missed
Building a case in our heads

Oh, and we hold onto this for whatever reason
Oh, and we're too far to fix it up

I want to break this to you honestly
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I know you're ready to move on from me
But you stay and you stay and you stay
And we wait and we wait 'til one of us caves

Oh, 'til one of us caves
Oh, 'til one of us caves
Oh, 'til one of us caves
Oh

Oh, and we hold onto this for whatever reason
No, and we're too far to fix it up

I want to break this to you honestly
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I know you're ready to move on from me
But you stay and you stay and you stay
And we wait and we wait 'til one of us caves

Oh, 'til one of us caves
Oh, 'til one of us caves
Oh, 'til one of us caves
Oh, 'til one of us caves
