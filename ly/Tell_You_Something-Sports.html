		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I say what's on my mind
It never really seems to come out right
Sometimes I just feel like stayin' quiet
In the night

Well, you would be the perfect one to ask
So tell me if I'm losin' all my class
Sometimes I just feel like running back
To the night

I don't know how to tell you something
But I do know that it won't be easy
I'm headed in the right direction
Just tell me what to say
Just tell me what to say

Thinkin' to myself, what is the time?
And surely I could wait until it's right
Sometimes it just feels like fight or flight
In the night

I don't know how to tell you something
But I do know that it won't be easy
I'm headed in the right direction
Just tell me what to say
Tell me what to say

How did I mess this up?
I could be going out of my mind
Tried to just be myself
Tried, but I just couldn't back it up

Back it up now, yeah, back it up now
Back it up now, yeah, back it up now

I don't know how to tell you something
But I do know that it won't be easy
I'm headed in the right direction
Just tell me what to say
Tell me what to say

How did I mess this up?
I could be going out of my mind
Tried to just be myself
Tried, but I just couldn't back it up
