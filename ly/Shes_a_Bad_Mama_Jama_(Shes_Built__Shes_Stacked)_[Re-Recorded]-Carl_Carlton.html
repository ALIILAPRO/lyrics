		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ooh, ooh
Look at her

She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be, hey
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be

Her body measurements are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sure enough gettin' attention
She's poetry in motion
A beautiful sight to see
I get so excited viewing her anatomy

She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
Look at her

She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be, hey
She's a bad mama jama, oh
Just as fine as she can be

Looks like she's poured into the gold
She's bad
The essence of beauty
Ooh, such lovely hair
She's foxy, classy
Oh, sexy, sassy
She's heavenly
A treat for the eye to see

She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like, ow
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
Ooh-wee

She's a bad mama jama, ooh, she's bad
Just as fine as she can be, hey
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be

Whoo, whoo
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la
La-la
Whoo, whoo
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la
La-la
Whoo, whoo

(She's built, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like)

Her body measurements are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sure enough gettin' attention
She's poetry in motion
A beautiful sight to see
I get so excited viewing her anatomy

She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
Look at her

She's a bad mama jama (hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Just as fine as she can be (oh, girl, oh)
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be

She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be

She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be

Whoo, whoo
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la
La-la
Whoo, whoo
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la
La-la
Whoo, whoo

She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be

She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
