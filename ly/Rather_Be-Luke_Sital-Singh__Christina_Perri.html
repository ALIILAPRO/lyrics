		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The siren sound
Have you fallen asleep yet?
I simmer down close under your breast
A record spins all through 'til the daylight
I wake again and you're still by my side

We may be falling backwards
And feeling out to sea
Hanging on for the sunrise
'Til we'll be wild and free
But with the world still shaking
And you lying next to me
There's nowhere I'd rather be

Your warmest glow, never easy to leave it
'Cause nothing fits me as well as your arms
The dinner fight, the shadows at sunset
Still close at night with miles to go yet

We may feel under pressure
Just floating helplessly
Holding out for a pay rise
When we'll be wild and free
But with the curtain falling
You standing next to me
There's nowhere I'd rather be
There's nowhere I'd rather be
