		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every wrong I did turned me to a better kid, so alright
Every time we kissed, knew I wanted more of it, so don't hide
Never let it in, especially since we're getting rid of all lies
You know you've always been someone I've confided in on the cold nights

But redemption will come for you so
Guess I'll just call it a feeling
Tonight I'll just comfort you so
Maybe you can start to believe it

Oh, no
Oh, no, no, I won't let go
Oh, no, no, I'll never leave ya
Oh, no, no, I won't let go, no (oh, no)
Will you start to believe it?
Oh, no, no, I won't let go
Oh, no, no, I'll never leave ya (oh, no)
Oh, no, no, I won't let go, no
Will you start to believe it?
(Oh, no)

All those nights alone, demons that you've never known would run through
Never had a hope, never let your wings unfold, but I know you
Every word I wrote, every single thing I told, it's all true
Let your spirit show you that I could never hold, we'll leave soon

But redemption will come for you so
Guess I'll just call it a feeling
Tonight I'll just comfort you so
Maybe you can start to believe it

Oh, no
Oh, no, no, I won't let go
Oh, no, no, I'll never leave ya
Oh, no, no, I won't let go, no (oh, no)
Will you start to believe it?
Oh, no, no, I won't let go
Oh, no, no, I'll never leave ya (oh, no)
Oh, no, no, I won't let go, no
Will you start to believe it?

Guess we kinda thought it was easy
Guess we kinda thought it was easy
Least I saw the heart of you briefly, honey
Guess we kinda thought it was easy
Still I know the thought of you frees me
Least I saw the heart of you

But redemption will come for you so
Guess I'll just call it a feeling
Tonight I'll just comfort you so
Maybe you can start to believe it

Oh, no
Oh, no, no, I won't let go
Oh, no, no, I'll never leave ya
Oh, no, no, I won't let go, no (oh no)
Will you start to believe it?
Oh, no, no, I won't let go
Oh, no, no, I'll never leave ya 
Oh, no, no, I won't let go, no
Will you start to believe it?
