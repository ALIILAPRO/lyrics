		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh, I beat the back out the bitch
I walk in barefoot like Rick
This not the time to confess
Sleep with two phones on my chest
Yesterday, I was just broke
Today I look sexy and blessed
Every time I come back home
Baby girl kiss on my neck
These girls keep callin' me handsome
Flew out to England and I'm with lil' Mexico
Croppin' that bitch out my pic' because she too thick
She must be a messy ho (yeah, yeah)
Put that on my cats
I'm tired of debuggin' these big protein boogers
Get that weak shit out of my face
I gotta be honest, I cannot be happy
Unless my whole team get a taste
NDA rent, cancel your ass yesterday
'Cause a nigga gon' die 'bout respect, huh

Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Hol' up, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed

Ayy, smokin' a basket, uh
I'm in a casket 'cause I get ratchet, uh
King of the fashion, you can't get active
Beat your ass up for it, I caught you lackin'
Eat your ass up for it, I caught you braggin'
Kick your ass up for it, I'm with the drama
Frontin' your mama, frontin' your daddy, your sister, your aunt
Two hundred K taxes, please do not sue me
I can't afford to Paul Jane a blunt, uh
Bitch, hand me the rock
Rock band on me and I look attractive
Holdin' up five fingers, my numbers are brackin'
Barbarian shit, Barbarian tactic
My name is Booman, my name is not Jeff
I told you that I am a Barbarian
I told you that I am a Barbarian
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Hol' up, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
