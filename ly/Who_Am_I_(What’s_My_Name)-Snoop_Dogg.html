		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tha Dogg Pound's in the house (the bomb)
Ey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Tha Dogg Pound's in the house)
Snoop Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
Snoop Doggy Dogg (Dogg)

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C.
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I served my 'caine
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit
So I ain't holdin' nothin' back
And motherfucker I got five on the twenty sack
It's like that and as a matter of fact (rat-tat-tat-tat)
'Cause I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Yeah, so peep out the manuscript
You see that it's a must we drop gangsta shit
What's my motherfuckin' name?

Snoop Doggy Dogg (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Snoop Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
Da-da-da-da-da, do-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da (Dogg)

It's the bow to the wow, creepin' and crawlin'
Yiggy yes y'allin', Snoop Doggy Dogg in
The motherfuckin' house like every day
Droppin' shit with my nigga mister Dr. Dre
Like I said, niggas can't fuck with this
And niggas can't fuck with that
Shit that I drop 'cause you know it don't stop
Mister One Eight Seven on a motherfuckin' cop
Tic-toc, never the Glock, just some nuts and a cock
Robbin' motherfuckers, then I kill them bloodclaats
And I step through the fog and I creep through the smog
'Cause I'm Snoop Doggy (who?) Doggy (what?) Doggy (Dogg)

Snoop Doggy Dogg
Snoop Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
(Bow, wow, wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay)
(Bow, wow, wow, yippy-yo) (the bomb)
(Bow, wow, wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay)
(Bow, wow, wow, yippy-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo) (Dogg)

Now just throw your hands in the motherfuckin' air
And wave the motherfuckers like ya just don't care (Dogg)
Yeah, roll up the dank and pour the drank
And watch your step (why?) 'Cause Doggy's on the gank
My bankroll's on swole
My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With Tha Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in your bitch, is where ya might find me
Layin' that, playin' that G Thang
She want the nigga with the biggest nuts, and guess what?
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
What's my motherfuckin' name?

Snoop Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
Snoop Doggy Dogg 
Snoop Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
Snoop Doggy Dogg (Dogg) 
Da-da-da-da-da, do-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da (the bomb)
Da-da-da-da-da, do-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da (the bomb)

Doggy Dogg, Doggy Dogg, Doggy Dogg (the bomb)
(Bow, wow, wow, yippy-yo) (the bomb)
What is his name? (Dogg)
Snoop Dogg and the Dogg Pound (Dogg) (the bomb)
Oh, yeah, Snoopy Dogg, Snoopy Dogg
Snoopy Dogg (the bomb)
Yeah, yeah (Dogg), I know his name
Come on Snoopy, come on Snoopy (the bomb)
And Tha Dogg Pound
Snoopy Dogg (the bomb), Snoopy Dogg
Snoopy Dogg (Dogg, Dogg)
(Nasty Dogg, Doggy Dogg)
