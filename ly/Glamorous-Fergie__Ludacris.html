		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ready?

If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it
"If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home"

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' the first class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy (are you ready?)
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shoppin' for expensive things
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm n queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin' and reminiscin'
On days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm in

First class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy (are you ready?)
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

I'm talkin' Champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothin' but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue to do with us
I got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyle so rich and famous, Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Takin' trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah 
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' first class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things that I don't wanna know (fuck y'all)
I got money in the bank, and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road, and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it)
My daddy told me so
(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)
He let his daughter know
(He said, if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it)
My daddy told me so
(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)
He let his daughter know
