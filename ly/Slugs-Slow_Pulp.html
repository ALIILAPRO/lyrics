		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quiet, c'mon and give me a kiss
I guess that I wasn't over it
Perfect, all the ways I know we
Fit together, I think I want back in
Oh, when it, it all ends again
What if I tell you that
You'll be playing in my head

'Cause you're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it

Listen, I wanna tell you how I've been
That I want you despite my defense
Trust in all the things I never said
I'm sorry I haven't been honest
But when it, it all ends again
What if I tell you that
You'll keep playing in my head

'Cause you're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing it
You're a summer hit
I'm singing
