Lala-lala-lala-lala
Lala-lala-lala-lala
Lala-lala-lala-lala 

 I like to hear your voice
And play with you, my lover
In game that we call choice
We flying out of hours
Fog that i’ve discovered
Wants to take and hold us
Like we are ready 
To make step to other life
On your face you show surprise
I'm sure that it's all lie
Cause i know that it’s not right
I’m gonna get it out of my mind 

 Hush
Don’t tell anymore, Lala
Don't come if you know, Lala
What i wouldn’t know, Lala
I’m looking for more and more, Lala 

Don’t tell anymore, Lala
Don't come if you know, Lala
What i wouldn’t know, Lala
I’m looking for more and more, Lala 

 I guess my way was long and hard
You’ve left our game with an aimed shot
My past is stolen, rope holder
Pull it down I can’t hold it
Don’t you play anymore?
I’ve cut my face with an empty heart
So what I know and what I do? 

 Hush
Don’t tell anymore, Lala
Don't come if you know, Lala
What i wouldn’t know, Lala
I’m looking for more and more, Lala 

Don’t tell anymore, Lala
Don't come if you know, Lala
What i wouldn’t know, Lala
I’m looking for more and more, Lala 

Don’t tell anymore, Lala
Don't come if you know, Lala
What i wouldn’t know, Lala
I’m looking for more and more, Lala 

Don’t tell anymore, Lala
Don't come if you know, Lala
What i wouldn’t know, Lala
I’m looking for more and more, Lala
