		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh (ooh, yeah) 
(SWISH)
Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin' (cravin')
(D-D-Diego)

Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin'
All night, that's right, ballin' on the daily
Off-White fit nice, Balenciaga wavy
Ass fat, real snack, got that nigga cravin'
Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin'
All night, that's right, ballin' on the daily
Off-White fit nice, Balenciaga wavy
Ass fat, real snack, got that nigga cravin'

Ooh, I been on a jet all day
Yeah, ooh, even when I'm chill, I'm still cool
Ooh, smoke a J and then I regroup
Ooh, I spend a check and don't trip, I recoup
Yeah, get it right back
Every day, gettin' paid, I can't write back
You'll see my face every day, I can't hide that
DaniLeigh, what they say when I ride past

Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin'
All night, that's right, ballin' on the daily
Off-White fit nice, Balenciaga wavy
Ass fat, real snack, got that nigga cravin'
Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin'
All night, that's right, ballin' on the daily
Off-White fit nice, Balenciaga wavy
Ass fat, real snack, got that nigga cravin'

Okay, I look good, fuck good, got lil' baby cravin'
Said, "I'm pullin' up, start showerin' and shavin'"
Kiss her clit, flick my tongue, got her legs shakin'
I ain't hit since last month, gotta keep her waitin'
Hunnid on my neck, my chains Aquafina
So I stay on my toes like a ballerina
Light-skinned and Mexican, she look like Selena
She just moved to LA, she signed to Wilhelmina
But she's new to the city, so her clout's on beginner
She not on Raya yet, she still on Tinder
Month to month lease, will she make it past winter?
She cheated on her man with me, I hope that he forgive her
'Cause I know he pays her rent, so I hope he stays with her
'Cause I need her in the city, 'cause I'm still tryna hit her
Like, wow, that's hella foul
G, you hella flagrant, settle down

Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin' (DaniLeigh)
All night, that's right, ballin' on the daily
Off-White fit nice, Balenciaga wavy
Ass fat, real snack, got that nigga cravin'

Ooh, got that nigga cravin'
Gotta keep him waitin'
God, I'm feelin' faded
Drizzy Drake, I'm jaded
Wanna have my baby
Don't be scared to say it
Love it, you can't face it
Ooh, like she cool as shit
On some smooth shit
Yeah, LL Cool shit
Started trippin' on me, had to ten-and-two, dip (bye)
Homie pulled up on me, had to pull up to it

Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin'
All night, that's right, ballin' on the daily
Off-White fit nice, Balenciaga wavy
Ass fat, real snack, got that nigga cravin'
Slim right, real tight, got a nigga cravin'
All night, that's right, ballin' on the daily
Off-White fit nice, Balenciaga wavy
Ass fat, real snack, got that nigga cravin'
