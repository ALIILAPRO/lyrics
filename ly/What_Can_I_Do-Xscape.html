		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My man done left me on a midnight train
He said he wasn't thinkin' of ever comin' back again
He told me he wanted me to find somebody else
He done left me here all by myself
Tell me

What can I do?(Well, can I get a witness? What)
What?(Ah, yeah) 
I'm still in love with you (tell me what)
What can I do? (All I wanna know is what)
What? I'm still in love with you baby

When it first started it was all good
The things you done to me I never thought that you would
Didn't give me a reason why it had to end
I can't believe you left me for another lady friend

You know I've been searchin' for someone
Who could share that special love with me

I thought you were the one, I gave my trust to you
I'm such a fool, I want you back
Tell me what am I to do?

What, what can I do?(Somebody tell me)
What, what? I'm still in love with you
What, what can I do?(Somebody tell me)
What, what? I'm still in love with you baby

I'm sittin' by the phone, all alone
Tell me, what can I do? 
Tell me, yeah 
Tell me what

What can I do?(Tell me what)
What?(Yeah)I'm still in love with you (I'm still in love with you)
What can I do?(Can I get a witness? Yeah)
What? I'm still in love with you, baby (tell me what)
What can I do? (Tell me what, yeah, yeah)
What? I'm still in love with you 
What can I do?(Tell me what)
What? I'm still in love with you
