		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reign upon me, show me how will I survive.
Try and tell me a way to feel alive.
Bring it back to life, to whole new heights
And tell me what is needed.
I know you'll guide me home down this darkened road.

Rain upon me, shower me with the tears of salvation.
Hold me close, hold me near.

I find myself another year spent facing a wall,
My life, our path has never been shown, but we move on.
Fighting to keep our reign from them.
Fighting to keep our reign from them.

We will fall into the blacker sense of reason.
Choose your side.
I hope to God you pick the right one this time.

Reign upon me, how will I survive?
Try and tell me a way to feel alive.
Bring it back to life, to whole new heights
And tell me what is needed.
I know you'll guide me home down this darkened road.

We are The Crown!
We are The Crown!
We are The Crown!
We are The Crown!
We are The Crown!
Stand up and scream it loud!
We are The Crown!
We are The Crown!
Triumphant, immovable.

In darkness we find ourselves.
We find ourselves.

Reign upon me, how will I survive?
Won't you test me, to carry all the strife
Bring it back to life, to whole new heights
And tell me what is needed.
I know you'll guide me home down this darkened road.

I knew we would pursue the right path, even if it was long.
We haven't changed, we stay the same; ever strong.

Show me the new day,
Show me the new day,
Know as long as our hearts are beating,
We will always find our way.
