		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haven't talked in four months
Cut off all connection
Beating myself up about leaving you fighting for me
You had good intentions
But when I saw you it clicked
I guess that was all that I needed to know that if

We were still together
By now we'd be at each other's throats
Tryna recover from another argument
Like who's the better lover
We don't know each other
We don't know each other at all

I didn't end it just for me
Knew we'd break eventually
What's love if it's temporary?
I couldn't settle, you couldn't change
It was inevitable this way
We never got in too deep
Headed down a dead end street
What's love if it's temporary?
Headed down a dead end street
What's love if it's temporary?

I know what you're thinking
You weren't good enough for me
Those were your words
You said at first you couldn't see that

If we were still together
By now we'd be fighting
Until we both lost our voices
So much for the silent treatment
I don't wanna do this as if
You wanna do this
But you say you're loyal to a fault

I didn't end it just for me
Knew we'd break eventually
What's love if it's temporary?
I couldn't settle, you couldn't change
It was inevitable this way
We never got in too deep
Headed down a dead end street
What's love if it's temporary?
Headed down a dead end street
What's love if it's temporary?
What's love if it's temporary?
Headed down a dead end street
What's love if it's temporary?
