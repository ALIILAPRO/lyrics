		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have heard the echoes in the dark
Dim and distant voices of the past
And I've seen so far into the night
And lingered in the land of no light

Far beyond the
Shrouded hours of dawn
Through the mist
Of daybreak I was borne
But the day was
Clouded still by night
Leaving me in the land of no light

Though I'd love to
Say hello to you
You might have to wait awhile
To say goodbye
For it must end as it began
And then start again

The day of darkness
Comes to every man
And lingers while he
Reaches out his hand
And he cannot know how it will end
Till he finds out if he has a friend
A friend
