		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another sleepless night,     
I sit alone and cry,
Twilight time 'til dawn,
Memories linger on,
Since we said goodbye.

Throughout that sleepless night,
No matter what I do,
You're always on my mind,
And though you're gone I find,
I'm still in love with you. 

Shadows fall, and I recall,
The love that you once had for me.
Miss you so, when lights are low,
I think of things that use to be. 

You're always in my heart,
Although you're out of sight,
Lonely teardrops burn,
As I toss and turn,
Another sleepless night. 

Although you're out of sight,
Lonely teardrops burn,
As I toss and turn,
Another sleepless night.
