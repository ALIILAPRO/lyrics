		<p>
		  Runaway
Right now let's just runaway
All that talk is killing me
One last shot, hold onto me

Oh-oh, there's something I got to say to ya
There's somewhere we gotta go
And now they're sinking in the sand, chasin' what we can
Baby, it's not enough, oh
It's like we're stuck in the mezzanine
With twenty floors left to go (oh yeah)
And now we're driving in the rain, trying to switch the lane
But you already know

So don't waste this time, yeah, I don't move slow
But one good shot and I'll let you know
It's all I want, yeah
Can we just let go and

Runaway
Right now let's just runaway
All that talk, it's killing me
One last shot, hold onto me, oh-oh
Babe, I think we should runaway
I'm my own worst enemy
Blue sky's only miles away
One last shot, hold onto me, oh-oh

There's something I got to say to you
I'm on that new energy (oh yeah)
Not on that easy as it goes, wait for miracles
No, what will be will be

No, so don't waste this time, yeah, I don't move slow
But one good shot and I'll let you know
It's all I want, yeah
Can we just let go and

Runaway
Right now let's just runaway
All that talk, it's killing me
One last shot, hold onto me, oh-oh
Babe, I think we should runaway
I'm my own worst enemy
Blue sky's only miles away
One last shot, hold onto me, oh-oh

(Oh yeah)
(Runaway)
One last shot, hold onto me, oh-oh

Runaway
Right now let's just runaway
All that talk, it's killing me
One last shot, hold onto me (oh)
