		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good love beside me
A warm bed in which to sleep
Quiet the voice inside
That only of weakness speaks

Feels like no angels
Follow where I tread
Made to make a home but I am
Lost in wilderness instead

And I will find
Myself alone again
And all my fears
Become the dreams of yester-when

Awake in this hell space
I can barely hold my tongue
Try for my life to be someone
Who can never come undone

Feels like no angels
Follow where I tread
Made to make a home but it
Burns to the ground instead

And I will find myself alone again
And all my fears
Become the dreams of other men
And I will find myself alone again
And all my fears
Become the dreams of yester-when

Oh

And I will find
Myself alone again
And all my fears
Become the dreams of yester-when
