		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bend the key
'Til we break it
We dissolve
To golden dust
Find the gate
But there's no way out
When you see it's locked
By a circle of fire
Never thought I could run
Such an endless distance to you
But the way to your world
So shadowed and fraught
I hear you call
Horizons away
I'll wait for a sign
The promise we made
We gave it all
We walked into the fire
When we stared into the violet sun
And watched it all come undone
Will you follow me home
Through the fields of light?
Let go of the wreckage
Leave it behind
Turn to golden dust
Under a violet sun
We gave it all
We walked into the fire
When we stared into the dying sun
And watched it all come undone
Now I'm here
I surrender
Bound to the promise I made
Burned away
All that I knew
Walked into the circle
Tethered to you
Turn the key
Inside of the dream
Unchained by the wonder
Setting us free
