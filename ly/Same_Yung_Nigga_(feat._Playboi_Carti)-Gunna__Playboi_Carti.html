		<p>
		  Wheezy outta here
Run that back, Turbo

Yeah
Stack them hunnids up like Lego (Lego)
Remember I had to charge my bro for petrol (petrol)
I came a long way trappin' off a Metro (Metro)
Ain't the same young nigga from the ghetto (ghetto)
Still got rounds I can let go (let go)
Land in any town I smoke the best dope (best dope)
I pop off a tag when I change clothes (change clothes)
Ain't the same young nigga from the ghetto (ghetto)

I done made this drip a series (series)
I can see these diamonds clear like HD (clear like HD)
Carats in my ear, why can't you hear me? (Run that back, Turbo)
Rock Balmain busted down, my jeans Amiri (Wheezy outta here)
Won't touch you once but still can make you feel me
He feel hot but then walk right in a D&G (yah)
Got three condos, I still won't give my bitch a key (nah)
To all promoters, get the presidential suite (presidential suite)
Sold out shows, this shit litty (litty)
These bitches love it when I'm in they city (city)
I'ma buy a Rolls and a Bentley (Rolls and a Bentley)
Told doctor "Get that syrup out my kidney" (kidney)

Stack them hunnids up like Lego (Lego)
Remember I had to charge my bro for petrol (petrol)
I came a long way trappin' off a Metro (Metro)
Ain't the same young nigga from the ghetto (ghetto)
Still got rounds I can let go (let go)
Land in any town I smoke the best dope (best dope)
I pop off a tag when I change clothes (change clothes)
Ain't the same young nigga from the ghetto (ghetto)

Spend a lotta money on some damn clothes (spend some money on that)
Spend a lotta money on some damn clothes (yeah yeah)
Fendi on my body, hoe no plain clothes (Run that back, Turbo)
East Atlanta kickin', smokin' big dope (Wheezy outta here)
I want a Ferrari and a Range Rover (a Ferrari and a Range Rover)
That bih got a boy so she gon' lay low (that boy got no mansion, he don't)
That boy just a lick, we serve him Karo (that boy doesn't listen, he don't)
Cut that bitch right off, I feel like Van Gogh (cut that bitch right off and Van Gogh)
Diamonds on me dancing, where's the dance floor (dance floor)
Walk down on a opp and let that thang go (yeah, yeah)
50K on my backend, I did a late show (yeah, yeah)

Yeah
Stack them hunnids up like Lego (Lego)
Remember I had to charge my bro for petrol (petrol)
I came a long way trappin' off a Metro (Metro)
Ain't the same young nigga from the ghetto (ghetto)
Still got rounds I can let go (let go)
Land in any town I smoke the best dope (best dope)
I pop off a tag when I change clothes (change clothes)
Ain't the same young nigga from the ghetto (ghetto)
