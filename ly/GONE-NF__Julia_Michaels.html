		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always saw my glass as half empty, it was never full
You were always passive and I was irresponsible
Didn't have a chance, but we were scared to let things go
Young, in love, broken hearts holding on to our false hope

Had your whole life planned out, I had no clue who I was
Gave it all we had, but guess our all wasn't enough
Wonder where you're at now, did you ever find the one?
Hope you're out there somewhere happy, sometimes I think of ya

Yeah, yeah
And it makes me sad
Mm, yeah
The way you left
But I'm glad you did
It was for the best

I pray, someday you find yourself
Somehow, some way, with someone else
Don't wait, it's too late to keep holding on
I'm already gone

Ah, I could blame us breaking up on being too young and being too dumb
And being too caught up on past traumas
But the truth is we just weren't right, we planned a whole life
When we both know we should've just ended on the first night
And I know if I would have stayed with you
I would've been down on luck and done with love and done too much
To make you stay, second-guessing and resenting all the love
I could've gave to someone else
Got carpal tunnel from holding on to what we once felt
I'm happy for you, I am
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I am
And once in a while it's true, I think about you too
Yeah, I do
I think about you too

Mm, yeah
And it makes me sad
Mm, yeah
The way you left
But I'm glad you did
It was for the best, yeah

I pray that someday you find yourself
Somehow, some way, with someone else
Don't wait, it's too late to keep holding on
Yeah, yeah
I'm already gone

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
