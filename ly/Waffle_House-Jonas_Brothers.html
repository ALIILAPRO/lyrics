		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Come on) (hey now)
We never knew how to forfeit (hey now)
But we always knew how to talk sh- (hey now)
Couple nights, threw gasoline on the fire (hey) (hey now)
We never knew how to perfect (hey now)
But we always knew it would work

'Cause if something misread
Or if something got said
Know before the night ends

No, don't get stressed, it's gon' get figured out
Oh, deep conversations at the Waffle House
Headstrong father and a determined mother
Oh, that's why some nights we tried to kill each other
But you know it's always love (hey now)

We never knew how to fake it (hey now)
But we always knew how to break sh- (hey now)
Couple nights, threw gasoline on the fire

'Cause if something misread
Or if something got said
Know before the night ends

No, don't get stressed, it's gon' get figured out
Oh, deep conversations at the Waffle House
Headstrong father and a determined mother
Oh, that's why some nights we tried to kill each other
But you know it's always love

Na-na-na (oh, yeah)
La-la-la-la (but you know it's only love)
Na-na-na (oh, baby)
La-la-la-la

But you know it's always gon' get figured out
Deep conversations at the Waffle House
Headstrong father and a determined mother
Oh, that's why some nights we tried to kill each other
You know it's only love

Na-na-na (oh, yeah)
La-la-la-la (you know it's only love)
Na-na-na (hey)
La-la-la-la (you know it's only love)
Na-na-na (it's always love)
La-la-la-la
