		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time makes two love
Makes more than friends
Time makes true love
More than just pretend
Makes you count the nights
And the moments
Were apart

Time will heal your troubles
When you've got the blues
Heal the burning heartache
Put you right back in the groove
But time will take its toll on you
If you don't play it smart

Because time makes two, it takes two to heal a broken heart

Time makes two love
Feel each others pain
And I'm so glad of you love
So proud to be your man
Time makes two
Oh Times makes two
Times makes two

You know time makes two, it takes two to heal a broken heart
Time makes two, it takes two to heal a broken heart
Oh times makes two, it takes two to heal a broken heart
It makes you more than friends
Time makes two â?¦ time makes two
It makes you feel each other's pain
Time makes two, it takes two to heal a broken heart
Makes you more than friends
Time makes two, it takes two to heal a broken heart
