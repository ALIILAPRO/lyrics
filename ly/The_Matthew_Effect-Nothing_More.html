		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been sucking tit
Asleep in your cradle 
Given the world
You're still ungrateful
You bitch and whine
You're always entitled
You blame Mommy and Daddy
You think you're Jesus Christ
 
You've been sucking tit 
Safe in your cradle
Given the world
But somehow unable
If talk is the game
Then you take the title 
Your day is coming
Despite your denial
 
Like a parasite, You got the easy life
I'm the hand that feeds, 
You're the dog that bites
 
I'll be breaking, breaking, breaking your pride
You're sucking, sucking, sucking me dry
One day you'll realize, 
You're no Jesus Christ
 
I dream of the day,
Your eyes are ripped open
You eat your words
Spit up and start choking
Talk like a man
But walk like a child
Your day is coming, Despite your denial
 
I'll be breaking, breaking, breaking your pride
You're sucking, sucking, sucking me dry
One day you'll realize, why can't you realize?
You're no Jesus Christ
 
Give up, step back, rewind, repeat
 
And then you'll see one day 
That you could be like a star someday
