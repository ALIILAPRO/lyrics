		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never dare to reach for the moon
I never thought I'd know heaven so soon
I couldn't hope to say how I feel
The joy in my heart no words can reveal

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Now just a memory the tears that I cried
Now just a memory the sighs that I sighed
Dreams that I cherished all have come true
All my tomorrows I give to you

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Life's summer leaves may turn into gold
The love that we share will never grow old
Here in your arms no words far away
Her in your arms forever I'll stay

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

La誰 lalala誰 lalala誰 lalala誰 [Repeat until the end]
