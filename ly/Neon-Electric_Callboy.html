		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First sight, hard crush, your touch
I wanna feel it day and night
Messed up, too much
thought about our first touch

We were ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky (tell me)
Tell me the reason why
You decide to push me away
Ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky
Ready to fly
Nothing but close to the sky

Break up, hard stuff, fucked up
I wanna leave it all behind
New town, unknown, restart
Now I'm living on my own

We were ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky (tell me)
Tell me the reason why
You decide to push me away
We're ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky
Ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky

We can't go back to
The time where it began
But I love to thank you
For the memories we share

Oh, baby, we save the moments, the good, the bad ones
Remember you and me
Oh, baby, we can't go back, oh, I can't forget
That we were nothing but close to the sky

We can't go back to
(All I wanted was to be with you)
The time where it began
(No matter what you've put me through)
But I love to thank you
(All I wanted was to be with you)
That we were nothing but close the sky

We can't go back to
(All I wanted was to be with you)
The time where it began
(No matter what you've put me through)
But I love to thank you
(All I wanted was to be with you)
That we were nothing but close the sky
