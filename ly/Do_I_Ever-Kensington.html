		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't sit around holding up my guard
Let it all go
Let it all go around go in and face the inevitable

Can't figure out how to play my part
Where do I go?
How do I go around go in and make it inhabitable

Now let it all in

Cover up the arm that holds the weight
Raging on too long and all will stay
Unsolved

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know
I ought to grow
But do I ever?

Can't sit around hiding all my scars
Let them all show
Let them all know about go in and embrace the inevitable

Now let it all in

Cover up the arm that holds the weight 
Raging on too long and all will stay 
Unsolved

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know
I ought to grow
But do I ever?

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know
I ought to grow
But do I ever?

I let it
Take away all I could be 
Take all the best of me away with it
I let it
Take away all I could see 
Take all the best of me 
Away with it

I let it throw me off my feet 
I let it put me on my knees 
What do I know
I ought to grow
But do I ever?
I'll let it tell me who to be
I'll let it show me what to see 
What do I know
I ought to grow
But do I ever?

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know
I ought to grow
But do I ever?

I let it tell me who to be
I let it show me what to see
What do I know
I ought to grow
But do I ever?
Do I ever?
