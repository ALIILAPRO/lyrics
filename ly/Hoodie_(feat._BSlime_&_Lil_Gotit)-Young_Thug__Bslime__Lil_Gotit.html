		  (Southside on the track, yeah)
Yeah, that's my buddy, buddy
What about (Metro)

That's my buddy, buddy, drinkin' on the muddy
Pass it all off to the dogs, let 'em cut it
Make sure you let her experience her nutty
Put the dick all in as our ribs end up gutted
Drake and Kid Cudi actin' all slutty in front company
Trayvon hoodie, know it's all goodie
Don Juan pimpin' bitches, black tees, hoodies
Durag business

Lookin' all funky, but savin' all your cookies
Act to the right, red for the rookies
Ass on the right, hand on her left
Bunch of wealthy rich guys like I sell it (yeah, like I sell it)

And you was supposed to call me back
But I'm glad you didn't 'cause I got busy
I just got a call, one of my brothers got whacked
It was time to rise, lit the sticks in them masses
You know if I pass, you won't get a call back and
If I hit you back, you know we deaded the madness
Round of applause, we one to one in this battle
Mama say she look at my eyes and see a casket
Daddy said he looked at my eyes, he see a bastard
I won't hit you back, you never could've imagined
Round of applause, you think you winnin' the battle
No, I don't wanna lose so I Casper
I was rockin' Jimmy Choo's on my first tour
I still was thinkin' like a fool on my first tour
Now I'm on my worst tour

That's my buddy, buddy, drinkin' on the muddy
Pass it all off to the dogs, let 'em cut it
Make sure you let her experience her nutty
Put the dick all in as our ribs end up gutted
Drake and Kid Cudi actin' all slutty in front company
Trayvon hoodie, know it's all goodie
Don Juan pimpin' bitches, black tees, hoodies
Durag business

Rich stepper, let's begin, I got a million on the coast
Thousand better, thousand shooters
Y'all, I been on C-Low
Cash pryer, let her cash it in and left her with a note
Never beat, niggas, ain't ever-ever (no)
Pooh-manji, we devise, we like to swap buy (we like to swap buy)
Droptop, we pushin' P, she got her a cockeye, cockeye
Sham, bank rolls, they brung the prop' side (prop' side)
Ain't no switchin' sides, I'm with the gas shit 'til I pass out

Now they say they feelin' us (yeah), but reality, they ain't as big as us (nah)
Fuck her every night, I know fo' sure, she catchin' many nuts (body count)
Cali distro sendin' boxes through just like a Pizza Hut
Put it on, then eat it up (eat it), flooded down as my pieces up
Drop the top, you stab me in the wind
I be feelin' like a DJ when I tell her spin (three sixty)
Ran up all these millions so I went, copped another bitch (skrrt)
Don't let my fuckin' brother near my Rolly
Not my twin (Keed, Keed)

That's my buddy, buddy, drinkin' on the muddy
Pass it all off to the dogs, let 'em cut it
Make sure you let her experience her nutty
Put the dick all in as our ribs end up gutted
Drake and Kid Cudi actin' all slutty in front company
Trayvon hoodie, know it's all goodie
Don Juan pimpin' bitches, black tees, hoodies
Durag business

Lookin' all funky, but savin' all your cookies
Act' to the right, red for the rookies
Ass on the right, hand on her left
Bunch of wealthy rich guys like I sell it
Like I sell it
