		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep thinking that I'm seeing water 
You're playing tricks on me in the sun 
See your shadow in the courtyard
Stays until the day is done

The desert don't end
The rain don't fall 
And I can't pretend I don't want you all 
'Cause I want you all (you all, you all, you all)

Oh, babe, I really need you (need you)
My feelings getting deeper (deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions (emotions) 
I'm flowing like the ocean (ocean)
I pray for your devotion (devotion)
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you 

My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you

Wait a minute, tell me why you're moving like that?
Nah, you wey I choose, but you make it so hard
I gave you my heart, you're making it so dark
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You taking it for granted
A lot of silence, the river don't end
'Cause I want you all, yeah
(You all, you all, you all)

Oh, babe, I really need you (no, baby)
My feelings getting deeper (deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions (emotions) 
I'm flowing like the ocean (ocean)
I pray for your devotion (devotion)
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you 

My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you

I remember say me tell you, you're my hell and you're my heaven to me, to me, to me

Oh, oh, oh
