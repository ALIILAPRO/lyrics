Pequeno Juan
Let's get this thing jumpin'

Hold up
Three, two, one, let's go now
We don't pull up 'til the party's jumpin'
Ese culo twerkin', jumpin'
Too lit, I can't stop jumpin'
Todo el mundo brincando (jumpin')
It's your birthday, girl, get jumpin'
Dale loca, toma (jumpin')
Dale loca, toma (jumpin')
Another round of shots, this party's jumpin'

Pack it up, pack it in, I came to sin
And if she's with me, you know she's a 10
Quarterback, sack 'em, billions, stack 'em
8 ball corner pocket, game over, rack 'em
Get up, stand up, come and get your hands up
I was raised by Luke, so go and raise the roof (raise the roof)
I stay clean like a fresh triple beam
And in '93, it was all a dream
Brass monkey, that ass chunky
Pass me the voli and roll me the funky
She got an ass like a seven tre donk
and she don't make it clap, she make it jump

Hold up
Three, two, one, let's go now
We don't pull up 'til the party's jumpin'
Ese culo twerkin', jumpin'
Too lit, I can't stop jumpin'
Todo el mundo brincando (jumpin')
It's your birthday, girl, get jumpin'
Dale loca, toma (jumpin')
Dale loca, toma (jumpin')
Another round of shots, this party's jumpin'

Ladies shake your rump and keep them booties jumpin'
Ladies shake your rump and keep them booties jumpin'
Ladies shake your rump and keep them booties jumpin'
Ladies shake your rump and keep them booties jumpin'

If it's an IG pic, you know I don't trust it
But if she thick, then you know I'll buss it
I came to get down, we came to get down
Now throw your hands up and jump around

Hold up
Three, two, one, let's go now
We don't pull up 'til the party's jumpin'
Ese culo twerkin', jumpin'
Too lit, I can't stop jumpin'
Todo el mundo brincando (jumpin')
It's your birthday, girl, get jumpin'
Dale loca, toma (jumpin')
Dale loca, toma (jumpin')
Another round of shots, this party's jumpin'

Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump (hold up)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Another round of shots, this party's jumpin'
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump (hold up)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Another round of shots, this party's jumpin'
