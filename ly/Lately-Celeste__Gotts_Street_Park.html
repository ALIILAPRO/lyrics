		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want to put on pressure
When I'm talking to you
Don't want to give you lectures
But you've just got to move
Don't know where we went wrong
But I know who's gone
For me and for you

They used to envy you and us
I hate what we've become
Running 'round in circles
'Til no air is in my lungs
Cherish what you give me
Boy I need to be free
All this time I'm fighting

Lately, I've been tied up
Lately, I've been lying
Lately, I've been thinking about the way to shake my life up
Lately, I've been useless
Lately, I've been loose
Lately, I'm pushing through
I'll hold my hand tonight, if I have to
I'll always pay the price when I'm with you

Oh, lately
Oh, lately

Don't want to build you up 'cause
I know you're not that strong
I'll only let you down I know
I need to be on my own
Well I'm never in the right mood
When you come to my home
So if you hear the silence
Please leave your message after the tone

Looking through this
I didn't do this
I know
You know how slow time goes, oh god
But we stuck through it
It's done

Lately, I've been tied up
Lately, I've been lying
Lately, I've been thinking about the way to shake my life up
Lately, I've been useless
Lately, I've been loose
Lately, I'm pushing through
I'll hold my hand tonight, if I have to
I'll only pay the price when I'm with you

Oh, lately
Oh, lately

Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
