		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep holding
Keep holding on

Laying here awake at night
I was just a temporary high?
It's so hard to know
Unless you push all the distractions aside (hold tight)
Can you take the noise and drown it out?
I wanna hear your actions loud
And so, if you don't
Wanna give me up, then don't let me down

Show me where your love's at
Lately, I've been going out of my mind
Hoping maybe you can prove me wrong
Show me where your love's at
I'll keep holding on (three, two, one)

Keep holding on
And I keep holding on
Yeah, I'll keep holding on
Yeah, I'll keep holding on (oh)
Keep holding on
And I keep holding on (yeah)
Show me where your love's at
I'll keep holding on (oh)

I know when you hesitate
So please don't make me wait
'Cause it's so hard to know
When you give me too little too late

Show me where your love's at
Lately, I've been going out of my mind
Hoping maybe you can prove me wrong
Show me where your love's at
I'll keep holding on (I'll keep holding on)

Keep holding on
And I keep holding on
Yeah, I'll keep holding on
Yeah, I'll keep holding on (oh)
Keep holding on
And I keep holding on (yeah)
Show me where your love's at
I'll keep holding on (I'll keep holding on)
Keep holding on (yeah, yeah)
And I keep holding on
Yeah, I'll keep holding on
Yeah, I'll keep holding on (hey)
Keep holding on
And I keep holding on
Show me where your love's at
I'll keep holding on
