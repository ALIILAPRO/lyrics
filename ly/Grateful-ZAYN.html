		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see your mother's shine in your eye
I know that you're mine and I'd cry
Telling you the things that are on my mind
When I think of you

Yeah, I'm grateful for you
Love it when the rain comes down
Love it when the waves calm down
Yeah, I'm grateful for you

These days I live to my depiction
Nowadays I'm finding no affliction
These days I'm needing no restriction
Feel like I'm finding new addiction

And it feels good
And I knew it would
When I'm telling this story
It's complicated
Some mishaps I've been mourning
But I'm grateful for it

Yeah, I'm grateful for you
Love it when the rain comes down (yeah, I love it)
Love it when the waves calm down (when the waves calm down)
Yeah, I'm grateful for you

These days I live to my depiction
Nowadays I'm finding no affliction
These days I'm needing no restriction
Feel like I'm finding new addiction

Things change and I'm okay with what I'm not
It feels wasteful to be hateful
I'll be grateful for what I got
Things change and I'm okay with what I'm not
Feels wasteful to be hateful
I'll be grateful with what I got

These days I live to my depiction (yeah, I'm grateful)
Nowadays I'm finding no affliction (yeah, I'm grateful)
These days I'm needing no restriction (for you)
Feel like I'm finding new addiction (yeah, I'm grateful)
These days I live to my depiction (yeah, I'm grateful)
Nowadays I'm finding no affliction (yeah, I'm grateful)
These days I'm needing no restriction (for you)
Feel like I'm finding new addiction 

Yeah, I'm grateful for you
