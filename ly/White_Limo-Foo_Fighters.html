		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll take it out of the wishing well, I'm thinkin' I have a plan
Go on with your bad self, what do you see in yourself?
You think you're losin', it's time to stop accusin'
You're never gonna take a hit on the head
Now, if you don't care, take a ride somewhere

Hey, it has somethin' you want to try and buy yourself
Hey, it has somethin', it goes 'round and 'round again
Go, go, you should've never wasted your lung
Go, go, and the ride was shared

Go, limo
Go, limo

I guess you're stuck in the Habitrail, you gotta love this shit
Way out on a back shelf, you'll never know what you did
Look what you're doin', now mama said it's ruined
You had a mollusk in the palm of your hand
So, it's a bad smell, your ass won't win

Hey, it has somethin' you wanna try and buy yourself
Hey, it has somethin', it goes 'round and 'round and 'round again
Go, go, you never have been away so long
Go, go, and the ride was shared
Go, go, whatever happened to DayGlo thongs?
Go, go, and the ride was shared

Go, limo
Go, limo
Yeah, all right

Whoa
