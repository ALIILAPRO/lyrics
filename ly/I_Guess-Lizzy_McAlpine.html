		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Straighten your tie, we're not alone
I'll tell a lie just to bring you home
We danced together, you're not that good
I'll tell a lie but it's understood

I guess it's all about timing
I guess it's all about the things you want but never get
I guess it's all about trying
To love someone you've never met

We eat our dinner, then we undress
And now we're equal, more or less
Now I am sick and you're probably drunk
You're saying things and they sound like love

I guess it's all about timing
I guess it's all about the things you have but didn't want
I guess it's all about dying
To love someone

Wish it was easy, I wish I knew
What I was doing, but I never do (here we go)
