Police and soldier man
Every-day militant
Police and soldier man
Police and soldier man
Every-day militant

Still have to come shut niggas up 
'Cause they think they know what they see through a lens
Bug spray for these roaches and rats
Come see for yourself, I got cheese to defend
And if anyone tries going 0 - 100
Fuck him up before he reaches a 10
They know I'm trouble
But I keep so calm I'm reeking of zen
I'm like bro don't need another body 
I made him feel like he's speaking to Tems
Said I'm sober and cleansing my body but
Now I'm high and I'm geeking again
I'm outside on a weekend again
Freaky hoes dem leaching again
Leaking again, peeping the Benz
I don't want her so I'm breaching her friend
Getting this money is tough but it's easy to spend
They don't believe I'm the goat but we'll see in the end
You asked me to spit now I'm leaking the phlegm
You woke up a demon again

I dey come back now
Omo pompi swag
Omori na my shooter
Focus the lense
Then vomit am
Sniper
One shot
No jonze
Old soldier go flog this Gen-Z squad
Put up with it
Or keep am
You know the p
We too bad
Na their kele Dey blow my phone
Mizzle true pass

Shayo dey position
Make e dey go down
Bani dey hold man
Make we dey go kpansh
This na coup de tat
Now they calling me Obo
Invest in Mizzle stocks
Nobody go tell you make you no gock

A1 perico
Commot body o
Disappear like I'm DERICO
Eh
Who no go
No know
Take them to school o
Then polish them with ugo c ugo

Ugo c ugo

(Eh)

A1 perico
Commot body o
I go disappear like I'm DERICO (Derico)
Eh
Who no go
No know
Take them to school o
Then polish them with ugo c ugo

Ugo c ugo
