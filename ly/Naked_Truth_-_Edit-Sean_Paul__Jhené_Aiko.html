		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You kept me waiting, but I was patient
Now you're my favorite
Wasn't that hard to choose
Sex so amazing, I can't replace it
Don't wanna waste it

I wanna call you up sometimes
Whenever you cross my mind
Wanna go back in time, good love's hard to find
I know you remember when, we used to be more than friends
I know that was way back when
But can we- again?

Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth
Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth

Ain't no secret, you can keep
When I give it good to you
You want me and I want you
And that's the naked truth

Well, alright then
My girl, it's a while, long time
Say mi ready fi buss like it's dynamite
My style weh mi call it lion pride
See, my love girl, it's cyanide
Tha-that's right, that's right
Giving you all night, the longest ride
My girl a the strongest kind
Keep you floating, river Nile
Girl, the naked truth is
Need one night fi just handle mi bizz
The naked truth is

I wanna call you up sometimes
Whenever you cross my mind
Wanna go back in time, good love's hard to find
I know you remember when, we used to be more than friends
I know that was way back when
But can we - again?

Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth
Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth

Ain't no secret, you can keep
When I give it good to you
You want me and I want you
And that's the naked truth

Well, alright then
Bruk out, bruk out from a time yaa gal
Mi love out, love out when you wine yaa gal
Mi nuh plug out, plug out like wire signal
Nuh done out, done out you're my original
Gal, your body keep calling, calling
Mi a tell you take warning, warning
Mi will work you 'til a morning, morning
And there ain't no stalling, stalling
I'm giving you the best of loving
When you look inna your life
Gal you just discovering, you used to be suffering
You never get no bubbling
You never get no troubling
But now you keep coming in

You kept me waiting
But I was patient
Now your my favorite, ooh

Girl, I don't wanna talk too much (yeah)
I just wanna see your naked truth (ooh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
