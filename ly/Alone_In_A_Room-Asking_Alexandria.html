		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been away, a little while, sometimes I just can't help myself 
When my mind's running wild, I seem to lose grip on reality 
And I try to disregard the crazy things the voices tell me to do, but it's no use 
I tried to own it, write songs about it 
Believe me I tried, in the end I needed to breathe 
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose 
To take a second to face the shit that makes me, me 

All I needed was the last thing I wanted 
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud 
Every moment, every second, every trespass 
Every awful thing, every broken dream 
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage 
Banging my head against the wall tryna put words on a page 
All I needed was the last thing I wanted 
To be alone in a room, alone in a room 

I saw the world a couple times, tried to cure the ache with absence 
But that hole was still a hole and my mind kept playing tricks on me 
Feeling older every day, took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn 

Sometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope 
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground 
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here 
So I keep pushing the limits of what makes me 

All I needed was the last thing I wanted 
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud 
Every moment, every second, every trespass 
Every awful thing, every broken dream 
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage 
Banging my head against the wall tryna put words on a page 
All I needed was the last thing I wanted 
To be alone in a room, alone in a room 

(Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely)
I can be better than I was 
I can be better than I am 
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room

All I needed was the last thing I wanted 
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud 
Every moment, every second, every trespass 
Every awful thing, every broken dream 
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage 
Banging my head against the wall tryna put words on a page 
All I needed was the last thing I wanted 
To be alone in a room, alone in a room
