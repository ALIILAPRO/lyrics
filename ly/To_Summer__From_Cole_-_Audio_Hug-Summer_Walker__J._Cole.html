		  Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some love

Hey
Ms. Walker
Thank you for wantin' a verse from me
'Pologies for the wait, sometimes it's hard to
Get the distractions up off ya
For enough time to jot your thoughts
But fuck it, this morning I gotsta'
I'm thinkin' about ya
I heard you just had you another lil' baby
Congratulations
I hope you got through it with no complications
I find it amazing
The way that you juggle your kids
The biz, the fame
The bitches that's hatin'
They sit around waitin' for you to fall off
Like the album I'm makin'
But I hope that you takin'
A little time for yourself
Stealin' a moment or two to unwind
Between the hectic sounds of your precious baby cryin'
Do you clear your mind?
Must be a lot goin' on
I hear it in all of your songs
Niggas been doing you wrong
Family been doing you wrong
On days you feelin' like you on your own
I wrote this for you to put on
Thank you for sharin' your light, your voice
And writin' them beautiful poems
Session 32 bring me to tears
Be gettin' choked up when I hear it
Seem like I keep cryin'
Off so much since a nigga had these kids
And I don't know what it is
That made me so sensitive
More than I already was
But never mind that, I'm back, I'm sending you this little audio hug
In hopes that you smile
Forgettin' the stress that piles from all the above
The more that we hurt, the harder we love
As soon as it's gone, we gotta re-up
It's just like a drug
If people knew half of the pressure they'd know that it's hard to be her
I'm sending you, SZA, and Ari my love
Y'all holdin' us down, y'all holdin' the crowns
You ever need something from me don't hesitate, please
Just hit me and I'll be around
I'm gone

Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some, some love
