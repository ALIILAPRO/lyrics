		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I'm loungin' I got my man Donald Byrd 
I wanna give a big shout out to my little man Miko he's 2 years old 
He's away visiting his grandmom but I miss him dearly 

Check it out 
If I rhyme this you will find this situation shall advance 
You could take a glance or dance 
Elevator lyrics to arouse the crowd 
Now tell me who's the man to show you how 
Many legacies of brothers who get busy 
And I do it fluid til the suckers get dizzy 
Saying peace to the blackbirds 125th street 
And check the flow that's unique 
For loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 

Can't refuse this, never lose this, it's the choice this 
'Cause my voice is the smoothest 
Dominating to your boys 'cause I've been around doing work 
And sold tons of others jerk 
Donald Byrd word on the track, quite exact 
Giving you the format, Jack 
See we gotta pave the way and display 
How to loungin', loungin' 
Mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 

Peace to the pioneers but I gotta try to clear 
My throat, check out what I wrote 
You can't tap into this unless you know the roots 
Word shoe like life absolute 
For real so now you gotta know the deal 
For loungin', just loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin' mellow out, check it out and loungin' 

Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', peace to Brooklyn where I live 

Realistic, kind of mystic when I kick this 
You should witness the slickness 
Of the horn player and the dope rhymesayer 
Quite emotional and inspirational 
Philosophical and yes very logical 
Teaching you the method for loungin' 

Everybody knows they have times when they wanna just lay back 
Kick their feet up, you know 
Listen to some good music and just lounge 
That's right, I said lounge
