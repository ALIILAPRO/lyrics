		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My bitch way too boujee
Your bitch ain't too special
And your bitch got good pussy but
My bitch got good credit
Thumbin' the hundreds like pussy
I found out that I got me a fetish
Coppers, they tryna come get me
I'm smashin' my foot on the pedal
I seen how the world is so cold
So I had to go cop me some metal
I feel like Malcolm, I
Got four, five bitches
Just me in the middle
She tell me, "Smack it, " oh, no no
She don't wanna be treated civil
And it's still free Bugga and free all
My dogs out of the kennel

He on fuck shit
I could read that lil' ass boy like a Kindle
Told myself one day I'ma have me
A Lambo' like my cousin Kendall
He ain't want smoke, okay, okay
So what is you tryna' get into?
Came a long ass way from sittin'
On my ass and playin' Nintendo
I made fifty thousand dollars on
My ass this year i been workin' my ass off
For the past six years in that Hellcat
Can't be caught once it's past sixth gear
I heard every lie you thought
Was gon' pass this ear
Not makin' my mama proud is
The only thing I fear
Ain't speakin' of cash amounts, nigga
I ain't tryna hear
Walk in, she start passin' out, she like
"What you doin' here?"
It really don't matter now what I
Went through all them years pops told me
"Don't ever let your backbone
Hit that damn wall"
Yeah, he told me, "If you wanna
Do it, then you can, dawg"
Daddy told me, "Okay, now it's
Time to be a man, son"
Mama always told me
I was smart and I was handsome
Any nigga try me, bitch
This pretty boy gon' jam some
We pull up and we air your shit out, yeah
We gon' fan some lotta' niggas talkin' shit
But really he my damn son
Bitch, I been that nigga since
I had a fuckin' Samsung

My bitch way too boujee
Your bitch ain't too special
And your bitch got good pussy but
My bitch got good credit
Thumbin' the hundreds like pussy
I found out that I got me a fetish
I think I'm finna go vegan
Dem niggas finna only eat lettuce
She want it right now, yeah
Want me to slide right in her crevice
I fell in love with the way
She say my name, shit
Almost flew her to Paris damn, she bad
But honestly she really ain't
Nothin' to cherish
I treat all my bitches like shit
But I guess that's what you call fairness

Damn, she bad, but honestly she really ain't
Nothin' to cherish
I treat all my bitches like shit
But I guess that's what you call fairness
I treat all my bitches like shit
But I guess that's what you call fairness
