		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The hardest part is heavy on my mind
The years are gone but my mind still rewinds

I don't wanna go
Go, go, go cuz it'll kill me
I'm losing what I know
Go go go get a memory 

I miss you more than I remember you
I miss you more than I remember you
It hit me in the head
I'll forget when I'm dead
I miss you more than I remember you

I miss you more than I remember you

Like a dream that's twisted on itself
Speeding down memory lane never helps

And I don't wanna go
Go, go, go cuz it'll kill me
I'm searching for shelter inside of my past

I miss you more than I remember you
I miss you more than I remember you
You hit me in the head
I'll forget when I'm dead
I miss you more than I remember you

I miss you more than I remember you

I don't forget, I love the regret
I'm not a mess I shed all the stress
Rekindle a path that I know 
I can't find a reason I know that 

I miss you more than I remember you
I miss you more than I remember you
You hit me in the head
I'll forget when I'm dead
I miss you more than I remember you

I miss you more than I remember you
