		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong
But the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na

Girl, I know
Mistakes were made between us two
And we showed our ass that night
Even said some things weren't true
Watched you go
And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was
'Cause you were my homie, lover and friend

I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na

I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watchin' every day that goes by (I miss you much)
Until I get you back, I'm gon' try (yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl, I miss you much)
(I miss you much)
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watchin' every day that goes by (I miss you much)
Until I get you back, I'm gon' try (yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl, I miss you much)
(I miss you much)

I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na

I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you could dine with me)
The one that'll grind with me (said the one that'll grind with me)
I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (oh, miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you could dine)
The one that'll grind with me (oh, one that'll grind, yeah, yeah)

I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na (make up)
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na (link up, baby)
I wanna make up right now, na, na
I wanna make up right now, na, na
Wish we never broke up right now, na, na
We need to link up right now, na, na (link up)
