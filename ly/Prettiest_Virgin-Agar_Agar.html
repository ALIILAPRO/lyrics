		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was dark and the moon was out
I wore the prettiest dress
And I couldn't wait to dance all night on the dance floor
I felt so beautiful, worth my sparkles
Jenny drove us and we stole a bottle of wine from the basement

The minute I came and I saw you
You were beautiful, the prettiest guy in the whole crowd
Gorgeous beard with colorful ends, colorful ends

Come on dance with me
Come on, come on dance with me

I heard your name was Dan, I felt the word D-A-N 
Rolling in my mind
And I licked my lips, while looking at you fly
I wish you could see me, look at me
Ask me to spend the whole night with you, on the dance floor
'Cause I crave you, I crave you, I crave you tonight

Come on dance with me, come on dance with me
Give me a wink if you want me to faint
And I know you want me 'cause you push me down tonight
Come on dance with me, come on dance with me
Give me a wink if you want me to faint
And I know you want me
Give me a wink if you want me to faint

I see them looking at you
You were beautiful
Now I'm crying 'cause I know I can't kiss you
I want our lips to touch, to burn
Feel the pleasure in my skin
Yeah, yeah, I'm the prettiest virgin
Talk to me, look at me, can't you see I can't take it?
I feel so lonely, I wish I could kiss you under the table

Come on dance with me, come on dance
Give me a wink if you want to me to faint and I know you want me
Ah, gve me a wink if you want to me to faint and I know you want me
