		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We turn Miami to Sky-ami
We do this without any shenani'
She ready, spaghetti (yeah, yeah)
I'm throwin' them baguettes (yeah, yeah)
I'm cuttin' shit up like machete (uh)
More hundo, the solo, I'm ripped
The king, I'm the GOAT, I'm your daddy
Put my finger in her pussy, VVS'
Hit her like a porn star, I came heavy
She can tell my persona, that's the difference
Put it down in her tonsils
I'm responsible, bitch, I'm doin' my numbers
No matter what I done conquered
I'm goin' back in and goin' bonkers
Bad bitch, she wearin' a different bag in all her pics
As long as she listenin', ain't doin' nothin suspicions, know that bitch be glistenin'

Bitch inspire me, get more money and I go out to get it
Bitch massagin' me, 'cause she know I'm gettin' these mil's consistent
Bitch massagin' me, 'cause she know I'm gettin' this money consistent
Bitch massagin' me, 'cause she know I'm gettin' these racks consistent
Bitch massagin' me, 'cause she know I'm gettin' these racks consistent

Tell me you proud of me
Every time I come through and I hit it, no one fly as me
I been like this since-since I was an infant, they on gang time
Soon as I get off the jet, I'm in the trenches throwin' up gang signs
I know how to take this cash and go and flip it
I go in the bank now
Tell 'em to bring it out and break out
Go to Bal Harbour
Turn the Chanel store to a hangout
Bigger than Rocko
Bitch, get close to me and faint now
Must be star-struck
Anything else gettin' gunned down

Bitch inspire me, get more money and I go out to get it
Stay on gang time
Soon as I get off the jet, I'm in the trenches throwin' up gang signs
I know how to take this cash and go and flip it
Go to Bal Harbour
Turn the Chanel store to a hangout

And bitch massagin' me 'cause she know I'm gettin' these mil's consistent
Bitch massagin' me, 'cause she know I'm gettin' this money consistent
Bitch massagin' me, 'cause she know I'm gettin' these racks consistent
Bitch massagin' me, 'cause she know I'm gettin' these racks consistent

Gettin' these racks, gettin' these racks
