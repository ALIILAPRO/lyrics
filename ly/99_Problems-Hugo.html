		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one

Tip my hat to the sun in the west
Feel the beat right in my chest
At the crossroads a second time
Make the devil change his mind.
It's a pound of flesh but it's really a ton
99 problems and a bitch ain't one

If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
99 problems
But a bitch ain't one.

Like broken glass under my feet
I could lose my mind in this heat
Looking for the prize but I don't want blood
I order one drink then I drink the flood
Well, you can come inside but your friends can't come
99 problems and a bitch ain't one

If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
I got 99
99
99
99
99 problems
But a bitch ain't one.

99
99 problems and about a bitch ain't one
