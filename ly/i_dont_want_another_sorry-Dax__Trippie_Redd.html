		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After they hurt you the first time, leave
(Ay, this a Trademark production)
'Cause if they'll do it once
They'll do it again (Stillsanexile)

Never thought you'd leave, never thought it would end (yeah, uh)
Look at all the pain that you caused me
Fuck it, I don't want another sorry, uh
S-sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
And I don't want another sorry
Sorry, you're not sorry
I never thought this shit would end
End (yo, uh)

Two wrongs don't make a right
I turned left
Now you mad I don't pick up
I don't return texts
Like I'm supposed to, let it slide, what, and just forget
That you destroyed everything we had, what
Just for sex, fuck that
I'm angry, I'm depressed and I'm mad
Reminiscing over days, living life in the past (why?)
How'd you do that shit? Was I really that bad? (Crazy)
I even let you stay, huh
I even let you meet my dad
I don't know where we go 
But I know that you're not for me, you're not for me
Ay yo, ay yo

Never thought you'd leave, never thought it would end (yeah, uh)
Look at all the pain that you caused me
Fuck it, I don't want another sorry, uh
S-sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
And I don't want another sorry
Sorry, you're not sorry
I never thought this shit would end
End (yeah)

I'm sorry, it was a mistake
Every fucking day another heartbreak
I can't take this pain, how much my heart aches
There won't be nothing left
Said you not sorry, not sorry either
Told you I would love you to the moon and to the ether
She think that I'm stupid and I peeped her
Told her I'll move on by myself, I need to leave her, yeah (yeah)

Never thought you'd leave, never thought it would end (yeah, uh)
Look at all the pain that you caused me (yeah)
Fuck it, I don't want another sorry, uh
S-sorry
I never thought this shit would end, end
And I don't want another sorry
Sorry, you're not sorry
I never thought this shit would end
End
