		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you'd yell, I would stay silent
You never noticed I was quiet
I was taught that speaking up was talking back

Always first to say I'm sorry
'Cause I wanted you to like me
And I thought that's what it took to make it last

It's a lose-lose
That I don't choose
But you don't always choose the ones you love

I shouldn't have to be the bigger person
How come I have to break to keep us workin'?
It's always up to me
Even though it shouldn't be
I will take the blame the way you want me to
'Cause that's what I do for you

I was half of this dynamic
I was stable, you were manic
Without you or with you comes with a cost

I got used to the excuses
And emotional abuses
We kept moving the lines we'd never cross

It's a lose-lose
That I don't choose
But you don't always choose the ones you love

I shouldn't have to be the bigger person
How come I have to break to keep us workin'?
It's always up to me
Even though it shouldn't be
I will take the blame the way you want me to
'Cause that's what I do for you

I always think it's over
But it never really is
'Cause I can't get the closure
When you're like this
Can we switch?

Maybe this time, you'll be the bigger person
'Cause I'm gettin' tired of bearin' all your burden
It should be up to you
But you won't admit the truth, ohh-oh-ohh

I shouldn't have to be the bigger person
How come I have to break to keep us workin'?
It's always up to me
Even though it shouldn't be
I'll take the blame the way you want me to
'Cause that's what I do for you
