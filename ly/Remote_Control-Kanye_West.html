		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't ask again, who's up in the van?
They my only fans
I was in my hovercraft, had another laugh
How you roll with them? When you know I'm him

Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control, like a CEO
I thought you should know

On my Instagram, it get outta hand
Why you so mad?

He got it on remote control like a CEO
Feelin' like the man, feelin' like the man
I was in my hovercraft, floating down the path
God just grabbed my hand, had a bigger plan

He got this on remote control
He got it on remote control
'Trol

Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
I just, uh, I owe you a load
I live on the Titanic (oh), I can rock your boat
Just hoppin' out the brand new Rolls (skrrt, skrrt)
Hoppin' out the brand new Rolls (skrrt, skrrt)
Jesus sent me brand new clothes (skrrt, skrrt)
Wrist still thirty-two below (yeah)
I want my mob ties to shine (hah)
I could caress your mind with the right time (time)
Don't you give your love up, this is the right sign (sign), sign (yeah)

I treat you lovely and righteous and kind (hah)
And we'll be lasting with one another until we die (yeah)
I'd give you kids at the drop of a dime (dime)
Oh-whoa, told the b-, fold my clothes (fold my clothes)
Take it to the light like a strobe (yeah)
Taking me to court like O (taking me to court like OJ)
Paparazzi sleep at my door
I just thought that you should know (sleep at my door)
I get frozen like the North Pole
Don't you freeze up on the pole

He got this on remote control like a sink in gold
He got it, no fight, no more meds, twilight in the game
He got it on my hovercraft, have another laugh
Pop on a handstand, twilight in demand

He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control, like that's to know
Should know

"Ooh, ha-ha-ha, mmh, splendid
Simply delicious, oh, ha-ha-ha
I am the Glob-glo-gab-galab
The shwabble-dabble-wabble-gabble flibba blabba blab"
