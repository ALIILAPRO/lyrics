		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to think I would spend every second I have
Right where my story began
I'd be happy here
Every day, month, year of my life
But now I'm wishing for whatever comes after goodbye
On every star in the sky
And I'm dreaming of what I could become

This is where home will be
As long as my lungs can breathe
But my heart is dying to leave
'Cause I know there's more to me

I don't wanna live with "What ifs", "Might haves"
"Could have been if I had, only tried not held back"
Oh no, that's not a part of my plan
That's not the me that I
That's not the me that I am

This time there's no looking back (no looking back)
I'm crossing things off my list (crossing things off my list)
Don't wanna run out of time before I wake up and find
There was a life that I missed (oh)
My limit doesn't exist

I don't wanna live with "What ifs", "Might haves"
"Could have been if I had, only tried not held back"
Oh no, that's not a part of my plan
That's not the me that I am
No "What ifs", regrets
Wear my strengths and weakness
I would hide my feelings
Oh no, that's not a part of my plan
That's not the me that I am
