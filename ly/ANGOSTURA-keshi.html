		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, I can't lie, you been on my mind again
Go 'round one more time, yeah, we can do things you like
You don't need a reason for it
Tell me what you need, make it easy for ya
All of this talk ain't enough
Are you down to see me or what?
When you come through, you know I got you
Babe, I got you

So tell me when you roll through the H
Goddamn, girl, you look amazing
Babe, we can drink it all away
Whatchu say, whatchu say, whatchu s-? (keshi)

Pour me up another, let it go, I
Kick it with my brothers and it's alright
I just want a lover for the whole night, yeah
Whole night, whole night
Pour me up another, let it go, I
Kick it with my brothers and it's alright
I just want a lover for the whole night
For the whole night, yeah, whole night

Body get hot like sauna
Ice on the wrist, big comma
Baby girl, come bring it back, back, back
You can take all the time you wanna
'Cause I ain't in a rush to meet ya
Small talk never meant much to me, nah
We're face to face with it, love
Go waist to waist with it, ya
When you come through, you know I got you
Babe, I got you

So tell me when you roll through the H
Goddamn, girl, you look amazing
Babe, we can drink it all away
Whatchu say, whatchu say, whatchu say?

Pour me up another, let it go, I
Kick it with my brothers and it's alright
I just want a lover for the whole night, yeah
Whole night, whole night
Pour me up another, let it go, I
Kick it with my brothers and it's alright
I just want a lover for the whole night (for the whole night)
For the whole night, yeah, whole night (for the whole night, yeah)
