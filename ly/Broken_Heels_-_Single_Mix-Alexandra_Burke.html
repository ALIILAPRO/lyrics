		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey
RedOne, you know I can do it better than you
I can do it even better in broken heels

Hey, hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels

I roll my sleeves up, wrap my hair up
There's no sign on the road so I never stop
Can you catch me? Yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll never catch me, ay, ay, ay

I'm fresh out the box, fast like a fox
Boss in my shoes, tick tock, 12 o'clock
You better watch me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sit back and watch me, ay, ay, ay

You go hard, yes, you do
But when I go it's a magic show
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I get it when I want it and I get it right

Hey, hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better with broken heels

Hey, hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels

Anything you can do I can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken heels
Anything you can do we can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken, broken heels

When you step it up I'm 20 levels up
I took the escalator, elevator to the top
How you like me? Yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta like me, ay, ay, ay

Oh, you know we rock, we control the block
Whatever's going down, ladies take the biggest cut
We bring the party, yeah, yeah, yeah
We bought the party, ay, ay, ay

You go hard, yes, you do
But when I go it's a magic show
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I get it when I want it and I get it right

Hey, hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels

Hey, hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels

Anything you can do I can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken heels
Anything you can do we can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken, broken heels

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey, hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels

Hey, hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels

Anything you can do I can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken heels
Anything you can do we can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken, broken heels

Anything you can do I can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken heels
Anything you can do we can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken, broken heels
