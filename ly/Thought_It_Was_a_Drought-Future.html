		  Dirty soda, Spike Lee, white girl, Ice T
Fully loaded AP, yeah

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot now
I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the Xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash can't even stay in the house 'cause there's too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent I was too far behind
Fuck 'em two at a time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at
Niggas know I ain't lying, niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym, I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ay

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her "bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
'Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put the hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp' on me now
Stacking the Styrofoams up by the door
They don't let me back in, they ain't know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a Percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I'm working on having some manners
I'm thinking about it right now
I'm holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured up Actavis
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
