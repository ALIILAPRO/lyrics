		  Hello, Dolly
This is Louis, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
So take her wrap, fellas find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
So golly, gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Promise you'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again
