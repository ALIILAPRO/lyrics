		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's yo birthday, so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip mo-eezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good, but I know you want to cry out
You say u want passion, I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switching positions, you feel surrounded
Tell me where you want your gift, girl

Girl you know I,I,I, girl you know I,I,I
I been fiending
Wake up in the late night
Been dreaming about your loving, girl
Girl you know I,I,I, girl you know I,I,I
Don't need candles or cake
Just need your body to make you
Birthday sex
Birthday sex oh oh oh oh
(It's the best day of the year girl)
Birthday sex
Birthday sex oh oh oh oh
(If he's, he's, he's, let me hit that g,spot g,spot girl)

See you sexy in them jeans got me on ten
One, two, three think I got you pinned
Don't tap out, fight until the end
Ring that bell, and we gon' start over again
We grinding with passion, 'cause it's your birthday
Been at it for hours, I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly, taste just like Hershey's
Just tell me how you want you gift, girl

Girl you know I,I,I, girl you know I,I,I
I been fiending
Wake up in the late night
Been dreaming about your loving, girl
Girl you know I,I,I, girl you know I,I,I
Don't need candles or cake
Just need your body to make you
Birthday sex
Birthday sex oh oh oh oh
(It's the best day of the year girl)
Birthday sex
Birthday sex oh oh oh oh
(If he's, he's, he's, let me hit that g-spot g-spot girl)

First, I'm gonna take a dive into the water deep
Until I know I please that body (body) aaah oooh
Or girl without a broom I might just sweep you off yo feet
And make you wanna tell somebody (body) how I do
Or maybe we can float on top my water bed (bed)
You close your eyes as I improv between your legs
We work our way from kitchens, stoves and tables
Girl, you know I'm more than able to please yeah
You say you wanted flowers on the bed (on the bed)
But you got me in hours on the bed

Girl you know I,I,I, girl you know I,I,I
I been fiending
Wake up in the late night
Been dreaming about your loving, girl
Girl you know I,I,I, girl you know I,I,I
Don't need candles or cake
Just need your body to make you
Birthday sex
Birthday sex oh oh oh oh
(It's the best day of the year girl)
Birthday sex
Birthday sex oh oh oh oh
(If he's, he's, he's, let me hit that g-spot g-spot girl)
