Bruh, you seen this shawty?
With like the fattest ass, no cap
Like damn, that's a whole ass bakery
Damn, what she look like?
She's like a

E-girl with a fat ass
Ripped jeans, striped tee, with a big rack
Pink hair, fishnet, and it's all black
Converse and a Hello Kitty backpack
Studded belt with a long chain
Nose ring, no sleep, and some cocaine
I'ma hit it from the back, tell her rotate
And she like that alt rock, put on Cobain
E-girl with a fat ass
Ripped jeans, striped tee, with a big rack
Pink hair, fishnet, and it's all black
Converse and a Hello Kitty backpack
Studded belt with a long chain
Nose ring, no sleep, and some cocaine
I'ma hit it from the back, tell her rotate (yuh, yuh, yuh)
And she like that alt rock, put on Cobain

Yeah, e-girl with them thick thighs
Always talking 'bout the dick, I know you miss mine
Shaking ass in the fishnet, pressing rewind
Dressed in all black like she Codie
Tailored in a baggy fit, drip like nose bleeds (nose bleeds)
She always off the drugs, sippin' codeine (codeine)
Talk to me about my music like you know me
She say I'm too fast, she take it slowly
Slowly, like

E-girl with a fat ass
Ripped jeans, striped tee, with a big rack
Pink hair, fishnet, and it's all black
Converse and a Hello Kitty backpack
Studded belt with a long chain
Nose ring, no sleep, and some cocaine
I'ma hit it from the back, tell her rotate
And she like that alt rock, put on Cobain
E-girl with a fat ass
Ripped jeans, striped tee, with a big rack
Pink hair, fishnet, and it's all black
Converse and a Hello Kitty backpack
Studded belt with a long chain
Nose ring, no sleep, and some cocaine
I'ma hit it from the back, tell her rotate
And she like that alt rock, put on Cobain
