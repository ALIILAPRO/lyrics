		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

Five a.M. On the bathroom floor 
From the night before
Do you find me dreadful?
What a shame, such a sad disgrace
Such a pretty face 
But she's not regretful

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

It's killing time again
Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again

Three a.M. On the city street
When the air is sweet
I've had my mouthful
But it seems that I'm tired of screams
Such a pretty face
Up in will look dreadful, oh

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

It's killing time again
Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again
It's killing time again
Cover your face and we'll pretend
These killing lights can't kill us all again

You seem to always remember
We never forget a face
When we cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut they remember
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up
Cut you up

It's killing time again
Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again
It's killing time again
Cover your face and we'll pretend
These killing lights can't kill us all again
All again
All again
It's time again
It's killing time
