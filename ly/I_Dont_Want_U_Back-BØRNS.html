		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was last week
You ran out of the house
I heard his sparkomatic
And when you came back
I felt you losing touch
I knew you couldn't be trusted

I should've known better when you're coming to bed at four in the morning
I should've taken your eyes avoiding mine as a warning
Every time I ask you what's up baby you're changing your story
Just so you know that when you go I ain't begging for you back

I sleep better than every night you were lying next to me
Don't wanna see your face, you need to face the facts
I don't want you back
I don't want you back

Another year passed
Another Friday night
You showed up at the disco
And when we caught eyes
The room started to spin
And my heart nearly busted

I should've known better but the liquor got me thinking I miss ya
I should've taken two steps back but I wanted to kiss ya
Every time you flash those eyes you make me reminisce ya
You're looking fine, but I'd be lying, if I said I wanted you back

The bigger the lies the harder they fall
The hotter the fire, the faster the love is gonna burn up
The hotter the fire, the smoke and the mirrors
Its clear i'm better off without ya

Heartbeats
Are made of honesty
And all this time wasn't just you and me
It's sad to say, I'm glad you left
I don't want you back
I don't want you back
I don't want you back
