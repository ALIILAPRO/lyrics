		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something cold and blank 
Behind her smile 
She's standing on an overpass 
In her miracle mile 

'Cause you were from a perfect world 
A world that threw me away today, today, today
To run away

A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself

Her mouth was an empty cut 
And she was waiting to fall 
Just bleeding like a Polaroid 
That lost all her dolls 

You were from a perfect world 
A world that threw me away today, today, today
To run away

A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself

A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself

You were from a perfect world 
A world that threw me away today 

A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself

A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself
