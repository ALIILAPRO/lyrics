		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you fall into that raven night
With sigh and woe and lonely path ?

This song is for the demons
That haunted you in those loveless lonely nights
And for the shadows that stained your soul
For the echoes of your loss

This song is for your forgiveness
For the sadness I knifed in your heart
For the road that lies ahead
With fear and hope, loss and salvation

Did you wake with a sigh and not a smile, did you ?
Did you hear the ravens woe in this exaulted night ?
This very night

This song is for the demons
That haunted me in those loveless lonely nights
And for the shadows that stained my soul
For the echoes of my loss

This song is for my forgiveness
For the sadness you knifed in my heart
For the road that lies ahead
With fear and hope, loss and salvation
