		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can never pass up, lay it down
Long backstrokes in the middle of your ocean
I'mma need that ass up, face down
If I get in, then I just might drown
Slippin' and slidin'
Slippin' and slidin'
I could swim in it all night and
Slippin' and slidin' it in
I just slip in then I slide in
I just slip in then I slide in

Dumb bitch, do your dumb dance
Like Juicy J said "They ain't usin' hands"
It's halftime, got hella bands
Even white girls with spray tans
Yeah, let me see it
Yeah, I like it when you bend over bitch
For a real nigga, I'm a big tipper
You ain't gotta be a stripper
I politic and she with it
I ain't trippin' to hit it
Titties, hundreds and fifties
Turning up in your city
Later she leaving with me
Now you see me, I'm

I can never pass up, lay it down
Long backstrokes in the middle of your ocean
I'mma need that ass up, face down
If I get in, then I just might drown
Slippin' and slidin'
I could swim in it all night and
Slippin' and slidin'
I just slip in then I slide in
I just slip in then I slide in

Uh, lights up, damn I'm feeling hella cocky
I'm just from the bottom tryna get some topy
Diamonds got my mami screaming "Hello papi"
Said she put in work and need it hella hobby
Bust it, bust it, she get hella sloppy
I just hate it in the moments I can't put on IG
I know your man be trippin' but really that is not me
But if I wasn't me then who the hell would I be?
Cameras rolling we should make a scene or two
Slip and sliding got me thinking, what would Trina do?"
She seen you staring at me, got me feeling
Like Ray Allen we get them hoes in 3's
How we in the thug Cabana at The Palms in LV
Swimming your ocean all night, might as well go overseas
Is you rolling? Know I really roll, row with me
Spinking go get all them hoes they comin' home with me

I can never pass up, lay it down
Long backstrokes in the middle of your ocean
I'mma need that ass up, face down
If I get in, then I just might drown
Slippin' and slidin'
Slippin' and slidin'
I could swim in it all night and
Slippin' and slidin'
I just slip in then I slide in
I just slip in then I slide in
