		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I don't belong here
'Cause I don't belong here
'Cause I don't belong here

Those days, it was all I wanted, nowadays, it feels all the same
Used to stare at my bedroom ceiling
Wishing everything could change
Now it's hard when you're always searching
For the life that you left behind
Time disappears, year after year
How the hell did I get here? ('Cause)

I feel so far away
Minutes turn to hours and the hours into days, I gave up everything
You don't know what you got until you throw it all away
'Cause I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I don't belong, I don't belong
I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I don't belong

Looking back on the past, all the time I wasted
Running from everyone that tells me that I'm fading out
Must be mistaken 'cause I, I, I don't feel anything
You know I got this brain, it drives me insane
Some days I feel I can't take the pain, I'm gone
I can't explain it 'cause I, I, I don't need anything (no)

I feel so far away, minutes turn to hours and the hours into days
I gave up everything, you don't know what you got until you throw it all away
'Cause I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I don't belong, I don't belong
I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I don't belong
