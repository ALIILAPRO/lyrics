		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so used to you
On the left side, on the left side of the bedside
I'm so used to you
And if you 
Find somebody new on the west side, on the west side
Live your best life
Out there in the blue
Woah-oh

I pictured this, I pictured this in my head
But shit was looking different
And if this is it, if this is as good as it gets
I think I wanna give it

All the way, all the way
All the way
All the way, all the way
All the way, yeah

I'm not used to you
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye 
For the all time
I'm not used to you
You know

I pictured this, I pictured this in my head
But shit was looking different
And if this is it, if this is as good as it gets
I think I wanna give it

All the way, all the way
All the way
All the way, all the way
All the way, yeah

(Way, yeah)
(Way)
(Way, yeah)

All the way, all the way
All the way
All the way, all the way (woah)
All the way, yeah (ohh)
All the way, all the way (ohh)
All the way
All the way, all the way (ohh)
All the way, yeah (oh)
