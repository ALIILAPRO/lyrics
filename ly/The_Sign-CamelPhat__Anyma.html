		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

I'm broken, I'm broken
With words left unspoken
This silence won't let me be

Confusion, illusion
In my seclusion
I need you to speak to me

'Cause in my confusion
It's all an illusion
This silence won't let me be
'Cause in my confusion
It's all an illusion
I need you to speak to me

Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign

Speak to me
Speak to me

Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign

How long do I have to wait?
How long do I have to cry?
How long do I have to wait?
How long do I have to wait?
How long do I have to cry?
How long do I have to wait?

Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign
Waiting on a sign
