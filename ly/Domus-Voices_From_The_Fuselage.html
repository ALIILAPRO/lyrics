		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't see the lion's den that you just backed in.
Watch them feed on your hind legs as your children dread.
A shame that fills you from head to toe as you plead let go'.

There's nowhere that I'd rather be.
Second-guessing me, double-crossing you.
I feel at home in this controversy.
Persecuting me, vindicating you. Home.

(That you just backed in.
Watch them feed on your hind legs as your children dread.
A shame that fills you from head to toe as you plead let go'.)

Let go of all the pain that floods your eyes.
Let me see the colours that shy away behind.
Let somebody else account for the damage you've been trying to hide.
Far & wide.
Don't be the prey.
Don't be the prey.
No.

There's nowhere that I'd rather be.
Second-guessing me, double-crossing you.
I feel at home in this controversy.
Persecuting me, vindicating you. Home.
I held your head for all to see.
High above the crowd, celebrating loud.
I feel at home in this controversy.
Persecuting me, vindicating you. Home.
