		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb
He's always choking from the stench and the fume
The wedding party all collapsed in the room
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom
Let's go down
This elevator only goes up to ten
He's not around
He's always looking at men
Down by the pool
He doesn't have many friends
As they are
Face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens

If you marry me
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

(So say goodbye) to the vows you take
(And say goodbye) to the life you make
(And say goodbye) to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

She keeps a picture of the body she lends
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends
She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz
She drives at ninety by the Barbies and Ken's
If you ever say never too late
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate
Lost in coma and covered in cake
Increase the medication
Share the vows at the wake
(Kiss the bride)

If you marry me
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

(So say goodbye) to the vows you take
(And say goodbye) to the life you make
(And say goodbye) to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

(And say goodbye) to the last parade
(And walk away) from the choice you made
(And say goodnight) to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

(So say goodbye) to the vows you take
(And say goodbye) to the life you make
(And say goodbye) to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

(And say goodbye) to the last parade
(And walk away) from the choice you made
(And say goodnight) to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

To the last parade
When the parties fade
And the choice you made
To the end
