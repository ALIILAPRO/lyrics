		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no, she likes another boy
And I'm feeling sad
And at the end of the day
I'll know there was something that we had
I see her kiss him with my eyes
And it makes me mad
But at the end of the day
I know she don't love him that bad

And if that's so
I'll wait around
'Cause it will take a little time to let you go

I watch her from across the room
She dances so nice
And if I see her again
I'm not so sure we'll just be friends
I want to get a little close
So let me in
And if you push me away
Baby, that's where I'll stay

And if that's so
I'll wait around
'Cause it will take a little time to let you go
And if that's so
I'll wait around
'Cause it will take a little time to let you go

And if that's so
I'll wait around
'Cause it will take a little time to let you go
