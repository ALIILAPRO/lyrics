		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a fire
These dreams they pass me by
This salvation I desire
Keeps getting me down
'Cause we need to
Recognize mistakes
For time and again
So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail

'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, sister breathe on

From this oneself
Testify or tell
It's fooling us now
So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail

'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, little sister, breathe on
Oh so breathe on, little sister, like a fool
