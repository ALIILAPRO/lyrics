		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were so magical, why end this way?
I know you're furious, yeah, just like me
You got good reasons, but I do too
What really happened here? I wish I knew

It escalated so fast
We yelled things we can't take back
It escalated too soon
I know what they say
I know that they say that

No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us?
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us?
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?

I tried my best with you, you claim the same
Somehow, we're strangers, but share this pain
Keep writin' letters I'll never send (send-send-send)
Don't want you movin' on when it's my end (end-end-end)

It escalated so fast (so fast)
We yelled things we can't take back (take back)
It escalated too soon
I know what they say
I know that they say that

No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us?
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
No one dies from love (no one dies from love)
Guess I'll be the first (guess I'll be the first)
Will you remember us? (You'll remember)
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?

I'll miss all the cool things we'd do
But what I miss the most is watching movies with you
I'll miss all the cool things we'd do
But what I miss the most is watching movies with you

No one dies from love (no one dies from love)
Guess I'll be the first (guess I'll be the first)
Will you remember us? (You'll remember)
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
No one dies from love (no one dies from love)
Guess I'll be the first (guess I'll be the first)
Will you remember us? (You'll remember)
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
