		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
"It's all about makin' that GTA"

'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Yo, man
Yo, man
Yo, yo, yo man
Yo, man
Yo, man
Get the fuck out
Pump that
Pump that
Pump, p-pump, p-pump that
Pump that
Pump that bass
Motherfucker, say what?

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded twelve-gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Yo, Leroy
Y-Y-Y-Y-Yo, Leroy
Y-Y-Y-Y-Yo, Leroy
Yo, Leroy
Yo, Leroy
Beer drink
Beer drink
B-B-Beer drink
Beer drink
Beer drink
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me with a forty and I started drinkin'
And from the eight-ball my breath start stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I him threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out

'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Who do, do you
Who do, do you
Who do, do you
Who do, do you
Who do you think you are, Mr. Big Stuff?
Rock this motherfucker like "Three The Hard Way"

I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Done wrapped my '64 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother"
Throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked a pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

L.A. playa
Big drum
Big drum
B-B-B-B-Big drum
Big drum
Big drum
Big drum beater

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas 'cause a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial, cold cut a fart
"Disruption of the court," said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out, "Fire!", then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Get, get, get, get
Get, get
Get, get, get, get, get
Get busy y'all, y-y-y-y'all
Aw
You motherfucker
