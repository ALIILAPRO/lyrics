		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew you ever since we were kids
And I always thought that you were something special
You were something special
I knew you ever since we were kids
And I always thought that you were something special
You were always special
I remember when I met you we were like nine
Playing during recess and having a good time
I thought you were mad cute
And now we 22
And I don’t know what to do 'cause
I have thought about you my whole life and
You’ve always been super nice I
Wanna make you my wife I
Wanna see you tonight and
I knew you ever since we were kids
And I always thought that you were something special
You were something special
I knew you ever since we were kids
And I always thought that you were something special
You were always special
