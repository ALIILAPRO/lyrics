		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know me when I'm a slave
Not when I am king
Don't claim your royalty (big daddy)
Know me when I am small
Not when I am big
I will stumble over this (don't call me sugar)
I missed you yesterday
Even when you said
This is not your way
No more playing game
I'm breaking all the chain
We cannot stay the same (we cannot stay the same)

Fimile, don't call me sugar
Don't touch the fire
Don't give me drama
My best friend lover
When no money
She no give honey
She wan leave daddy
Big daddy
Fimile, don't call me sugar
Don't touch the fire
Don't give me drama
My best friend lover
When no money
She no give honey
She wan leave daddy
Big daddy

Hold me when I am blind
Not when I can see
I can see my destiny (I can see my destiny)
I know I don't have much
My love should be enough
I guess you wanted more (wanted more money)
Called me yesterday
I saw but walked away
This hate cannot surface (it will beat an easy path)
You left me on the ground
You turned your back around
Now I'm feeling down (feelin' underground)

Fimile, don't call me sugar
Don't touch the fire
Don't give me drama
My best friend lover
When no money
She no give honey
She wan leave daddy
Big daddy
Fimile, don't call me sugar
Don't touch the fire
Don't give me drama
My best friend lover
When no money
She no give honey
She wan leave daddy
Big daddy
