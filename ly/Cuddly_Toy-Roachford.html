		  Cuddly Toy
Roachford
(A. Roachford)

I know you've heard so many people say
I've got a different girl in every town
But there must be somebody telling lies
And spreading rumours, spreading rumours all around

Because my only joy, is a cuddly toy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you
To call my very own

(chorus)

So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
And give me some love

Well I don't pour out my heart like this, to everyone
And anyone that I meet
And I know it ain't the wine 'cause I feel just fine,
Can't you see baby, I'm still on my feet

(bridge)

A cuddly toy is my only joy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you
To call my very own

(repeat chorus, bridge and chorus)
