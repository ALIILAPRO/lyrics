		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we were young, we had it rough
Short on money, short on love
That's how the wayside takes
The wayside keeps its ghosts
Thick as thieves, my fears and me
We've been wrong and now ten years deep
That's how the wayside takes
And it keeps a hold on me

Oh, I'm living in a no man's land
Nowhere land, no place left to go
When I'm running from myself
I'm holding on to hope
But struggling to cope
And there's places I can't leave
When they're leaving a mark on me
So I'm living in a no man's land
Everywhere I go, I'm running from myself

Right age, wrong crowd
Blamed it all on my hometown
But it wasn't them
They never let me down
No, it was me
I drank, I smoked
I held it in until I choked
Still, these roots are wrapped around my feet

Oh, I'm living in a no man's land
Nowhere land, no place left to go
And I'm running from myself
I'm holding on to hope
But struggling to cope
And there's places I can't leave
When they're leaving a mark on me
So I'm living in a no man's land
Everywhere I go, I'm running from myself

(I'm living in a no man's land)
(I'm living in a no man's land)
And there's places I can't leave
When they're leaving a mark on me
So I'm living in a no man's land
Everywhere I go, I'm running from myself
