		  Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Tell me what's the price to pay the motherfuckin' preacher
I was watching from a distance sitting on the bleachers
All them boys who hate me, now it's really non-believers
From servin' white and molly caps to on stage with Mr. Bieber
Spin, and spin the block, I do the three-sixty call her feeder
Go ahead and kiss her shawty, know that she's a eater
Okay, He like to treat you, baby, I can be your teacher
Babe, I been loopin', sippin' drink, yeah, down to feed her

Oh, oh, don't nobody get high no more
Off codeine on Holly Road, this shit colossal, Geronimo

Oh, Nigga my eenie miney mo (need more, oh, oh, oh)
L, for the love of the game
O, for the zeroes in the bank
V, I got the 'Vert, about to skeet
E, I love the way that you pleasin' me
L, for the love of the game
O, for the zeroes in the bank
V, I got the 'Vert, about to skeet
E, I love the way that you pleasin' me

Tell me what's the price to pay the motherfuckin' preacher
I was watching from a distance sitting on the bleachers
All them boys who hate me, now it's really non-believers
From servin' white and molly caps to on stage with Mr. Bieber
Spin, and spin the block, I do the three-sixty call her feeder
Go ahead and kiss her shawty, know that she's a eater
Okay, He like to treat you, baby, I can be your teacher
Babe, I been loopin', sippin' drink, yeah, down to feed her

Oh, oh, don't nobody get high no more
Off codeine on Holly Road, this shit colossal, Geronimo
