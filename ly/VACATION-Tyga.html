Uh 

Bitch, why you keep on callin' me?
Blowin' my phone, it's on vibration
I been goin' so hard, party like a rock star
I need a vacation
Sittin' at the top, niggas wanna take shots
They just want my situation
I need a vacation, niggas wanna test my patience

Niggas wanna pop off, I'ma take the top off
Nigga, this inspiration
T-Raw, movie star (how dog?)
Got a few actress in rotation
Might gotta run for the mayor
Need a Hollywood star, nigga, stop deabtin'
Diamonds on me, hydration
I'ma the shit, exclamation
Niggas wanna be like Mike, fly like Mike
Wanna be cold as ice
Wanna take flight from the free throw
Niggas ain't cut throat, nigga, I roll the dice
Two, four, seven, three, six, five, nigga, I shine
'Cause I grind like every night
Whoa, vibe, oh, my

Bitch, why you keep on callin' me?
Blowin' my phone, it's on vibration
I been goin' so hard, party like a rock star
I need a vacation
Sittin' at the top, niggas wanna take shots
They just want my situation
I need a vacation, niggas wanna test my patience
Whoa, vibe, oh, my
I been goin' so hard, party like a rock star
I need a vacation
Whoa, vibe, oh, my
Sittin' at the top, niggas wanna take shots
They just want my situation (yeah)

I need a trip to Jamaica, yeah
Baddie in the water, no makeup, yeah
I need a house on the sand, forty acres in the back
Matter fact no neighbors
I'm a black rainmaker, ex-heartbreaker
Niggas overslept on me now it's time they wake up
Lookin' for a favor on a boat full of haters
Tryna float, I am not a lifesaver
Look at the flow, ay
Look at the dough, ay
Look at my glow
Who can I trust? Ay
Who can I love? Ay, ay, me
I need confirmation, big standin' ovations
Million dollar conversations
On the line with Live Nation (Goddamn)

Bitch, why you keep on callin' me?
Blowin' my phone, it's on vibration
I been goin' so hard, party like a rock star
I need a vacation
Sittin' at the top, niggas wanna take shots
They just want my situation
I need a vacation, niggas wanna test my patience
Whoa, vibe, oh, my
I been goin' so hard, party like a rock star
I need a vacation
Whoa, vibe, oh, my
Sittin' at the top, niggas wanna take shots
They just want my situation

I need a vacation
I need a vacation
