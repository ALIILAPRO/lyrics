		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This morning I got diagnosed
With frost bite in my toes
Who knew that the winter comes through Sherman Oaks
So I drove to the Rite Aid
Where we used to go
And I know you'd make a bad joke
About getting cold feet
And how that sounds much more like you than like me
You'd be happy to know that my new place has heat
Whenever you're back
I've got so much I could tell you
And I know you'd laugh
If I told you just half of the things
That have happened today
And I have to remind myself
It's okay you're not coming home
Cuz I keep a list
Of all of the things you don't know
And I feel like you'd be so proud
I made it out
Of a heartbreak with some scars and 12 songs somehow
And I play them when I wonder where you are now
Cuz I wish you could be here to hold me
When I just can't sleep
Or that day I was so sad that I couldn't eat
Maybe I'll fill you in one of these weeks
Whenever you're back
I've got so much I could tell you
And I know you'd laugh
If I told you just half of the things
That have happened today
And I have to remind myself
It's okay you're not coming home
Cuz I keep a list
Of all of the things you don't know
