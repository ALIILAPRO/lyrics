		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey yeah)

Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was

Trap, she do licks
She the one I forget
She do coke, she do blow
She do dope, make a list
This the life, don't forget
Sober nights, make it lit
She the one, you the one
I'm the one, what a trick
I ain't never tellin' lies, cross my heart and hope to die
If it's real, it's real forever, maybe never testify
Put the pedal to the floor, look the devil in the eye
If you tell me that you love me, promise not to change your mind

We're light sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the light?
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police

Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was

Grindin' all my life, hundred say, a thousand nights
And every night I fucked it up, all I know is rollin' dice
Only God can slow me down, you already know my type
Baby, I be rich forever, may we never say goodbye
But if

We're light sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the light?
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police

Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was

Trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was
