		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just tryina get it for my grandson
Keep the fire in me lighted till the day tomorrow can't come
Hands up high for the handsome
We done came from project buildings to them mothafuckin' mansions
Wake up when the mornin' ended
Opportunities come to those who get it yeah yeah
Don't believe in the one's pretending
Focus only on your needs not on who done and did it yeah yeah
Ameriqa now a commodity
Look like at least a couple times I went and won the fuckin' lottery
Ballin' like Pac 'bove the rim
And no damn days off for the ones who sleep 'n' wake up in the fuckin' gym
Rollin' shmoke intermission
Looking like a ghost in the mist (ooh-whoah)
Gang cold on them bitches
Staying on my toes on these roads to the riches..
Yeah, I’m on the road to the riches yeah yeah
That’s why I'm cold to these bitches (oh yeah oh yeah)
I'm on the road to the riches yeah yeah
That's why I'm froze on them pictures (oh yeah oh yeah)
I’m on the road to these riches yeah
And there ain’t no lane switchin' here
I’m on the road to the riches yeah
And it's a toast if you’re listening
I’m up early on a Sunday, its on me
Bitch I hardly have a holiday, I’m chasing it
Get it right when you get it right
I say its do or die really do or die,
I can’t let them,
Define me
She’s got questions
She lying with
I’m invested
In grinding
All these texts and lines I’m interested all through the night
Rollin' shmoke intermission
Looking like a ghost in the mist (ooh-whoah)
Gang cold on them bitches
Staying on my toes on these roads to the riches..
Yeah, I’m on the road to the riches yeah yeah
That’s why I'm cold to these bitches (oh yeah oh yeah)
I'm on the road to the riches yeah yeah
That's why I'm froze on them pictures (oh yeah oh yeah)
I’m on the road to these riches yeah
And there ain’t no lane switchin' here
I’m on the road to the riches yeah
And it's a toast if you’re listening
