		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nails, hair, hips, heels, ass fat, lips real
Purse full, big bills, bitch I'm a big deal
Legs, legs, face, eyes, thin waist, thick thighs
You, me, you wish, new phone, who this?
Pussy puss, puss
Give them cunt, cunt, cunt, bitch
Mama yes god when you pop that tongue bitch
This whole club is my runway, run bitch
Y'all five, four, three, twos, I'm a one bitch

Girl, what did that girl just say, girl?
Girl, I don't dance, I work
I don't play, I slay
I don't walk I strut, strut, strut and then sashay (okay)
I don't work for free 
No, that's not the tea, hunty (no ma'am)
So make it rain on me, and I might let you see
What you gonna let them see?

My nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels

Head, shoulders, knees, toes, don't know these hoes
Face, lips, eyes, nose, camera, click, we pose
Beat mug, limp wrists, V.I.P list, wave, wave, blow a kiss
I'm that bitch, sis
Left, right, left, right, left with a spin bitch
Where's my sash and crown, 'cause I win bitch
I'm so fab, I'm gone with the wind bitch
Y'all six, seven, eight, nines, I'm a ten bitch

Girl, what did that girl just say, girl?
Girl, I don't dance, I work
I don't play, I slay
I don't walk I strut, strut, strut and then sashay (okay)
I don't work for free 
No, that's not the tea, hunty (no ma'am)
So make it rain on me, and I might let you see
What you gonna let them see?

My nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels

Okay dolls, y'all know what time it is, come on
Everybody on the floor, everybody on the floor
Now I want you to stretch out those arms, stretch out those legs
Stretch out that wrist, stretch out that weave
I don't want to see you dance, I want to see you work, come on

Drop for me, drop for me, drop
Drop for me, drop for me, drop
Drop for me, drop for me, drop
Drop for me, drop for me, drop
Tongue pop for me, pop for me, pop
Tongue pop for me, pop for me, pop
Tongue pop for me, pop for me, pop
Tongue pop for me, pop for me, pop
Pose for me, pose for me, pose
Pose for me, pose for me, pose
Pose for me, pose for me, pose
Pose for me, pose for me, pose
Now blink for these, blink for these, hoes
Blink for these, blink for these, hoes
Blink for these, blink for these, hoes
Blink for these, blink for these, hoes
Twirl for me, twirl for me, twirl

Say girl for me, girl for me, girl
