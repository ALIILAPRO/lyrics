		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear, girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on

If you're losing your interest
You should go
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you won't
If you're losing your interest
You should go
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you won't

I don't see an 'us' anymore
I only see you and the new dude (oh)
That's been texting you, late nights
Tryna make a path through to you (through to you)
You see I'ma let him pass
He can have you if he wants you that bad
I don't really need to be your man
And I'll get a girl, I really understand (I do)
You don't have to make it clear
You did it to me once, now again (again)
I really thought that was the end (end)
It's a cycle, that's got me in a spin (spin)
Going psycho, but depend (depend)
On this music just to keep me from the edge (edge)
I don't really wanna be dead (nah)
I just wanna feel again
You should go

Losing interest, you won't find no better

If you're losing your interest
You should go
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you won't
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you won't
If you're losing your interest
You should go
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you won't
Maybe you will, maybe you won't
Maybe you won't

Just waiting on the heartbreak again
But I know that it's never gonna stop

Waitin' for the time that you walk out
It's gonna happen soon, I just know it
But you put it off for so damn long now
That I'm trippin' divin' down to the low end
Got me hurtin' every way that I can though
Stressin' over love, I don't know if I had hold
Feelin' like nothing got struck in my damn soul
Just tryna to heal but you keep comin' back slow
Got a foot in the door, just close it
Please let it shut, I don't wanna feel emotion
Dealin' with effects of a love this potent
Swimmin' in your waters, only sirens floatin'

Got a foot in the door, just close it
Please let it shut, I don't wanna feel emotion
Dealing with effects of a love this potent
Swimming in your waters, only sirens floating, yeah

Losing interest, you won't find no better than this
I swear, girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
