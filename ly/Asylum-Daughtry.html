		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a reign over the horizon
The lunatics have taken the asylum

Fear is like a dagger
And blood is dripping off the blade
They wave it like a scepter
In the kingdom come of the insane
There's a wake up in the shelter
The prisoners have broke their chains
All hail the deceptors
Who poison and manipulate

Somebody sound the alarm
Somebody ring the bell
Grab the noose, the psychos are loose
And we're headed straight for hell
Ya'll better run for cover
The writing is on the wall
It's pandemonium
And Rome is about to fall

Oh, there's a reign over the horizon
The lunatics have taken the asylum
We're on the edge, it's an uprisin'
The lunatics have taken the asylum

(The lunatics have taken the asylum)
(The lunatics have taken the asylum)

Deadly is the viper
That licks the venom from their fangs
Watch the way they slither, yeah
Like a parasite inside your brain
Too many sharks in the water
Circling the weakest prey
Like a sniper in the shadows
Waiting just to take his aim

There's a reign over the horizon
The lunatics have taken the asylum
We're on the edge, it's an uprisin'
The lunatics have taken the asylum

Somebody sound the alarm
Somebody ring the bell
Drop the noose, too much to lose
We gotta save ourselves
We better run for cover
The writing is on the wall
We gotta take our power back
Before they take us all

There's a reign over the horizon
The lunatics have taken the asylum
We're on the edge, it's an uprisin'
The lunatics have taken the asylum

There's a reign over the horizon (oh, there's a reign)
The lunatics have taken the asylum (oh)
We're on the edge, it's an uprisin' (oh, and it's an uprisin')
The lunatics have taken the asylum

Oh, have taken the asylum
The lunatics have taken the asylum
Oh, and it's an uprising
The lunatics have taken the asylum
