		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can one become so bounded
By choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version
Of a person we don't even like?

We're in love with the world
But the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads
That corrupt our hearts somehow

When I was a child
Every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun
But now I only soak up wine

They say to play hard, you work hard
Find balance in the sacrifice
Yet I don't know anybody
Who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser (ahh)

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something
You just want me

Why am I obsessing
About the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval
From people I don't even know?

In these crazy times I hope to find 
Something I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life
Something real, something that feels true

You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (high tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad
But you can't fight fire with fire (ahh)

Oh, so I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) 
Love you for free (each other for free)
Everybody wants something from me
You just want me

Listen, I know how low I can go
I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all
'Cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)
We both will find (we both find) peace of mind
Sometimes the road less traveled
Is a road best left behind (ahh)

Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) 
Love you for free, yeah (each other for free)
'Cause everybody wants something from me
You just want me

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There was just memories in a big storm
