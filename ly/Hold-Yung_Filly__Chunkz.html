		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ransom got that sauce, innit?)

Put you on hold
(I'ma put you)
Ah, put you on hold
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ah, put you on hold
(I'ma put you on)
Ah, put you on hold
Ah, hold on, put you on hold
Ah, hold on

Mama, are you interested? (Mama)
Beg you get your hand up off my investment
Knew that this would happen, it was expected
No amount of money make me blind
And now I wanna leave, it's feeling infested
Still I be the topic, I'm the suggestion
I'll be what you wanted if you're suggesting
Caught me on my toes, it could get interesting

Let's take a little break (little break)
Me and you on a plane
But it ain't about us by the way (yeah-yeah)
Yeah, we won't be gone for long (yeah)
So tell me 'bout your day (your day)
I'm spending on her, so it's hard to save (hard to save)
Can you hear me, baby? I'm just one away (one away)

Put you on hold
(I'ma put you on)
Ah, put you on hold
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ah, put you on hold
(Put you on)
Ah, put you on hold
Ah, hold on, put you on hold
Ah, hold on

Baby, baby no me enga√±es
Y yo la trato, bien
Yo ta trato muy bien
She just needed more time, ah
She wanna live the high life, ah
She got me wondering why you do me dirty more than once (more than once)
I never meant to leave her, ah
If I get the chance, then I'll retrieve her, ah
Said she gonna change and I believe her, ah
The feelings that I had for her were deeper, ah
I'ma put you on hold (put you on)
Call me on my phone but I'm on aeroplane mode (put you on)
Doing all the telling, baby girl, you've been told
Leave it all to God, he'll let the future unfold (oh, yeah)

Let's take a little break (take a break)
Me and you on a plane
But it ain't about us by the way (yeah-yeah)
Yeah, we won't be gone for long (yeah)
So tell me 'bout your day ('bout your day)
I'm spending on her, so it's hard to save (hard to save)
Can you hear me, baby? I'm just one away (one away, yeah)

Put you on hold
(I'ma put you on)
Ah, put you on hold
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, hold)
Ah, put you on hold
(Put you on)
Ah, put you on hold
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Ah, hold on, put you on hold
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Ah, hold on
