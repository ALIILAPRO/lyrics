		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, go
Uh, yeah
Ciara
Sex
Ciara
Here we go (talk to 'em)

Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
The way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine
Imagine if there was a million me's
Talkin' sexy to you like that (yeah)
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze and I need you to push it right back

Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' 'til clothin' disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh, baby (yeah)

All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

Everything ain't what it seems, I wave my hands and I got you
And you feel so fly assistin' me (yeah)
But now it's my turn to watch you, I ain't gon' stop you
If you wanna crowd my neck, talk sexy to me like that
Just do what I taught you, girl, when I give you my heat
And I need you to push it right back

Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' 'til clothing disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby (uh, come on)

All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

(Breakdown) now
This is the part where we fall in love (love, sugar)
Let's slow it down, so we fall in love (oh-oh-oh)
But don't stop what you doin' to me
Ciara (bring it back)

All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean (know what I mean)
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean (you know what I mean)
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic, uh

Uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh, yeah, I see you on the floor
Get it, girl, love, sex and magic
I see you on the floor, you know what I mean
Get it, girl
I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic, ow
I see you on the floor
Get it, girl
