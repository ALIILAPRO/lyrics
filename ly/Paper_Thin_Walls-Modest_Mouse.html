		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These walls are paper thin
And everyone hears every little sound
Everyone's a voyeurist
They're watching me, watch them, watch me right now
They're shaking hands, they're shaking in their shoes
Oh Lord, don't shake me down
Everyone wants two of them
And half of everyone else moves around
It's been agreed the whole world stinks
So no one's taking showers anymore

Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank
I can't be blamed for nothing anymore
It's been a long time since you've been around
Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank

Tow the line to tax the time, you know
That you don't owe
I can't be a fool for everyone
That I don't know

These walls are paper thin
And everyone hears every little sound
Everyone's a voyeurist
They're watching me, watch them, watch me right now
They're shaking hands, they're shaking in their shoes
Oh Lord, don't shake me down
Everyone wants two of them
And half of everyone else moves around
It's been agreed the whole world stinks
So no one's taking showers anymore

Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank

Tow the line to tax the time, you know
That you don't owe
I can't be a fool for everyone
That I don't know
