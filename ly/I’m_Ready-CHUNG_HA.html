		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage
그 누구든 test me 얼마든 chase me 두려울 건 없지
Got this perfected so high 
I won't forget this
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

소란스런 밤을 지나 저 빛을 향해 가
움츠렸던 시간만큼 날개를 펼쳐 가
Never stop, I love this feeling 더 높이 날아 난
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage
그 누구든 test me 얼마든 chase mе 두려울 건 없지
Got this perfected so high
I won't forgеt this
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage
Gold all on my body 
Now everybody save me another dance
Got this perfected so high
I won't forget this
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

I'm ready to get this 
Ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

아찔한 이 리듬 속은 baby
My new playground
얼마든지 날 짓밟아 봐봐
I'm never burnin' out
Never gonna be hidden no more
Watch me be loud
'Cause I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this now

거부할 수 없는 빛에 넌 홀려 들어와
남은 정신 꽉 붙잡아 난 멈추지 않아
Never stop I love this feeling
It's what I'm living for
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage
Gold all on my body
Now everybody save me another dance
Got this perfected so high
I won't forget this
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

Lights around feels like I'm dreaming
Stay right by my side
어두웠던 시간만큼
Let's divine our light

Ah
Ah
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage
Gold all on my body 
Now everybody save me another dance
Got this perfected so high
I won't forget this
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this
Ready to get this stage

I'm ready to get this, ready to get this (la-la, na-na-na-na-na)
Ready to get this stage (na-na-na-na)
Gold all on my body, now everybody (la-la, na-na-na-na-na)
Save me another dance (na-na-na-na)
I'm ready to get this, ready to get this (la-la, na-na-na-na-na)
Ready to get this stage (na-na-na-na)
I'm ready to get this
Ready to get this
Ready to get this stage
