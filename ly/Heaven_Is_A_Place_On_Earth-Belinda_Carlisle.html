		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth

When the night falls down
I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside

When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth

When I feel alone
I reach for you and you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea 
I hear your voice and it carries me

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth

(Heaven)
(Heaven)
(Heaven)

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth (ooh)
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth (ooh)
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
