		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a 454 
With the four on the floor
Deuce coupe coming at you 
Avoiding the capture
Fall from stop and drop
Than we ready to rock
And city of steel 
Catch me cruisin down the block
Whenever days are difficult
I'm out on my own
Driving an '86 Jetta
Hoping that I could do better
But my car keeps me humble
In the concrete jungle
Despite the wear and tear
It seems to always get me there

Rebuilt the motor because
She decided to blow
And what do you know 
Someone stole my stereo, when it's
Time to go I put my foot on the floor
Let the diesel do the work
I ain't complaining no more
Highways and straightaways
Off roads and open roads
No matter what we will 
still be making the show
It's kinda like life 
And life treats you good
It's not what's on the outside 
It's what's under the hood

[Chorus: x2]
Put the pedal to the metal and I'm off and never getting lost
Which way will I turn when roads cross
Press the petal to the metal little more when it's scary
But one thing for sure, keep my foot on the floor

It doesn't matter what you drive
It's like you drive what you got
Discipline you can win
Just let the tire spin
And begin
The journey of life with each ride
Can you help me at the side 
On what we want to ride
Sometimes we can live
With the back up plan
And in with the program
Who I am, Doesn't reflect material
My vehicle approaches

[Chorus]

Won't stop drivin till it's over
Still be cruisin when the sun goes down
Won't stop drivin till it's over
Still be cruisin when the sun goes down

[Chorus x2]

Put the pedal to the metal and I'm off
Put the pedal to the metal and I'm off
Pedal to the metal and I'm off
