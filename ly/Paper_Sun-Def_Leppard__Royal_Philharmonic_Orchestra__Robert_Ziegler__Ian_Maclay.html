		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does it hurt to remember
Does it help to forget
Do you know what you started
When you lit the fuse of regret

There's not a reason why you've come undone
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land

Cause you're living on a paper sun
Blind to all the damage done
Living on a paper sun
Waiting for the tide to turn
Living on a paper sun
You can't hide and you can't run
All your dreams have come and gone
Living on a paper sun

Do you still hear 'em screamin'
And does the fear make you run
Is the anger inside of you
A gift from father to son

I don't believe in you, you've come undone
I don't believe in what you do, this can't go on
I don't believe in you as I walk this broken land

Cause you're living on a paper sun
Blind to all the damage done
Living on a paper sun
Waiting for the tide to turn
Living on a paper sun
You can't hide and you can't run
All your dreams have come and gone
Living on a paper

You will discover the way to suffer
And like no other you feed the fire

There's not a reason why you've come undone
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land

Cause you're living on a paper sun
Blind to all the damage done
Living on a paper sun
Waiting for the tide to turn
Living on a paper sun
Waiting for the night
All your dreams have come and gone
