		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I'm outside with a whole lotta guap
(yeah, whole lot, damn, Trgc made that?)
I'm in LA where the sun don't stop
Sippin' on le, whole lotta drop
I took the coupe out that bitch, yeah
I swerved that bitch right off the lot
(Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I took her shoppin' at Saks
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of my diamonds, they shine, yeah (Huh)
Which one, a boot up or Perc'? (Huh)
I don't know, I can't decide (Huh)
I had a hard time cleanin' my life (Huh)

I put a deuce on his head, yeah
Watch her head go back like Pez, yеah
I pull up, she take off my pants
I don't do shit but get high, fuck a plan
(Uh) i'm in thе sky on a jet
In the top just livin', bitch
I don't think I can land
I need some top from that
Bitch, need the māthā, lil'
Bitch, give me head as soon as I land, yeah
Feel like a dream every day
When I boot off the
X, I can't tell you what's real or not
I can't feel it all
When it come to me takin' these drugs, I
Can do a whole lot with my body
My bitch like a druggie now
She pull up, she pull up, she suck it
She suck it, she gone, she gone
That bitch like an In & Out
You might've just learned who I am
But I really
Been here, doin' this shit for a minute now
Yeah i just been doin' this shit
Thinkin' 'bout everybody (Everybody)
I don't be doin' this shit for nobody
Don't care about it (I don't care about it)
These lil' kids act like a
Fruit, like a bitch
He act like a pear about it (Pear)
Yeah, all these dudes copy my shit
They act like some parrots 'bout it
(Parrots)
They said that they hard as it gets
Well I'm askin' they parents 'bout it
(yeah, yeah)
I been at the tippity-top, it's hard
I got beef with my kidney
He ask me why the hell I take all these
Percs, I told that boy to shut up, shut up
(yeah) 'Cause they feel good as shit
(Why) , huh, why else would I? (yeah)

Bitch, I'm outside with a whole lotta guap
(yeah, whole lot, damn, Trgc made that?)
I'm in LA where the sun don't stop
Sippin' on le, whole lotta drop
I took the coupe out that bitch, yeah
I swerved that bitch right off the lot
(Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I took her shoppin' at Saks
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of my diamonds, they shine, yeah (Huh)
Which one, a boot up or Perc'? (Huh)
I don't know, I can't decide (Huh)
I had a hard time cleanin' my life (Huh)
