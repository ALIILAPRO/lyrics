		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
(There we go)

I could write a song on my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle,
Not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
And I could sing about cupid and a shooting arrow,
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was better,
Real hard, (real hard) it's so hard, (so hard)
Real hard, (real hard) it's not hard, (it's not hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio babe
Makes you wanna dance, don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio babe
Makes you wanna grab your lover's hands

So hold up and, take it through the night
And we should follow through, to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I wanna see you rock to the piano
The piano

I could write a song on my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle,
Not hard, (it's not hard) it's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard) it's not hard, (it's not hard)
And I could sing about cupid and a shooting arrow,
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was better,
Real hard, (it's not hard) it's so hard, (so hard)
Real hard, (it's not hard) it's not hard, (it's so hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio babe
Makes you wanna dance, don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio babe
Makes you wanna grab your lover's hands

So hold up and, take it through the night
And we should follow through, to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I wanna see you rock to the piano
The piano

So hold up and, take it through the night
And we should follow through, to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I wanna see you rock to the piano
The piano

I'd rather tell you 'bout
How I'm feeling boy (boy)
And how I'm doing things my way,
If I got my piano, then I'm gon be okay baby

So hold up and, take it through the night
And we should follow through, to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I wanna see you rock to the piano
The piano

So hold up and, take it through the night
And we should follow through, to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I wanna see you rock to the piano
The piano

So hold up and, take it through the night
And we should follow through, to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I wanna see you rock to the piano
The piano

I could write a song on my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard (it's not hard)
It's not hard
