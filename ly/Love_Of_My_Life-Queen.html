		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all of my love) and now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back) bring it back, bring it back (back)
Don't take it away from me (take it away from me)
Because you don't know (ooh-ooh-ooh, know, means to me)
What it means to me

Who will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way? (Ooh, yeah)
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)

Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me (ooh-ooh-ooh, know, means to me)
Love of my life
Love of my life
Oh, oh
