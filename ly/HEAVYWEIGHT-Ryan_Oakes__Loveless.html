		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been dropping sixteens since my sweet sixteen in 2011 
Told the world that I'd take overusing my words as the weapon
Got a million dollar deal and had the catalog for leverage, 
All my haters got were emptiness and diagnosed depression

That's rude 

But imagine peaking in high school
You put yourself in a box now
I'm only living by my rules
Participation awards
You couldn't afford to pay all of my dues 
Wishin that you more were like me
If you were like me you wouldn't like you 

I guess life can hit you fast 
Now you stuck inside the past
I guess life can hit you fast

You betta watch
Watch what you say
Dig into me, I'll dig your grave
Talk is cheap, put you to sleep 
I'm heavyweight

Fortune favors blood and pain
My guilty pleasure's all the hate
Talk is cheap, put you to sleep
I'm heavyweight

Bitch I'm only 27 be respectful when you say my name
I'm a millionaire off what I dreamed about in 7th grade
Made 100 thousand off of crypto next is real estate 
I didn't plan to peak financially from music anyway

Bitchin all that bitchin got you burned bridges
Y'all are on my Richard I'm a dick you won't get no riches
Radiate success the human form of what Chernobyl is
You could work for me to see exactly what promotion is 

I guess life can hit you fast
Now you're stuck inside the past 
I guess life can hit you fast 

You betta watch
Watch what you say
Dig into me, I'll dig your grave
Talk is cheap, put you to sleep 
I'm heavyweight

Fortune favors blood and pain
My guilty pleasure's all the hate
Talk is cheap, put you to sleep
I'm heavyweight

Never gonna come down
Never gonna break down
Never gonna come down
Never gonna break down

You betta watch
Watch what you say
Dig into me, I'll dig your grave
Talk is cheap, put you to sleep 
I'm heavyweight

Fortune favors blood and pain
My guilty pleasure's all the hate
Talk is cheap, put you to sleep
I'm heavyweight
