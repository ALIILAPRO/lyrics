		  (I wish you, I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well)
(I wish you, I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well)

It's sad we're not together
But I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever
Love don't always make it through

Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way
We opened up the same book, we found a different page
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save

I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
'Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you, I wish you, I wish you)
I wish you well
I wish you well

I hope that you remember
That I was always good to you
And even though you hurt me, ah
I just had to see it through

Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way
I had to let you go, but I wanted you to stay
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save

I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you, I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well)

Wish you well, I wish you well, I
Wish you well, I wish you well, I
Wish you well, I wish you well, I
Wish you well, I

I wish you well
I wish you well, oh-oh
I wish, I wish (I wish you well)
(I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well)
