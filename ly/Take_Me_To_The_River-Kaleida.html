		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t know why i love you like I do
After all the changes you put me through

You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven’t seen the worst of it yet

I wanna know can you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won’t you cleanse my soul
And put my feet on the ground
Oh take me to the river right now

I don’t know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things
That we could have had

Love is a notion that I can’t forget
Sweet sixteen i will never regret

I wanna know can you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and dip me down
Won’t you cleanse my soul
And put my feet on the ground
Oh take me to the river right now

Hold me in then I know I’ll be there
Hold me in and wash me down
Then I know I’ll be there

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won’t you cleanse my soul
And put my feet on the ground
Oh take me to the river right now
