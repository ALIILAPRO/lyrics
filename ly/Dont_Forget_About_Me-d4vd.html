		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me it was all in your head
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Tell me I'd be better off dead
But don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me

'Cause I don't wanna relive this feeling of alone
And I don't wanna keep crying on your shoulder
Swear I thought we'd be together 'til we're older
Too many thoughts inside my head, they're spilling over

Stay for me
Can you say something?
Take me away, baby
But I'm holding my tongue 'cause it's over now

Tell me it was all in your head
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Tell me I'd be better off dead
But don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
