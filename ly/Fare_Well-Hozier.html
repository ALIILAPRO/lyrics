		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I wouldn't fare well
And I, I couldn't fare well
Hedgehog-under-a-van-wheel kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here trying to feel good again

And I, I wouldn't fare well
A kitten-cozy-in-the-engine type of wouldn't fare well
A dog-deep-into-the-chocolate kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here trying to feel good again

I'll take any high
Any glazing of the eyes
Any solitary pleasure that was sorrow in disguise
Let the sun only shine on me through a falling sky
I'll be alright

Joy, disaster, come unbound here
I'll deny me none while I'm allowed
With all things above the ground

And I, I wouldn't fare well
A whale-swimming-up-Sumida-Gawa wouldn't fare well
Critic-hoping-to-be-remembered wouldn't fare well
Out here trying to feel good again

I'll take any high
Any glazing of the eyes
Any solitary pleasure that was sorrow in disguise
Let the sun only shine on me through a falling sky
I'll be alright

Joy, disaster, come unbound here
I'll deny me none while I'm allowed
With all things above the ground
