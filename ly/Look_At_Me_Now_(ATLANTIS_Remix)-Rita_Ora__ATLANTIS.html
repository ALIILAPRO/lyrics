		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've made peace with the mirror
It took all of hell just to love myself
Now I'm seeing things clearer
I don't need anyone else

Take it with a pinch of salt
People always come and go
I won't keep my enemies close
The more you see, the more you learn
Better off for being burned
Breathe it in then let it go

Throw your stones until I'm broken
They won't bring me down
Even in my darkest moments
I am happy now

Shoot me with your best shot
Hold me in a headlock
Give me all you've got, baby
Aim for the heart
Throw your stones until I'm broken
They won't bring me down
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now

Mended things with my mother
Now I look like her and I found the words
So I tell her I love her
And she knows me like no other, oh

Take it with a pinch of salt
People always come and go
I won't keep my enemies close (oh no)
The more you see, the more you learn
Better off for being burned
Breathe it in then let it go

Throw your stones until I'm broken
They won't bring me down
Even in my darkest moments
I am happy now

Shoot me with your best shot
Hold me in a headlock
Give me all you've got, baby
Aim for the heart
Throw your stones until I'm broken
They won't bring me down (bring me down)
Look at me now, look at me now (look at me now)
Look at me now, look at me now (look at me now, look at me now)
