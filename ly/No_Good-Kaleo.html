		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't fight the temptation
When you get the vibration
Won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

You better start running
When you hear the man coming
Won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

No, we don't mind
If you don't mind
Hell, I never mind!

Now let the moment break you
Let the feeling come take you
Won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

And you know I got feelings
Won't you hit me right, you know you might as well
Won't do you no good
Said it won't do you no good

And I said kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright!
Heaven knows they wanna break you apart, yeah

Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright!
You never know unless you give it a try
Oh baby

'Said do you no good
Yeah!

Can't fight the temptation
When you get the vibration
Won't do you no good
Won't do you no good

And you can tell I got feelings
You try to shake it off, try it, oh, you won't
You won't, do you no good
Today won't do you no good

And I said kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright
Heaven knows they wanna break you apart, yeah

Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright
You never know unless you give it a try, oh yeah!

Yeah, yeah!
Whoa, yeah!
No, no, baby
Yeah!
Whoa yeah!
Want my sweet baby
Whoa, you're no good babe
Yeah!
I said yeah
One day yeah, baby!
Ah yeah
Woo!
Oh, yeah!
