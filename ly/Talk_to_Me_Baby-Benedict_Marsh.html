		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey, are you running away?
Is it me, or some other thing?
What is it?
You seem so in your head
Lately, things just don't seem the same
Oh baby

Talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby

When I called you the other day
You weren't listening to a word I said
What is it?
It seems like you are hurting
Lately, your eyes are so deserted
Oh baby

Talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby

Cuz you know the hardest thing about this
Is not knowing the truth (cuz you know)
Wondering whether you know just how in love with you I am
Stop with the faces and talk to me
I want to know how to help you baby
Know what to do

(Talk to me, what you say)

Oh lady, couldn't stand the pressure?
When the world is out to get ya?
Someone is trying to mess ya? What is it?
Would you stop making me guess?

Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby

Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby
Oh talk to me baby

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Would you talk to me?
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Girl would you hit me with it?
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
What you got for me?
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
