		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Locked down
Every single feeling that I have for you is locked down
Tryna find myself through the mist but I am lost now
I can't be myself, till the chain is broken
Locked down
Maybe with a little help, I'm able to

I'm locked down
Every single promise that I break is getting wrote down
Slowly losing feeling from the parabolic thoughts now
I wish that you could understand
I wish that you could understand

Cause I'm out for the last time
Fought up but he's one line, ahead of me now
Nobody helped but, its too late, good luck
It's up to me now

Know many millions
Who've fallen before me
Takes a strong force to break me down
To break me down

Will you remember
Not just me but all of these soldiers
I hope that you've taken these as lessons, so you can help others
And when I'm gone then I hope that these lyrics, will leave me with honour
Cause I dont wanna be remembered as the one that surrendered

Cause I feel
I've let you down
But I hope
That you'll forgive me now
I left a note
I know
I'm in a better place

Locked down
Every single feeling that I have for you is locked down
Tryna find myself through the mist but I am lost now
I can't be myself, till the chain is broken
Locked down
Maybe with a little help, I'm able to

I'm locked down
Every single promise that I break is getting wrote down
Slowly losing feeling from the parabolic thoughts now
I wish that you could understand
I wish that you could understand

Locked down
Every single feeling that was locked down
Tryna find myself but I am lost now
I can't be myself cause I am locked down
I'm locked down

Locked down
Every single promise that I wrote down
Slowly losing feeling from my thoughts now
I wish that you could understand
I wish that you could understand
