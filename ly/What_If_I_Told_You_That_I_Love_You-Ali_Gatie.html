		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I told you that I love you?
Would you tell me that you love me back?
What if I told you that I miss you?
Would you tell me that you miss me back?

What if I told you that I need you? (Need you)
Would you tell me that you need me, yeah?
If I tell you all my feelings (feelings)
Would you believe me, yeah?

What if I told you that I lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you? Yeah
What if I told you that I lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you? Yeah
What if I told you that I need you? (Need you, need you)
Would you tell me that you need me, too?
What if I told you that I lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you?

Ayy, when you told me that you love me
Was I a fool to believe in you?
When you told me I was special
Was I dumb for trusting you?
When you told me that you want me
Did you really want me?
Or was this all a joke to you? (To you, to you)
I don't wanna say, "I miss you"
If I don't know that you miss me back (oh, no, no)
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
If I do, there's no coming back

What if I told you that I need you? (Need you)
Would you tell me that you need me, yeah?
If I'd tell you all my feelings (feelings)
Would you believe me, yeah?

What if I told you that I lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you? (Na, na, na)
Yeah, what if I told you that I lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you?

I wish I told you that I loved you
Now it's too late, you have someone new
I hope he loves you like I do
Do you love the way he's treating you?

What if I told you that I love you?
Would you tell me that you love me back? (Me back)
If I told you that I miss you
Would you tell me that you miss me back? (Me back)

What if I told you that I need you?
Would you tell me that you need me, yeah?
If I tell you all my feelings
Would you believe me, yeah?

What if I told you that I lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you? Yeah
What if I told you that I lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you? Yeah
What if I told you that I need you?
Would you tell me that you need me, too?
What if I told you that I love you?
What if I told you that I
