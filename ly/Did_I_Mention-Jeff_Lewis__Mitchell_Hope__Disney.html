		  Did I mention
That I'm in love with you
Did I mention
There's nothing I can do
And did I happen to say?
I dream of you everyday
But let me shout it out, if that's okay
That's okay

I met this girl that rocked my world like it's never been rocked
And now I'm living just for her and I won't ever stop
I never thought it can happen to a guy like me
But now look at what you've done, you at got down on my knees

Because my love for is ridiculous
I never knew (who knew?)
That it can be like this
My love for you is ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S
(R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S)
It's (ridiculous)
Just (ridiculous)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss

Well did I mention
That I'm in love with you
And did I mention
There's nothing I can do
And did I happen to say?
I dream of you everyday
But let me shout it out, if that's okay, (yeah!)
If that's okay

I gotta know which way to go, c'mon gimme a sign
You gotta show me that you're only ever gonna be mine
Don't want to go another minute even without you
That's if your heart just isn't in it, I don't know what I'd do

Because my love for is ridiculous
I never knew (who knew?)
That it can be like this
My love for you is ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S
(R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S)
It's (ridiculous)
Just (ridiculous)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss
C'mon now!

(Oh yeah!)
(Ya-ow!)
(Alright!)
(Alright!)

Because my love for is Ridiculous
I never knew (who knew?)
That it can be like this
My love for you is ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S
(R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S)
It's (ridiculous)
Just (ridiculous)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss
C'mon Now!
