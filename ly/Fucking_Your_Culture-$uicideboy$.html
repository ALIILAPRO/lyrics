		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a Smash!
Play-play-play-play-players never doubt
You did good, $lick

It's the demented motherfucker, kickin' it with my brothers
And repping the 59, you know Grey the fucking color
My gat' screamin', "Kill 'em Wetto, hit 'em where they lay"
Smokin' 'em like some indo, let the pistol up and spray
Never could be fucked with, my dick, they love to suck it
They come in and gettin' seven, I switch a bitch like subjects
Pull up Continental, make a ho get sentimental
I got ADIKA denim, ballin' with no fundamentals
Michael Jackson off the Thriller dose, hold it from the killer dose
Cookin' up in the rental (Van), Emeril with the chemicals
Grippin' on my genitals, Northside general
Pull up in the Benz, Forgi' turn this sucker cynical, anyway (Northside)
Think about the drive-by any day (Northside)
Bet if I pass by (Northside), rollin' up that Mary J (Northside)
I might drop 30 like I'm Curry (Northside), you know, NBA (Northside)
Talk 'bout Andy Murray with the stick (Northside) and let it swing away (Northside)
Before I turn to black out, pimpin' out the crack house
Smackin' up on these bitches, flew the ho to fuck from Krakow
My dick threw her back out, packet flew her back out
Been runnin' and gunnin' and fuckin', now I'm trip and end up blackout
My name is the killer (North), Northside Gorilla
Mom and dad both fiends and my ex a pill dealer (Northside)
Thought I'd keep it realer, there's no drug I ain't touched
Best stay out yo' face, then I best see yo' place up
Or aim with yo' face up, this Glock with no make up
This weed be for warm-ups, I ain't even laced up
Fuckboy, get your rank up, robbin' and dealin' and homicide
Swipe, swipe, Wetto from the ghetto, I was born to die

Ruby gettin' up in the gizzas, lookin' like a blizzard
Keepin' an eye on these snakes in the grass, so I move just like a lizard
Fat boy taste vanilla, pop the painkillers
Grip the .45, I feel like the Grey Gorilla
Chicken heads flockin', they think I'm a quesadilla
Beatin' up the pussy, I must be a lady killer, yeah
Papa Pine, break yo' spine, rub her clit likes it's a vibe
Now she askin' what's my sign, so I threw up the 59
I'm a lord, out the 7th Ward I pick the lock on heaven's door
Feel no need to settle scores, leave pussies red and sore
Never called her back, she breakin' down like metalcore
Everybody still my sons like they fiendin' for peppercorn (7th Ward)
Check the score (7th Ward), Grey59 five and O in the fourth (7th Ward)
Rolled a blunt so big (7th Ward) you'll have to light it with a torch (7th Ward)
Whip look like it might've (7th Ward) lost the second World War (7th Ward)
Yup, Ruby such an animal (7th Ward)
Seventh Ward Dragon, when I breathe, it's fuckin' flammable
Keep my clique tight and isolated like we cannibals
Spit so many bars you'd think infinity is tangible
All these fuckin' chains, you would think I'm wearin' mandibles
Yeah, bitch, tell me what's happenin'
Dick so big, I'll turn her pussy to the Grand Canyon
All my haters pussy like I keep on smellin' salmon
Keep it old school, I might pull up with a cannon
Yeah, bitch, tell me what it is
Wake up with a smile, pickin' out the right fit
OJ in the mornin' like I stabbed a white bitch
Every color in the fucking rainbow, suck my white dick

Wait for a beep, dial 5-9 and hit the pound
Um, okay, so I'll talk to you later
