		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I live
As I live
As I live for tomorrow

While my mind is at rest
While my mind is at rest
There is no leaving or sorrow

While my mind is at rest
While my mind is at rest
There is no leaving or sorrow

As I live
As I live
As I live for tomorrow

As I live
As I live
AS I live for tomorrow

Still my heart is disturbed
Still my heart is disturbed

While my mind is at rest
While my mind is at rest
There is no leaving or sorrow

As I live
As I live
As I live for tomorrow

As I live
As I live
As I live for tomorrow

Still my heart is disturbed [Repeat: x 8]

As I live
As I live
As I live for tomorrow

As I live
As I live
As I live for tomorrow
