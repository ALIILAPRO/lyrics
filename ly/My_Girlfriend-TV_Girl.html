		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My girlfriend gets so depressed
She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend always leaves a mess
She says she's gonna clean
But she always forgets

My girlfriend is there when I get home
Watching movies on TV
Or talking on the phone
Sometimes I want to leave
But I got nowhere to go
But hey nobody's perfect
No one wants to be alone

My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
You can see it in her face
I don't say much, I just hope and pray
There's been some big mistake
And buy her flowers just in case

And I don't mind it when she
Goes out with her friends
They drop her off drunk
And I take her up to bed
She says 'I'm sorry' and I
Kiss her on the head and everything is fine
Until the morning comes again

I remember when we were in high school
I took her to the dance
We snuck out to the bleachers
And I thought that I might take a chance

But it never does any long-term good
To go thinking about the past
God damn this wandering mind of mine
That can't be happy with what it has

But I'm not mad and sometimes we still laugh
And when she's just getting up
And the sun hit's her right
She doesn't even look half bad

My girlfriend gets so depressed
She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
You can see it in her face
