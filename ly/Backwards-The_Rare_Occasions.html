		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, it's a sorry sight when the one you love
Is looking back at you from the arms of another
And oh sure, you're happy for her
But it's not what you wanted, it's not what you wanted
Pining it tends to wreck you
Timbers scatter as your hull shatters
And you feel like an inconvenience
Something don't quite belong in this sequence

Your world is torn apart
And the room is spinning faster
Should've seen it from the start
But there is no going backwards

It was months ago you lost her
Shoulda been phoning her up, but you were thinking it over
No sense in waiting around
So get over yourself and your boring feelings
Something don't quite belong in this sequence

Your world is torn apart
And the room is spinning faster
Should've seen it from the start
But there is no going backwards

And from the caverns
To the shore
Run around in circles
Forevermore
'Cause she was the light above the candle
You're sometimes dealt more than you can handle
So face it, it's never gonna happen
And all you know don't matter if you don't believe it

Your world is torn apart
And the room is spinning faster
Should've seen it from the start
But there is no going backwards

Your world is torn apart
And the room is spinning faster
Should've seen it from the start
But there is no going backwards
