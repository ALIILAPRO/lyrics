		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little Earl is driving down the Gulf Coast
Sitting on a pillow so he can see the road
Next to him is a twelve pack of beer 
Three frozen pizzas and two lighters as souvenirs

Little Earl's brother is bleeding in the backseat 
It's been twenty miles and he can't stop crying
Passing the houses on stilts on Holly Beach 
The AC don't work and Earl's sick in the Gulf Coast heat

Little Earl's uncle is gonna go through the roof
But he's working out of town until the end of June
They ain't supposed to use his car  
Or do anything that lets people know he's gone

Little Earl don't know what to do
He's looking for a hospital even though his brother don't want him to
He's starting to panic he's too scared to stop
He's never driven at night and he keeps getting lost
