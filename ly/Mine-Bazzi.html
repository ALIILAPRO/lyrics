		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh, yeah, nah I just, had a lil' bit too much of Hennessy
Just gotta tell you how I feel, look

You so fuckin' precious when you smile (huh, yeah)
Hit it from the back and drive you wild (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine (mine)

Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

I'm so fucking happy you're alive (huh, yeah)
Swear to God, I'm down if you're down, all you gotta say is right (yeah, yeah)
Girl, anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy, all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man, this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine

Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say
