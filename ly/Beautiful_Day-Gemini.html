		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a beautiful day
I wished for it a long time
It's a beautiful day
I had no-one next to me
I've waited for the sun
I dreamt of, It's been far too long
Seems like years since I felt something
I don't want to face it again
Tell me you're here to stay

There, here I am
Same as always
There, here I am
Same as always
Takes me time to fully heal through
Will I finally see
Let out a sigh
It's a beautiful day
From here and everywhere

I've waited for the sun
I dreamt of, It's been far too long
Seems like years since I felt something
I don't want to face it again
Tell me you're here to stay

There, here I am
Same as always
There, here I am
Same as always
Takes me time to fully heal through
Will I finally see
Let out a sigh
It's a beautiful day
From here and everywhere
