		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moment when you held me tight
Won't come back anymore
And at the end of that night
You slammed the door
My dream it died away
Just when I saw red
And nothing but a memory
Is left inside my head
Nothing is forever in life
But a memory believe it's true
And when I gaze in the rain
I'm crying just for you
The scarlet rose has died
Lost inside the night
Left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
The scarlet rose has died
The one and only way to catch
The beauty of a dawn
Is to take a picture
Of the growing sun
I got that experience
No one could steal away
One moment of your life is mine
I remember day by day
Nothing is forever in life
But a memory - believe it's true
And when I gaze in the rain
I'm crying just for you
The scarlet rose has died
Lost inside the night
Left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
The scarlet rose has died

The scarlet rose has died
Lost inside the night
Left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
The scarlet rose has died
The scarlet rose has died
Lost inside the night
Left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
The scarlet rose has died
