		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low (It's the Cataracs)
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low

It's like one, two, three, fuck it
I'm bout to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thing along with four more shots
Of Patron I give a fuck about going home
Straight buzzin' Robotussin'
Wanna get ya mitts in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin'

Yeah, I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
G-give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that boom boom pow

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low

It's like one, two, three, okay
Can I get a little goose in my OJ?
Everyday feel like my birthday
And we sip champagne when we thirsty
Quit fronting why yo husband
Tryna get his mitts in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin'

Yeah, I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
G-give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that boom boom pow

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low

Bass, bass, bass, bass
Bass, bass, bass, bass
Bass, bass, bass

I got a question for you
Do you, do you like it when I flow?
I got a question for you, ooh ooh
Do you like it when I flow?
With my bass down low

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know (Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low (To the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low (Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low (To the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
