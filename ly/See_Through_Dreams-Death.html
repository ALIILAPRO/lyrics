		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born into darkness
Where sounds portay the images that are out
Out of reach from my sight
Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away

In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identify
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound

[Solo: Schuldiner]

Close your eyes and imagine to be without
What we take for granted every time we open eyes
A permanent shadow to never step away
Feel the dark in the cold
Feel the warmth of the light
Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away
In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identify
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound
