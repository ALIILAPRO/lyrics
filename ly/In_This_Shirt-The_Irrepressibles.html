		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
Overcast by your shadow
As our worlds move on

In this shirt, I can be you
To be near you for a while
In this shirt, I can be you
To be near you for a while

There's a crane knocking down
All those things that we were
I awake in the night
To hear the engines pout

There's a pain, it does ripple
Through my frame, makes me lame
There's a thorn in my side
It's the shame, it's the prize

Of you and me, ever-changing
Moving on now, moving fast
And this touch must be wanted
Must become through your ask

But I need Jake to tell you
That I love you, it never rests
And I bled every day now
For a year, for a year

I did send you a note
On the wind for to read
Our names there together
Must've fallen like a seed

To the depths of the soil
Buried deep in the ground
On the wind, I can hear you
Call my name, held the sounds

I am lost, I am lost
In a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone

I am lost, I am lost
I am lost, I am lost
I am lost
