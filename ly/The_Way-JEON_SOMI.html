		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was your red balloon tied to you
With pretty ribbon
And pretty words kept me there (kept me there)
You start to think it's all real
And maybe we're one in a million
And maybe love isn't unfair (isn't unfair)

If I had known that
Sunrise would have turned rain in the afternoon
I would've never showed up
If I had known the blue skies would have turned gray
Then the honeymoon would have never meant so much

Baby, the way you left me ruined everything
Yeah, baby the way you left me ruined everything
And everything and everything
Made me crazy how all the perfect times are turning into one bad dream
Baby, the way you left me ruined everything
And everything and everything

Brings me back, back to you
Stories that we wrote together
Moves so fast, gone too soon (gone too soon)
Sometimes I wish I could
Rip out the pages, write a new ending
One with the lighter, shade of blue (shade of blue)

If I had known that
Sunrise would have turned rain in the afternoon
I would've never showed up
If I had known the blue skies would have turned gray
Then the honeymoon would have never meant so much

Baby, the way you left me ruined everything
Yeah, baby the way you left me ruined everything
And everything and everything
Made me crazy how all the perfect times are turning into one bad dream
Baby, the way you left me ruined everything
And everything and everything
