		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) 
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) 
(Oh, not another take)

Oh, it's like that
I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you 
Then you pulled back
Wanna try to make plans more than two hours in advance, hm-mmm

I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off

I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
Floating through the memories like, whatever, you're a waste of time
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch 
You fit every stereotype, send a pic
I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you out my life
With you out my life

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) 
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah

It feels so good not caring where you are tonight
And it feels so good not pretending to like the wine you like
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) I slam the door (slam the door), I hit ignore (hit ignore)
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, excited to never talk
I, I'm so sorry for your loss

I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
Floating through the memories like, whatever, you're a waste of time
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch 
You fit every stereotype, send a pic
I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you out my life
With you out my life

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) oh, mmm
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather

You want me, I'm done
You miss me? No, duh
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I'm done)
You miss me? No, duh
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at

You want me? I'm done (I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind)
You miss me? No, duh 
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I feel so much lighter, like a feather, with you off my mind)
You miss me? No, duh
Where I'm at? I'm up where I'm at
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah)
