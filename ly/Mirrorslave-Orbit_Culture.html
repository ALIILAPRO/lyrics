		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take what you need to take
You steal and no one notice
I promise, I'll protect you from it
You never cared, inject it, consume this

Say what you need to say
You'll be my host forever
I release, I can never ever
You never cared, inject it, consume this

I killed you, still you need me
I took your life and all you have is me

It's the only way out
It's the fear of pain
It's the will of feeling something more you can never feel
It's the only way out
It's the way of pain
It's the way of feeling sane, you're the living mirrorslave

Take what you need to take
You kill and no one notice
I promise, I'll help you through this
You never see, the answer for all this

Lies after all these lies
Always knew the real dark problem
Never cared to try to solve them
You never cared, inject it, consume them

I killed you, still you need me
I took your life and all you have is me

It's the only way out
It's the fear of pain
It's the will of feeling something more you can never feel
It's the only way out
It's the way of pain
It's the way of feeling sane, you're the living mirrorslave

In those eyes I saw a young boy crying clear
In those eyes I saw the devil staring back at me
In those eyes I saw a young girl scream in fear
In those eyes I saw the witch laugh uncontrollably

I am your life now year after year
Living for me in hell 

In this hell

I control you now like strings in skies, in chains, you and I
I control you now like strings in skies, in chains

You'll always be dying
