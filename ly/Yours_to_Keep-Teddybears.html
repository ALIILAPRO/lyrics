		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Won't you call my private number?
We can go away for the summer!

We can drive around with the top down
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to

But I hear that you wanna ditch me
But you know I'm not such a bad seed.

We can drive around with the top down
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to

We can have some fun with an ear drum
We can bang away on the tom tom

We can drive around with the top down
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to

Won't you come on down to the freak show?
He can sit along as my hair grows.

We can drive around with the top down
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
