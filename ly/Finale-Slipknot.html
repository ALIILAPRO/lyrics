		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's a shame but I gotta stay because I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day but I like it here
I know it's a shame but I gotta stay because I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day but I like it here
I like it here

The sentiment, the sad things, the punishment, the bad things
The cellular, the solenoid, the outer reach, the inner void
I keep repeating older answers, the questions are all brand new
Does the room seem smaller these days? Does the road seem long to you?
The accidents, the bitter pills, the populace, the stronger wills
The innocence, the common sense, the rare occasions exist

I know it's a shame but I gotta stay because I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day but I like it here

I know it's a shame but I gotta stay because I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day but I like it here

The harder work, the darker thoughts, the ultimatums, the tangled knots
The long depressions, the shorter fuse, denominator is you

Everybody has a cross to bear
I'll nail you up on mine
Couldn't tell you, don't know where to begin
Won't crumble not this time

I know it's a shame but I gotta stay because I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day but I like it here
I know it's a shame but I gotta stay because I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day but I like it here
I like it here
