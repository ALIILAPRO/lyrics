		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder)
Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder)
Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder)
Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder)
 
Slice the pie in half                             
You'll make it half the night                    
If you're losing it                      
Get used to it 
 
Slice the pie in half                             
You'll make it half the night                    
If you're losing it                      
Get used to it 
 
Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder)
Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder) 
Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder)
Natural laws are born and raised in disorder (in disorder)
 
Time to make it right                                                             
To get it together
To follow the weather
To crack under pressure
It's way past midnight 
cnd the moon Is bright 
But you know there's no right time 
To do it all right
To do it all wrong
To just face it
 
Slice the pie in half                             
You'll make it half the night                    
If you're losing it                      
Get used to it 
 
Slice the pie in half                             
You'll make it half the night                    
If you're losing it                      
Get used to it 
 
In disorder
In disorder
In disorder
In disorder
