		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the caves we emerge
Into the hard driving rain
All around the barren fells
The coven gather again

And there, veiled in the mist
Pendle Hill stands tall
Above the barren fields
She shines phantasmagorical

Out of the caverns, onto the moor
Through cols and passes we process toward the pinnacle
From subterranea to summit stone
Now we pilgrims ascend, we climb toward the mountain throne
Mountain throne

Under a pall of freezing fog
We find our way in the murk
Trudging on, torch in hand
To do the devil's work

On the black ridge we convene
Come the witching hour
When at the wuthering peak
We'll reconstruct the Malkin Tower

Out of the caverns, onto the moor
Through cols and passes we process toward the pinnacle
From subterranea to summit stone
Now we pilgrims ascend, we climb toward the mountain throne

So now bow down
As the sabbath fires burn
Demdike and Chattox have finally come home
From the devil's pulpit
Their sermon holds all in thrall
At the Hexenaltar we heed Karnayna's call

Out of the caverns, onto the moor
Through cols and passes we process toward the pinnacle
From subterranea to summit stone
Now we pilgrims ascend, we climb toward the mountain throne
