		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me as I am
Take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even when I'm alone
I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies (sweetest melodies)
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free
It's got me singing

God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America

Take me as I am
Don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe
I might be standing outside
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even walking alone, I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me (arms around me)
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free
It's got me thinking

God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America (sweetest melodies)

Even with you I've got nothing to lose
So you'd better believe that nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear (sweetest melodies)
Even when you talk that talk with those lips I'm most certain in hell
I'll never feel, never feel lonely
I have no fear
It's got me thinking (Yeah)

God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful people in it
May they stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America, and all the beautiful people in it
And all the beautiful people in it
