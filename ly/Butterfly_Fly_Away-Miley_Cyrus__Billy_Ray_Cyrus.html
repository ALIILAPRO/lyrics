		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tucked me in, turned out the lights
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that

Brushed my teeth and combed my hair, had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when
I looked back

You had to do it all alone, make a livin', make a home
Must have been as hard as it could be

And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold in tight
I promise you, there will come a day
Butterfly, fly away

Butterfly, fly away, butterfly, fly away
Flap your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true

Butterfly, fly away, butterfly, fly away
We've been waiting for this day
All along and knowing just what to do
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, fly away

Butterfly, fly away
Butterfly, fly away
