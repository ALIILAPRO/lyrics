		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me, even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on babe
Now I know what I have found

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I'm latching on to you (I'm latching on to you)
I won't let go of you (I won't let go)
I'm latching on to you (I don't wanna let go)
I won't let go of you (I won't let go, I won't let go)

(I won't let go, I won't let go)
