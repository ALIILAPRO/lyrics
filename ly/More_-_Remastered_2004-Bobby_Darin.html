		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  More than the greatest love
The world has known,
This is the love 
That I give to you, 
Alone.

More than the simple words
I try to say,
I only live to love you
More each day.

More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so.
My life will be in your keeping;
Waking, sleeping,
Laughing, weeping.

Longer than always
Is a long, long time.
But far beyond forever,
You'll be mine.
I know I never lived before,
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more.

More than the greatest love
The world has known,
This is the love
That I give to you,
Alone.

More than the simple words
I try to say,
I only live to love you
More each day.

More than you'll ever know
My arms got to hold you so.
My life will be in your keeping;
Waking, sleeping,
Laughing, weeping.

Longer than always 
Is a long, long, long time.
But far beyond forever
You'll be mine.
I know I never lived before,
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more.
