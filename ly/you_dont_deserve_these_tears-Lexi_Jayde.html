		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I really need a therapist
'Cause you really fucked me up
I think it's kinda funny that
Your mom and dad
Are texting me "congrats" on all my songs
I think I should be over this
'Cause it's been too fucking long
I should be forgetting you, hating you
Moving on where did I go wrong?

'Cause you don't deserve it
The way that I'm hurting
Oh, how did I end up here?
'Cause you're out there laughing
While I'm stuck here crying in the mirror
Screaming, "You don't deserve these tears"

Maybe I should text you drunk
Try to run into your friends
See you at a party, say you'rе sorry
That you miss me and you wish we didn't end
Oh, damn it, what thе fuck?
I'm getting all up in my head
I know that you were shitty
Didn't treat me right
So why am I still missing you again?

'Cause you don't deserve it
The way that I'm hurting
Oh, how did I end up here?
'Cause you're out there laughing
While I'm stuck here crying in the mirror
Screaming, "You don't deserve these tears"

So why am I crying? Why am I crying?
Tell me, why am I crying? Why am I crying?
