		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Usher
Yeah, man

So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from side to side
Side, side to side, uh
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life
Back, back to life
Hands up, uh
Yeah, suddenly we all got our hands up, uh
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (love again)
Yeah baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)

Keep downing drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right now, now, now
Now, now-now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherf- down, down, down
Down, down-down, down (come on)

Hands up, uh
When the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I've seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (love again)
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Usher, don't lie (oh)
Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil
Get it baby? Hope you catch that like T-O
That's how we roll, my life is a movie, and you just TIVO
Mami got me twisted like a dreadlock
She don't wrestle, but I got her in a headlock
Yabba-dabba-doo, make her bedrock, mami on fire, psh, red hot
Bada bing, bada boom, Mr. Worldwide as I step in the room
I'm a hustler baby, but that you knew
And tonight it's just me and you

'Cause baby, tonight (dale)
The DJ got us falling in love again
(Mr. Worldwide, yeah, yeah, let's take over the world)
Yeah baby, tonight (yeah, man)
DJ got us fallin' in love (dale, leggo)
Fallin' in love, oh-whoa
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight (come on, come on)
The DJ got us falling in love again (yeah)
Yeah baby, tonight (somebody get the DJs up)
The DJ got us falling in love again (somebody get the DJs up)
(Somebody get the hands up, get the hands up, get your hands up, ow, come on)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)

Hahaha
Yeah, thank you, DJ, haha
