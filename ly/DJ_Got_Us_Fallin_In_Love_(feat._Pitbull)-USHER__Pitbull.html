		  Usher
Yeah, man

So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from side to side
Side, side to side, uh
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life
Back, back to life
Hands up, uh
Yeah, suddenly we all got our hands up, uh
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (love again)
Yeah baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)

Keep downing drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right now, now, now
Now, now-now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherf- down, down, down
Down, down-down, down (come on)

Hands up, uh
When the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I've seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (love again)
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again, again)

Oh
Usher, yeah
Usher, DJs, yeah
Usher
All around the world, come on
Usher
Listen

Hands up, now when the music drops
I wanna see your hands up

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (yeah, yeah)
Yeah baby, tonight (yeah, man)
DJ got us fallin' in love (leggo)
Fallin' in love, oh-whoa
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight (come on, come on)
The DJ got us falling in love again (yeah)
Yeah baby, tonight (somebody get the DJs up)
The DJ got us falling in love again (somebody get the DJs up)
(Somebody get the hands up, get the hands up, get your hands up, ow, come on)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (l-love again-gain)
