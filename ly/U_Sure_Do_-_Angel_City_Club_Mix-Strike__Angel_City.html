		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You sure do
Come on, baby

You sure make me feel like lovin' you
You sure make me feel like lovin' you
You sure make me feel like lovin' you
You sure make me feel like lovin' you

You sure do
You sure do

Nothin' looks the same in the light
Standin' here right by your side
We're two of a kind, you're on my mind
Love will see us through
When the music flows and a vision comes
It makes me feel like lovin' you

You sure make me feel like lovin' you
Lovin' you, yeah, baby
You sure make me feel like lovin' you

You sure do
You sure do

Let's do it
Let's do it

Nothin' looks the same in the light
Standin' here right by your side
We're two of a kind, you're on my mind
Love will see us through
When the music flows and a vision comes
It makes me feel like lovin' you

You sure make me feel like lovin' you
Lovin' you, yeah, baby
You sure make me feel like lovin' you
You sure make me feel like lovin' you
You sure make me feel like lovin' you

You sure do
Make me feel
You sure do
Make me feel
You sure do
Make me feel
You sure do
