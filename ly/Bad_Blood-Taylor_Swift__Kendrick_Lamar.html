		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

Hey, I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (hey)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (ah)
You made a really deep cut (ah)
And, baby, now we've got bad blood (hey)

Hey, remember when you tried to write me off? (Ah-ah)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back, brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (hey)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood (hey)

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (hey)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (hey)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood (hey)
