		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the way
know I’m running late
been a long day
can’t wait to see your face
know that you can ease my mind
and I deserve to just unwind

I’ll let you take the lead
Imma bring the weed
you and a zoot
is really all that I need
baby I’ll be there in five
then you can have all of my time

Cause you deserve it
you deserve it
know you earned this
baby you deserve it

Uber pulls up to your crib at last
from the door to your bed in a flash
take my mind off the stress from the past
know just I what I need don’t have to ask

Cause you deserve it
know you earned this
baby you deserve it

Baby you deserve this yeah
I deserve it too
Oh we deserve this
Oh we deserve this yeah

You look so perfect when you’re sleeping
wish I could lay with you all day
you’re all I see when I am dreaming
don’t wanna let this moment slip away

Cause you got a hold on me
It’s hard to explain
wish I could tell you how I’m feeling
but your girlfriend's probably on the way
