		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey, this club here is stuck up
Dinner and diatribes
I knew it from the first look of
The look of mischief in your eyes
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Head is the talking type
I'd suffer Hell if you'd tell me
What you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me, ah

That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar I am of pride
Scarcely can speak for my thinking
What you'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end is in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing
What you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man

That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love

Ohh
Let there be hotels complaints and grievances raised
In that kind of love
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)

Ohh
Let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
In that kind of love
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)

That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of, ah
Oh

And that's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)

And that's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love)
