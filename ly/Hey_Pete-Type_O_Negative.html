		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Peter, where you going with that axe in your hand
Hey Peter, where you going with that axe in your hand

I'm gonna kill my lady 'cause
I caught her screwing around with some other men
I'm gonna kill my lady 'cause
I caught her fucking around with some other men

Hey Peter, I heard you cut your woman down
Hey Peter, I heard you cut your woman down
Cut her down to the ground

Last night I killed my lady 'cause
I caught her screwing around with every guy in town
Last night I killed my lady 'cause
I caught her screwing around all over this town

Hey Peter, where you're gonna run to now
Hey Peter, where you're gonna go

I'll take that D-train
Take it down to Brighton Beach, to bay 7
I'll take that D-train
Take it down to Brighton Beach, Brighton Beach

I'll see my baby to heaven
I'll see my baby to heaven
