		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got?

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so, so, so blind
I'm a man
Can't you see what I am?
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got? Baby

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you, oh no, no

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
