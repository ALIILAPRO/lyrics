		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Plane rides and jewelry, fast life ain't new to me
(Fast life ain't new to me)
Plane rides and jewelry, fast life ain't new to me
(Fast life ain't new to me)
Off white, she go ten times, dim light with them thin lines
Dim light, she go all night and it's 3AM and we all right
Disconnecting the phone lines, distractions baby, I don't like
Double faded, going all night, I could live like this my whole life
Thin white with that red wine, all night if she spend time
Long nights in the spot light and it's 5AM and we all right
Captivated by strobe lights, elevated, we so high
Might escape my slow mind, I could live like this my whole life
Eyes wide, I've got blurred site, my mind, it don't work right
All night, I've been up like, long time without sunlight
Eyes wide, I've got blurred site, my mind, it don't work right
My mind, it don't work right, eyes wide, I've got blurred site
(Fast life ain't new to me)
Plane rides and jewelry, fast life ain't new to me
Plane rides and jewelry, fast life ain't new to me
(Fast life ain't new to me)
