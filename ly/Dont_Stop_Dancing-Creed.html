		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At times life is wicked and I just can't
See the light
A silver lining sometimes isn't enough
To make some wrong seem right
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees, hoping

But I know I must go on
Although I hurt I must be strong
Because inside I know that many
Feel this way

Children don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly 
Away, away

At times life's unfair and you know
It's plain to see
Hey God I know I'm just a dot in this world
Have you forgot about me?
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees, hoping

But I know I must go on
Although I hurt I must be strong
Because inside I know that many
Feel this way

Children don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away, away

Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
But I know I must go on
Although I hurt I must be strong
Because inside I know that many feel this way

Children don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away, away

Children don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away, away

Children don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away, away

Am I hiding in the shadows?
Are we hiding in the shadows?
