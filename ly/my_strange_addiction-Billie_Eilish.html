		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do the Scarn

Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin' to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

I'm really, really sorry
I think I was just relieved to see that Michael Scott got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie's amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever 'cause I don't self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass?
Can't you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothin' lasts
Like I don't know
You could kiss my askin' about my motto

You should enter it in festivals
Or carnivals
Thoughts?
Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool, right?

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?
