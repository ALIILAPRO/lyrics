		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (makeup)
I say a little prayer for you
And while combing my hair, now
And wondering what dress to wear, now (wear, now)
I say a little prayer for you

Forever (forever), forever ('ever)
You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever (forever), and ever (ever)
We never will part, oh, how I love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it must be
To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me

Mmhm
I run for the bus, dear
But while riding I think of us, dear (us, dear)
I say a little prayer for you
And at work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time (break time)
I say a little prayer for you

Forever (forever), forever ('ever)
You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
We never will part, oh, how I love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it must be
To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me
Nobody but me

Forever ('ever), and ever (ever) 
You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever (forever), and ever (ever) 
We never will part, oh, how I love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it must be
To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me

Mmh-mhm
My darling, believe me (believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please, love me true
I'm in love with you
(Answer my prayer) answer my prayer, babe
(Answer my prayer) say you love me true
(Answer my prayer) answer my prayer, baby
(Answer my prayer) yeah

Forever (forever), and ever (ever) 
You'll stay (ever) in my heart and I will love you
Forever (forever), and ever (ever) 
We never will part, oh, how I love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it must be
To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me
Oh, nobody but me

My darling, believe me (believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please, love me true
This is my prayer (answer my prayer, baby)
Answer my prayer now, babe (answer my prayer, baby)
This is my prayer (answer my prayer, baby)
Answer it right now, babe (answer my prayer, baby)
Say you love me true (answer my prayer, baby)
This is my prayer, baby (answer my prayer, baby)
