		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Four door corolla yet I only need two
Red lips and white lies
Giving berry the blues
Bungee jump in the buggy she put the
Blunt in my view you got all of my mind
My only philosophy's you
Love jones sweater jacket just about to
Truth is I've been trying to flex
Learning sex is the move
But setting the mood up around it
My big mouth ain't as smooth
You rolling paradise with me
Got bonita on cue
I needed you I needed to believe
You believed in true love
Called a venus dude what only real niggas do
So I vandalized heaven made a
Place for me and you
Cause we ain't perfect but it's worth it
And I got a scenic view
Of heartache and a burglary
Been addicted to hurtles its ricocheted
(I love you)
But turned with hints of discouragement
Maybe I ain't really that nigga
Just fit for the services
Oh you actually saw me for how
I'm feeling these verses and I'm
Like four door whips with just two bodies
Need not a Bugatti corolla my boo got it
Gas pass left both our high's got drolics
But you? I knew to no surprise who was riding
Let's bounce and bounce

I got all my fears in one place
Got a one-way ticket on my waist
Oh this bed ain't sitting right I'm
Rolling to the other side
While I've been thinking 'bout you
Imma see you where the sun is hot
Imma get you in a perfect spot
Oh this bed ain't sitting right and
I'll be on another flight
Some things just come and go
Baby some things just come and go
Baby they just won't let go baby

Four door corolla yet I only need two
White lips and white lies
Giving berry the blues
Bungee jump in the buggy she put
The blunt in my view you got all of my mind
My only philosophy's you
