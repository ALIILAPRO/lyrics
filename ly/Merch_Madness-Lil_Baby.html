		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Merch madness, I done took it global (global, global)
Jump back in my bag, did this one for the culture (culture)
Ain't too good to give, my cup been runnin' over
Made these millions for the kids, I gotta turn it over (turn it over)

They see how I live now, I can't forget the feelin'
My daddy in the ground, my mama independent
I can call on some of my friends, ain't no one I depend on
Tryna run up all these M's and go sit in the endzone
I gotta give back, I got every reason
Winnin' team be every season
In the streets, I let 'em see me, let the kids know they can be one
Lawyers doctors, authors, you ain't gotta rap or make it D1
Build up a foundation you can stand on, just grow up and be somethin'
I took what they gave me and went way further
I conquered every obstacle and every hurdle
Lookin' through a lens might think my life perfect
God gave me a gift and it came with a purpose

Merch madness, I done took it global (global, global)
Jump back in my bag, did this one for the culture (culture)
Ain't too good to give, my cup been runnin' over
Made these millions for the kids, I gotta turn it over (turn it over)
Merch madness, I done took it global (global, global)
Jump back in my bag, did this one for the culture (culture)
Ain't too good to give, my cup been runnin' over
Made these millions for the kids, I gotta turn it over (turn it over)

It was rough but I made it happen
I came up, but I'm still at it
Real trench baby, business with Fanatics
This like twenty million on a giveaway
Twenty buses, twenty cities, stadium to stadium
See they idols givin' back to them, makin' people go crazy
I get paid when I appear
To do this, I volunteer
This is not a one-time thing, it gets better every year
Lot of people pulled a lot of strings just to make this happen
Real people really do exist, but they might call it magic

Merch madness, I done took it global (global, global)
Jump back in my bag, did this one for the culture (culture)
Ain't too good to give, my cup been runnin' over
Made these millions for the kids, I gotta turn it over (turn it over)
Merch madness, I done took it global (global, global)
Jump back in my bag, did this one for the culture (culture)
Ain't too good to give, my cup been runnin' over
Made these millions for the kids, I gotta turn it over (turn it over)
