		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you workin', I know you want it bad
Below the surface, you envy what they have
I wish you knew it's not worth it, babe
Not worth it (not worth it)
I could tell you're lost, you know that I got you
You don't need to rush (to rush), you don't need to rush, no
I know it's too much, just hold on, I got you
We won't fuck this up (fuck this up)

You know I got you, babe, got you, babe (got you, babe)
I know it's hard on you to play this game (play this game)
Don't let them fuck with you
Money comes and goes, it won't ever be enough (no)
It's not worth it, babe (not worth it, babe)
Not worth it, babe (not worth it, baby)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Not worth it, babe, worth it, baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Not worth it, babe, worth it, baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

You know I'm workin' late, you know I want it badly
One thing's for certain, babe, I'm missin' what we had and
I wish you knew (knew)
What I'ma do when I get back home, girl, I need that
It'll be worth the wait (worth the wait)
You been there when it's crazy
Kept my toes on the ground through the ups and downs
Never lettin' go of my baby
That's my day one 'til my days is done
This time, it's on
Take my past life and wipe it off
I'ma make you my wife and all 'cause

You know I got you, babe, got you, babe (I got you, got you, babe)
I know it's hard on you to play this game (play this game)
Don't let them fuck with you
Money comes and goes, it won't ever be enough (no)
It's not worth it, babe (not worth it, babe)
Not worth it, babe (not worth it, babe)

'Cause I care for you, care for you
Always there for you, there for you
Not alone, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Said I care for you, care for you
Always there for you, there for you
Come back home (come back home)

You know I got you, babe, got you, babe (got you, babe)
I know it's hard on you to play this game (play this game)
Don't let them fuck with you
Money comes and goes, it won't ever be enough (no)
It's not worth it, babe (not worth it, babe)
Not worth it, babe (not worth it, babe)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
