		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-ah
Oh-woah

Sorry, not sorry, don't mind me
I'm livin' the dream, livin' the dream, yeah
Came from nothin', whoever thought that we would be
Livin' the dream? Livin' the dream, yeah

We The Best Music
Another one
DJ Khaled

Hear ye, hear ye, only kings stand near me
Silicon Valley money mixed with Henny, that's Effendi
Half a century almost, sliced the green like a lawnmower
'Til we all on, never fall off, hear a boss talk
You don't hear me? That's your loss
Winner in life, fuck a coin toss
I'm coin-based, basically cryptocurrency Scarface
Join us, there's gotta be more of us
I'm from the ghetto, what location? Two seconds from the Devil
I live heavenly in Cabo, with a Mexican sombrero
Drink heavily, health is wealth (health is wealth)
Look at wealthy me, wipe your nose, HSTRY my type of clothes
Miss me with the hate, helped so many people get cake
Whips and cream for the crew, no other weed, that thing faster
The time I spit this, I started some other business (some other business)
Came from the pitchin' (came from the pitchin')', 'caine in the kitchen
Dangerous missions, wastin' your time if you want my forgiveness (forgiveness)

Sorry, not sorry, don't mind me
I'm livin' the dream, livin' the dream, yeah
Came from nothin', whoever thought that we would be
Livin' the dream? Livin' the dream, yeah

Sorry, that's another B
Haters still ain't recover from the other B
Mmm, that's a double B
Nah, that's a triple B, can't forget 'bout the other Bey (hey)
It's the white gloves for me
Hater know not to touch me, I'm with the fuckery (fuck with me)
Humbly (humbly), nah, respectfully
I'm a project baby, fuck y'all expect from me? (Technically)
'Merica's disrespect for me
You killed Christ, you created religion, unexpectedly
Circular ice on Japanese whiskey, on my mezzanine
Overlookin' the City of Angels, the angel invested in things
Unprecedented run (facts)
Everybody's gettin' bands, we just dance to different drums 
I like who I've become
Intermittin' fastin', but these mil's, I'm not missin' none, sorry

Sorry, not sorry, don't mind me
I'm livin' the dream, livin' the dream, yeah
Came from nothin', whoever thought that we would be
Livin' the dream? Livin' the dream, yeah

La-la, la-la, la, la-la (oh, oh-oh, oh)
La, la, la-la (oh, oh-oh, oh)
La, la, la-la (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
La, la, la-la 
La, la, la-la (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
La, la, la-la (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
La, la, la-la (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
