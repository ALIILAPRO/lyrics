		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away
(I've tried to walk away)
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh, oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop if love me (you will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry (that day forever)
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me, babe ooh

Oh you'd better stop (stop) before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop (stop) before you go and break my heart
Ooh (you'd better) you'd better stop, babe stop 
(You'd better) ooh you'd better stop, babe stop
(You'd better) Babe stop
Babe stop
(You'd better, you'd better)
You'd better stop, stop, stop, stop
(You'd better, you'd better)
Babe stop
(You'd better, you'd better)
You'd better stop
(You'd better, you'd better)
Oh oh yeah yeah yeah (you'd better)
(You'd better, you'd better)
(You'd better)
(You'd better, you'd better)
