		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tall white house with an empty room
And your name carved over the door
Facing out to the tallest view
From your place on the second floor
Sound it out to an empty house
Was it just like you had before
Savior pulled from an open mouth
Did you want to be something more

Now you're taller than you've ever been
There's a mark on the wall, you see
I'm sure that someone will draw a new one
And cover it before they leave
Mark my words
There's a thousand things
That don't wash out with anything
I keep you clean
You surrounded me
And my windows are breaking

Something is rotten inside of me
I have to find it and
Cut it out
Cut it out
