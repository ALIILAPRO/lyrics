		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ridin' 'round town with no lights on
Bumpin' Darkthrone out my Audi A4
Pentagram on my shawty torso
Nails on my neck 'bout blood-soaked
I ain’t got no heart, it’s still in Moscow
You must not be flame if you got smoke
Blood so cold, where my trench coat?

Wait until they see what’s in my
Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what in my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my

Ever since I was a fetus
I knew that I could be
This reincarnated elated Crowley
I’m misunderstood and I’m proud about it now
I’m roundin' up all the
Calloused and malice and
Puttin' em all up in a palace
Call it the White House, no power balance
Now let me get another shot at living
And I’ll never take it for granted again
I swear to what? None!
Hallway greeted with a gun
How has it come to this? Everybody run!
Police will put you in a wooden
Box in the ground if
You look at 'em wrong in
The wrong part of town
But a motherfucker with a gun at a campus
Blastin' away at the staff and masses you’ll

Let, live on again, with no regrets oh, bet
Who the fuck let you paint the land all red?
It’s all a mess, I’m just a guest
Go blast, your local press
And kill 'em all, kill 'em all

Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what up my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my trench coat
Wait until they see what’s in my
