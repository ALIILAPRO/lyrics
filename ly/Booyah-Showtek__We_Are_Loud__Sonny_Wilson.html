		  Yes all we care about is dem party
Keeping the good vibes good vibes in the air now

Feelin' high feelin' high!
Everyone up in the club is down with this rockin'

And that's how it is now, rocking them now
Long, all night long, all night long now
You better be up on that dance floor now
Get in that rhythm now
