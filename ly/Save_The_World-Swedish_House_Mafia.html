		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Into the streets, we're coming down
We never sleep, never get tired
Through urban fields, and suburban life

Turn the crowd up now, we'll never back down
Shoot down a skyline, watch it in prime time
Turn up the love now, listen up now, turn up the love

Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring you back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

We're far from home, it's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

Turn the crowd up now, we'll never back down
Shoot down a skyline, watch it in prime time
Turn up the love now, listen up now, turn up the love

Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring you back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

Who's gonna save?
Who's gonna bring? 
We're gonna make it, you and I
Who's gonna save?
Who's gonna bring? 
We're gonna save the world tonight
