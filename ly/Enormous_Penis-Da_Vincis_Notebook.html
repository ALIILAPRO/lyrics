		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever life gets you down,
Keeps you wearing a frown,
And the gravy train has left you behind
And when you're all out of hope,

Down at the end of your rope,
And nobody's there to throw you a line
If you ever get so low
That you don't know which way to go

Come on and take a walk in my shoes
Never worry 'bout a thing
Got the world on a string
Cause I've got the cure for all of my blues.

[Chorus]
I take a look at my enormous penis
And my troubles start melting away.
I take a look at my enormous penis
And the happy times are coming to stay.

I gotta sing and I dance
When I glance in my pants
And the feeling's like a sunshiney day
I take a look at my enormous penis
And everything is going my way.

[Chorus]

Yeah I got great big amounts
In the place where it counts
And the feeling's like a sunshiney day
I take a look at my enormous penis
And everything is going my way.

Everything is going my way
