		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me all ah walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
What a piece of body gyal
Tell me where you get it from
Knock 'pon your entrance
Ram pa pa pam pam
Gyal let me in
Me have di ting weh you ah wait pon
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
What a piece of body gyal
Ah where you get it from?
Knock 'pon your entrance
Ram pa pa pam pam
Gyal let me in (why?)

Buju B would be more than glad to take your hand
And lead you to the Promise Land in my twenty foot divan
All you got to do is be true, so let's correspond
Satisfy your emotions
Hot off ah di press, instantly she buss
She nuh old and tough and she nuh got on no rust
Skin smooth and precious like she never get a cut
Pants front ah expand I've got to haul and pull up
Giddy up, me haffi get you is a must

King Kong walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
What a piece of body gyal
Tell me where you get it from
Knock 'pon your entrance
Ram pa pa pam pam
Girl let me in
Me have ee ting

But nuff man ah call, you nuh look fi dem way
You look good, you n'affi guess, no matta what a gyal say
Put on yuh clothes, it's like a display
Man ah swear and ah stare both night and day
Could you be my honey? Y'ah di woman lay lay
With a gorgeous smile on her face and say
She wants a man fi do di work not one fi play
A marathon man, she says she want one fi stay

Ah Buju all ah walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
What a piece of body gyal
Tell me where you get it from
Knock 'pon your entrance
Ram pa pa pam pam
Gyal let me in
Me got di ting weh you ah wait pon
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
What a piece of body gyal
Ah where you get it from?
Knock 'pon your entrance
Ram pa pa pam pam
Gyal let me in (why?)

I sing, woman I want to settle down really start a plan
To how you look I've come to one conclusion (wah?)
You're supposed to know di work, suppose to full ah action
Music ah play, your waist respond
Non-stop ticking just like a time-bomb
Ah you every man wan slam

Buju Banton all ah walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
What a piece of body gyal
Tell me where you get it from
Knock 'pon your entrance
Ram pa pa pam pam
Gyal let me in
Me got di ting weh you ah wait pon
Walk like a champion
Talk like a champion
What a piece of body gyal
Ah where you get it from?
Knock 'pon your entrance
Ram pa pa pam pam
Gyal let me in (cry)

An' Buju would be more than glad to take your hand
And lead you to the Promise Land in my twenty foot divan
All you got to do is be true, so let's correspond
Satisfy your emotion
Hot off ah di press, instantly she buss
She nuh old and tough and she nuh got on no rust
Skin smooth and precious like she never get a cut
Pants front ah expand I've got to haul and pull up
Giddy up, me haffi get you is a must

Buju all ah walk like a champion
Talk like a champion

Man ah swear and ah stare both night and day
Could I be your honey? Y'ah di woman lay lay
With a gorgeous smile on her face and say, ay ay
Want a man fi work it, not fi play
Want a marathon man, who can stay
