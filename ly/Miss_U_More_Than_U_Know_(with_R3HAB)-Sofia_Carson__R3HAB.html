		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up alone to somethin' I've been getting used to
It's been a while since I could call you mine
I tell all my friends that I've been happier without you
But I still think about you all the time

You bring my heart out
Spin me up and
I kinda wish you knew
How much you put me through
You bring my heart out
Think you broke it
Don't know if you'll ever see
How much you hurt me

Yeah, I know that I said you'd be easy to forget
But I know I'll never get you off my mind
And I know that I said that I'd wish we never met
But it's only 'cause you let me go
I miss you more than you know

I miss you more than you know
I miss you more than you know
I miss you more than you know
I miss you more than you know

When you packed up all your things, I told you I was happy
But "Better off without you" was a lie
I tell all my friends that I've been happier without you
But I still think about you all the time

You bring my heart out
Spin me up and
I kinda wish you knew
How much you put me through
You bring my heart out
Think you broke it
Don't know if you'll ever see
How much you hurt me

Yeah, I know that I said you'd be easy to forget
But I know I'll never get you off my mind
And I know that I said that I wish we never met
But if only 'cause you let me go
I miss you more than you

(I miss you)
I miss you more than you know
('Cause you let me go)
I miss you more than you know
(You let me go)
I miss you more than you know
I miss you more than you know
