		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh

I could never take this shit for nothing
Sit back, nigga, I be havin' real discussions
Future time, I'm tryna have a bill' or somethin'
Where the love? I'm gettin' tired of the lust and
Crushin', yeah, your bitch, she blushin'
In my crib, she dustin', no rustin', it's jumpin'
I ain't kickin' shit, yeah, no puntin', no frontin'
Don't know why you knockin' on this door, ain't no love here

I ain't get it easy, nigga, but I get it jumpin'
I can't stand around nobody that don't stand for nothin'
I keep it on my conscience, I be on some boss shit
Anywhere I go I treat the world like my office
Oh, you givin' handouts? Only know what that could do
Only one way, yeah, that shit could just get back at you
I be in my zone now, I be in my avenue
I would have my own town, just so I'm the only mood

I know that it's all in one
Said she want the squad, she want all of us
Said she got a friend, tell her, "Call one"
Said she got a friend, she want all of us
All of us, yeah

I could never take this shit for nothing
Sit back, nigga, I be havin' real discussions
Future time, I'm tryna have a bill' or somethin'
Where the love? I'm gettin' tired of the lust and
Crushin', yeah, your bitch, she blushin'
In my crib, she dustin', no rustin', it's jumpin'
I ain't kickin' shit, yeah, no puntin', no frontin'
Don't know why you knockin' on this door, ain't no love here
