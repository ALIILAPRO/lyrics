		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  3 AM I'm spinning 'round the room
All these voices tell me what to do

Head rush, I'm speeding up, I'm losing all control
I know what I'm needing and I feel it more and more
4 AM still spinning 'round the room

I can't sleep at night
All my thoughts, they multiply
And I hear them all the time
There's a party in my mind
I can't sleep at night
All my thoughts, they multiply
And I hear them all the time
There's a party in my mind

(Attention)
Can't turn down the noise, it's deafening
Show me how to find myself again

Head rush, I'm speeding up, I'm losing all control
I know what I'm needing and I feel it more and more
5 AM this feeling never ends

I can't sleep at night
All my thoughts, they multiply
And I hear them all the time
There's a party in my mind
I can't sleep at night
All my thoughts, they multiply
And I hear them all the time
There's a party in my mind

I can't sleep at night
All my thoughts, they multiply
And I hear them all the time
There's a party in my mind
(Attention)
