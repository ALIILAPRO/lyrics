		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't try
Stare in the mirror
Don't try
I'm not here

Don't try
I'm not living
Don't try
I'm just waiting around

I've been forced to remember
So much more than today
I've no choice but to take with me
Everything I wanted to say

Islands caught in the middle
Islands unto ourselves
I've been forced to remember
Everything I want to forget

Don't try
Fear of the middle
Just a face in the crowd
Don't try
I stare in mirror
Let it bring me down

Don't try
Years wasted
Just a face in the crowd
Don't try
The future's here
And there's no way out

I've been forced to remember
So much more than today
I've no choice but to take to the grave
Everything I wanted to say

Islands caught in the middle
Islands unto ourselves
I've been forced to remember
Everything I want to forget
