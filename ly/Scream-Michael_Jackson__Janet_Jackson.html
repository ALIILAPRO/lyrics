		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it

Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight

With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just wanna scream

I'm tired of you telling the story your way
You're causing confusion, you think it's okay, damn it
You keep changing up rules, while I keep playing the game
I can't take it much longer, I think I might go insane

With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
So Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me wanna scream

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (all the injustice)

With such delusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream (stop your pressure)
