		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday
9-1-1, it's a man down
(20rocket on this bitch, so it's gon' knock)
Yeah, whole lotta, whole lotta

Money get involved, niggas gettin' crossed out (yeah)
Thought that was your man down, ooh, that's a big plot
Got you niggas' life in my hand, time'll get you shot
You ain't even gotta sell work, drank get on my nerves (damn)
That's why I just sip all this syrup and I just think 'bout murder
God sayin', "Please don't do it to 'em," devil sayin', "Hurt 'em"
Murder, murder, kill on my mind, I just wanna murder
Always keep the steel on my side, shells than a turtle

Yellow tape, yellow tape, yeah, yeah
Yellow tape, yellow tape (yeah), 9-1-1, it's a man down (yeah)
Yellow tape, yellow tape, yeah (yeah)
Yellow tape, yellow tape, yeah, 9-1-1, it's a man down (yeah)

Four-fifth or the trey pound (ooh)
It don't matter when it go down (yeah)
Get down or lay down
It don't matter, nigga, we gon' spray rounds (yeah)
4L gang the only gang that I protect now (yeah)
Niggas ain't with what I'm with, nigga don't get no respect now (nah)
Pussy nigga gettin' a check now (yeah)
Send them young niggas at your head now (gang)
Heard niggas that I gotta run the block, hell yeah, a nigga run it (yeah)
Hell yeah, nigga, shoot up your block, hell yeah, nigga, I done it (yeah)
I was in the fuckin' field before, just in case they didn't know (yeah)
I was in the hood totin' the pole, shoot a nigga make a pussy opp fold
Undercover 'cause I know these niggas pussy, niggas actin' just like these hoes now (damn)
Shootin' at these opps, they don't want no smoke, dawg (naw, dawg)
Fuckin' all these hoes, that's what I'm on, dawg (I'm on it, dawg)
And never call me you know it's low, dawg (it's low, dawg)
'Cause it's smoked out, nothin' but that loud (yeah)

Money get involved, niggas gettin' crossed out (yeah)
Thought that was your man down, ooh, that's a big plot
Got you niggas' life in my hand, time'll get you shot
You ain't even gotta sell work, drank get on my nerves (damn)
That's why I just sip all this syrup and I just think 'bout murder
God sayin', "Please don't do it to 'em," devil sayin', "Hurt 'em"
Murder, murder, kill on my mind, I just wanna murder
Always keep the steel on my side, shells than a turtle

Only thing I think about is murder, murder (ayy, ayy, ayy)
To my opp mom, I ain't mean to never hurt ya (ayy)
But your son was out here like he was really servin' (yeah)
He paid for the hit at 12, got killed at 12:30 (wow)
If I pay for the lick, oh yeah, now it's my watch (oh yeah)
And if I front the brick, now it's my block (oh yeah)
I'm the G.O.A.T. with the .223, I got that lamb chop
It's a hard top on that 'Venti, but that Lamb' drop (Lamb' drop)
Yeah, but that Lamb' drop
We be whippin' in the kitchen, smell like ham hocks (ew)
When I talk, I bet my fans stop (I bet they stop)
I'm so rich, don't need no handouts

Money get involved, niggas gettin' crossed out (yeah)
Thought that was your man down, ooh, that's a big plot
Got you niggas' life in my hand, time'll get you shot
You ain't even gotta sell work, drank get on my nerves (damn)
That's why I just sip all this syrup and I just think 'bout murder
God sayin', "Please don't do it to 'em," devil sayin', "Hurt 'em"
Murder, murder, kill on my mind, I just wanna murder
Always keep the steel on my side, shells than a turtle
