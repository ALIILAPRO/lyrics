		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been oversleeping so much that I've been bored of dreaming
And just wake up, not next to you
In this paper town where I live, boxes pass along and I wish
That I was sitting in one with you
With you

I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you

You've been overthinking so much, the traffic in your head
Oh, they rush at the thought of someone new
Lauren, why can't you accept it?
I love you and I'm not pretending when I say those words to you, yeah

I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you, Lo

If I learn to love myself, will it keep you from loving someone else?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
If learning to love would cost my life, I'd spend it all on you and I

I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you
