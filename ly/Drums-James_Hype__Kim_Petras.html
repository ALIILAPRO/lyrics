		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The less you give to me
The less you give to me
The less you give to me, the more I want it

The less you give to me, the more I want it
You push me back until I'm two steps forward
But I can see the signs, recognize where we're going, so
The less you give to me, the more I want it

You know, I used to dream about this
Never thought it'd end up this way
The less you give to me the more I want
Drums

Drums
Drums
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da (hey)
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
The less you give to me the more I want it
(Never thought it would end up this way)

The less you give to me the more I want it
You push me back until I'm two steps forward
But I can see the signs, recognize where we're going, so
The less you give to me, the more (more I) 
The less you give to me, the more I want it
You push me back until I'm two steps forward
But I can see the signs, recognize where we're going, so
The less you give to me, the more I want it

You know, I used to dream about this
Never thought it'd end up this way
The less you give to me the more I want it
Drums

Drums
The less you give to me, the more I want it
You push me back until I'm two steps forward
But I can see the signs, recognize where we're going, so
The less you give to me, the more I want it
