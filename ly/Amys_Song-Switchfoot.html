		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Amy's gone 
And time rolls on 
How far? how fast? how long? 

The last time we saw Amy 
She was headed for the shore 
Fighting off the volatile gray skies 

She said now begins forever 
And that no one knows there time 
We bid farewell not knowing 
That might be our last good-bye 

Amy was a fighter 
She cut like Casius Clay 
She burned like a fire 
Despite these rains 

Where time was a question 
She only knew one song: 
She's singing, "how far, how fast, how long?" 

Salvation is a fire 
In the midnight of the soul 
It lights up like a can of Gasoline 

Yeah, she's a freedom fighter 
She's a stand up kind of girl 
She's out to start a fire 
In a bar code plastic world 

When everything stops moving 
And i stop to catch my breath 
And ride my train of thought 
All the way around 

My thoughts return to Amy 
And the fire she's begun 
She came when we were freezing 
And left us burning up
