		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My coconuts
You can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now)
(Right now, right now)
My coconuts
Watch 'em bounce up and down
(Bounce up and down)
(Bounce up and down)

Coco, I tan and lotion
Sun sets over the ocean
Look up, hot air balloons
All good things come in twos
Work them out at the gym
Dive in and take a swim
Everybody love the twins
Everybody love the twins

So juicy and so ripe
You wouldn't believe
I give 'em different names
Mary-Kate and Ashley
They ask me what's my size
Just give 'em a squeeze
Strawberry, mango, lime
Don't compare to these

My coconuts
You can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now)
(Right now, right now)
My coconuts
Watch 'em bounce up and down
(Bounce up and down
(Bounce up and down)
Cocolicious, drippin' down your face
So delicious, bet you wanna taste
My coconuts
You can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now)
(Right now, right now)

Ooh, la, la-la, la-la-la
Whipped cream, cherry on top
Ice cream, sweet coco puff
Tight jeans, tropical pop
Ooh, mama-ma, give me a
Pina colada-da-da
Look at these margari-ta-tas
Look at these margari-ta-tas

So juicy and so ripe
You wouldn't believe (believe)
I give 'em different names
Cartier and Tiffany
I know you wanna bite
Get your face in these (in these)
I see 'em in your eyes
So meet the double D's

My coconuts
You can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now)
(Right now, right now)
My coconuts
Watch 'em bounce up and down
(Bounce up and down)
(Bounce up and down)
Cocolicious, drippin' down your face
So delicious, bet you wanna taste
My coconuts
You can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now)
(Right now, right now)
