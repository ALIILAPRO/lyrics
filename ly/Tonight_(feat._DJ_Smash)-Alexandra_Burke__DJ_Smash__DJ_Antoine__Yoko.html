		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause it's all over inside
I'm waiting for love again, saying to myself
What I feel about you, when no one arrives
I stare at my phone again, put it to my ear
Why pretend when it's through?

So baby, tonight i'm letting you know
I'm letting you go baby, tonight
I already know i'm letting you go
'Cause tonight i'm letting you know
I'm letting you go baby, tonight
I already know i'm letting you go

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Don't you know rule number one?
Gotta make me feel wanted
Don't ever flaunt it, flaunt it
Many other guys wanna try
Wanna die to jump on it

So baby, tonight i'm letting you go
I'm letting you know i'm letting you go
Baby, tonight i'm letting you go
I'm letting you know i'm letting you go

See it's all in my eyes
Can't hide so why pretend?
Wanna tell the world how I feel about you
It's building inside
I'm thinking of where and when
Running out of time so I gotta cut through

So baby, tonight i'm letting you know
I'm letting you go baby, tonight
I already know i'm letting you go
'Cause tonight i'm letting you know
I'm letting you go baby, tonight
I already know I'm letting you go

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Don't you know rule number one?
Gotta make me feel wanted
Don't ever flaunt it, flaunt it
Many other guys wanna try
Wanna die to jump on it

So baby, tonight i'm letting you go
I'm letting you know i'm letting you go
Baby, tonight i'm letting you go
I'm letting you know i'm letting you go
So baby tonight i'm letting you know
Baby, tonight ooh, baby, tonight
