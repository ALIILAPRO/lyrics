		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

I'm at the bank, beatin' it down (beatin')
Right 'fore I make all my rounds (Yeah)
I beat that ho with no sound (slatt)
Bitch, know I'm YSL-bound (SEX)
Whole half a mil' for a show, ho
Watch me control the whole crowd (yeah)
Jewelry on, ain't no choice but be loud
Ice on my neck, I can drown (let's go)

I Uber Eat Mr. Chow (Chow)
Something to put in her mouth (mouth)
I make her fly to the West (okay)
Then tell that lil' bird to go South (uh-huh)
How you want Birkins and shit (woo)
When you ain't even got a house? (right)
We get in one argument
You gon' live in that purse when I'm kickin' you out
I don't fuck with no broke bitches, ain't no doubt
That be chasin' them rich niggas for the clout
Put they head in the ceilin', in the clouds (poof)
And then they go runnin' they mouth (uh-huh)
And then they go tellin' they friends (uh-huh)
Talkin' 'bout, "He ain't a man" (yeah)
That shit be makin' me heh, heh
'Cause baby girl, I'm not a fan

Who that? (Who that?)
Say you keep it real, you don't do that (do that)
Everybody lyin' like, "true that" (true that)
Fuck new friends, where the loot at? (loot at)
Yeah (yeah), who that?
That my lil' bitch, don't move that (move that)
Ass might break your whole crew back (crew back)
Now it's time to get a whole new bag (new back), yeah

Milking the game, I want everything from hundreds to change (everything, nigga)
House is insane, glass porch, you could sleep in the rain (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I forgot to tell you that the kids say they want a private plane
I forgot to tell you that the girl say she need a PradadaBang

Name one nigga that live what they talkin' 'bout (talkin' bout)
Death to a nigga that lie on the trap house (trap house)
I gave her ass a little bit more, then she tapped out (tapped out)
Hit the 2 Live Crew like ass up, face down

Uh, uh, uh, hella diamonds, hella watches, hella rings and chains (everything)
Couple colors, I got red, rose gold, white, and plain (Both)
Start the engine, watch it, "vroom, vroom," then I switch all the lanes (vroom, vroom, vroom)
Half a million dollars on the car and I ain't even drove it yet

Ayy, half a million dollars on my tax
I just had to go pay the shit (go, pay, hah)
To speak to me, you better leave me direct
I don't talk to no middleman (get it, facts, nigga)
I just came back from taxin' a girl that I met off the Internet (ha ha)
I just turnt her body plastic, now she lookin' like a silhouette

Milking the game, I want everything from hundreds to change (everything, nigga)
House is insane, glass porch, you could sleep in the rain (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I forgot to tell you that the kids say they want a private plane
I forgot to tell you that the girl say she need a PradadaBang
