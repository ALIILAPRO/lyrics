		  Woman
You know you're a woman
You got to be a woman
I got the feeling of love

When you're, you're talking to me
You see right through me
I got the feeling of love

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free, yeah, yeah

You're kinda looking at me
Like I've got to set you free
I can't be nobody

You're kinda looking at me
Like I've got to set you free
I can't be nobody

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free, yeah, yeah

Woman
You know you're a woman
You got to be a woman
I got the feeling of love

When you're, you're talkin' to me
You see right through me
I got the feeling of love

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free, yeah, yeah
