		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me I lost it
And tell me I'm off
I won't fight with you girl
Know that you're right
And know that I'm wrong
You say that you're going
I know that you're gone
I've been too controlling
Fucked with your motives
You're moving on

And what can I do, I do, I do?
I know it's over

'Cause I lost the game, I can't get lower
'Cause your pain it's taking over
Lost the game, I can't get lower
Lost the game, lost the game, the game, the game

I think that I messed up
I think that I'm off
I won't fuck with you girl
'Cause it ain't right
Nah, baby, it's wrong

And what can I do, I do, I do?
I know it's over

'Cause I lost the game, I can't get lower
'Cause your pain it's taking over
Lost the game, I can't get lower
Lost the game, lost the game, the game, the game

I'm falling back down here now baby
My mind is collapsing, I'm crazy
I'm falling back down here now baby, now baby
I'm falling back down here now baby
My mind is collapsing, I'm crazy
I'm falling back down here now baby, now baby

'Cause I lost the game, I can't get lower
'Cause your pain it's taking over
Lost the game, I can't get lower
Lost the game, lost the game, the game, the game

Lost the game, I can't get lower
'Cause your pain it's taking over
Lost the game, I can't get lower
Lost the game, lost the game, the game, the game
