		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Conversation as currency
Shapes become a language
Square eyes and sunglasses
Finding faces in the trees
Fabricated fairytales
Bring a new world to life
Sit down, sit down
In this space and time

She is beauty
And we are world class (ooh)
Forever
We'll let the feeling last

Escape the inevitable
Fade into light
So cold, their empathy
'Cause I'm with you tonight
Are we one or are we two?
Are we me or are we you?
Haven't been all this before
Do you see what I see?

She is beauty
And we are world class (oh)
Forever
We'll let the feeling last
She is beauty
And we are world class (oh)
Forever
We'll let the feeling last

Surrounded by lights
Surrounded by lights
Surrounded by lights
Surrounded by lights
Surrounded by lights
Surrounded by lights
Surrounded, surrounded
Surrounded, surrounded by

She is beauty
And we are world class (oh)
Forever
We'll let the feeling last
She is beauty
And we are world class (oh)
Forever
We'll let the feeling last

Are we one or are we two?
Are we me or are we you?
Haven't been all this before
Do you see what I see?
