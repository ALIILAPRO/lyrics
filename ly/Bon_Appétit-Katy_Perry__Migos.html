		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay, yeah
Katy Perry, Migos, ay

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (woo)

Looks like you've been starvin' 
You got those hungry eyes (woo)
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right (woo)
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in (woo)
You want what I'm cookin', boy

Let me take you (woo)
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay (woo)
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon appétit, baby (woo)

So you want some more?
Well I'm open twenty-four (woo)
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right (woo)
Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie (woo)
Gonna hit that sweet tooth (ay), boy

Let me take you (woo)
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two (for two)
And it's okay (woo)
If you take your time (ay)
Eat with your hands, fine (yeah)
I'm on the menu 

(Go ahead)
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (all that you want)
All that you can have, boy (ay)
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven (fresh out the oven)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin' (yeah)
Bon a, bon appétit, baby

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (woo)
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven (woo)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin' (hey)
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (Quavo)

Sweet potato pie (sweet)
It'll change your mind (change)
Got you runnin' back for seconds (runnin')
Every single night (hey)

I'm the one they say can change your life (takeoff)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, just like my ice (blast)
Said she want a Migo night, I ask her, "what's the price?" (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like (Offset)

I grab her legs and I divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Lookin' at the eyes of a dime, make you blind (dime)
In her spine and I'm on some diamonds change the climate (chime)

Sweet tooth (sweet), no tooth fairy (no)
Whipped cream (whip), no dairy (yeah)
Got her hot light on, screamin', "I'm ready" (hot)
But no horses (woo), no carriage (yeah)

(Go ahead)
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (all that you want)
All that you can have, boy (oh)
Got me spread like a buffet (ay)
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (eat it up, eat it up, eat it up)
Appetite for seduction (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fresh out the oven (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (bon appétit) (woo)

Under candlelight (yeah)
Bon appétit, baby (woo)
