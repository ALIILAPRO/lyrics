		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ooh
Metro on these
Boominati wave, uh
(We've done it with robotic arm on the space shuttle)
(We've done it with direct launch of modules)
Prepare for lightspeed

Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (space cadet)
Big white mansion is my habitat (habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (cool rack)

Check came from my fans, life is fantastic (fantastic)
I was broke as hell, sleepin' on the mattress (on the mattress)
I felt like it's Hell, wasn't nobody happy
Hot shells droppin' out the semi-automatic (hot shells)
Ran it up, bought a condo, got a new addy (ran it up)
Got the VVs with a Vlone jean jacket (VVs)
They can't see me, even if you had 3D glasses (3D glasses)
Bad bitch in the bikini, she from Calabasas (Calabasas)
Got a pocket full of bleu cheese and some green relish
I'm a psycho for these hundreds, got a cash fetish (cash fetish)
I've been studyin' these hundreds, I'm a mathematic
And this love make me wanna buy my dad a Caddy
'Cause the love got me geeked up, I don't need a Addy
Dracos let these niggas know we war-ready ('Cos)
Expensive clothes on my bitches, we ain't ball-cappin'
Alien, feel like I'm livin' on my own planet

Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (space cadet)
Big white mansion is my habitat (habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (beanbag)
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack (cool rack)

Chanel shoes overseas, they was patent leather
Shop in Tokyo, Japan, they the best ever
Blueberry t-shirt, sleeve on leather
Hard-top turn the vert, ride in any weather
You ain't gotta bend down, this ain't a propeller
Me and Wheezy spent a dime coppin' Gucci sweaters
Steady drippin', nigga drownin', I cannot help him
It's the Boominati, guys, we are not the devil (Boominati)
Got Columbia and ties out in Mexico (Mexico)
Wash the Benz a hundred times, still smell dope (smell dope)
Got some pants from Philipp Plein, it feel like velcro
A bitch fine and love shoppin' at Rodeo (yeah)
I be iffy, don't want cop if it's a day old
Ain't stingy, my bro Gunna get a payroll
I just want the pretty women and the pesos
I can only hear the engine in this Lambo

Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet (space cadet)
Big white mansion is my habitat (habitat)
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag (laser tag)
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex (rich sex)
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant (weed plant)
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? (where the lean at?)
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag (beanbag)

Ooh, ooh
Yeah
No
(New coupe, I'm a space cadet, yeah)
No
(Metro bought me two Pateks, ooh)
No
(Is it drippin'? Got a nigga wet, hmm)
No
(You on the Boominati wave)
