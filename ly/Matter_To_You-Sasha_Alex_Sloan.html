		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate New York City
All the lights are way too bright
Million people on the street
They're all living their own lives

And I'm a stranger
Just a face they'll never know
Somebody unimportant
People come and people go

The world's so big and I'm so small
The ocean's deep as the sky is tall
Sometimes I feel like I'm nobody at all

But you make me feel like I'm someone, you do
'Cause I know I'm someone to you
Make me feel like I matter, you do
'Cause I know I matter to you

I hate busy parties
All the music's way too loud
Feel like nobody can see me
But you hold me in the crowd

And for a moment
I feel better being there
Like I'm somebody important
Just because I know you care

The world's so big and I'm so small
The ocean's deep as the sky is tall
Sometimes I feel like I'm nobody at all

But you make me feel like I'm someone, you do
'Cause I know I'm someone to you
Make me feel like I matter, you do
'Cause I know I matter to you
I know I matter to you
I know I matter to you

Make me feel like I'm someone, you do
'Cause I know I'm someone to you
Make me feel like I matter, you do
'Cause I know I matter to you
I know I matter to you
I know I matter to you
I know I matter to you
I know I matter to you
