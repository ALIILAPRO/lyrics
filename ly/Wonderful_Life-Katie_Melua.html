		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I go out to sea again
The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh or cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

The sun's in your eyes, the heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there
And I need a friend, oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand there on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh or cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

I need a friend, oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not so alone

Look at me here
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh or cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
