		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this moment
You don't need to know what I hide in my mind
Are we broken
Our decisions are they tainted by the light

In the heat, closing in
Brain on fire, moving in
As I find myself
Fall deep into your eyes, your eyes

In your eyes, eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
We've learn to believe in
In your eyes, eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
We've learn to believe in

See my devotion
You don't need to know it, I hide in my mind
My hand is open
Our decisions are they tainted by the light

In the heat, closing in
Brain on fire, moving in
As I find myself
Fall deep into your eyes, your eyes

In your eyes, eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
We've learn to believe in
In your eyes, eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
To have learned to believe in
