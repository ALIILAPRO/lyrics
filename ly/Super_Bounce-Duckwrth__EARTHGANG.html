		  Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast, fast
Baby be super sonic
Get your gas mask
All them niggas tote is tropic
For this fast cash
Venmo me them economics

Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast, fast
Baby be super sonic
Get your gas mask
All them niggas tote is tropic
For this fast cash
Venmo me them economics

Get to riding in the chariot
With my lady, I'm a marry her
Got the diamond in the back, yeah, yeah
Put the diamond on her, woo
Get on up, get on up
Like I put hydraulics on my car
Super bouncing to Snoop and Missy Elliot
And what?
And don't forget I'm from the west side
South central, throw it up
Slow it up while I'm bending corners on that

Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast, fast
Baby be super sonic
Get your gas mask
All them niggas tote is tropic
For this fast cash
Venmo me them economics

Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast, fast
Baby be super sonic
Get your gas mask
All them niggas tote is tropic
For this fast cash
Venmo me them

Sitting here in this parking lot in the tightest spot
I with you, you with me, well, sometimes, mostly you're not
Like to stare off in space in between sentence, you stop
Talking to escape through chapters up top you keep locked
Always smoke the indica 'cause your brain needs a break
Got no idea what you be going through
How you make it?
It's that time of the year, time of the month, time of day
Even warriors need euphoria, they'll go crazy
She say she don't wanna be thirty years old, asking, "what's the tea?"
Clicking on pictures, tryna envision places she really wanna see
Baby, don't try to solve it all one one day
How bout this, I know your feet hurt, so let's dip
Let's skip to your place, I'll massage them 'til you snoring
Fuck that silly bitch you work with
Eat that hoe for lunch and burp it
Ask me if I wanna see heaven
Girl, with you, my life is perfect
God, can wait, no shame to say but your soul's yearning
It'll keep burning 'til you cross paths 
With your purpose, so inhale
And keep on searching

Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast, fast
Baby be super sonic
Get your gas mask
All them niggas tote is tropic
For this fast cash
Venmo me them economics

Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast, fast
Baby be super sonic
Get your gas mask
All them niggas tote is tropic
For this fast cash
Venmo me them economics

I can slow it down if you want me to
I don't know how slow I can get
This bounce feel way too good
Tell Jody to pass that

I'm in my car parked
Posted on the block
Me and my dogs hotbox, box
Window foggy, la, la, la
The police go knock, knock, knock
Can you turn that down?
'Cause ya'll be blowing loud
Blah, blah, blah, they be
(They be wild)
Anyway, got the middle fingers up as well
Point the fingers to the 12
Funny that weed is legal but them D-boys sitting in them cells
Set the homies free
Free as bird, free as a bee
Free as the leaf that from the tree that blew to me
It's that

Super bounce
