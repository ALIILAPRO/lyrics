		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This won't be the first time that I confess
And I think it's time to face it that I hate my ex
If you want to get complacent, think I'll hate you next
And I want to see you naked, but I hate safe sex, yeah
Show some emotion, make it multiply
You don't like to focus, cause I'm in and out your life
Show some emotion and I'll make it multiply
You don't like to focus, cause I'm in and out your life

Smokin' big protein and it's potent
Now I'm on to the next, ay
Had a feelin, now I'm on to the next, ay
And I put in my songs cause I'm stressed
Either way it's still fun, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'ma laugh at your wrongs, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Put your ass in my arms, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You want it fast, want it long. Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm the one
What would you say
When I see you it's like staring at him in the face
My life changed when I seen you with your new bae
Not the fact you moved on, it's the principle
Why you talk to bums, treat the louie like a visitor
You say this nigga average and that's just what you like
You hate when I ignore you, I have to board my flight

This won't be the first time that I confess
And I think it's time to face it that I hate my ex
If you want to get complacent, think I'll hate you next
And I want to see you naked, but I hate safe sex, yeah
Show some emotion, make it multiply
You don't like to focus, cause I'm in and out your life
Show some emotion and I'll make it multiply
You don't like to focus, cause I'm in and out your life
This won't be the first time that I confess
And I think it's time to face it that I hate my ex
If you want to get complacent, think I'll hate you next
And I want to see you naked, but I hate safe sex, yeah
Show some emotion, make it multiply
You don't like to focus, cause I'm in and out your life
Show some emotion and I'll make it multiply
You don't like to focus, cause I'm in and out your life
