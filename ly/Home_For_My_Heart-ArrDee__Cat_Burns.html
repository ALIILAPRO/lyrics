		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told me you don't see me that much
Every call I make I don't say enough
But I been tryna put the time in for us
I been grindin' so hard, no home for my heart

Who knew life could move so fast?
Tied up my shoes, then I shoot for the stars
Give me a twos in my car, and a juice for the bars
On my way, if I never stop, how do I start?
Me, I been workin' hard all day, week, year
All the time in the world could make time unclear
But the deep end's where I learned to swim
The weekend's whenever I drink
I'm sleepin' the second that I blink
And the beep's all they gettin' when they ring
Over thinkin' it when it ain't a thing (ah)
I don't really get to spend time with me much
Surrounded by hands, sometimes the last thing I need is touch

You told me you don't see me that much
Every call I make I don't say enough
But I been tryna put the time in for us
I been grindin' so hard, no home for my heart
You told me you don't see me that much
Every call I make I don't say enough
But I been tryna put the time in for us
I been grindin' so hard, no home for my heart
So please don't give up on us
Please don't give up on us
Please don't give up on us
Please don't give up, no
Please don't give up

Where's a home for a heart when you're a mile high?
All the time, and you sign up to this fast life
Been a while since I been stuck in hard times
But times are still hard, just a different kind of hard, right?
When I switch off, doesn't mean I gave up
I been missin' me time that I gotta make up
You're forgettin' where I came from
I just gotta take time, and I'm sick of seein' all the fake love
Just leave me
The way I need and it needs be
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve
But the heart ain't for me, mines been bleedin'
It's give and take, but I don't give enough

You told me you don't see me that much
Every call I make I don't say enough
But I been tryna put the time in for us
I been grindin' so hard, no home for my heart
You told me you don't see me that much
Every call I make I don't say enough
But I been tryna put the time in for us
I been grindin' so hard, no home for my heart
So please don't give up on us
Please don't give up on us
Please don't give up on us
Please don't give up, no
Please don't give up

Please don't give up on us
Please don't give up on us
Please don't give up on us
Please don't give up
Please don't give up
You told me you don't see me that much
Every call I make I don't say enough
But I been tryna put the time in for us
I been grindin' so hard, no home for my heart
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
