		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Across the wide open nightly sky, avoiding the luminous dawn
Slowly takes my breath away from all that really matters

The ruins of this age right before my eyes
At the roots of inhumanity, even hope dies now

We are nothing compared to the rise of this inner void

Dying Signal
Interconnection lost
Lack of deep thoughts
I'm withering away

We are nothing compared to the dusk of our consciences

Dying Signal
Interconnection lost
Lack of deep thoughts
I'm withering away

Can this loss show me the way to keep my hope again?
Your words become useless like the emptiness you have inside
I'm tired of trying to understand your being, it's just like nothing
A dull surface does not reflect what it hides behind itself

We are nothing compared to this motionless cold human soul

Dying Signal
interconnection lost
Lack of deep thoughts
I'm withering away
