		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you have water in your car
I might get thirsty along the way
Are you sure is isn't very far
Are we getting there today
And is it hard
And complicated

You displace me

Drive me there
Let me sleep
We are coming to an end here see
Drive me there
I'm meant to be decieved
We are coming to an end here see

Reaching for a sentence in my mouth
Well hidden under my tounge
I know what things are all in doubt

I made it so easy for you when you came
For your safety
