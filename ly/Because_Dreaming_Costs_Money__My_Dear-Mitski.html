		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can still smell the fire
Even though it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes

So darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell
Oh babe
Don't say sorry

Darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for, you
Just play your violin
And we will manage somehow
