		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelings come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (my night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night

My necklace had a natural glow
She dancing in the strobe
Let's fuckin' spoil my night (spoil my night)
Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic
I took her robe off (yeah)
I couldn't get her off me
Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (my night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelings come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me
Yeah I spotted lil' mama through the wall at Jabroni's (ooh)
Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me
I ain't even seen her face, but she got beautiful boobies (wow)

And she see those diamonds in my teeth
I see her smilin' back at me
I think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji)
It's about time Post make Plan B
Now she whippin' out her phone and I know
Damn, how many videos you 'gon post?
Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know
My girl at home now my line about to blow (yeah)
I know what I'm doin' ain't right
But ain't no need to spoil my night
No need, no need

Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (my night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelings come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night
