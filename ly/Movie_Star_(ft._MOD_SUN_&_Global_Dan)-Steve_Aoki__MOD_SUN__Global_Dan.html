		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

1, 2, 3, 4
Back in high school
He was left out
They would talk down
Laughing at him in the hall
As he walked home
Kept his hopes high
With his chest out
All the drama left behind
Had a dream that he'd be livin' with the millionaires
And conversating about the way and how they made it there
He never knew how long it'd take for things to fall in place
We're shooting for the stars, gettin' lost in outer space

Wake up in the Bentley with the stars on the rooftop
Poppin' bottles, flexin' in the club with a few rocks
We're livin' iced out
Just look at my new watch
Ooh, bling blaow dang, Lamborghini jaws droppin'

Now we got it poppin' everybody pullin' up, ayy
Only with the reals, so ain't nobody foolin' us, ayy
Million dollar smile, diamonds shining on my tooth, ayy
I just copped a ride, but I told them keep the roof, yeah

Shinin' like an Audemars 
Said I wouldn't make it far
Now my mama livin' large
They say that her son a star
Every day a foreign car
Stuntin' on the boulevard
Paparazzi going hard
Feelin' like a movie star

They don't know about the grind
They just see the highlights
I wish I could show 'em what it took to live my life
Blood, sweat, and tears always waiting 'til the time is right
So many years of early mornings and late nights
I was crying on the floor, now I'm laughing to the bank
Say what you want to say, I don't care what you think
'Cause I got everything that I want, yeah
I came from the bottom now I'm living on the top
Can't stop, bottle pop, my shit pop
I'm a boss, pay the cost, I can't lie, I got a lot
I'm a self made millionaire, all the people stop and stare, living life without a care
Molly got it up popping, everybody pulling up
Only with the refs, so ain't nobody fooling us 
I remember sleeping on my mama couch
Now I'm all grown up, 'bout to buy my mom a house, ooh

Shinin' like an Audemars (this life is all that we know)
Said I wouldn't make it far
Now my mama livin' large (straight to the moon)
They say that her son a star (here we go)
Every day a foreign car (this life is all that we know)
Stuntin' on the boulevard
Paparazzi going hard (straight to the)
Feelin' like a movie star (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Cameras flashin', sold high fashion (high fashion)
I wake up every day in a big ass mansion (big ass mansion)
Superstar status, livin' so lavish (superstar)
Everything you dreamed about, I bet I've already had it
They were hatin' on me, that is why I got an ego (whoa, yeah)
Now they know my name, every single place that we go (hey, come on)
Living this good should probably be illegal (hey, whoa, whoa)
My life is a movie, directed by Tarantino (yeah, yeah)

Shinin' like an Audemars (this life is all that we know)
Said I wouldn't make it far (ayy)
Now my mama livin' large (yeah, yeah, yeah)(straight to the moon)
They say that her son a star (here we go)
Every day a foreign car (this life is all that we know) (that's true)
Stuntin' on the boulevard (yeah, yeah)
Paparazzi going hard (hey, hey)
Feelin' like a movie star (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Feelin' like a, feelin' like a (this life is all that we know)
Like a, like a movie star
Feelin' like a, feelin' like a (straight to the moon)
Feelin' like a movie star (here we go)
Feelin' like a, feelin' like a(this life is all that we know)
Like a, like a movie star
Feelin' like a, feelin' like a (straight to the moon)
Feelin' like a movie star (here we go)
