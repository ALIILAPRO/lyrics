		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your everlasting summer 
You can see it fading fast 
So you grab a piece of something 
That you think is gonna last 
Well you wouldn't even know a diamond 
If you held it in your hand 
The things you think are precious 
I can't understand 

Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine 

Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine 

You been tellin' me you're a genius 
Since you were seventeen 
In all the time I've known you 
I still don't know what you mean 
The weekend at the college 
Didn't turn out like you planned 
The things that pass for knowledge 
I can't understand 

Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine 

Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine 

I spend a lot of money 
And I spent a lot of time 
The trip we made to Hollywood 
Is etched upon my mind 
After all the things we've done and seen 
You find another man 
The things you think are useless 
I can't understand 

Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine 

Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine
