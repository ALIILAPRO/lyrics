		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cool kids, they do not use floss
Marry me in the countryside
Honestly, I don't give a fuck
I'm addicted to rock and roll, yeah

Beers up, drinks up, make a toast for me
I'm a scum, real scum, but I'm good at this (I'm good)
We're not punk, we're not pop, we're just music freaks
Spent two months in UK but I don't drink gin
Check my origins, mate

Well, cool kids, they do not use drugs (they do not)
Only weed 'cause it's not that strong
I'm a bitch and I have much fun (I have much fun)
And I like doing things I love, yeah
'Cause I love that
I fucking love that

Cool kids, cool kids
Cool kids, we are cool kids
Cool kids, cool kids
Cool kids only fuck cool kids

The cool kids, they do not vomit
Or at least not in front of Vic
I know you think she's a hot chick (you fucking pig)
But I'm sorry, she prefers hot chicks (sorry)

Cool kids, cool kids
Cool kids, we are cool kids
Cool kids, cool kids
Cool kids only fuck cool kids

Well, cool kids, they're not as cool as us
I talk shit 'cause it makes me laugh
You keep asking me about it
But my lyrics are all made up (you're gonna like them)

Cool kids, cool kids
Cool kids, we are cool kids
Cool kids, cool kids
Cool kids only fuck cool kids

Well, cool kids, they do not like rock
They only listen to trap and pop (Justin Bieber)
And everybody knows that rock and roll is shit
But I don't give a fuck about being a cool kid

Cool kids (cool kids), cool kids (cool kids)
Cool kids, we are cool kids
Cool kids (cool kids), cool kids (cool kids)
Cool kids only fuck cool kids

Cool kids
Cool kids
Eat my shit
