		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should your cup runneth over
The loss is not of wine
Your throne was once so golden
But the tarnish taints us all in time
As you revel in your decadent excess
To thy will I bend no knee
Do it stand with the damned or the
Blessed or find some land between

Where the boundaries are boundless and
The bounties are countless
Those with power have found heaven
But it's hell for the helpless
When the Elden Ring fell and
It showered around us
I was held in the grip of death
And slipped out of her talons
Cause I've countered the balance
That made mortality valid
I've become an army of one
I could fell a batallion
But I'm not overcompensating
For anything phallic
What I'm lackin' in stature I've
Been endowed with in talent
How was David so gallant in
The face of a challenge
Like the giant Goliath a mole
Hill made outta mountain
Check the size of my ego
You see how tired my mount is
From the day of my birth I
Have been worthy of crownin'
I'm a tarnished masochist and my
Heart is so calloused
Like my palms after the battles
That hardened my malice
I've gone Mad as a Hatter
Don't ask what happened to Alice
If you ain't got the taste
For torment develop your palate
So while you judge me from
Up in your towering palace
Your cup runneth over causing a
Drought in my chalice
So I'll drink up your tears and
I'll down 'em in gallons
Then devour the gods
I'm not calorie countin'

What if I don't wanna walk
In your grace anymore my faith is a fire
But the flame hasn't faded before
Should your cup runneth over
Spare me your sympathy
My lord, you left us broken
So shed no grace on me

The Tree stands far from
Where the apple falls
When the leaves are gone it's
Only half as tall
Now that the bark is decaying
The trunk is already breaking
I see the Garden of Eden
Has grace far beyond saving
Even the stars were obeying
But doubt has planted a seed
A question that has been rooted in
Runes that we can't read
Cause if the family tree is
Rotting the branches are weak
We drank it straight from the tap
The tainted sap that it bleeds
So no wonder we're tarnished
But not like gods are so polished
They said let death be abolished
Now I can not be admonished
And nothing's stoppin' my cursed fingers
From grippin' my fate
I can't be sent to my grave
It isn't written that way
No, I will not follow orders
If chaos follows order
I represent the lands between
But I'm crossin' the border
I'll rest assured that the gods
Are not esteemed anymore my lord
Now I can see you and I have seen it before

What if I don't wanna walk
In your grace anymore my faith is a fire
But the flame hasn't faded before
Should your cup runneth over
Spare me your sympathy
My lord, you left us broken
So shed no grace on me

Since I watered my garden with doubt
Oh, how twisted the limbs that have grown
After rot got it's roots in the ground
See how grim is the reaping we sow

What if I don't wanna walk
In your grace anymore my faith is a fire
But the flame hasn't faded before
Should your cup runneth over
Spare me your sympathy
My lord, you left us broken
So shed no grace on me
