		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me at our corner after dark
I swear, this city's 
Never seen a light as bright as ours
It's taking every 
Fiber of our beings to fend it off
But how long can this go on? 
(On)

Rode the early thrills of secrecy
When you're with your friends, I'm 
Just a passing stranger on the street
These pent-up feelings 
Brim inside until I'm shoulder-deep
And calling for a lifeboat 
(Oh)

Wish I didn't know this pain (know this pain)
Oh-oh
Lovers caught in retrograde (retrograde) 
Oh-oh
The more we go against the grain
The more it hurts
All in retrograde
Oh-oh, love in retrograde
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Mmm-mmm

Movie night, I'll sneak in through the back
(I'll tiptoe quietly) I know the drill
We spare your mom and dad the heart attack
(Don't want to make a scene) their pride and joy
You're framed in every corner of this flat
And I'd never fit the picture
Mmm-mmm

You were talking about our day in the sun (in the sun)
Like it's imminent
Though I suspect it'll never come (never come)
Keeping up our hopes 
That this isn't a false start (false start)
Is it time to face the facts?

Wish I didn't know this pain (know this pain)
Oh-oh
Lovers caught in retrograde (retrograde) 
Oh-oh
The more we go against the grain
The more it hurts
All in retrograde
Oh-oh, love in retrograde
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Uh-uh-uh

And I promise I won't forget you
When I'm leaving this all behind
Can you promise you won't forget me
When you find yourself on the outside?
