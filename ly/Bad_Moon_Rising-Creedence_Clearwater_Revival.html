		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the bad moon a-rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise, all right

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
