		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know those kinds of girls who look like they're made 
Of honey and glass, like sticky sweet ash
And you can't get the taste off your tongue?
Burnt sugar and a little bit of rum? 
And she dances in the rain with her clothes on 
Drenched to the bone and never knows when she's all gone
She's the life of the party and deep down I know
That nobody flinches when she takes off her clothes

And I wonder what it's like to be one of those girls
To sit in the sun and look at the world and never think
Wow, am I enough?

'Cause life is easy when you know that you're the main character and 
I'm sitting here thinking this is not fair but 
Her smile makes it hard to be mad
It's not her fault that I'm so fucking sad

So I'll sit here and look at these girls in the sun
Dancing in the rain and just having their fun
And maybe one day I can forget the past and 
Be one of those girls of honey and glass

But I think that it's hard for people to see 
That I love all these girls and honestly 
It doesn't matter what you look like or how much you weigh
It's just that these girls know they're okay
There's a beauty in knowing your place in the world
In loving yourself and knowing your worth
You don't have to be perfect or never get sad
That's not what it means to be honey and glass

And everyone has their highs and their lows
The nights they spend crying believe me I know
I don't want to be these girls for beauty or fame but 
For the confidence they have in their own damn name 

So I'll sit here and look at these girls in the sun
Dancing in the rain and just having their fun
And I know it doesn't make sense to forget the past 
But I promise one day you'll be honey and glass
