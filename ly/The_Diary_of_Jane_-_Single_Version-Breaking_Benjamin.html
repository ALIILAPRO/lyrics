		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had to I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask you
Would ya like that? Would ya like that?
And I don't mind If you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask
Do ya like that? Do ya like that? No

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
So, tell me
How it should be

Try to find out
What makes you tick as I lie down
Sore and sick
Do ya like that? Do ya like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind, just let me say
That I like that, I like that

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
So tell me
How it should be

Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there's no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
