		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in love with you watching Casablanca. 
Back road the drive in shaw in the flickerin' light. 
Pop corns and cokes beneath the stars. 
Became Champagne and caviar. 
Makin' love on a long hot summer night. 
I thought you fell in love with me watching Casablanca 
Holdin' hands in the Pado Fan's, in Ritz Candlei Cafe 
Hidin' the shadows from the stars. 
Or rockin' moonlight in your eyes 
Makin' magic at the movies at my own cheverolet 

Ooh, a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca. 
A kiss is not a kiss without your side. 
Please come back to me in Casablanca. 
I love you more and more each day as time goes by. 

I guess there are many broken hearts in Casablanca. 
You know l've never really been there so l don't know. 
I guess our love story will never be seen. 
On the big white silver screen. 
But the hurt is just as bad. 
When l had to watch you go.
