		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The name game. Shirley! Shirley, Shirley.
Bo-ber-ley, bo-na-na fanna.
Fo-fer-ley. fee fi mo-mer-ley, Shirley!
 
Lincoln! Lincoln, Lincoln. bo-bin-coln,
Bo-na-na fanna, fo-fin-coln.
Fee fi mo-min-coln, Lincoln!
 
Come on ev'rybody, I say now  let's play a game.
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name.
The first letter of the name,
I treat it like it wasn't there,
But a "B" or an "F"  or an "M" will appear;
And then I say "Bo" add a "B" then I say the name.
Then "Bo-na-na fanna" and "fo"
And then I say the name again with an ""f" very plain,
Then  "fee fi" and a "mo"
And then I say the name again with an "M" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.
 
Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold, 
Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold, 
Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!
 
But if the first two letters are ever the same,
Crop them both, then say the name.
Like Bob, Bob, drop the "B's", Bo-ob.
Or Fred, Fred, drop the "F's", Fo-red, 
Or Mary, Mary, drop the "M's", Mo-ary.
That's the only rule that is contrary.
 
And then I say "Bo" add a "B" then I say the name.
Then "Bo-na-na fanna" and "fo"
And then I say the name again with an ""f" very plain,
Then  "fee fi" and a "mo"
And then I say the name again with an "M" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.
 
Say Tony, Tony, bo-bo-ney, 
Bo-na-na fanna, fo-fo-ney, 
Fee fi mo-mo-ney, Tony!
 
Let's do Billy!
Billy, Billy, bo-gil-ly, bo-na-na 
Fanna, fo-fil-ly, 
Fee fi mo-mil-ly, Billy!
 
Let's do Marsha!
Marsha, Marsha, bo-bar-sha, 
Bo-na-na fanna, fo-far-sha, 
Fee fi mo-ar-sha, Marsha!
 
Little trick with Nick!
Nick, Nick, bo-bick, bo-na-na
Fanna fo fick, fee fi mo-mick. Nick!
The name game.
