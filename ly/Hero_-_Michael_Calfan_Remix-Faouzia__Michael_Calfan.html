		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Few things I really have to know
Before I go and let you in
Don't wanna be irrational
And make the same mistakes again

Would you be there
5 AM on a weekend?
Through the thick and the thin
Never second-guessing with you 
Don't wanna wake up
Wishing I never gave love
Wishing I never gave trust
Knowing it wasn't true

If I was your hero, would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale, this is real life
But if I were to save you, would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'?
If I was your hero, would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale, this is real life
But if I were to save you, would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'?

Maybe I'm better off alone
At least that's what my mind is saying
I think I've been through way too much
So you gotta assure
That this love is sure

Would you be there
5 AM on a weekend?
Through the thick and the thin
Never second-guessing with you
Don't wanna wake up
Wishing I never gave love
Wishing I never gave trust
Knowing it wasn't true

If I was your hero, would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale, this is real life
But if I were to save you, would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'?
If I was your hero, would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale, this is real life
But if I were to save you, would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'?

You got my heart on its knees
And it's begging you please don't go
Oh-oh-oh
And I'll be fine if you leave
But I'm hoping this time you won't
Oh-oh-oh

If I was your hero, would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale, this is real life
But if I were to save you, would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'?
If I was your hero, would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale, this is real life
But if I were to save you, would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'?
