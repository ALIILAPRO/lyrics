		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Christmas Eve
And I can hear a pin drop
Oh, it's Christmas Eve
And I can hear a snowflake fall
It's Christmas Eve
And I can hear a pin drop
Oh oh, it's Christmas Eve
And I don't wanna be alone

On my own, on my own
On my own, on my own
I can hear a pin drop

Santa Claus
Will you be mine?
Santa Claus
Will you be mine?

'Cause I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
And I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I don't wanna be alone
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I don't wanna be alone
(I don't wanna be alone)

It's Christmas Eve
And all along the tree tops
Whoa, it's Christmas Eve
And I can hear the rain, rain, rain
It's Christmas Eve
And I can hear a pin drop, oh
It's Christmas Eve
And I don't wanna be alone

On my own, on my own
On my own, on my own
I can hear a pin drop

Santa Claus
Will you be mine?
Santa Claus
Will you be mine?

'Cause I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I don't wanna be alone
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I can hear a pin drop
(Falling down on Christmas Eve)
I don't wanna be alone
(I don't wanna be alone)
