		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where the light shivers offshore
Through the tides of oceans
We are shining in the rising sun

As we are floating in the blue
I am softly watching you
Oh boy, your eyes betray what burns inside you

Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

After all I drifted ashore
Through the streams of oceans
Whispers wasted in the sand

As we were dancing in the blue
I was synchronized with you
But now the sound of love is out of tune

Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?

Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?
