		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home again
Home again
One day I know
I'll feel home again
Born again
Born again
One day I know
I'll feel strong again

I left my head
Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on

Lost again
Lost again
One day I know
Our paths will cross again
Smile again
Smile again
One day I hope
To make you smile again
I won't hide

Many times I've been told
Speak your mind, just be bold
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes
And the tears will clear
Then I feel no fear
Then I'd feel no way
My paths will remain straight

Home again
Home again
One day I know
I'll feel home again
Home again
Home again
One day I know
I'll feel strong again

I left my head
Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on
