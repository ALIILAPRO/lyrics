		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life's like the road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands

From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down and back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)
Uh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah

Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (mm, yeah)
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye, ooh, yeah

There ain't no load that I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (all night long, yeah, yeah)
If you're going my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long
(Uh, gimme, gimme, gimme, uh, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway (life is a highway)
I wanna ride it all night long (ooh, ooh, yeah)
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
(Come on, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
(Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby)
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)
