		  Hm, hm, hm
Black sheep for life, black sheep forever
Izgaaju till we kpeme, antiworld gangsters (never be my friends) Ge records, you get me?
Odumodublvck (kpakurukpa, now I dey ball)
Odumodublvck (my baby give me big koroba, be like say I dey dull)
Ayy, tic-tac-toe (mm, idan, shey I say, "I don come?‚Äù)
Ucee (ahh)

When I show them light (Idan), them go turn their back (be like I don show)
Them go show me dark
I can never lie, put it on my god (be like say I don come, come jonz, ayy)
Say my future bright but they gossip that, ayy
It is very bad (ayy), look am well, dan iska (mm, she can never lie)
She can never lie, I dey treat am well, my lover (prra, ayy, treat am well)
She can never lie, I dey treat am well (I dey treat am well), my lover
(She can never lie, ayy)
She can never lie (ayy, treat am well)
I dey treat am well (my)

Anything I want I'm gonna get
Put me on the spot
You no be threat, I no dey fear (prra)
I'm the fearless nigga that you heard about, then
Now and forever na me go dent them
Gave them everything, they said I'm blessed (dent them)
"Odumodu na you we count on (count on, dent them)
Take us to the promised land, we bank on" (bank on, say na me go deaf them)
Shout hallelujah, brother
Doings dey my resume (I go butcher them)
Did it like an israelite
Aaron (Aaron)
All my brothers them be follow come
Sharper than a porcupine
Defend any predator (prra)

Kpakurukpa
My baby give me big koroba (they can never be my friends)
She dey lap for my yard
I dey find kaluba (now I dey ball)
Make I feel among (be like say I dey dull), lacazette, I dey fire like
Kpakurukpa (ayy, idan)
My baby give me big koroba (be like say I don come)
She dey lap for my yard
I dey find kaluba (ayy, them go run)
I say make I feel among (be like say I dey dull), lacazette, I dey fire like that

This one na, 'dog eat dog'
I stand in, final warrior, ah-la-la-la
Me sunk in a pornstar
From the day them born me aromashina, aromashina, aromashina
Odumodu the prince of undefeated lamba
Santino move like Roger Milla, they can't keep up
Dog eat, dog eat, dog eat, dog eat warrior
Amaka do that dance, amaka do that dance, warrior
Amaka got it all, bust it down on me a soldier
Woof-woof, woof-woof, woof-woof, woof-woof (now dog eat dog)

Disturbing maitama
You can never lie when I put it in dada
Anything I want, I go do Mandela
She can never smoke, high me like gbana (gbana-ooh), ooh-oh
Dangbana, born fela
With the man dem Odumodu, big kala (kala)
She dey just dey whine like she wan do pana
When she see the thing, big boy mon kanra, ooh-oh
Popotipoti (ayy), tikatikati (ayy)
As I enter her body, okigbe daddy, daddy, ayy

Kpakurukpa (oh yeah)
My baby give me big koroba (they can never be my friends, ayy, oh yeah)
She dey lap for my yard
I dey find kaluba (now I dey ball, I dey find kaluba)
Make I feel among (be like say I dey dull), lacazette, I dey fire like
Kpakurukpa (ayy, idan, oya, kpakurukpa)
My baby give me big koroba (be like say I don come)
She dey lap for my yard
I dey find kaluba (ayy, them go run, I dey find kaluba)
I say make I feel among (be like say I dey dull), lacazette (grrt), I dey fire like that

When I show them light, them go turn their back (back, back, be like say I don)
Them go show me dark (I don come ayy)
I can never lie, put it on my god (toe, tic-tak-toe)
Say my future bright but they gossip that (prra), ayy
It is very bad, look am well, dan iska (she can never lie)
She can never lie, I dey treat am well, my lover (she can never lie, ah, she can never lie, ayy)
She can never lie, I dey treat am well, my lover (she can never lie, ayy)

My baby give me big koroba
She dey lap for my yard
I dey find kaluba (I dey find kaluba)
Make I feel among ayy (prra, be like say I don jonze)
Lacazette, I dey fire like that (I dey fire like that ayy, oya kpakurukpa)
Make I feel among ayy (be like say I don ah)
Racks on racks, then I shoot my gun (paw, tum, paw)
One day I go hol' am stand (prra)
Odumodublvck (ah), shun backstabbers
Yahweh dey my back, hm
