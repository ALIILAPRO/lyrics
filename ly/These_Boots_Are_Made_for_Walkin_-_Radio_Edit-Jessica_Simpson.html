		<p>
		  Are you ready boots?
Start walkin'
Yee ha
Let's go

You keep saying you go something for me (uh)
Well officer I don't mind to say you do
Now your looking right where I thought you'd be looking
Legs come here when laws in front of you

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of theses days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You believe you've stopped me for a reason (uh)
Now I'm pretending my bending just for fun
You keep playing where I got you playing (yeah)
These double, D's and this is where to fly

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of theses days these boots are gonna walk all over you

I'm the girl with the good boys who don't mean you no harm
This gotten way with pass the county charm
The ain't no crime in heaven it'll find

Sweat my stride
Got my sexy eyes
Where my boots at (ha ha)
Strut ya stuff come on

Hey y'all 
Want to come and see something (uh uh, uh uh)
Can't touch, can get a hand clap for the way I work my back
Tick tock all around the clock drop it
Push ya tush, like that
Can I get a sue
Can I get a yee ha

You keep thinking what you shouldn't be thinking
Another to far is down till you kissing ground
I'm a gonna send you back home till you crying
But Uncle Jessie he sure is gonna be proud

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of theses days these boots are gonna walk all over you

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of theses days these boots are gonna walk all over you

Come on boots
Start walking
Come on ladies

Hey y'all 
Want to come and see something (uh uh, uh uh)
Can't touch, can get a hand clap for the way I work my back
Tick tock all around the clock drop it
Push ya tush, like that
Can I get a sue
Can I get a yee ha

Come on Willie (ohh yeah, owww)
Yee ha
