		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wounded soldier, lotus grows up
Diamonds from pressure, time is precious
Blessings can blossom from a broken child
Cold in the desert but the sun will rise
You don't see the tears, I'm still all smiles
Put in on my back 'cause I'm built for the miles

Can I make it through the rain? (Ooh)
Through the trauma and the pain (ooh)
For the love and not the fame (ooh)
The most priceless glass is stained

It ain't hearts and flowers
It ain't all hearts and flowers
So many nights and hours
Every day of my life, in the grind faithfully
Superpowers, we all got superpowers
Before you see my life and say I live the dream
Remember everything ain't always what it seems

Boy I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I)
I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I)
I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I)
I'm still

Beautiful lies, a masquerade, mask up (mask up)
Count me out, I'll find a way to the top, top
See my life and don't know what it takes, no
Ask me what I'd change, not a goddamn thing

'Cause I made it through the rain? (Ooh)
Through the trauma and the pain (ooh)
For the love and not the fame (ooh)
The most priceless glass is stained

It ain't hearts and flowers
It ain't all hearts and flowers
So many nights and hours
Every day of my life, in the grind faithfully
Superpowers, we all got superpowers
Before you see my life and say I live the dream
Remember everything ain't always what it seems

Boy I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I)
I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I)
I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I)
I'm still

When you're wishin' on a star (when you're wishin' on your dreams)
It seems easy from where they are (don't forget that it never really is what it seems)
They'll be watching from afar (all eyes on you, when dreams come true)
Just remember, yeah, who you are (don't ever let go, don't, don't ever let 'em know)

Now she got even more than she had
Now she got hella haters and they hella mad
(They see) they see it's the same ol' Jenny, wanna block me
Paparazzi trying to make a move like they got me

Ask me how I did it, now we at the top
Perfect timin', don't be fooled by the rocks I got
We be shinin', bitch took it to another level
We be thrivin', I can set the tempo
For real though, but y'all know

I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I)
I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I) (through the mud)
I'm still (I-I-I-I-I-I) (or through the rain)
I'm still

It ain't hearts and flowers (you don't see all the tears I've cried)
It ain't all hearts and flowers
So many nights and hours
Every day of my life, in the grind faithfully
Superpowers, we all got superpowers (we got 'em, you got 'em)
Before you see my life and say I live the dream (ah)
Remember everything ain't always what it seems 
(Everything ain't always what it seems, but)

But I'm still
I may have cried, may have doubted
But they'll never know, they'll never know
