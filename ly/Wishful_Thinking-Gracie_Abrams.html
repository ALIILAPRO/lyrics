		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet you down at the bottom
Finish a bottle
You know I know all your problems now
Flaked on me back in August
And if I'm honest
You've gotten harder to figure out

I know that you got everything you wanted
I heard a rumor everybody's talking
'Bout you now

I really thought that I could fix this
Nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking
You'd grow up? (You'd grow up?)
I really hoped that we'd be past this
Problems past tense
Is it just wishful thinking
You'd grow up? (You'd grow up?)

Dropped it all in a second
After your message
Do you remember me calling out?
Meet you back in the wreckage
Right where you left it
Do you regret how I see you now?

You said that you got better when you saw me
I heard a rumor it's medicine and molly
You're blacking out

I really thought that I could fix this
Nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking
You'd grow up? (You'd grow up?)
I really hoped that we'd be past this
Problems past tense
Is it just wishful thinking
You'd grow up? (You'd grow up?)

(You'd grow up, you'd grow up)
(You'd grow up, you'd grow up)
(You'd grow up, you'd grow up)
(You'd grow up, you'd grow up)
(You'd grow)
