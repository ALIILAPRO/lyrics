		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Ooh

Tried calling yesterday but got your voicemail again
Rushed over to your uni hall, saw her leaving your place
You said you fucked up on a night out
You drank way too much, you're feeling bad now
You're tryna figure out how to worm your way out

Well, look at what you've done
You said you'd never do
You fucked it for yourself
This is the end of me and you

So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should've listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

You said it was a one-time thing
You don't know what you were thinking
That it didn't mean a thing
You promise it won't happen again
So when you get fucked up on a night out
How many times have you played around?
Was a fool, didn't see the signs
I guess my friends were always right

Well, look at what you've done
You said you'd never do
You fucked it for yourself
This is the end of me and you

So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should've listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

I can't trust you anymore
Look what you've done
You've turned this heart cold
And I don't know if I can love again
But I know for sure we can't be friends
This is the end

So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should've listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go (go)
Go, go, go, go (go)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go (I should've listened to my friends)
Go, go, go, go ('cause they always know best)
Go, go, go, go, uh

I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
Pack up your shit and go
