		  (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
(Where the fuck is the-)

Cocaine for my breakfast (what?)
Hold that pistol, ambidextrous, uh (yuh, yuh)
Pussy boy talk reckless (ayy)
He might end up on a stretcher, uh (yuh, bitch)
Fuck with my set (ayy)
You get wet, like a pussy, yuh (yuh, yuh)
Sauce, what I spilled (yuh, yuh)
On my kilt, she need milk, okay like (ayy, ayy)
Xxx on a Killstreak, huh (bitch)
You pussy niggas, Rice Krispie, uh (what?)
Fuck a white bitch on a 6 speed (yuh)
6 stars like GTA, kill me, uh (fuck)
It's more money I'm getting (ayy)
If a nigga tryna take, wig splitting 'em (ayy)
Shouts out to my Zoe, they killed my VRO (yuh, yuh)
So, bitch, off rip now, I'm like (ayy)

Mama raised a soldier (huh, yuh)
Not no bitch, not no bitch, yuh (yuh, what?)
Mama raised a soldier (huh, yuh)
Not no bitch, not no bitch, uh (yuh, ayy)
Mama raised a soldier (yuh, yuh)
Not no bitch, not no bitch, uh (yuh, ayy)
Mama raised a soldier (yuh, what?)
Not no bitch, not no bitch, yuh (huh)
Mama raised a soldier (huh, yuh)
Not no bitch, not no bitch, ayy (yuh, okay, you alright?)
R.I.P. my Zoe, ayy (yuh, uh)
R.I.P. my Zoe, okay (uh, yuh)
R.I.P. my Zoe, ayy (huh, yuh)
R.I.P. my Zoe, okay (hey, al-alright?)
R.I.P. my Zoe, yuh (yuh, yuh)
R.I.P. my Zoe, okay (yuh, yuh)
R.I.P. my soul (ayy, my who?)
Yuh (rest in peace, my soul, man)
Ayy (yuh, man)

TY
Bitch
I got my Andy Capp's in this bitch
I'm 'bout to sip this motherfuckin' water 
That's not even water
I stole that boy's shit (where the fuck is the-)
Ayy

Came from the dirt, you can't hit my purp
Said my diamonds wetter than some sweat, absurd
Gold up on my wrist's lookin' sunny, Big Bird
Hit 'em with the, hit 'em with the numbers like a nerd
Ayy, let's slide sixth wall, I'm tied
Call my pockets knotty 'cause they sloppy, oh, my
I could be Xzibit, might pimp my ride
Wet pleasure rather pay the Rafs, like Christ
Hit my bitch like Bruno, uh
Get a bitch wet, no Juno, uh
Put it in her mouth like Uno, uh
Chest, all Polo like, "Kudos!", ayy
Dog-ass nigga like Cujo, uh
Face card bad who you know, ayy
She all wet like fructose, ayy
Diamonds on like they cheat codes, ayy
