		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The houses around me
Are filled with people who panic
They hear the noise and the static
And then we all become frantic
We hear the omens and legends
We’re praising gold and our pleasures
We’re looking over our shoulders
Pretend we got it together
Draw the blinds
Check under your bed
Hide your gold
And hold your breath
Feel the ghost
In your chest
Check your pulse
You're scared to death
Para paranoia
You know what’s coming for ya
Venom in your blood
And there’s no one here to warn ya
Para paranoia
You’ve been here before
Ya can lock up all your doors
But there’s a phantom in your foyer
Para paranoia
Para paranoia
Para paranoia
Controlled by the tension
That’s taking all our attention
To busy with expectations
We’re losing all our convictions
Draw the blinds
Check under your bed
Hide your gold
And hold your breath
Feel the ghost
In your chest
Check your pulse
You're scared to death
Para paranoia
You know what’s coming for ya
Venom in your blood
And there’s no one here to warn ya
Para paranoia
You’ve been here before
Ya can lock up all your doors
But there’s a phantom in your foyer
Para paranoia
Para paranoia
Para paranoia
Draw the blinds
Check under your bed
Hide your gold
And hold your breath
Feel the ghost
In your chest
Check your pulse
You're scared to death
Para paranoia
You know what’s coming for ya
Venom in your blood
And there’s no one here to warn ya
Para paranoia
You’ve been here before
Ya can lock up all your doors
But there’s a phantom in your foyer
Para paranoia
You know what’s coming for ya
Venom in your blood
And there’s no one here to warn ya
Para paranoia
You’ve been here before
Ya can lock up all your doors
But there’s a phantom in your foyer
Para paranoia
