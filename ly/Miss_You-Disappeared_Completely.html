		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are hiding cause we are dreamers. 
We are sucking your soul. 
We want to destroy your plans. 
We want to find a new place for
Travelling, Seeking, Hunting, Loving. 
Travelling, Seeking, Hunting, Loving. 
Travelling, Seeking, Hunting, Loving. 
I miss you. 
You got me. 
You so fucking got me with your temper. 
My thoughts in colours 
And that's my honour 
You are fools 
And you don't see 
You are fools 
And you don't see 
So go to hell. 
I miss you
