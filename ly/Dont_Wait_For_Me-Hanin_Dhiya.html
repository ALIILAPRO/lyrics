		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where we are
When did we get it wrong
Where do we go from here
Who knows I don't know I don't

So close but still so far
Can you still hear my heart
Fallin' with all my tears
I know you know we know

Yeah we try and we try
But it's gettin' harder
For a while paradise fell apart

Don't wait for me
No don't let your love go to waste
Can't give what you need
One day I might feel the same

I don't know where I'm going
Wish that I could stay
Hate to see your heart broken
Only thing I can say is
Don't wait for me
No don't let your love go to waste

We gave it all we got
Sometimes it's not enough
I'll save the memories
I know you'll do it too
Yeah we try and we try
But it's gettin' harder
For a while, paradise fell apart

Don't wait for me
No don't let your love go to waste
Can't give what you need
One day I might feel the same

I don't know where I'm going
Wish that I could stay
Hate to see your heart broken
Only thing I can say is
Don't wait for me
No don't let your love go to waste

Don't
Oh don't let your love go to waste
Oh
Don't let your love go to waste
Don't wait for me
No don't let your love go to waste

Can't give what you need
One day I might feel the same

I don't know where I'm going
Wish that I could stay
Hate to see your heart broken
Only thing I can say is
Don't wait for me
No don't let your love go to waste
