		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let go
From that sea-saw
This is fucking your brain
It's gonna hold me out again
Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let go
By all the key-hole
You can press yourself against it
You keep waiting for me cage

Hear me say
Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let go
It's not a question for your head
Come and join me in this seat,
Cause there's a ruby in your eye
Or you're after me the same
Cause you're all the sweetest thing inside of you
Our home is bigger than a mountain view
Your file's so thin you believe that you should do
Sometimes it won't come so easy
But sometimes you gotta go get mad, mad

Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let go
Shift the ease on
Listen to me now and stay in the red zone of pain
And I'll look out and say
Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let go
Had a question for...
I may shout out with my head and mend back your heart
But remember me and say
Cause you're all the sweetest thing inside of you
Our home is bigger than a mountain view
Your file's so thin you believe that you should do
Sometimes it won't come so easy
But sometimes you gotta go get mad, mad

All the good things
Are out in the sun

Good things like friends come a long way
They'll be so bad, keep no sea calm storm
Nothing, and then we watch them shim
Feels like the sound going down
But I see no clouds
Well have you seen those clowns
Today's so supernatural

Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let go
From that sea-saw
This is holding your brain
It's gonna pull me out again
And I'll love you the same

Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let go
Another question for the game
I made a shadow with my head
And...
But they would never be the same
Same
