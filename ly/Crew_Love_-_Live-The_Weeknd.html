		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh
Whoa, yeah
Ooh (yeah)

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't a fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland

Why? 'Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, whoa

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothin'
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, "Your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story and made history
Tell 'em I'ma need reservations for twenty
I never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, whoa
'Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city
