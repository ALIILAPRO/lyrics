		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was wondering, maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm rea-

Did you already know him? It's coincidental that he learns your body and mind the way I do
The secrets you told me, were they confidential or do you let anyone inside your mental?
I bet you ain't told him the things that we been through
I know you're not flashin' your wrist like you been doin'
The fact that I actually started to trust you then you broke my heart, someone bring me a tissue
Or maybe my notebook, I'll sharpen my pencil to write you a letter and show you I'm into you
Stay down forever, even if it's pleasure, go 'head
Sign your name on the package I sent to you
Open it up and when you get to cheesin'
I hope that you believe in the end that I got you
How can I move forward when every relationship I get in
Don't hit the same if it ain't you?

So please don't fall in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
So please don't fall in love with me (don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me (don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me (don't fall, don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me

Do you still use that Versace bag that I bought you?
Look back at the pics of vacations I brought you on
He can't even match it, he's not in my bracket
You settle for less with him, with me, I put you on
Doesn't look good on you, way too appealin' to go through experiences that he's been givin' you
'Cause you see on this side, I'll drape you with fire
Got bundles of roses lined up to the ceiling
It's so good without you, I know that I'm healin'
But that doesn't change that the way I've been feelin'
Is clouding my judgment, I act like it's nothin' but really I'm sufferin'
I'm way too forgivin'
I saw your new man and he looks like a joke
It's been a while since the both of us spoke
Can't help but think that my life would be better if we never met
But that's not how it goes

So please don't fall in love with me (you can't fall for me)
Don't fall in love with me (you can't fall for me)
Don't fall in love with me (do not fall)
Don't fall in love with me (fall)
So please don't fall in love with me (don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me (don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me (don't fall, don't fall)
Don't fall in love with me
