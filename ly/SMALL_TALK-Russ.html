		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up

Stop playin' with a boss like that
I don't react well when you talk like that
Put the money on the phone then call right back
I don't really wanna do the small talk like that, yeah
Stop playin' with a boss like that
I don't react well when you talk like that
Put the money on the phone then call right back
I don't really wanna do the small talk like that, yeah

Run it up, run it up, yeah, that's a motive
But mostly I'm focused on being the coldest
While being the hottest, they say I'm not modest
I say I agree, I don't got it, I got it
I'm not sparin' feelings, y'all want me quiet
Bitch, I made millions, I'm 'bout to go riot
See, that's how I really feel
I think you would, too, this reminds me of Reallyville
Different team, same game, but it's "Fuck you"
As long as you're on the other side, I don't trust you
You don't love me, bitch, I don't love you
You don't gotta lie, I won't sit around and judge you
One, two, three, four, five six, that's just not enough M's
I got to pay for my whole family's rent and then some

Stop playin' with a boss like that
I don't react well when you talk like that
Put the money on the phone then call right back
I don't really wanna do the small talk like that, yeah
Stop playin' with a boss like that
I don't react well when you talk like that
Put the money on the phone then call right back (yeah, yeah)
I don't really wanna do the small talk like that (yeah, yeah)

Please shut the fuck up if you don't have the deal ready
I really don't want to waste my time
My lawyer told y'all better have ten mil' ready
But it's cool, I ain't trippin', I'm eatin'
Every day of my life, it's the weekend
Got my own weed that I'm chiefin'
They be hatin' on me for no reason
Now I'm lyin', I guess I gave them a couple along with the blueprint
I gave them the hustle, boo-hoo-hoo
Y'all should get over it
Promise you I'ma be Hova rich
I ain't 'bout to stop for you, take shit from you
Who the fuck are you? I'm me, bitch
I don't give a fuck 'bout what anybody else may be
I bet on me, bitch

Stop playin' with a boss like that
I don't react well when you talk like that
Put the money on the phone then call right back
I don't really wanna do the small talk like that, yeah
Stop playin' with a boss like that
I don't react well when you talk like that
Put the money on the phone then call right back
I don't really wanna do the small talk like that, yeah

You got me fucked up
