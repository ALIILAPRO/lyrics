		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands are all around me
I took a walk and one became three
Hands are all around me you ain't never seen
You ain't never seen

And in your face tightened lace
And below vertigo
You caught my bad dream
You caught my bad dream

A deathly guise took you by night
And, and those hands turned the tide
And you were harmed by unsaintly arms
And we will take you in our arms

This ain't no dream, this ain't no dream
Dream, dream, dream
