		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone's afraid of their own lives
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?

No one really knows the ones they love
If you knew everything they thought
I bet that you would wish that they'd just shut up

Well, you were the dull sound of sharp math
When you were alive
No one's going to play the harp when you die
And if I had a nickel for every damn dime
I'd have half the time, do you mind?

Everyone's afraid of their own lives
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?
Am I right, am I right, am I right?
Am I right, am I right, am I right?

And it's our lives
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
We're alive for the first time
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
We're alive for the last time
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
To live before you die

It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
That our lives are such a short time
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember
When it takes such a long time
It's hard to remember, it's hard to remember

My mom's God is a woman and my mom she is a witch
I like this
My hell comes from inside, comes from inside myself
Why fight this?

Everyone's afraid of their own lives
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?
