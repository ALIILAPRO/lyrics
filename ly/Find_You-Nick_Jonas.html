		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you
I chase the words that keep fallin' out your mouth
You got a logic I'll never figure out
If I could hold you then I'd never put you down
But I never really know just where to find you

Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I
Try, try, try, but I, but I
Try, try, try, but I
But I never really know just where to find you

Si tú supieras, donde quiera que estés
Que yo ya te soñé, que te imaginé, ooh
Te busqué tanto y aunque no te encontré
El olor de tu piel me sigue
Yo me la paso pensando en usted
Y aunque no estés conmigo
Yo te esperaré cueste lo que me cueste
Constantemente te veo en mi mente, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby in my dreams I see you
Yo ya te vi conmigo

Ooh
Where to find you (ooh) (yo ya te vi conmigo)
Where to find you (ooh)
But I never really know just where to find you (eh, eh)
Try, try, try, but I
Try, try, try, but I, but I
Try, try, try, but I
But I never really know just where to find you

Maybe I'm chasing a feeling
Maybe I don't even need it but
Maybe you're looking for me tonight, tonight

I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you (yo ya te vi conmigo)

(Ooh)
Where to find you (ooh) (yo ya te vi conmigo)
Where to find you (ooh)
But I never really know just where to find you (eh, eh)
Try, try, try, but I
Try, try, try, but I, but I
Try, try, try, but I
But I never really know just where to find you
