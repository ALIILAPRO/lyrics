		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the last time occurrences guided me
To the land where the lie lives
It's sovereigns have to humbug us
In such a way that all men's thinking's growing stiff
Joining in the conversation, reforming the situation -
This epoch is too weak-willed for this
Lifeless end or endless life
Narcotics affect the senses

Melancholic dreams or hysterical faces
Fascinated in a state without preceptive faculty
Strength of purpose wearies and the complexion fades
Because manipulation's modern methods stamped from cruelty
You're just blinded by a dream that does not exist
You think that you will find your fortune
Appear this feeling? NO - feelings disappear
Narcotics signify gloom

Influxes are soporific
Physic and psychic narcotic
Lugubrious I guess I'm sick
Physic and psychic narcotic

At first sight the front's iridescent
Loss of sight but future's earsplitting
'cause awfully the trombones will sound in the end

Consciousness is embedded in illusions
Which are incompetent to criticism
Shades of deception cover relected images
Reality is dimming and the untruth is rising
Sentiment is apathetic and argument just hypothetic
So all responsible men have an easy game
Illness of time and time of illness
Narcotics the braincells wane

Influxes are soporific
Physic and psychic narcotic
Lugubrious I guess I'm sick
Physic and psychic narcotic

At first sight coherence's not to see
Loss of sight earth's dirge frustrating me

I am under the impression that I suffocate
Some people feel passion but they don't premeditate
Addicted to their fashion not considering their fate
Mankind needs a lesson, it's imperative and not too late

The wise's providence affect anxiety neurosis
Event's concomitants affect a higher dosis
That is the prce we pay and we all know this
So the afterthought's evanescence entails narcosis

Narcotic
Soporific and despotic
Narcotic
I guess I'm sick
Narcotic

Pessimistic
Premonition
Pscyopathic
Politician

Persuasive
Propaganda
Paranoic
Perpetration

The proclamation of the real present predicament
Would cause people t recognize their passive behaviour
So we reached the point where we have to change our view
Lift the veil of concealed events - and above all -

Reconquer vigilance!!!
