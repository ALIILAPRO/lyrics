		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I roll and I tumble, cried the whole night long
Yes I roll and I tumble, I cried the whole night long
I got up this morning, feeling that something going on wrong
Well now want you to love me baby, or please let me be
Yes love me baby, or please let me be
If you don't like my peaches please don't shake my tree
Well I want you to love me baby, and come on and say you'll be mine
I want you to love me baby, come and say you'll be mine
IWell I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I hurt your feelin' baby, so this gone all wrong

Oh well I really love you baby, come on and say you'll be mine
Oh well I really love you baby, come on and say you'll be mine
Well if you don't like my tattoo's??? don't you drink my wine

Oh well I cried as my momma have cried the night before
Oh well I cried as my momma have cried the night before
Oh well I hurt your feelin' baby, you don't love me no more

Well in the river was whiskey I wasn't drive and drunk
Well in the river was whiskey I wasn't drive and drunk
Well I was whipped to the bottom baby I wouldn't come up

Oh well I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I hurt your feelin' baby, so this gone all wrongf you don't like my potatoes, please don't dig up my vine
