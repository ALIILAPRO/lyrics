		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven help me
The devil wears lace and she can't be tamed
If I were wealthy, spend every last dime
Just to hear her say my name
I get my fix
When she gets home
Now honey I've been thinkin bout this
All day long
The devil tricks
She sent her spawn
To drag me to the depths where
I belong
So light me in flames
Just as hot as you need
Let me see the good girl you wanted to be
All of my praise
Only from me
I can be the one who could set you free
Fall from your grace
Turn up the heat
I feel I'm going down hands gripping the sheets
Settin the pace
Number the beast
Got me by the belt, heart skippin a beat
The devil and me
I'm feelin lucky
I gambled on red and the price was paid
Took something from me
But gave it all back
It was one in the same
Shred my soul
Turn me on
Have pride in my will
But the devils strong
Rock and roll
Sing my song
It must've been right cause she can't be wrong
So light me in flames
Just as hot as you need
Let me see the good girl you wanted to be
All of my praise
Only from me
I can be the one who could set you free
Fall from your grace
Turn up the heat
I feel I'm going down hands gripping the sheets
Settin the pace
Number the beast
Got me by the belt, heart skippin a beat
The devil and me
They're closin up
Heavens gates
I ain't feelin sorry
Was close enough
Guess I'll wait
I'll wait
I'll wait
So light me in flames
Just as hot as you need
Let me see the good girl you wanted to be
All of my praise
Only from me
I can be the one who could set you free
Fall from your grace
Turn up the heat
I feel I'm going down hands gripping the sheets
Settin the pace
Number the beast
Got me by the belt heart skippin a beat
The devil and me
