		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  you got my heart
Don't need nobody else, you're everything I want
Caught in your gravity, been falling from the start
But as long as you hold me, I will never be goin' low
Let's get away
And we can find a place where no one knows our names
Turn into ghosts, we be goin' M.I.A.
And as long as you hold me, I will never be goin' low (never be goin' low)

I don't know when, I don't know how
But we'll escape, we're gettin' out
We could be somewhere in the clouds
Let's leave this place
Go lost and found, found, found
Turn it all around
Go lost and found, found, found
And now

Just you and me for seven days, seven nights
Wake up on a Saturday by your side
We be on a runaway, ohh-oh
We be on a runaway, ohh-oh

We goin' rogue
We can go anywhere, we switchin' timezones
Forget the world, put every day on flight mode
'Cause as long as you hold me, I will never be goin' low
Full speed, we won't ever slow down
You and me alone while
Drivin' down an endless road
Baby, we don't need a reason
I give you the keys, and
We'll go anywhere we want

I don't know when, I don't know how
But we'll escape, we're gettin' out
We could be somewhere in the clouds
Let's leave this place
Go lost and found, found, found
Turn it all around
Go lost and found, found, found
And now

Just you and me for seven days, seven nights
Wake up on a Saturday by your side
We be on a runaway, ohh-oh
We be on a runaway, ohh-oh

Just you and me for seven days, seven nights
Wake up on a Saturday by your side
We be on a runaway, ohh-oh
We be on a runaway, ohh-oh

Can you feel it?
I can feel it in your eyes
If we can dream it
We can have it in real life, ohh

I don't know when, I don't know how
But we'll escape, we're gettin' out
We could be somewhere in the clouds
Let's leave this place, go lost and found
