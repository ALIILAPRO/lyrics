		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever since I left you
You and I
Forever gone
You made me think that I'm crazy
How fool I was
For trusting you
And I know and I know and I know that you pretended
And I know and I know and I know you didn't care
How you played how you played how you played me like puppet
You just knew
Where to push
Motherfucker can't believe that I had brought you into my family
I brought into my life
You even met my mother
I brought into my life
You acted like your my brother
I brought into my life
I brought you into my family
I brought into my life
Fuck
Ever since I left you
You and I
Forever gone
You made me think that I'm crazy
How fool I was
For trusting you
