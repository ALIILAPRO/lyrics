		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the door shuts
Don't worry about me
Its not attention that I want from you
I need you to trust who I'm gonna be
And in everything I'm going to do

'Cause I'm not afraid 
Of what I don't know
For understanding is all that I earn
What is for sure is I'm gonna to go
I'm gonna to live and I'm going to learn

And I know there will be mistakes that I will make
But I know they're not worse than chances I don't take, take
Right before your eyes I am changing, changing 
New life on the inside I am changing, changing

When the door shuts 
Its shuts in front of me
A new person that I have become
I follow my heart to my destiny
But living in fear and sorrow is done

There will be no more feeling that I'm all alone
I will surround myself with things that help me grow, grow
Right before your eyes I am changing, changing 
New life on the inside I am changing, changing 

Right before your eyes I am changing, changing 
New life on the inside I am changing, changing 
Right before your eyes I am changing, changing 
New life on the inside I am changing, changing 

Right before your eyes
Right before your eyes
