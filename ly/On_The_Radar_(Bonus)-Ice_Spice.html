		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, sir, baby, On The Radar Radio Freestyles
Yo, The BX is in the buildin', Ice Spice is in the buildin'
I'ma step out, she gon' step in and kill this shit, aight?
Let's go
(Is that Chris?)
(Stop playin' wit' 'em, RIOT)

You a stranger, I feel like shit changed
I'm different, I don't feel the same
I'm a smoochie, like, you cannot change me
Trendin' topic, like, you cannot blame me
Goin' up, so I feel like they hate me
Oh, she gangster? But she cannot face me
Hear the chatter, but I'm never switchin'
It don't matter, I know my shit different

In the end that I know that I'm good
Understand that I'm misunderstood
And the plan to get bro out the hood
I be fiendin' to dump on a bitch
And I know that she bumpin' my shit
In the comments they eatin' my dick
Remember they didn't believe in a bitch
I be thinkin' 'bout me and you fuckin'
I be readin' your text and I dub it
You be leadin' me on, I'm like, "Fuck it"
Act like you don't, but I know that you love it
And he fiendin', he know my name buzzin'
From The Bronx, so I got it from nothin'
I'm what they want, so I got it, it's comin'
I'm in the front of the race that we runnin'

You a stranger, I feel like shit changed
I'm different, I don't feel the same
I'm a smoochie, like, you cannot change me
Trendin' topic, like, you cannot blame me
Goin' up, so I feel like they hate me
Oh, she gangster? But she cannot face me
Hear the chatter, but I'm never switchin'
It don't matter, I know my shit different

Damn, you was my heart, you a stranger
How you turn love into anger?
Like, you wanna fuck wit' that bitch from Decatur
Like, I don't want you wit' a bitch, I'ma hater
And I put it all past me
Would fuck your bro, but I don't let him gas me
I got angels, they watchin'
Shit that I'm doin', there's nobody stoppin'
They say that I'm next, but it's cool, 'cause I know that
Sayin' you love me, then show that
Old friends, they watchin', they sendin' me throwbacks
Soon as I make it, they know I can't go back
I got feelings, but I never show 'em
I don't talk about it, I just smoke 'em
Goin' through shit, I don't think, I just go numb
Soon as I hop in the booth, I'ma go numb
Grrah
