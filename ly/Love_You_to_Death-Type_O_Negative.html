		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In her place one hundred candles burning
As salty sweat drips from her breast
Her hips move and I can feel what they're saying, swaying
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, get

Black lipstick stains her glass of red wine
I am your servant, may I light your cigarette?
Those lips smooth, yeah I can feel what you're saying, praying
They say the beast inside of me's gonna get ya, get ya, get

I beg to serve, your wish is my law
Now close those eyes and let me love you to death
Shall I prove I mean what I'm saying, begging
I say the beast inside me is gonna get ya, get ya, get

Let me love you too
Let me love you to death

Hey am I good enough
For you?
Hey am I good enough
For you?
Am I?
Am I?
Am I good enough
For you?
