		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Change your heart, look around you
Change your heart, it will astound you
I need your lovin' like the sunshine

Everybody's got to learn sometime
Everybody's got to learn sometime
Everybody's got to learn sometime

Change your heart, look around you
Change your heart, will astound you
I need your lovin' like the sunshine

Everybody's got to learn sometime
Everybody's got to learn sometime
Everybody's got to learn sometime

I need your lovin' like the sunshine

Everybody's got to learn sometime
Everybody's got to learn sometime
