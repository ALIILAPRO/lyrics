		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bum-bum-bum, ba-dum-bum, bum-bum)
(Bum-bum-bum, ba-dum-bum, bum-bum)
(Bum-bum-bum, ba-dum-bum, bum-bum)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, a-bum-bum-bum, ayy)

Look, look, J.I.D back in the city with it
Jiddy done been all across the globe
They say, "JID a scribbler, he silly with it"
"When he spiting, I hope he don't sell his soul"
"He should be good, man, he signed to Cole"
"He from the hood, nigga, down the road"
"He was just jugging right by the stove"
Then they saw the patrol, it was time to roll
Saw the patrol it was time to ride
Motor running on Memorial Drive
Got a country cousin cruising with that blammer
In Savannah at the Florida-Georgia line
Got a couple family members in Atlanta
Not Atlanta, we let Omeretta decide
They just gon' let that Beretta fly 
'Cause you niggas bugging, spray pesticides
It's me and the bros, it's not extra guys
And they moving weight, it's no exercise
We could pick a date to come stretch you out
Only showing muscle when it's flexing time
You could see the hustle, you could recognize
Overcame struggle when the Devil tried
Let me bare it all when I'm telling God
You know I'ma rant, when I talk to Jah

Nigga say that I can't, damn lie
Ain't dapping no hand, sanitize
We gon' slide on your man, landslide
It's a nine in my pants, hand cocked
You gon' try to recant, you can't now
I can step on a ant, ant pile
I'ma shoot at the ground, dance now
Dance, uh, dance, shh, dance

Oh, what a handsome gift (yeah)
To live in a land of sin (uh)
Riding with bags and bricks (yeah)
And my lil' nasty chick (yeah)
That's what I asked of Him
Told me He'd grant my wish
You dance with the Devil
You'll never dance again

Dance now
Dance, dance, shh, dance
Dance now
Dance, dance, shh, dance
Dance now
Dance, dance, shh, dance
Dance now (I'm not a)
Dance, dance, shh, dance (I'm not a, uh)

I'm not a two stepping man, I said I do not dance
It's a gun inside my pants, and the whole worlds in his hands
It depends, penny for your sins
Shooting up the block, can't stop revenge (oh)
Nappy dread locks like a Rasta man
Where the story ends and plot thickens (uh, look)
Mama said the Messiah's in moccasins
Tryna save the kids in them apartments and
Show a way to live with other options
Opulence, decadence, black excellence, and lots of it
I could cop the newest Beamer, Bentley, or Balenciagas
I could pay for this lil' nigga scholarship
Ain't caught up in rap nigga politics
Play with me and you playing yourself
Playing with death, say him a prayer
Cathy and Carl got a K on the shelf
I'm in DeKalb County open carrying, catering, chef
Cooking up another plate of the best
Me and Christo got it popping like it's Crisco fried chicken
I'm licking her thighs then I put my face in breast, I
Took a drive, my plug on the west side of Atlanta
He known to finesse guys
With a hammer on Campbelton, headshots
On the camera, knock out a dreadlock
That's a felony charge, he caught a F
Nigga's come to the A and get X'd out (facts)
But I only been here 'cause I'm trying to help
Only one you can help is yourself now

Nigga say that I can't, damn lie
Ain't dapping no hand, sanitize
We gon' slide on your man, landslide
It's a nine in my pants, hand cocked
You gon' try to recant, you can't now
I can step on a ant, ant pile
I'ma shoot at the ground, dance now
Dance, uh, dance, shh, dance

Oh, what a handsome gift
To live in a land of sin
Riding with bags and bricks
And my lil' nasty chick
That's what I asked of Him
Told me He'd grant my wish
You dance with the Devil
You'll never dance again

Dance now
Dance, dance, shh, dance
Dance now
Dance, dance, shh, dance
Dance now
Dance, dance, shh, dance
Dance now
Dance, dance, shh, dance

Life is a journey, you know? Not a destination
Lean not towards the egoistic intonations 
Positive vibrations bring real liberation
It's the will of the heart, the strength of the mind
And the love creator that will help us
Rise out of these sadistic situations
And experience the purity that exits inna creation, you know?
