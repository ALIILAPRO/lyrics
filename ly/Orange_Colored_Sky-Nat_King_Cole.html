		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was walking along, minding my business
When out of an orange colored sky
(Flash, bam, alakazam)
Wonderful you came by

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
(Flash, bam, alakazam)
I got a look at you

One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
(This is it, this is it, I've been hit)

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
(Flash, bam, alakazam)
Out of an orange colored sky

One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
(This is it, this is it, I've been hit)

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
(Flash, bam, alakazam)
Out of an orange colored, purple striped
Pretty green polka dot sky
(Flash, bam) alakazam and goodbye

Wow, I thought love was much softer than that
For the most disturbing sound
