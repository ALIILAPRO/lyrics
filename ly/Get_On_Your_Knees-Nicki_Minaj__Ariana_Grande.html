		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby just say pretty please

I'll be back at eleven, you just act like a peasant
Got a bow on my panties because my ass is a present
Yeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'
I be laughing when you beggin' me, to just put the head in
Let me sit on your face, it's ok you can play with it
When I'm bouncin' it, chill out and don't you make a mistake with it
Let me see what you're workin' with, if you're ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it

I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby I'ma need you to beg, beg beg for it

Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby just say pretty please (pretty please)

Gimme brain, assume the position
Make me way smarter like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition
Good head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission
Finish your mission, you make it come down, make it run down
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the run down
You got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry

I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby I'ma need you to beg, beg beg for it (I need you to beg) (let's go)

'Cause we are just animals
Baby it's primal
I want you on all fours
And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl
If you want it all
It's non negotiable
So do as I say (I say)
If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss

(Yeah)
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it (beg for it)
I wanna see you lookin' up (lookin' up)
Baby I'ma need you to beg, beg beg for it

Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby just say pretty please (pretty please)
