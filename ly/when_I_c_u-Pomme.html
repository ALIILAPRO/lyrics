		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see you I will breathe again
Tell me the truth, do you feel the pain?
Do you cry a lot at night?
I do cry sometimes
I try to let it go

When I see you, I will smile again
Tell me the truth, do you feel the pain?
Do you switch on all the lights?
I do keep them on
I try to close my eyes

But I miss you
I miss the sun
And I love you
More than I can say
I miss you
I miss your hands
I love you
More than I can say

When I see you, we will drive again
To the river, do you hear the waves?
Do you remember the time?
I do, I was stoned
And tried to let it go

When I see you, we will kiss again
In the morning, do you miss my face?
Do you want to call tonight?
I do but it makes me sad
Maybe tomorrow

I miss you
I miss the sun
I love you
More than I can say
I miss you
I miss your hands
And I love you
More than I can say

When I see you
