		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wear you everywhere I go
It feels so close on my empty ghost
Can you scare away the wolves,
Scare away the wolves
(Wrap me up, wrap me up, wrap me up, wrap me up in your love)
I wear you everywhere I go
Can you find me, in the undergrowth
I've been hiding from the wolves, it's hard in these four walls
(Wrap me up, wrap me up, wrap me up, wrap me up in your love)
I wear you everywhere I go
Familiarity wrapped in bones
Just don't let me fall
I want your skin on mine that is all
Wrap me up, wrap me up, wrap me up
Wrap me up in your love
And when I'm spiralling through a storm
You are the eye that keeps me from
Giving up, wrap me up, wrap me up
Wrap me up in your love
Just don't let me fall
(Don't let me fall, don't let me fall, don't let me fall, don't let me fall)
I wear you everywhere I go
Fill me up when the bottle is low
