		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Made for you
That's the picture that I'm trying to paint
Even though I know it ain't true 
I kust wanted to get close to you
'Cause you make me feel like no one else
I'll be whoever you want me to
Except for being myself

Ooh
I'm scared of any type of disconnection
Ooh
It's my own fucked up way of showing affection

You tell me what you love I'm like me too
Say anything to get to you
I might seem like a dream come true
'Cause I lie like I was made for you
Should come clean with the things I've said
But I fall perfect in your bed
I might look like a dream come true
'Cause I lie like I was made for you (made for you)

Made for you
No, I don't want you to meet my friends
'Cause I'll be someone completely new
Ooh-oh
'Cause I love to panic
In need of attention
Put a new face on and I stop pretending
Don't know where to start
You bring up your old scars
I'll act like I had no idea

You tell me what you love I'm like me too
Say anything to get to you
I might seem like a dream come true
'Cause I lie like I was made for you
Should come clean with the things I've said
But I fall perfect in your bed
I might look like a dream come true
'Cause I lie like I was made for you (made for you)

Made for you
Ooh-oh
I'm scared of any type of disconnection
Ooh-oh
That's my own fucked up way of showing affection

You tell me what you love I'm like me too
Say anything to get to you
I might seem like a dream come true
'Cause I lie like I was made for you
Should come clean with the things I've said
But I fall perfect in your bed
I might look like a dream come true
'Cause I lie like I was made for you

Until you find somebody new
I'll lie like I was made for you
