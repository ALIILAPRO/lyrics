		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me wild and wired
Oh, you come to me
Give me everything I need

Give me a life time of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
Mm, and it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, babe

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long here in your arms I could be in no better place

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say, oh
Tear us apart, now, now, now
Baby, I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh, baby, don't let go

Oh, you're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Oh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart
Baby I would rather be dead
You're the best

Oh, you're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Oh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, now, now, now
Baby I would rather be dead
Oh, you're the best

You're better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Oh, you're the best
