Up in the club, fuck VIP
P to da I, I to da T
Ying to the Yang, up in this thang
D to da roc
My Nigga Kaine, open it cut
Pouring it up, rolling it up
Holing it up, ain't her ass swollen or what?
Yes sir yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be
That must be too live for your crew hoe, get down get low
I'm crossing these mammas like tic tac toe
Let's ride lets go
Get loose get crunk get drunk get blown
That's right lets roll
MIA ATL for sho'

Shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake 
Chica, shake, shake

Shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake 
Chica, shake, shake

That hoe's fine, but but but but this one's a killa
That hoe's is fine, but but but but this one's a killa
That hoe's is fine, but but but but this one's a killa
That hoe's is fine, but but but but this one's a killa

All the lil' mamas, all around the world
Shake that ass if you a nasty girl
Back that ass up says juvenile
Show a nigga some titties, like "Girls Gone Wild"
Tear off this clip of clothes, I want to see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road, where niggas go to see naked hoe's
Shake that shit bitch
And be off in the club with a hard-ass dick, then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit 
Put a hump in your back and lift your rump 
Do a three-point stance, put yo fist up her ass 
You must be on that Kanye work-out plan, like head, shoulders, knees, hoes

Shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake 
Chica, shake, shake

Shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake 
Chica, shake, shake

Mentirosa (Mentirosa)
Mentirosa (Mentirosa)
Mentirosa (Mentirosa)

That hoe's fine, but but but but this one's a killa
That hoe's is fine, but but but but this one's a killa
That hoe's is fine, but but but but this one's a killa
That hoe's is fine, but but but but this one's a killa

Take em out in cruise, 
Take em out all dressed, is the realest true niggas in the ATL 
Yeah we break it down betta shake a booty 
And hoes and the hoe with the real tight clothes 
One time for the gang with the ying yang twins 
We already know we off the reel 
Dont tolerate that talkin Bitch u can get to walkin 
Patron is what im groaking 
The only way that we gon' talk If your breath smells like mine 
Girl I don't give a fuck 'cause you fine 
I diss em fo I kiss em I pack em fo i stack em 
So while we in the club betta get these girls 
'Cause on the streets there aint no action

Shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake 
Chica, shake, shake

Shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake 
Chica, shake, shake

Mentirosa (Mentirosa)
