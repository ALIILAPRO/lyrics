		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you look at me
The way you touch me
The fire are in your eyes
(I swear) Makes me shivers inside
There's nothing I can do about it
'Cause nothing seems so truth
When I'm beside you
And my dream 
Of all thing is all in my hand
Naked, perfect, so beautiful
You turn me up and down
I was spinning round and round
You never get enough, baby you don't
You're a shining star

The way you look at me
The way you touch me
The fire are in your eyes
(I swear) Makes me shivers inside
There's nothing I can do about it
You're my soulmate, my summer and my faith
You fill me up with love
Your kisses are better than wine
There's nothing I want more than you, girl

The way you look at me
The way you touch me
The fire are in your eyes
(I swear) Makes me shivers inside
There's nothing I can do about it
You're my soulmate, my summer and my faith
You fill me up with love
Your kisses are better than wine
There's nothing I want more than you, girl
You turn me up and down
I was spinning round and round
You never get enough, baby you don't
You're a shining star

The way you look at me
The way you touch me
The fire are in your eyes
(I swear) Makes me shivers inside
There's nothing I can do about it
You're my soulmate, my summer and my faith
You fill me up with love
Your kisses are better than wine
There's nothing I want more than you, girl
You're my soulmate, my summer and my faith
You fill me up with love
Your kisses are better than wine
There's nothing I want more than you, girl
