		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we were young the future was bright.
No one told us we were buried alive.
Now we aspire just to barely survive.
Trapped in a box, searching for light.

Trust there's just no future left for us.

It's quiet as night but you can still hear the sound
of the royals in court marching above the ground.
The promise of hope, they wave it around.
They'll open it up just to push you back down.

Once I had a hope.
Once I had a dream
that this was more than what it seemed.
Trust there's just no future left for us.

If I could go back I'd take a photograph.
Trust there's just no future left for us.
