		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At 14
Katy talked about teenage dreams
On the bus and she's looking at me
Talking about life and her dog and the boys that she likes
I ask "Have you got someone in mind?"
He's at the all-boys school
She says something about liking his height
Suddenly worried about mine
بياخد مخدرات
و هوا بيتعلم سواقة
بيقضي وقت معها
She likes a boy, she likes a boy
She likes a boy, she likes a boy
I'm not a boy, I'm not a boy
I'm not a-
Accustomed to making a move
مش ھاقدراشرح
Why I'm feeling the way that I do
احساس جدید لیا
She's half-Greek with a pretty face
Strawberry lip gloss, oh, it's wasted
On this dumb boy who likes the chase
But why am I so angry in the first place?
Why am I hurting?
ما تفوقي شوية
She's not your girlfriend
She likes a boy, she likes a boy
And I'm not a boy, I'm not a boy
I'm not a boy, I'm not a-
She likes a boy, she likes a boy
She likes a boy, she likes a boy
And I'm not a boy, I'm not a boy
I'm not a boy, I'm not a-

I'm not a boy

Fuck that guy
