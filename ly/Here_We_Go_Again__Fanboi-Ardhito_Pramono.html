		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So here we go again I kissed that girl again
But suddenly it must come to an end
Stop smiling you know you are so annoying
Your chicks your lips your hips are little tempting
If she really finds out I'll be dead man walking

Your eyes are blue
So good to be true
I just can't stop thinking about you oh
Though we're a far apart
You are still my best bud

So here we go again I fall in love again
Please don't tell that we're gonna be friend
Your love is sweet as honey in the spring
Romantic places you will be the clue
This time love you'll always in my dream

It's early too early
It comes too early
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget

Oh here we go again I kissed that girl again
Then suddenly it must come to an end
Stop smiling you know you're so annoying
Your chicks your lips your hips are little tempting

If she really finds out I'll be dead man walking

II'm just a fan
Living my fantasy
Falling in love with the girl I can't see

Fly miles away
With all my dignity
Saving all my fireworks
Will you ever notice me
Will you ever notice me
