		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just checked my photos
I was with you bout' a year ago
I'm not even sad
I'm still wishing you were here though
I get really worried
If you really wanna hear though
I know who I am though
I know who I am though

You hate who I am though
Say I got no plan though
You still call me when I land though
Baby that's the plan though

I see your shadow
Same place, different time
And it kills me
Fucking with me in my mind
You never loved me
Still at least I got some time
And it's fine
Oh it's fine

I see your shadow
Same place, different time
And it kills me
Fucking with me in my mind
You never loved me
Still at least I got some time
And it's fine
Oh it's fine

Catch me in LA now
Would have flown you out to stay now
Something bout' the way you say wow
Would have loved to see your face now

I just checked my photos
I was with you bout' a year ago
I'm not even sad
I'm still wishing you were here though
I get really worried
If you really wanna hear though
I know who I am though
I know who I am though

You hate who I am though
Say I got no plan though
You still call me when I land though
Baby that's the plan though

I see your shadow
Same place, different time
And it kills me
Fucking with me in my mind
You never loved me
Still at least I got some time
And it's fine
Oh it's fine

I see your shadow
Same place, different time
And it kills me
Fucking with me in my mind
You never loved me
Still at least I got some time
And it's fine
Oh it's fine

Catch me in LA now
I would have flown you out to stay now
I wonder what you would have said now
I would have loved to see your face now

I just checked my photos
I was with you bout' a year ago
I'm not even sad
I'm still wishing you were here though
I get really worried
If you really wanna hear though
I know who I am though
I know who I am though

You hate who I am though
Say I got no plan though
You still call me when I land though
Baby that's the plan though

I see your shadow
Same place, different time
And it kills me
Fucking with me in my mind
You never loved me
Still at least I got some time
And it's fine
Oh it's fine
