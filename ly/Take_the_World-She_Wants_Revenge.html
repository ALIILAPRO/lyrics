		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The words that no one speaks
About the night before
She stares off at the road
Her finger taps the door
I'd hate to judge if roles reverse you'd think so too

She'd seen the film before
But stayed until the end
She had him to herself
Perhaps as more than friends
Maybe I'd do things differently if I were you

Your pulse it races with mine and I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight we can take the world
Your pulse it races with mine and I swear we can take the world

His hand against her cheek
Her tongue against his neck
She says "You're awfully sweet, I feel like we connect."
Maybe it's love. How would she know?
And did she tell?

The clothes they go on slow
She thinks of what to say
He whispers in her ear
She smiles and looks away
Her heart it screams she grabs his hand and says "Me too."

Your pulse it races with mine and I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight we can take the world
Your pulse it races with mine and I swear we can take the world

Is this the life, the one you imagined
Is this the life, the one from your dreams
Is this the life,the one you imagined
Is this the life, the one from your dreams
Is this the life, the one you imagined
Is this the life, the one from your dreams
Is this the life, the one you imagined
Is this the life, the one from your dreams

Your pulse it races with mine and I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight we can take the world
Your pulse it races with mine and I swear we can take the world
