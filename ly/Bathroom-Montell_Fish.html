		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said, "Forget all the slow dancing
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
You know you ain't even gotta ask me
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom"

She moves with my palm
She always gives it to me
And I'm fallin' in love
This is addictive, please
I'm sorry, girl
For the way you make me feel
You were my world
And you ruined everything

She said, "Forget all the slow dancing (ah)
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom (you know I'll take you)
You know you ain't even gotta ask me
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom"
She said, "Forget all the slow dancing
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
You know you ain't even gotta ask me
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom"

She said, "Forget all the slow dancing
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
You know you ain't even gotta ask me
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom"
She said, "Forget all the slow dancing
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
You know you ain't even gotta ask me
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom"

Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom

Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
