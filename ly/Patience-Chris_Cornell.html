		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now

Was a time when I wasn't sure
You set my mind at ease
There ain't no doubt you're in my heart now

Said woman, take it slow, it will work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar, make it slow, we will come together fine
All we need is just a little patience

I sit here on the stairs
I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear

Sometimes it gets so tense
I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

Said woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
If you and I just use a little patience
Said sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I got what it takes to make it, oh

I've been walking these streets at night
Just trying to get it right
Hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in a crowd

And the streets don't change but maybe the names
You know I ain't got time for the game
'Cause I need you
Yeah, I'll need you

Said, woman, take it slow, it will work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar, make it slow, we will come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
