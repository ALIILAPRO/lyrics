		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm done with you if you reached out
I wouldn't respond to you, for the first time
Was I too good for you?
Holding mirrors, just so they're facing you
Never felt right

I can't believe you ruined nineteen for me
Then blamed me for it
I am twenty-two and still am paying for it
Bet you adore it

I hate you and all the boys
With the same name as you
Continue to lead me on and
Lead me back to you
I've got five fingers and my
Favorite ones for you so fuck you Matthew

The reason I'm done with you
I found someone who looks way better
Than you in the mirror
Even my bed sheet's new
Every time I had to fake it with you
Why you? Why you?

I can't believe you ruined nineteen for me
Then blamed me for it
I am twenty-two and still am paying for it
Bet you adore it

I hate you and all the boys
With the same name as you
Continue to lead me on and
Lead me back to you
I've got five fingers and my
Favorite ones for you so fuck you Matthew

Ooh, fuck you Matthew fuck you Matthew

I hate you and all the boys
With the same name as you
Continue to lead me on and
Lead me back to you
I've got five fingers and my
Favorite ones for you so fuck you-
I hate you and all the boys
With the same name as you
Continue to lead me on and
Lead me back to you
I've got five fingers and my
Favorite ones for you so fuck you Matthew

(Fuck you Matthew) fuck you Matthew

I'm finally done with you if you reach out
I'll never respond to you this is goodbye
