		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suicide obsession in a world of betray
Taunted into silence and then bury the rage
Deep depression darkness fed, pull the trigger count the dead
Contradict of faith, out to devastate
Crazed disposition underlining deceit
Killing without reason for no cause or belief
Deadly imposition, out of touch and deranged
One with god half insane
Wage of sanctity, tears and agony
Ancient and bizarre Satan's repertoire

In the minds of evil, fear imposed by design,
In the minds of evil, kill till everything dies

Twisted by religion and fanatical hate
In the line of fire devastation in place
Homicidal mission of tyrannical lust
Fatal inquisition for the spilling of blood,
Don't care what you've done, death to everyone
It's no mystery, destroy you and me

In the minds of evil, fear imposed by his design,
In the minds of evil, death to all of mankind, die
In the minds of evil, burn in hell and die, and die

In the minds of evil, fear imposed by design,
In the minds of evil, death to all of mankind.
