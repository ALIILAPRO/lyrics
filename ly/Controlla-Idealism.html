		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Barrel up against the temple
It's so funny
These the moments
That I feel so sentimental
And resentful
The potential
Detrimental
Kind of thinking in this moment
Frozen
While you holding up your weapon
And you counting down your seconds
Was this luck or was it destined
Am I wrong for second guessing?
That my life would fall to weston
Or falling to a man that I still view as the oppresion
No deception
Hides the fear of learning life's eternal lessons
Now
I can hear the angels call
Mama dressed in black and all
I never teach my son to ball
Or see my daughter standing tall
And with my back against the wall
I feel a tear begin to fall
The lonely soldiers dark reprise
That hits you in the heat of night
The pistol at my head
Chokes my lungs and fills it up with fright
Darkness as I close my eyes
My family stuck up in my sights
The silence starts to scream
As I plea, for my wretched life
So controlla
Is it really over?
Your finger on the trigger gonna be my final closure?
Am I
Going up above
Or am I going down lower
Will my family get to know
That their daddy was a soldier?
So controlla
Is it really over?
Your finger on the trigger gonna be my final closure?
Am I
Going up above
Or am I going down lower
Will my family get to know
That their daddy was a soldier?
