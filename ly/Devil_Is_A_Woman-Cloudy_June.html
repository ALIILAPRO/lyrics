		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The devil is a woman
The devil is a woman

Don't you ever make angels cry
Never misbehave, stay in line
But she looks so good in red like a secret valentine
I can't change my ways, God knows why

If the sin is so bad 
Tell me why's it gotta taste so sweet (the devil is a woman)
No, I've never been a Saint 
But her power got me on my knees (the devil is a woman)
They say, "Watch out for the serpentine 
She's sly but her curves don't lie"
Your paradise sucks but your hell sounds good to me

If the devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman

Wear's no halo but choker chains
Just one kiss, it's your broken faith
Don't fear who don't obey when straight gets locked away
If that's your world, I'm a hopeless case

If the sin is so bad 
Tell me why's it gotta taste so sweet (the devil is a woman)
No, I've never been a Saint 
But her power got me on my knees (the devil is a woman)
They say, "Watch out for the serpentine
She's sly but her curves don't lie"
Your paradise sucks but your hell sounds good to me

If the devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a

Belial (the devil)
Behemoth (the devil is a)
Beelzebub (the devil is a woman)
Asmodeus (the devil)
Satanas (the devil is a)
Lucifer, Lucifer

If the sin is so bad
Tell me why's it gotta taste so sweet
No, I've never been a Saint 
But her power got me on my knees
They say, "Watch out for the serpentine
She's sly but her curves don't lie"
Your paradise sucks but your hell sounds good to me

If the devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha, ha ha)
The devil is a woman (ha, ha ha ha)
The devil is a woman
