		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the verge of a breakdown
Back in her hometown
Never thought she'd settle down
In a place like this

Cold coffee on the back porch
Wooden chair rocking back and forth
Now she wonders how it all went down
Back in her hometown

Most people never left
Found a job and filled in the rest
Never got around to leaving the nest
Holding on to not let go

But that path just wasn't for her
She got out faster than the fireworks
Never took time to slow it down
Now she's back in her hometown

Looking out at the cedars and the oaks
The mourning dove sings beneath the sky of blue
All the thoughts that led her out
On that road, without a doubt
Somewhere they fizzled out
Now she's back in her hometown

What makes a life complete?
Roads traveled and the people you meet?
Or is just the silence
Of the times in between?

Her mind is racing as she sits alone
In the place that she used to call home
Memories are all around
Back in her hometown

Looking out at the light above the hills
Her mama sings beneath the sky of blue
All the thoughts that led her out
On that road, without a doubt
Somewhere they fizzled out
Now she's back in her hometown
