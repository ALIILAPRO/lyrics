		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Upside doooown
like a word that's hung to the inside of an empty promise zip tied to your mouth
Tongue tied nooow
By the weightless shock of a nightfall looming over you when the lightbulb burns you out
Like a flame
You see the face but you can't remember the name
It's a constant state of worn out phrases
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Ahhhh-ahhh-ahhhh
Tip toe ouuut
From the backdoor down to the basement where your funny faces always made me frown
And when I'm dooown
I'll dance in a fever cold and calm with a sewn on smile and feet swollen and numb
Like a vein
You see the face but you can't remember the name
It's a constant state of worn out phrases waiting on the same sum
I'm going numb!
And it doesn't get better it just gets twice as bad because you let it
So you better get numb to it, get numb to it, get numb to it
No it never gets better it just gets twice as bad because you let it
So you better get numb to it, get numb to it, get numb to it
And it doesn't get better it just gets twice as bad because you let it
So you better get numb to it, get numb to it, get numb to it
No it never gets better it just gets twice as bad because you let it
So you better get numb to it, get numb to it, get numb to it
wooooo
