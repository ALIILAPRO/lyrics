		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
They call me F-L-A-C-K-O and don't play, no, 'bout my papes
Baked potato on that Draco, new bandana on my face
Ain't no stains up on my drapes, squeaky clean, fuck you say?
Peep them teeth, no dentures please
Princess cut, no dentist please
Say cheese for the cameras (ayy)
Eight G's for the dancers (ayy)
Benjis in the safe (ayy, that's right)
Bentleys for the phantoms (uh)
But they all go to waste (uh)
So what more can I say?
Praise to the Lord, give him grace
Scar on my face
Uh-uh, wait

(ecafracS, sruoy si dlrow ehT)
The world is yours, Scarface 
(ecafracS, sruoy si dlrow ehT)

I ain't ducking niggas, I ain't ducking bullets either, shit
I ain't duck sauce since I became a vegan
Nigga, Flacko Jodye season
Prada pants before the season
Probably ducked off in a quiet place with ya breezy
Prada shades probably why you couldn't see him
You shittin' me? (Boy)

I would like to dedicate (that's right)
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this 
To the scar on my face
In the stars on the globe
The world is yours, Scarface (Scarface)

Scarface
Scarface

Uh, fuck no, this ain't no hookah
Smoking while I'm strolling down Wooster
Buck fifty, my babushka
No pistol poppers and prostituters
Card scammers and the Prada boosters
Low top, yeah, the powder blue ones
Robber too, huh? Power to ya
Hallelujah, better pray to God

I would like to dedicate (that's right)
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this 
To the scar on my face
In the stars on the globe
The world is yours, Scarface (boy)

Scarface
Scarface

Uh, pearls and diamonds, that's excessive
Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass and breasts's
Pearls and diamonds, that's excessive
Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass and breasts's
