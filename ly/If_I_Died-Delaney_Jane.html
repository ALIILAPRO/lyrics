		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe If I died
And came back to life
You will look at me the way you did before
Before I was yours
Before you were mine
'Cause I don't feel those hungry eyes anymore

And it's hard for me to find the words to say
When I'm afraid that nothing's ever gonna change

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Or maybe you'd be fine

Remember when we met
You were just a friend
But you chased me like I was a piece of heaven
And I warned you first
That I wouldn't be easy to love, no
Everybody tells me I'm too much
But you wouldn't let me go, yeah

It's hard for me to up and walk away
When I know my love for you has never changed

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Or maybe you'd be fine

Kiss me like you mean it
Hold me like you're scared to let me go
You change like the seasons
Show me you're the man I used to know

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Would you miss me?

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Or maybe you'd be fine

Would you miss me?
Maybe you'd be fine
