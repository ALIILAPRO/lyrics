		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have waited
Paralyzed by my own will
Viciously reminding me still
I'm born to believe
And I am certain, no
That you and I are crashing course
Driven by a holy force
I know you can see

That you will be mine
Yeah, you will be mine

We balance fire in the earth we walk
Will never stop me reaching forth
To see you again
With colors over all the wasted years
Eternity will bring you near
I know you can see
I know you can see

That you will be mine
Yeah, you will be mine (you will be mine)
But don't give me time (you will be mine)
You will be mine (you will be mine, you will be mine, you will be mine)

Did you not say we were made for each other?
Did you not say we were made for each other?

I have waited
Paralyzed by my own will
Viciously reminding me still
I'm born to believe
I am certain
You and I are crashing course
Driven by a holy force
And oh, you can see

You will be mine (did you not say)
You will be mine (we were made)
You will be mine (for each other?)
You will be mine, yeah, no
Did you not say we were made for each other?
