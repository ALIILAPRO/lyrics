		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are so worthy of everything
I have to give
But I burn with feeble offerings
Nothing to sustain fan against the flame
Oh, what I've made

So take all of me please take all of me

It's like I'm running away from me
It's like I've taken the puzzle in me
And left it scrambled for all to see
It's like I'm fighting behind these walls
And hiding through metaphors
This is real, these are flaws

So take all of me please take all of me

So take all of me please take all of me
