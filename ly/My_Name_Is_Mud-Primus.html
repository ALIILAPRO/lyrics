		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My name is Mud
Not to be confused with Bill or Jack or Pete or Dennis
My name is mud and it's always been
'Cause I'm the most boring sons-a-bitch you've ever seen

I dress in blue-yes navy blue
From head to toe I'm rather drab except my patent shoes
I make 'em shine, well most the time
'Cept today my feet are troddin' on by this friend of mine

Six foort two and rude as hell
I got to get him in the ground before he starts to smell

My name is Mud

My name is Mud,
But call me Alowishus Devadander Abercrombie
That's long for Mud, so I've been told
Told that by this sonsabitch that lies before me bloated blue and cold

I've got my pride, I drink my wine
I'd drink the finest except I haven't earned a dime in several months
Or were it years
The breath on that fat bastard could bring any man to tears

We had our words, a common spat
So I kissed him upside the cranium with an aluminum baseball bat

My name is Mud
