		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We said we'd do this life together
You told me nothing's gonna change
Well, funny change is hard to measure
When you get so used to the pain

But something feels wrong, I don't know what it is
If I'm the problem, just tell me what I did
Everything's different, you just don't wanna talk
I feel the distance every time that I call

You used to answer straight away
Now you just let it ring
You used to wipe my tears away
Now all I do is swim
Oh, the way you look at me has changed
And you won't let me in
So can you tell me how, tell me how
Tell me how did it come to this?

But something feels wrong, I don't know what it is
If I'm the problem, just tell me what I did
Everything's different, you just don't wanna talk
I feel the distance every time that I call

You used to answer straight away
Now you just let it ring (you just let it ring)
You used to wipe my tears away
Now all I do is swim
Oh, the way you look at me has changed
And you won't let me in (let me in, let me in)
So can you tell me how, tell me how
Tell me how did it come to this?

Oh, you used to answer straight away
Now you just let it ring (you just let it ring)
You used to wipe my tears away
Now all I do is swim
Oh, the way you look at me has changed
And you won't let me in (let me in, let me in)
So can you tell me how, tell me how
Tell me how did it come to this?

You used to answer straight away
You used to wipe my tears away
