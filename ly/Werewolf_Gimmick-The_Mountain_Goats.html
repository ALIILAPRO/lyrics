		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was not there for rehearsal, I don't need it any more
When I show up just in time to pop, you can clear the goddamn floor
Empty out the locker room, let me find my space
Let him who thinks he knows no fear look well upon my face

Nameless bodies 
In unremembered rooms
Know how a man becomes a beast when the wolfbane blooms 

Sail past all the grasping hands, floodlights white and hot
Bring my vision into focus, find out what I've got
Some sniveling local babyface with an angle he can't sell
Full werewolf off the buckle like an angel straight from hell

Nameless bodies
In unremembered rooms
Run howling through the carnage when the wolfbane blooms

Half the city sound asleep and safe inside their beds
Get lost inside my thoughts and nearly tear his face to shreds
Blood pooling on the canvas as the atmosphere gets hushed
Bring your heroes to the wolf's den, watch them all get crushed
Get told to maybe dial it back backstage later on
Everyone still in this building right now, dead before the dawn

Nameless bodies 
In unremembered rooms
The pure at heart go putrid when the wolfbane blooms
