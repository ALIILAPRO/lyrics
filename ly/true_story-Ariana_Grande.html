		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a true story about all the lies
You fantasized (fantasized) 'bout you and I
This is a true story about all the games
I know you play

No, this is not what I need (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Not what I want (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Ain't gonna happen to me
Gimme love, love, gimme love, love, lo-love
Gimme love, gimme love, love
Love, love, lo-love

I'll play the villain if you need me to
I know how this goes, yeah
I'll be the one you pay to see play the scene
Roll the cameras, please

Turnin' like a dime (dime), wastin' all their time
Sneakin' like a creep in the night
But I'll play whatever part you need me to
Mm

This is a true story about all the lies
You fantasized (fantasized) 'bout you and I
This is a true story about all the games
I know you play

No, this is not what I need (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Not what I want (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Ain't gonna happen to me
Gimme love, love, gimme love, love, lo-love
Gimme love, gimme love, love
Love, love, lo-love

I'll play the bad girl if you need me to
If it makes you feel better
I'll be the one you love to hate, can't relate
Too much on my plate

See it in your eyes (eyes), you got too much time
For fun, you like to pray for my demise, mm
But I'll play whatever part you need me to
And I'll be good in it, too

This is a true story about all the lies
You fantasized (fantasized) 'bout you and I
This is a true story about all the games
I know you play

No, this is not what I need (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Not what I want (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Ain't gonna happen to me
Gimme love, love, gimme love, love, lo-love (ooh)
Gimme love, gimme love, love (gimme love, gimme love)
Love, love, lo-love (not what I want)
Gimme love, love, gimme love (not what I need)
Gimme love, love, gimme love (ain't gonna happen to me)
Gimme love, love, gimme love, love, lo-love (gimme love, gimme love)
Gimme love, gimme love, love
Love, love, lo-love (mm)
