		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone is super young
They're fucking and they're getting drunk
They left me in the dust again
It seems to have become a trend
I'm sinking down the fucking drain
Drinking away all the pain
I think I'll blow my brains out now

They're stealing everything I've made
Corrupting every girl I've laid
Doing it better and getting paid
I'm very very very afraid there's nowhere left for me to go
I burned out a long time ago I guess I'm just an asshole

(Eins, zwei, drei, vier)

Hey, tomorrow fuck you and your friend yesterday
But you can never catch me because
I'm old, I'm bold, I broke that fucking mold 
When I was young and dumb and full of fuckin' cum
And if you feel the way that I'm supposed to feel then you are

Youth is wasted on the young
What fucking planet are you from
You think that you're the only one who's ever fucking lived before
I have died a thousand deaths
I've sucked upon a million breasts
My compliments to all the chefs

Whatever gets me through the day is how I throw my life away
These lyrics are becoming gay it's just like 50 shades of grey
You're doing everything I want
Being everything I'm not and reaping all the benefits

Hey, tomorrow fuck you and your friend yesterday
But you can never catch me because
I'm old, I'm bold, I broke that fucking mold 
When I was young and dumb and full of fuckin' cum
And if you feel the way that I'm supposed to feel then you are
You are [x3]

(I am a relic from the past
Praise to Caesar
These days are all I've got
And that ain't much
My life is the ambition
If I was going to kill myself I would tell you
You're only young once, but you can't be immature forever)

Hey, tomorrow fuck you and your friend yesterday
But you can never catch me because
I'm old, I'm bold, I broke that fucking mold 
When I was young and dumb and full of fuckin' cum
And if you feel the way that I'm supposed to feel then you are
