		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pray for continuing
peace eternally
Sunny day
In the breeze blew the leaves
of flowers and trees
People were beginning
to be in a hurry
Suddenly without notice
an evil child was born
The nightmare comes again
He repeated the carnage
with missile and many soldiers
Sow destruction
and reign and deprive
He thought it was just
I don't know
how random murder is
justice to anyone it left behind
Angry victims
and the dead bodies, dead bodies
But there are no more tears
Thus the evil one
still sits and laughs
Safe behind his white wall
made of greed
Laughing as he starts
a war spilling innocent blood
A cross of sadness
that people must bear
To a destiny where we will die
Where is the promised land?
Can't we grab happiness
in our hand?
Someone said
"There is too much Population"
Victims cry in the distance
Children cry You hear them?

They shake with anger
and deeper sorrow
Burying their dead
holding their guns for a fight
Conflict, it echoes on a spiral
Even now today
The sorrow that
we cannot never ever,
never ever cannot escape
The scar is left forever
Thus the evil one
still sits and laughs
Safe behind his white wall
made of greed
Laughing as he starts
a war spilling innocent blood
A cross of sadness
that people must bear
To a destiny where we will die
Where is the promised land?
Can't we grab happiness
in our hand?
Soaked in drugs
Killed while crying
A cross of sadness
the troops bore
No future and no tomorrow
A cross of sadness
that you who died bore
To keep singing such a thing
A cross of sadness that I bear
I pray for all fate has cursed
