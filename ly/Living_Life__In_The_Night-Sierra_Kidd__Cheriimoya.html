		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time and they reachin' out for what's mine

Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time and they reachin' out for what's mine

I've been awake for days
So we out living life in the night
Pray to god, man I hope I don't die
I've been awake for days
So we out living life in the night
Pray to god, man I hope I don't die in the night

Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time and they reachin' out for what's mine

Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time and they reachin' out for what's mine

Two bedrooms, seven little childs, can't be right
Call my brother, he in prison doin' time, but we alright
Tried my best just to catch a fucking smile
But for now I see myself ain't hitting the 35 (oh)

I've been awake for days
So we out living life in the night
Pray to god, man I hope I don't die
I've been awake for days
So we out living life in the night
Pray to god, man I hope I don't die in the night

Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time and they reachin' out for what's mine

Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time and they reachin' out for what's mine
