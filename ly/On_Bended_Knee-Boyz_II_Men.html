		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way?
Girl it's drivin' me insane 
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God, give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know that I don't need to be alone, yeah
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God, give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God, give me a reason
I'm down on bended
Down on bended knee

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God, give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again 
'Til you come back to me
I'm down on bended knees
