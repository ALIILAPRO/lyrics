		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'ma need that gold medal, matte black shit on a whip
Hear them drums, nigga? ERYS in a 6 with the wrist
'Bout to swish, no assist, never miss with the drip
Man, I'm 'bout to go and do some shit that no one ever did

I'm with the boys, making the noise
This is the uh, Tesla toy
We stackin' the toys, end of the story
We already gone, that's more to the point
Niggas ignored us, flyin' it solo
Gone in the mornin', you never know it
I'm unemployed and I'm on the block
Now we 'bout to blow up, now we 'bout to blow it
We the rascal, dead cam, punk kids
Runnin' through the club, where the music hella pumpin'
You don't want shit
Tell them niggas start jumpin'
At a warehouse party with the fuck shit
And pull up with the bass, made the shit sound rustic
Mace to the face, riot gear's in the closet
Keep the city sane, keep the babies out the moshpits
Keep me out the party, 'cause I'm too psychotic, yeah

(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
Tell me you're sorry, I feel the same
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
You gave me DMT, straight from your brain, girl
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
We weren't in nature to marry again
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
That's why it all feels like it's just the same

On a roll
When we pull up with the gold
Ready to go, ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go
We don't flex most trap shit
Bass with the backflip
Scrape metal on the pavement, fuck fashion away
Everyday, motivate, to the masses who bought that shit
Nigga, this shit's a classic
Whoa (whoa)

(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
Tell me you're sorry, I feel the same
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
You gave me DMT, straight from your brain, girl
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
We weren't in nature to⁠

Jaden'll flash, man, okay
Man I'm back in this shit, and I'm rappin'
Today, pushin' packs on the corner, countin' stacks
Everyday got the wings in the Hills, like it's Batman, okay
Fuckboys need to stop fuckin' rappin', okay

Tell me you're sorry, I feel the same
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
You gave me DMT, straight from your brain, girl
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
We weren't in nature to marry again
(I'm with the boys, making the noise)
That's why it all feels like it's just the same (Ayo, Ayo)

Jaden, they think we fuckin', kissin', lickin' and suckin'
What they don't get, sarcasm, let's end it like orgasm
I'm a nutcase baby, put a lock on that bitch
You'd thinkin' I'm diggin' graves
The way I'm puttin' rocks on my wrist? (no)
Young T-man, taller when you see him (woo)
I'm all about them fruits and my greens like a vegan (wow, wow)
Your talent couldn't put you in the spot where niggas be in
When I get that 20 bag, I swear to God that I'll be leavin' (Nyoom)
I might buy vanilla waf', I might buy some real estate
I might buy canary, taxi yellow, diamond glitter flick
I might blow it all on somethin' stupid, wouldn't matter
'Cause I did not sign a dummy fuckin' deal
Like them, at end of day
Got my white stripes, this my icky thump
Got my heart broke, won't you pick it up?
Needed time to heal, just like Nicki Buns
Bitch I make it hard to breathe, like, bitch, I kick the lung

(Let's go, let's go)
ERYS is on your side
I didn't wanna die for you
Girl I had to try
I really wanna fly with you
Sunset on our lives
I really wanna try
You been by my⁠

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go!
