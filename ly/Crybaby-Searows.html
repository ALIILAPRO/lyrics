		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it just like me to say this?
Just what you'd expect from the latest
Version
If I knew what it was I would tell you
If the door wasn't shut i'd let you in

Take your sweet time
I'll give you all of mine
Take what I can get
And let you have the rest what do I do here?
What do I do? Am I
Too sad to be here? Am I
Too sad to be alive? I don't wanna be
I try but I wanna stay alive
I do, I do, I do at least I try to
Want to

Do you have a place for me
Do I have to become smaller
Would you see me differently
If I made mys–µlf taller instead?
