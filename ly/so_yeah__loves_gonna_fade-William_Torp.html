		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So yeah, love's gonna fade
I thought I would know by now
I would love if you stayed
And maybe just talk things out

How does it feel to get something so real
How does it feel for you

I was only halfway through the main
When you broke the news
Saying - "some things never change right
I still wanna care for you"
If you want me to


So yeah love's gonna change
I really should've known by now
I would tell you to wait
But I missed the train somehow

How does it feel to know someone so well
How does it feel to loose

I'll be driving halfway through the state
with a broken heart
I don't need you to see me
Break down in a parking lot

Only ever saw this in the movies
that we used to watch
But this ain't gonna end well
I believe i know that much
