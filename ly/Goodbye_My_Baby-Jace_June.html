		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, don't you cry now
What's the time now?
It's goodbye, my baby
Hold me in your arms just like you do

(I don't suppose I'll ever get you completely out of my heart, but)
(What are you saying to me, Katherine?)
(I don't know)
(I just know what we've got to do)
(And we've got to do it right now)
(So please, say goodbye)

I just found a penguin in my kitchen
She said, "Love is earned it isn't given"
But love just breaks me down

I just poured my heart out to my mother
She said, "Dear there'll always be another"
But love just breaks me down

Wish me well
Oh time will tell
But darling don't say
Wish we could stay
(Stay)

Baby, don't you cry now
What's the time now?
It's goodbye, my baby
Hold me in your arms just like you do

Lay me on a clover
When the clock stops
Then it's over, baby
I just need your love

I just found a fish inside my toilet
She said, "Love is rare you best enjoy it"
But love just breaks me down

I just found a bunny in my dresser
She said, "Sex is good, but love is better"
But love just breaks me down

Wish me well
Oh time will tell
But darling don't say
Wish we could stay
(Stay)
(Hello?)

Baby, don't you cry now
What's the time now?
It's goodbye, my baby
Hold me in your arms just like you do

Lay me on a clover
When the clock stops
Then it's over, baby
I just need your love
