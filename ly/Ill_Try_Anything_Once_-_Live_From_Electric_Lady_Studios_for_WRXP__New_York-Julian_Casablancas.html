		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ten decisions shape your life
You'll be aware of five about
Seven ways to go through school
Either you're noticed or left out
Seven ways to get ahead
Seven reasons to drop out
When I said, "I can see me in your eyes"
You said, "I can see you in my bed"
That's not just friendship, that's romance, too
You like music we can dance to

Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you

There is a time when we all fail
Some people take it pretty well
Some take it all out on themselves
Others, they just take it out on friends
Oh, everybody plays the game
And if you don't, you're called insane

Don't, don't, don't, don't, it's not safe no more
I've got to see you one more time
That's when you were born in 1984

Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you

Everybody was well dressed
And everybody was a mess
Six things without fail you must do
So that your woman loves just you
Oh, and all the girls played mental games
And all the guys were dressed the same

So why not try it all
If you only remember it once?
Ooh, ooh

Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you

(Yep)
