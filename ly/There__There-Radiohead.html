		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
There there

Why so green and lonely?
And lonely, and lonely?

Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me?

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
