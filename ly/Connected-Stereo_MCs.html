Somethin' ain't right
Gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light which is reflected
I see through you, see through you
I see through you, I see through you
Your dirty tricks, you make me sick
I see through you, I see through you
I'm gonna do it again, gonna do it again

I'm (gonna do it again, gonna do it again)
Gotta do right (gonna do it again)
Somethin' ain't right (gonna do it again)
Gotta do right
Come on

If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
(Stereo MC's)

I, ain't gonna go blind
I see through you, see through you
I see through you, I see through you
Gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light which is reflected
Hear me out
Can ya hear me out?
Can ya hear me out?
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
You're terrified (I wanna do it again)
Ain't gonna go blind, ain't gonna go blind
(I wanna do it again) 
Here we go

If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
Hear me out
Stumble, you might fall

Interstate 5
Stayin' alive
Won't someone try
Open up your eyes
You must be blind
If you can't see
The gaping hole called reality
Ow, wanna do it again
I gonna, gonna do it again
I wanna do it again, come on
I'm gonna do it again
Hear me out
Terrified
Somethin' ain't right
Here we go

If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble, you might fall
Stumble, you might fall
