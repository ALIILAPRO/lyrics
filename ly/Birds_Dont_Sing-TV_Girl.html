		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said "How could you joke
At a time like this?
I know why, cause this is what
You wanted all along now, isn't it?
I think that all you ever really ever
Wanted was a reason to complain
That never stopped you before
Don't let it get in your way"
Those are her words, not mine
As far as I'm concerned
We could've had a good time
So, if you walk out that door in disgust
I guess there's nothing more to discuss

("You don't sound 'a little sick' to me")

Don't listen to my music, don't lie in my bed
Don't listen to the references to things
That you might have actually said
'Cause those are my words, not yours
As far as I'm concerned
It could have been a lot worse
I wasn't trying to avoid the confrontation
She isn’t crying
She’s just making conversation

Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye goodbye

(Over and over again, "Well, umyes!")
("You'd do that to a woman?")
