		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's an old town wrought with mystery of
Tom The Poet and his Muse
And the magic lake which gave a life
To the words the Poet used

Now the Muse, she was his happiness
And he rhymed about her grace
And told her stories of treasures
Deep beneath the blackened waves

'Till in the stillness of one dawn
Still in its mystic crown
The Muse, she went down to the lake
And in the waves she drowned

And now to see your love set free
You will need the Witch's cabin key
Find the lady of the light gone mad with the night
That's how you reshape destiny

The Poet came down to the lake
To call out to his dear
When there was no answer
He was overcome with fear

He searched in vain for his treasure lost
And too soon the night would fall
And only his own echo
Would wail back at his call

And when he swore to bring back his love
By stories he'd create
Nightmares shifted endlessly
In the darkness of the lake

And now to see your love set free...

In the dead of night, she came to him
With darkness in her eyes
Wearing a mourning gown
Sweet words as her disguise

He took her in without a word
For he saw his grave mistake
And vowed them both to silence
Deep beneath the lake

Now if it's real or just a dream
One mystery remains
For it is said, on moonless nights
They may still haunt this place

And now to see your love set free...
