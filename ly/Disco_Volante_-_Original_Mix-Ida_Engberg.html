		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, it's ninety-seven going into ninety-eight,
And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues.
This is my heart, my purpose in life,
And finally I'm on.
Which brings me to realise that the tough life that I had only made me 
Stronger, true.

[Chorus]
Richard Stites
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.

Growin' up, didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you.
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you.
Want to play you close and jump in the pool wit' you.
I don't know what to do, but this much is true,
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career,
And turn right around when you hot a gear.
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear;
That the man upstairs, he control this here.
And it's funny how soon as the money piles,
Everybody want to play with that brother now.
Run me down, but when the dough gets low, only a few friends roll, you know.
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife,
Said "Lynisse, please do something with your life."
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

And I remember when, I used to feen for calls;
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls.
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work;
Told her when I made it big she never gonna work.
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street,
Hustlin', shit, they would live to the light,
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow.
To all my soldiers I hold you down.
From standin' in the rain, to the rovers now.
I'm screamin your name, to warn you that the rollers is around.
To on-stage, throwin' it down.
No matter where you at, represent your hood.
No matter where I'm at, I'm representing my hood.
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day,
Nobody in the block gave their life away.
We all tryin' to take it easily,
And everybody want to make it seems is free.
Today it's all good, and it seemes so strange,
Since you look up in the hood now, things done changed.
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks,
And bitches on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in,
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'.
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes.
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows.
Girls flow through with designer clothes.
It's day now, but you know how night time goes,
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

...you know it's true!
