		  Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate

If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation
It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together to release the pressure
We need a holiday

If we took a holiday (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Took some time to celebrate (come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (holiday)
It would be, it would be so nice

If we took a holiday (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Took some time to celebrate (come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (just one day out of life)
It would be, it would be so nice

You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate
Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together, we can make things better
We need a holiday

If we took a holiday (holiday)
Took some time to celebrate (come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (just one day out of life)
It would be, it would be so nice

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Come on, let's celebrate
We have got to get together

Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate

If we took a holiday (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Took some time to celebrate (come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (holiday)
It would be, it would be so nice

Holiday (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Celebrate (come on, let's celebrate)
Holiday (just one day out of life)
Celebrate
It would be so nice 

(Holiday) holiday celebration (celebrate)
Come together in every nation
(Holiday) holiday celebration (celebrate)
Come together in every nation (holiday)

(Celebrate)
(Holiday)
(Celebrate)
(Holiday) we've got to get together 
(Celebrate) take some time to celebrate
(Holiday) just one day out of life
(Celebrate) it would be so nice
(Holiday) holiday celebration
(Celebrate) come together in every nation
(Holiday) holiday celebration
(Celebrate) come together in every nation
