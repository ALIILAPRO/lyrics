		  There's a devil waiting outside your door (how much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door (how much longer?)
And he's bucking and braying and pawing at the floor (how much longer?)
And he's howling with pain, crawling up the walls (how much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door (how much longer?)
And he's weak with evil and broken by the world (how much longer?)
And he's shouting your name and asking for more (how much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door (how much longer?)

Loverman! since the world began
Forever, amen, till the end of time, yeah
Take off that dress, oh
I'm coming down, yeah
I'm your loverman, yeah
'Cause I am what I am what I am what I am what I am

L is for love, baby
O is for only you that I do
V is for loving virtually everything that you are
E is for loving almost everything that you do
R is for rape me
M is for murder me
A is for answering all of my prayers
N is for knowing your loverman's going to be the answer to all of yours

Loverman! till the bitter end
While the empires burn down
Forever and ever and ever, ever, amen
I'm your loverman
So help me, baby
So help me, baby
'Cause I am what I am what I am what I am what I am
I'm your loverman

There's a devil crawling along your floor (how much longer?)
There's a devil crawling along your floor (how much longer? )
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door (how much longer?)
With his straining sex in his jumping paw (how much longer?)
Ooh, there's a devil crawling along your floor (how much longer?)
And he's old and he's stupid and he's hungry and he's sore
And he's blind and he's lame and he's dirty and he's poor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more (how much longer?)
There's a devil crawling along your floor

Loverman! haha! and here I stand
Forever, amen
'Cause I am what I am what I am what I am, hey
Forgive me, baby
My hands are tied
And I got no choice, no, no, no, no
I got no choice, no choice at all

I'll say it again
L is for love, baby
O is for oh yes I do
V is for virtue, so I ain't gonna hurt you
E is for even if you want me to
R is for render unto me, baby
M is for that which is mine
A is for any old how, darling
N is for any old time

Loverman! yeah, yeah, yeah! I got a masterplan, yeah
To take off your dress, yeah
And be your man, be your man, yeah
Seize the throne, haha
Seize that mantle
Seize the crown, yeah
'Cause I am what I am what I am what I am, plus I am
I'm your loverman

There's a devil laying by your side (how much longer?)
There's a devil laying by your side (how much longer?)
You might think he's asleep, but take a look at his eyes (how much longer?)
And he wants you, darling, to be his bride (how much longer?)
And there's a devil laying by your side (how much longer?)

Loverman! loverman! loverman!
I'll be your loverman!
Till the end of the time!
Till the empires burn down!
Forever, amen
I'll be your loverman
I'll be your loverman
I'm your loverman
I'm your loverman
Yeah, I'm your loverman
I'm your loverman
Loverman
I'm your loverman
I'm your loverman
I'm your loverman
Yeah, I'm your loverman
Yes, I'm your loverman
Loverman
Loverman
Loverman
Forever, amen
Loverman (how much longer?)
