		  Isn't this what you came here for?
Isn't this what you came here for?
Isn't this what you came here for?
Isn't this what you came here for?

Blah, blah, blah I don't wanna hear shit
Medicals and miracles and all the obits
We stay all day and leave all night
Tell it like it is because we know it ain't right, they're
Paid off, catch a tiger by- the total price of all the penalties
Let's go, don't you wanna see another model just like you?

Too smart but you can't imagine (too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (now don't think twice)
You always buy brand new
Too smart but you can't imagine (too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (now don't think twice)
You always buy brand new

Gangs start shooting and the parents aren't gonna be the answer
To the overwhelming ordinary
Pick a vision and just follow the clues
We don't need the conversation we just confuse the
Breakdown, don't adjust your set, now careful
There's no feedback guarantees
Why now? It always seems to be another job you can't get through

Too smart but you can't imagine (too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (now don't think twice)
You always buy brand new
Too smart but you can't imagine (too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (now don't think twice)
You always buy brand new

Your warranty is not a guarantee to me
Your innocence is just a pittance and naive
Contrive the controversy, sinister and plain
Upgrade the system 'til the virus can be sane

Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?
Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?
Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?
Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?

Too smart but you can't imagine (too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (now don't think twice)
You always buy brand new
Too smart but you can't imagine (too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (now don't think twice)
You always buy brand new

Haha (haha, haha, haha, haha)
