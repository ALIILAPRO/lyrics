		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Towel underneath the door
Fast food wrappers on the floor
Staring at the TV screen
Drinking uncontrollably
Watched The Notebook, didn't cry
Emotionally paralyzed
Drowning in my cluttered bed
Ignoring all of my friends

I don't wanna go to your party
No, I don't wanna see anybody

I don't wanna live, wanna laugh, wanna love
I wanna sit in my room and get drunk
Don't wanna live my best life
Just wanna lay here all night
I don't wanna live, wanna laugh, wanna love

Eating chips after they're stale
Listening to Nine Inch Nails
Boxers are my lingerie
Dinners in the microwave
Google imaging myself
Wishing I was someone else
Up until four in the morning
Stressing over global warming

I don't wanna go to your party
No, I don't wanna see anybody

I don't wanna live, wanna laugh, wanna love
I wanna sit in my room and get drunk
Don't wanna live my best life
Just wanna lay here all night
I don't wanna live, wanna laugh, wanna love

Live, laugh, love
Live, laugh, love
Just wanna sit, get drunk
Don't wanna live, laugh, love

I don't wanna live, wanna laugh, wanna love
I wanna sit in my room and get drunk
Don't wanna live my best life
Just wanna lay here all night
I don't wanna live, wanna laugh, wanna love
