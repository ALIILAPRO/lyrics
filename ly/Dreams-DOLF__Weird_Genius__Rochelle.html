		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't have to say goodbye when I see you in my dreams
Like the warmest summer wind I feel you in the breeze
It'll never be goodbye cause I'll see you in my dreams
So until later in my dreams

I sleep through the days now just in case you might show up
I'm wasting away now but I still feel all the love
If I wake up stay with me
I sleep through the days now just to see you in my dreams

Came to me again last night to say it's okay to breathe
Take it slow take it easy and take all the time you need
You won't need to close your eyes when I hold you in my wings
So until later in my dream

I sleep through the days now just in case you might show up
I'm wasting away now but I still feel all the love
If I wake up stay with me
I sleep through the days now just to see you in my dreams
