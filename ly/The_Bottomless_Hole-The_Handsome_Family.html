		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My name I don't remember, though, I hail from Ohio
I had a wife and children, good tires on my car
What took me from my home and put me in the earth
Was the mouth of a deep, dark hole I found behind my barn

We'd been filling it with garbage as long as you could count
Kitchen scraps and dead cows, tractors broken down
But never did I hear one thing hit the ground
And slowly I came to fear that this was a bottomless hole

I went out behind the barn and stared down in that hole
Late into the evening my mind would not let go
So I got out my ropes and a rusty claw-foot tub
And I rigged myself a chariot to ride down in that hole

My wife, she did help me, she fed me down the ropes
And then I sank away from the surface of this world
With the last rope pulled tight, I had not reached the end
And in anger I swung there, down in that dark abyss

So I got out my knife, I told my wife goodbye
I cut loose from the ropes and fell on down that hole
And still I am there falling down in this evil pit
But until I hit the bottom, I won't believe it's bottomless
