		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I wrong for being lost?
The pressures of being boss
Exhausted every bone in my body, I can't walk
I don't talk, I scream, I don't stop to think
I'm so close to the dream that I can't go to sleep
Ironic I know, so I need more chronic to roll
Tryna find what's more important, the money or my soul?
It's cold, I'm low
I'm caught between the roads
Under the Hollywood sign, you get blinded by the glow

Uh, yo, how could you look me in the face?
You sat at the table with my daughter
Promising you got us right after you finished saying grace
Why don't you tell her what your hidin' in the bank?
It's time to cut my lawn and see the snakes
It's time to tell the truth to every fan
Who doesn't understand that it's because of you they had to wait
While you left me here to deal with all the hate
I still smile but feel so fake
It's no sun the clouds are opaque
So much shade I read on one page
I can't even look at your name without getting the shakes
What a mistake, uh
Look how you take, uh
What doesn't belong to you, this was a rape
And if fate send us both to heaven
I'ma keep a blade in my leather so I can kill you at the gate, uh

(First place)
Isn't worth it when you see it's all (two-faced)
Tryna fit into a world with no (new space)
Commit third degree murder (what for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood Whore
(First place)
Isn't worth it when you see it's all (two-faced)
Tryna fit into a world with no (new space)
Commit third degree murder (what for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood Whore

I woke up sweatin'
Tryna forget I'm in a mansion
Because fans are mad at my expansion
And my friend I thought was family who'd always understand me
Got offended 'cause he jealous we're supposed to be at the Grammys
I'm askin', when did pride and passion get mistaken for handouts and ass-kissing?
The fact is I made it from trailer trash to Saks 5th
Took it from underground to massive and the come up was classic
Back when white boys rapped they gettin' their ass kicked
I was battlin' putting these rappers in caskets
I was walking home getting jumped after classes
Tell me, why don't my haters mention that shit now?
My rent is due and I'm the tenant getting by with no credit
Got residue from sedative I ain't get from the medic
My schedule is so fuckin' hectic but still I'm in debt
I'd be better off dead so life insurance keeps my family fed
It's because of y'all I couldn't separate from my career
'Cause of y'all I hated myself for so many years
'Cause of you, you ain't never gonna see me trust
Even If I got a wife, she's just somebody I fuck

(First place)
Isn't worth it when you see it's all (two-faced)
Tryna fit into a world with no (new space)
Commit third degree murder (what for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood Whore
(First place)
Isn't worth it when you see it's all (two-faced)
Tryna fit into a world with no (new space)
Commit third degree murder (what for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood Whore

City of Angels (danger)
The City of Angels (danger)
