		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rockin' the tee, mm-mm-mm, it's so elegant
I'm rocking the tee, it's so elegant
My money bigger than big like an elephant
Bak got the game on lock, you heard me? Yeah

I'm rocking the tee, it's so elegant
My money bigger than big like an elephant
She eat the dick, in her mouth like a pelican
Rock with the realest and none of us hesitant
Speakin' some facts
I should be the president
Felt like it's porn without all the cameramen
Once I get money, I won't be depressed again
Say what I mean, know what was happening

Beatin' my checks like buss down King Kong
Only got two cups, don't play ping pong
This shit too catchy, come on, sing along
Yeah, I'll admit it, I live like a junkie
But I still did it, man, whole lotta money
You wanna split it, I don't find it funny
Know I won't quit it, she hop like a bunny
Pots over kick it, you know I get wicked
You talkin' the shit on Twitter
You's a cricket
Yes I'm a stoner, I know I'll admit it
Bitch yeah, I'm leanin', I pivot
Your money tall as a midget
Uh, yeah, my money changin' in digit's
I'm high as fuck like a pigeon, uh, yah
Don't get it wrong, don't get twisted
I'm goin' up, my ass, you can kiss it, bye
I can't fuck with nobody
Seem they to be recording me
Copy my drip, it's like I imported 'em
Sip on the DJ Fay, pour it up
She too hot, feel like it's Florida, uh
We in the back of the bands with her friends
She wan' dance, get a game
On my dick wit her friends
No, I won't split it, I fuck on these bitches
The back of the building
Yeah that's where we kick it
I'm gettin' this money
You're short like a midget
Not talkin' Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang
I kick it i just called chief, yeah, listen
I got new sheets, yeah, exquisite
I got this money, my gang, I split it
I misunderstood how I don't fit in (Fuck 'em)

I'm rocking the tee, it's so elegant
My money bigger than big like an elephant
She eat the dick, in her mouth like a pelican
Rock with the realest and none of us hesitant
Speakin' some facts
I should be the president
Felt like it's porn without all the cameramen
Once I get money, I won't be depressed again
Say what I mean, know what was happening

Yeah, yeah with the OG gas 'cause she see
It from the top show
Uh, yeah, your racks so trash
Wrap it in a nutshell (Wrap it up)
I do not ask, I do not show and tell
Yeah, uh, I'm gettin' calls
I'ma get clients now
Boy, I need that cash and
That shit like pronto
Rollin' a leaf in the woods, smoke fine toke
Pourin' up deuce in the blue
What a fine tone every day I get a present
This shit like Santa
Boy, you keep talkin' shit
We gon' get fed up
Yuh, all in my cheese, all in my feta
I cannot trust all you twelves
Sick in the water just like it's a well
They wish me the worst
They don't wish me well
I got a song, it's called "I Can Tell"

I'm rocking the tee, it's so elegant
My money bigger than big like an elephant
She eat the dick, in her mouth like a pelican
Rock with the realest and none of us hesitant
Speakin' some facts
I should be the president
Felt like it's porn without all the cameramen
Once I get money, I won't be depressed again
Say what I mean, know what was happening
