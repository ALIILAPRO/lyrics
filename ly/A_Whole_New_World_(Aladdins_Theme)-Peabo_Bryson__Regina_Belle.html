		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, free wheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world (Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world (A whole new world)
That's where we'll be (Where we will be)
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me
