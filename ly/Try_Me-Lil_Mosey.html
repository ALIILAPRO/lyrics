		<p>
		  (Y'all rocking with DJ Scheme, lil' bitch)
(Nuri the GOAT)

Walkin' through the thunder, feel like I'm goin' insane (insane)
The only thing that's helpin' is these racks in the safe (these racks)
If you comin' with me, give me a reason for you to stay (for you to stay)
I stopped poppin' pills and switched to champagne (champagne)
I just booked a jet, I'm tryna fly and go away (away)
Landed in Miami, ninety down the freeway (freeway)
I just lost my nigga, think about it every day (every day)
Life is moving fast but I know I'm okay (okay)

I'm never lacking, do what I'm 'posed to ('posed to)
I hate these niggas, watch who you get close to (who you get close to)
You don't know my past, you don't know what I been through (what I been through)
I been doin' scams and stealin', what I'm used to (what I'm)
Grew up too fast (too fast)
Watchin' niggas get blown back (blown back)
I just think you should know that (know that)
Addiction came from my dad
So don't ask why I love poppin' pills (pills)
I came from a place where this shit get real (get real)
I was havin' troubles tryna find my next meal (next meal)
I felt so good when I signed my deal (yeah, I signed that)
I brought all my niggas, everyone out the field (the field)
I hopped in the stu' with the fire on me (boom)
I was finna show you what you was tryna see (tryna see)
Picked me up when I was down, 'cause you down with me (down with me)
He said he was my nigga but he lied to me

So sad, so sad (so sad)
I hope that you know that, know that (know that)
We all rich we glowin', glowin' (glowin')
Look my wrist is snowin', snowin' (snowin')
Celebrate with Moët, Moët (Moët)
Leave my pistol showin', showin' (showin')
Let any nigga try me, try me (try me)
Please don't get it by me, by me (by me, uh)

Walkin' through the thunder, feel like I'm goin' insane (insane)
The only thing that's helpin' is these racks in the safe (in the safe)
If you comin' with me, give me a reason for you to stay (for you to stay)
I stopped poppin' pills and switched to champagne (champagne)
I just booked a jet, I'm tryna fly and go away (away)
Landed in Miami, ninety down the freeway (freeway)
I just lost my nigga, think about it every day (every day)
Life is moving fast but I know I'm okay (okay)
