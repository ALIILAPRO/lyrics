		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An odd unreality
Macabre life at home
Dominating Father figure
Sadist to the bone

Ape-like looks the doting parent
Prone to fits of rage
Sadist and a Mother's boy
Deflowers come of age

They're missing
Underground they dwell
Mundane life with inner secret
He is West of Hell

Satisfaction comes through power
Fuse them in their guilt
Chemistry ignites the powder
Homely graveyard he had built

Saw-edge blade that cuts and slices
Pack them in the floor
All his evils have been done
There's none now to explore

They're missing
Underground they dwell
Mundane life with inner secret
He is West of Hell

Fantasy fuelled killing spree
Porno's psychopath
Resenting Mother for her sins
His twisted childhood trap

Overcome was all too much
In the prison cell
We look back within disgust
The creature West of Hell

Killing became such a trick
The only way to get a kick
Violent his appetite
Scrape of earth throughout the night

They're missing
Underground they dwell
Mundane life with inner secret
He is West of Hell

They're missing
Insane life he led
Our gratitude in suicide
You are better dead
