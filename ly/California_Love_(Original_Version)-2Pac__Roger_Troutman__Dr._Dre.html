		  California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that Sunshine State where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay (uh)
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

California (California) knows how to party (knows how to party)
California (West Coast) knows how to party (yes, they do, that's right)
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts (good ol' Watts)
In the city, the city of Compton (city of Compton)
We keep it rockin' (keep it rockin'), we keep it rockin' 
(Yeah, now make it shake, c'mon)

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali (Cali)
Shake, shake it, baby (that's right)
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right, uh)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution, we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down, give me love

California (California) knows how to party
California knows how to party (c'mon, baby)
In the city of L.A. (South Central)
In the city of good ol' Watts (uh, that's right)
In the city, the city of Compton (yup, yup)
We keep it rockin' (keep it rockin'), we keep it rockin' 
(Yeah, yeah, now make it shake, uh)

Shake, shake it, baby (uh)
Shake, shake it (uh, yeah)
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali (shake it, Cali)
Shake, shake it, baby (shake it, Cali)
Shake, shake it
Shake, shake it, mama (West Coast)
Shake it, Cali

Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown
Oakland definitely in the house (hahaha)
Frisco (yeah), Frisco 

And you know L.A. up in this
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood tryna get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?
Yeah
Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up
I can't see ya
California love (uh, uh, uh)
Let's show these fools how we do it on this Westside
