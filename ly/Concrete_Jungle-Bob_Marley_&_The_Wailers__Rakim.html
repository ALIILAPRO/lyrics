		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No sun will shine in my day today (no sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play (that high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said (darkness) darkness has covered my light
(And the stage) And the stage my day into night, yeah
Where is the love to be found? 
Won't someone tell me 'cause life (sweet life) must be somewhere to be found
(Must be somewhere for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (la la-la!)
Where the living is harder 

Concrete jungle (la-la!)
Man you got to do your best, whoa, yeah
No chains around my feet
But I'm not free, oh-ooh!
I know I am bound here in captivity
G'yeah, now (never, never) I've never known happiness
(Never, never) I've never known what sweet caress is
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown

Won't someone help me 'cause I (sweet life)
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
(Must be somewhere for me), he-yeah!
In this a concrete jungle (la la-la!)
I said, what do you got for me (la-la!) now, o-oh!
Concrete jungle (la la-la!), ah, won't you let me be (concrete jungle)
Hey, oh, now

I said that life (sweet life) it must be somewhere (must be somewhere for me) to be found
Oh, instead, concrete jungle (la-la!) collusion
Confusion (concrete jungle) eh!

Concrete jungle (la-la!) baby, you've got it in
Concrete jungle (concrete jungle) eh!
Concrete jungle (la-la!)

What do you got for me (concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle (la-la!)
