		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Of course I do
Try not to think about you
But of course I do

Have you tried moving on without you
It's impossible to do you're impossible to lose
Subconsciously thought I wasn't allowed to

I was just waiting for some kind of sign
That there's not a world where it's not you and I

But this is the end
The plot doesn't twist
You'll never love me again like you did

You might always be
Someone I miss
But it's okay if you forget I exist

Forget I exist
Forget I exist

Of course I tried
Blaming it on the timing
But at the time
Life was hard and you helped me survive it

So I could never hate you
Or let someone replace you
But of course I tried
Of course I tried

We're no longer lovers and we're no longer friends
Now all that's left is being strangers again

But this is the end
The plot doesn't twist
You'll never love me again like you did
You might always be
Someone I miss
But it's okay if you forget I exist
Forget I exist

It's okay if you forget everything that you promised
It's okay if you forget all the things that we wanted
If my name is something that you no longer acknowledge
It's okay it's okay it's okay

But this is the end
The plot doesn't twist
You'll never love me again like you did
You might always be
Someone I miss
But it's okay if you forget I exist
Forget I exist
