		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's have hotel sex
Lock the door and get both undressed
Make the other rooms so jealous 
From the sound of you moanin'
I'm so obsessed 
I don't care if it's a Motel 6
Pretty obvious we're both a mess
Throw our clothes on the floor (and) 
We'll leave it all till the morning 
Heavy 
The only word that comes to mind
Am I ready? 
Roller coaster up and down on your body
As soon as our eyes lock you know that you got me
Yeah you got me 
Venom in your bite
Put it on my lips
You're the holy grail 
Let me have a sip 
Wake the neighbors up
Don't apologize 
We don't need no alibi 
Cautious 
A word that never comes to mind when we're touching
You love to fuck my head up like a concussion
As soon as our lips lock it's end of discussion
No discussion 
C'mon, c'mon, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, yeah
Let's have hotel sex
