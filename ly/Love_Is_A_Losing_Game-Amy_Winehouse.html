		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For you, I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
