		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your "hey, oh"
Now listen what I say, oh (oh)

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on?
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, yo, whoa-oa, whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go, oh

When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea, to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey, yo
Listen what I say, oh
I got your "hey, yo"
Listen what I say, oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, yo, whoa-oa, whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said, "Hey, hey-yeah, oh yeah"
Tell my love now
Hey, hey-yeah, oh yeah
Tell my love now

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said, "Hey, hey-yeah, oh yeah"
Tell my love now
Hey, hey-yeah, oh yeah
