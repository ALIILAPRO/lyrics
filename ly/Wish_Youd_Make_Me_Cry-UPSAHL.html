		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm getting bored, I start some drama
And when I'm too fucked up, you let me yell
Without you, yeah, I'm so unbothered
I'm tryna stir it up, I need your help

I know it's only natural
But can we pretend to be cool?

Sometimes, I wish you'd make me cry
Sometimes, I wish that we could fight
Tell me, don't you hate it? Perfect's overrated
Tell the nice guy to give me a taste of my medicine
I wish you'd make me cry

I get angry and I try to call it off
But you don't play along, you keep it fair
You keep saying you just want good karma (Good karma, karma)
But she's a bitch like me who doesn't care (Care)

I know it's only natural
But can we pretend to be cool?

Sometimes, I wish you'd make me cry
Sometimes, I wish that we could fight
Tell me, don't you hate it? Perfect's overrated
Tell the nice guy to give me a taste of my medicine
I wish you'd make me cry

I wish you'd make me cry

Can we just forget that we're in love real quick
And tell me all 'bout how you want me to change?
Don't you hate it when I hate on all your newest kicks?
And when I never say I'm wrong
Or how I get when we're alone
And I am always on my phone
I wish that you would tell me off

Sometimes, I wish you'd make me cry
Sometimes, I wish that we could fight
Tell me, don't you hate it? Perfect's overrated
Tell the nice guy to give me a taste of my medicine
I wish you'd make me cry

Make me cry
Make me cry
Make me cry
I wish you'd make me cry
