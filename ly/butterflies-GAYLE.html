		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, no, no, like this

Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, oh my daisy
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You make my legs shake, you make me go crazy

Overcriticizin', always villainizin'
Overanalyzin', always overridin', slither like a snake
Just a caterpillar and you won't see me gettin' bigger
'Til I'm flyin' in a figure eight, circlin' your face

People feel better when they put in you a box
But the plastic's gonna melt if you're the one to make it hot
'Cause they're lookin' for the one way monologue
They're lookin' for the one way monologue

Are you gettin' mad?
Panic attacks?
Don't take it back
You wanna lash out

Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, oh my daisy
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, sugar, crazy
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, oh my daisy
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You make my legs shake, you make me go crazy

You are wild (shut up)
You're insane

Butterflies in my eyes
And the looks that could kill
You could say (you could say)
It's a gift (it's a gift)
But I know (but I know)
It's a skill (it's a skill)

People feel better when they put you in a box
And you're fittin' all the story lines, they think they need a plot
And they're lookin' for the clickbait dialogue
Lookin' for the clickbait dialogue (ah)

Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, sugar, crazy
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, oh my daisy
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, sugar, crazy
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly

Hello?
Come on baby, come, come on baby
You're my butterfly, sugar, crazy (fly, fly)
Come on baby, come, come on baby
Be my butterfly, oh my daisy (fly, fly)

Fly, fly, fly, fly (sugar, crazy)
Oh my daisy
