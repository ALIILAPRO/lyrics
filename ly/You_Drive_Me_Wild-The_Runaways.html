		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know when you're close you really turn me on
That's why I want you so bad when your gone, yeah
Come on, come on and take me home
Please stay with me and don't you leave me alone

You drive me wild, yeah yeah
You know you do, uh huh
You drive me wild, oh yeah
You know I need you, ooh ooh

You're on my mind always my one desire
And let's get together and build us a fire
Make me tremble and make me shake
Pleasin' each other rockin' till daybreak

You drive me wild, yeah yeah
You know you do, uh huh
You drive me wild, oh yeah
You know I need you, ooh ooh

You drive me wild, yeah yeah
You know you do, uh huh
You drive me wild, oh oh
You know I need you, ooh ooh

Don't hold off do it, I need your lovin'
I'm getting so hot, I'm cooking like an oven
My head is all filled with crazy thoughts
Love like this just can't be bought

You drive me wild, yeah yeah
You know you do, uh huh
You drive me wild, oh oh
You know I need you, ooh ooh
