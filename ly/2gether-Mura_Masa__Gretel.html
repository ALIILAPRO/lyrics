		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Half a world away
Feels a little further every day
Why can't we talk
Save some for me

Rest on my arm here
Talk like everything is gonna work itself out
Words like one thing
Looks like another

But I
I just wanted to be (together)
Why is it we can't be? (Together)
I just want us to be together
But I
I just wanted to be (together)
Why is it we can't be? (Together)
I just want us to be together
(Together)
(Together)

Together
Together
(Together)
(Together)
Together
Together

I just wanted to be (together)
Why is it we can't be? (Together)
I just wanted to be together
(Together)

(Jesus Christ)
(Together)
Together
Together
(Together)
(Together)
Together
Together
