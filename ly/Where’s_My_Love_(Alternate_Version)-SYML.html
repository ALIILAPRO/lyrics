		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold bones, yeah, that's my love
She hides away, like a ghost

Ooh, does she know that we bleed the same?
Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way

Cold sheets, oh, where's my love?
I am searching high, I'm searching low in the night

Ooh, does she know that we bleed the same?
Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way

Did she run away
Did she run away, I don't know
If she ran away
If she ran away, come back home
Just come home

I got a fear, oh, in my blood
She was carried up into the clouds, high above

If you're there I bleed the same
If you're scared I'm on my way

Did you run away
Did you run away, I don't need to know
If you ran away
If you ran away, come back home
Just come home
