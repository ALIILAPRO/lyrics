		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Light the lamp and fire mellow cabin essence
Timely hello welcomes the time for a change

Lost and found, you still remain there
You'll find a meadow filled with rain there

I'll give you a home on the range

Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?

I want to watch you, windblown, facing waves of wheat
For you embracing, folks sing a song of the grange

Nestle in a kiss below there; the constellations ebb
And flow there and witness our home on the range

Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?

Have you seen the Grand Coulee workin' on the railroad?
Over and over, the crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over, the thresher and hover the wheat field
