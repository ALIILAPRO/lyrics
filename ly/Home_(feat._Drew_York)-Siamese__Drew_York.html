		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're soul is the fuel to my insanity
There's no one who can do what you do to me
Cause you'll be by my side
When they turn of the lights
And a thousand eyes
Close and call it a night
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
 
When the winds bring me along
To the place that I call home
I want you to know, whereever I go
I'll be forever yours
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know
Whereever i go
I'll be forever yours
 
Straight from the city that never sleeps 
Surrounded by filth and scum
Moving at my feet
Vibrations from underneath, underneath
Hands behind my back, my back
Facedown, my eyes are open
I'm choking
I spent my whole life running
From something, but I trust the concrete
 
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
 
When the winds bring me along
From the place that I call home
I want you to know, whereever I go
I'll be forever yours.
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know
Whereever I go
I'll be forever yours
 
They say it's safe to fall
If you just trust the ground that you stand on
Get back up, against them all
Done forget where you came from
 
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes

When the winds bring me along
From the place that I call home
I want you to know, whereever I go
I'll be forever yours.
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know
Whereever I go
I'll be forever yours
