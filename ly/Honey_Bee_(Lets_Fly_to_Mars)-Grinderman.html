		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Mad mullahs and dirty bombs
Alert the coastal command
Ack-Ack positions everyone
She's my honey bee and here she comes
Cancer, rabies, SARS
Hairy beards and hurtling stars
Won't somebody touch me?
Won't somebody touch me?
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Buzz buzz buzz buzz

There's a kid laying on the lawn
The neighbors on the telephone
The dispatcher asks "What's going on?"
"Please Sir, what's going on?"
The kid is laying on the lawn
He's been giving me shit for years
He rides his bike across my lawn
Now he's laying on the lawn
Won't somebody touch me?
Oh, won't someone please touch me!
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Buzz buzz buzz ba baba ba ba ba woo!

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!

SCUD missiles, Asian Flu
The easily offended
We are the undefended
We are the undefended
Won't somebody touch us
There's a virus come to town
Won't somebody give me a kiss
He's been giving me shit for years
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Honey bee lets fly to Mars
Buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
Buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz

Honey bee
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Honey bee
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Honey bee
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Honey bee
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Honey bee
Buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
Buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
