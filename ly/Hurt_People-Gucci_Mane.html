		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know there's a lot of folks dealin' with a lot
It's been one hell of a last two years
(Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)

Hurt people, hurt people
Hurt people hurt people (facts)
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
Poor, rich or white or black all share this earth people (well, damn)
Hurt people, hurt people
Hurt people hurt people (facts)
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
'Cause they hurt, so they hurt people (go)

I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I had to search people (the right ones)
Let's talk about how hurt people hurt people (even your day ones)
Some put 'em in the dirt I mean they murk people
So sad to see your homeboy on a shirt people (damn)
I pray one day we all know gon' know our worth people (Lord)
Our curse we black so it started from birth people
I heard this lady killed her husband he wasn't sleepin' with her (woah)
But her pops had left her mom she been had daddy issues (damn)
Saw my partner shoot his brother over a couple dollars (bruh)
It gets deep 'cause they grew up without no fuckin' father (sad)
My daddy love me but didn't love me like that fuckin' bottle
I watch my momma fight her sisters I was just a toddler (mom)

Hurt people (hurt), hurt people
Hurt people hurt people
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
Poor, rich or white or black all share this earth people
Hurt people, hurt people
Hurt people hurt people
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
'Cause they hurt, so they hurt people

They say that hurt people hurt people well I'm the fuckin' model
Them niggas robbed me a couple times then I turned to a robber
I had to look straight in the mirror and say, "I'm the problem"
Life kept givin' me tests I didn't even know how to solve them (well, damn)
I damn near went completely numb, I wasn't even feelin' shit (nah)
I had a lot of pent up trauma I wasn't dealin' with
Self medicatin', a pint a day leads to an early death
Oh, that's the Wop y'all want well hope that y'all don't hold y'all breath
The shit I said and did, I'm grown, I had to blame myself
Now there's no one to blame 'cause I'm the only one that's left (myself)
A nigga tried to claim my body just to gain a rep
But he so hurt and desperate really that's a cry for help (help)

Hurt people, hurt people
Hurt people hurt people
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
Poor, rich or white or black all share this earth people
Hurt people, hurt people
Hurt people hurt people
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
'Cause they hurt, so they hurt people
