		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what?
It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me or something

It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me
It's not my fault
You gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're, like, you're, like, you're, like, in love with me
It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me (yeah)
You're, like, in love with me

Where she at? (Where she at?)
What she doin'? (What she doin'?)
Who she with and where she from? (Oh)
Oh, she's this? (She's this?)
Oh, she's that? (She's that?)
She's a flight risk on the run (okay)
She's back (she's back), she's back (she's back?)
Yeah, I'm back, bitch, are you done? (Huh)
Excuse me while I bite my tongue (woo)

I'm back on that same shit from before
I can't take this pettiness, now I'm bored, uh-huh
We can share, babe, there's enough for us all
Told you who I am and what it is, that's not my fault

It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me
It's not my fault
You gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're, like, you're, like, you're, like, in love with me
It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me (yeah)
You're, like, in love with me

Get her number, get her name
Get a good thing while you can
Kiss a blonde (kiss a blonde), kiss a friend (okay)
Can a gay girl get an, "Amen?" (Amen, woo)

I'm back on that same shit from before
I can't take this pettiness, now I'm bored, uh-huh
We can share, babe, there's enough for us all (us all)
Told you who I am and what it is, that's not my fault

It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me
It's not my fault
You gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're, like, you're, like, you're, like, in love with me
It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me
You're, like, in love with me (hm)

I mean who wouldn't wanna be in love with me? (Love with me)
I'm a mood, borin' whores gotta Pinterest me
I'm a stallion, but they comin' for me like Trojan (ah)
And it wouldn't be me if I ain't cause commotion (baow)
Bitch so bad, dudes thought I was A.I., ballin' like eight, ah
Stick to the motherfuckin' money like a stapler, stack like Jenga
Any pussy bitch get stroked like a painter
It's funny how the mean girl open all the doors (all the doors)
I been told y'all, I'm the black Regina George (baow)
Bikini top, booty shorts, Megan-core
You was hatin' back then, now you finna hate more
I got influence, they do anythin' I endorse
I run shit, to be a bad bitch is a sport (grrah)

'Cause I woke up hotter than I was yesterday (yesterday)
Don't care about no rules 'cause I always get my way (ah)

It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me
It's not my fault (baow)
You gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're, like, you're, like, you're, like, in love with me
It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me
You're, like, in love with me (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I woke up hotter than I was yesterday (woo, boaw)
Don't care about no rules 'cause I always get my way (hm, hm)
I woke up hotter than I was yesterday
It's not my (ah) fault you're, like, in love with me
You're, like, in love with me
