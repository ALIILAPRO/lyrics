		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone needs to rap off, in, off the top
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah

You're standing at the door
I'm falling to the floor
You look even better than you did before
I'm staring at my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while but I couldn't forget you

Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't want to

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

We're sitting real close, I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back
'Cause you know this thing could spiral in the night
I've changed my mind I'm ready for you this time

Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't want to

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you?
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

We're sitting real close, I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're sitting real close, I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand, I cannot fight it off

Do it, do it

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you?
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y-y-y-y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
