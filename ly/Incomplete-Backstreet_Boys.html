		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me, I can't find no rest
Where I'm going, is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is 
Incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go (alone)

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is

Incomplete
Incomplete
