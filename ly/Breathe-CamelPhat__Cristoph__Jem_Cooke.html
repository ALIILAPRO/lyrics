		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're hurting so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurting so much
I need you to breathe again

Skin, I'm folding
Come in, my friend
You feel unsteady
But I won't bend

You're hurting so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurting so much
I need you to breathe again

We tear our demon
You feel no pain
In the sweet surrender
Alive again

You're hurting so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurting so much
I need you to breathe again

You're hurting so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurting so much
I need you to breathe again

You're hurting so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurting so much
I need you to breathe again
