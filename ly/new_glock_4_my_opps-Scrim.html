		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
Yeah, okay, okay
Yeah (it's a smash)

I just bought a new Glock for my opps
Yeah, yeah, let's get it
I just bought a new chop for my opps (turn me up)
One thing they know about it, we gon' spin the block
Two things they know about it, yeah, it's fuck the opps (fuck the opps)
Three things they know about it got the thing on lock
This shit right here forever, I won't ever stop (let's go)
Keep the block hot (let's go)
Keep the block hot
Keep the block hot
Keep the block hot
Yeah, I stay ice angels but my gang is filled with demons
It's me and my cup, only thing that I can lean on
My lil' bitch, she toxic, yeah, she like the things I sing on
All these voices in my head singin' like a theme song

Yeah (yeah), yeah
I just bought a new Glock, bought a new chop
My bitch let me cum inside her like a tube sock
Told my gang I shoot, I don't care who on the block
Granny worried 'bout me, scared that I'm gonna die
Pop another pill, tell her I'ma be alright (turn me up)
I don't like to talk, nothin' to do with bein' shy (shy)
They can never see me, nothin' to do with bein' blind
Got a couple scripts on me hangin' out the Rick's
Came up out the sticks servin' fents to the hicks (turn me up)
Hangin' with them dogs, I ain't talkin' Michael Vick
G*59 for life, but my money bangin' crip
Alley-oop gang, white chocolate off the pick
Lil' bitch pop that E now she poppin' on my dick
Before he pop a stick bet he fuck around and flip
SRT the whip drinkin' codeine 'til I sick

Yeah, okay, okay
Yeah
I just bought a new chop for my opps
Yeah, yeah (let's get it)
I just bought a new chop for my opps
One thing they know about it, we gon' spin the block
Two things they know about it, yeah, it's fuck the opps (fuck the opps)
Three things they know about it got the thing on lock
This shit right here forever, I won't ever stop (let's go)
Keep the block hot (let's go)
Keep the block hot
Keep the block hot
Keep the block hot
Yeah, I stay ice angels but my gang is filled with demons
It's me and my cup, only thing that I can lean on
My lil' bitch, she toxic, yeah, she like the things I sing on
All these voices in my head singin' like a theme song
