		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I'm gone

Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so sweet to you
You won't realize I'm gone
You won't realize I'm gone

Many people wanna make money, make love
Make friends, make peace with death
But most mainly wanna win the game
They came to win, they want to come out ahead

But you, you're a rock with a heart
Like a socket I can plug into at will
And will you guess when I come around next?
I hope your open sign is blinking still

So marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I'm gone

Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I'm gone
You won't realize I've gone

As for me, I would have to agree
I'm as fickle as a paper doll
Being kicked by the wind
When I touch down again
I'll be in someone else's arms

Oh, John, come on
We'll do what married people do
Oh, John (I don't care) 
Come on (what you are)

Let's do what Mary and Joseph did (I want to marry you)
Without the kid (I want to marry you)

So marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I've gone

Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone

You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone

Many people wanna make money, make love (marry me, John)
Make friends, make peace with death (marry me, John)
Many people wanna make money, make love (marry me, John)
Make friends, make peace with death (marry me, John)
Many people wanna make money, make love (marry me, John)
Make friends, make peace with death (marry me, John)
