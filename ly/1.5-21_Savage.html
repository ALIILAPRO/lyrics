		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My earrings cost a half a ticket, I don't hear the same shit y'all niggas hear
On God

Pockets on Cheez-Its, heavy on the cheddar (cheddar)
Run off with your money, Savage a.k.a. Jerry Heller (Heller)
Too much drip, I'm rainin', bought a Gucci umbrella (umbrella)
Why you always trippin' bitch? You must look up to Ella (Ella)
It's only the first night and she keep tryna snuggle (snuggle)
I slept on my back just so I ain't have to cuddle (cuddle)
Nothing 'bout me average, hit her with a Fendi rubber (straight up)
Feel like a magician, all these bitches that I juggle (straight up)
'Rari red, Bentley black
Got a Demon and a 'Cat
Check the stats, all facts
Rap made me a lot of racks
Down bad, caught a flat
Change his tire, he got jacked
Ass fat, waist snatched
Can I get some of that pussycat?

1.5 (1.5), on the ride (on the ride)
Niggas die (niggas die), when we slide (when we slide)
Draw the line (draw the line), pick a side (pick a side)
Ain't no switchin' (ain't no switchin'), on my guys (on the gang)
1.5 (1.5), on the ride (on the ride)
Niggas die (niggas die), when we slide (when we slide)
Draw the line (draw the line), pick a side (pick a side)
Ain't no switchin' (ain't no switchin'), on my guys (on the gang)

(Offset!) I'm such a vibe (vibes)
The doors go up, suicides (suicides)
The diamonds poke your eyes (eyes)
Don't tread my gang, they shiest (gang)
I don't take advice (nah)
I don't care 'bout price
Sticks, the boss don't fight (brrt)
Flippin' bricks in the loft at night (bricks)
Told her "Get what you want, I swipe" (hey)
Hoppin' in the Lambo', brains open (skrr)
My chain soakin', Codeine in my vein, I'm strokin' (Codeine)
I put her head in motion (baow)
This Patek right here a trophy (Patek)
Passed out on the Hermes sofa (hey)
Straight face, this a game of poker (game)
The green Lambo' a ogre (skrr)
We pass the bitch (bitch)
Got to flippin' the bitch in the Ritz
Just ask your bitch (ask her)
I fuck, no kiss (smash)
Walked right in this bitch, don't touch me, don't get frisked
Let's get lit (lit)

1.5 (1.5), on the ride (on the ride)
Niggas die (niggas die), when we slide (when we slide)
Draw the line (draw the line), pick a side (pick a side)
Ain't no switchin' (ain't no switchin'), on my guys (on the gang)
1.5 (1.5), on the ride (on the ride)
Niggas die (niggas die), when we slide (when we slide)
Draw the line (draw the line), pick a side (pick a side)
Ain't no switchin' (ain't no switchin'), on my guys (on the gang)
