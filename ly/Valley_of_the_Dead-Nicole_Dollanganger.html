		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The ghosts of the palliative care ward
Have been following me
Whispering through the clear plastic lining
Over their dead bodies
Their diapers and their feces still
On the hospital sheets they're dead
But they're still up walking around
And they say to me, "Death is pretty sweet"

We're in the valley of the dead
Cremated bodies in the air
And the rotten ones underneath
Where we harvest the food we eat
I'm not scared of death because
Death's all over me

I've been spending my time hanging
Out in hospital wards
Bringing flowers and love letters
To my quadriplegic baby
The ache of his colostomy bag
And his blood transfusions
His medication makes him so sleepy
But he still whispers to me
"Death is pretty sweet"

We're in the valley of the dead
Bodies turn to liquid in the heat
The particles crawl into our pores
And they soak into our wooden floors
I'm not scared of death because
Death's all over me
I'm not scared of death because
Death's all over me
