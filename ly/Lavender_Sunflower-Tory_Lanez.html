		  Sexy lady
What would you do
If this goes right, girl
If everythin' goes how we planned it to?
Sexy lady
What would you do
If I was rubbin' my hand on you?
Would it make you amused?

You electrify my body (electrify my body)
Specify, I'm horny (specify, I'm horny)
Baby, yes, tonight we're goin' (yes, tonight we're goin')
Come and sexify my heart (woo)

What are you waitin' for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (baby)
What are you waitin' for?
'Cause maybe her lovin' me this much won't do (won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (don't wanna hurt her soul)

Tell me
What would you do
If everything felt right when she dimmed the lights?
I bet you would what she tells you to
Oh, now sexy lady, uh
What would you want to do
If I laid my cards, left my girl
And stay with you?

You electrify my body (electrify my body)
Specify, I'm horny (specify, I'm horny)
Baby, yes, tonight we're goin' (yes, tonight we're goin')
Come and sexify my heart (woo)

What are you waitin' for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (baby)
What are you waitin' for?
'Cause maybe her lovin' me this much won't do (won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (don't wanna hurt her soul)

What are you waitin' for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (baby)
What are you waitin' for?
'Cause maybe her lovin' me this much won't do (won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (don't wanna hurt her soul)
