		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe in
Breathe out
Bae I wanna see you, keep the lights on
Just look in my eyes, don't look away
If you want it I could give it to you right now
Breathe in
Breathe out
I know what you like, fuck your lights out
Good girl, know I love it when you look back
Know you getting real close, won't slow down
Yeah we maintaining the pace
Birthday suit, my face in the cake
On top of me, she riding away
Knew she a freak, got beads on her waist
Eyes roll back when she reaching the summit
Going real deep, push down on your stomach
All about you, this real queen loving
Thought you was done, but the waves keep coming
Maxed out legs way them thangs gon' shake
My baby got back, but this shit gon' break
We can talk through it while I pull on your braids
Baby look at my face, it'll be ok just
Breathe in
Breathe out
Bae I wanna see you, keep the lights on
Just look in my eyes, don't look away
If you want it I could give it to you right now
Breathe in
Breathe out
I know what you like, fuck your lights out
Good girl, know I love it when you look back
Know you getting real close, won't slow down
Stay obsessed, she coming right back
Not one ex got you cumming like that
Loving a drug, and we got it bad
Man its been a week and I got her
Itching, switching, twitching
Thoughts of you bending it clouding my vision
Do it herself, but she miss when I kiss it
If you ain't shaking I'm failing my mission, never
Baddest, ain't nobody better
Still got the scent of your flesh on my sweater
It's something special when we come together
Baby we fuck on a spiritual level, damn
Breathe in
Breathe out
Bae I wanna see you, keep the lights on
Just look in my eyes, don't look away
If you want it I could give it to you right now
Breathe in
Breathe out
I know what you like, fuck your lights out
Good girl, know I love it when you look back
Know you getting real close, won't slow down
