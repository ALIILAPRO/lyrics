		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you feel it?
Feel it in the air
Can you see it?
See it in the sky
Baby, it's our love
Baby, it's our love

Can you feel it?
Feel it in your heart
Can you see it?
See it in the stars
It says

You got what I need
And I got what you need
Baby, it's our love

Our love, baby, it's our love
(Baby, it's our love)
Our love, baby, it's our love

Can you feel it?
Feel it in the ground
Can you hear it?
Hear it all around
It says

You got what I need
And I got what you need
Baby, it's our love

Our love, baby, it's our love
(Baby, it's our love)

Our love, baby, it's our love
(Baby, it's our love)

Our love, baby, it's our love
(Baby, it's our love)
