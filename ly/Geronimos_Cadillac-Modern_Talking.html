		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to share my dreams
Want to share with you
On the wings of love
Like dreamers do

Touch your heart
You're the queen of broken hearts
Oh we are daytime friends and nighttime fools
Want to play this game

You break the rules
Tears of love are frozen tears

Geronimo's Cadillac
Is making all girls turn mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac
Oh making all girls turn sad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag

Geronimo's Cadillac 
It's tossing oh in your head
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, it makes you mad

Geronimo's Cadillac
Oh baby I'll hold you back
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, it makes you sad

I'm looking through the eyes
The eyes of love
Made a fool of me, can't get enough
Touch my heart
Boulevard of broken dreams

Another time for love
Other place to be
Don't let him take your love
Your love from me
Tears of love are frozen tears

Geronimo's Cadillac
Is making all girls turn mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac
Oh making all girls turn sad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag

Geronimo's Cadillac 
It's tossing oh in your head
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, it makes you mad

Geronimo's Cadillac
Oh baby I'll hold you back
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, it makes you sad

Geronimo's Cadillac
Is making all girls turn mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
