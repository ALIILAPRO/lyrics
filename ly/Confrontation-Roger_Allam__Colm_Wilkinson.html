		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Valjean, at last, we see each other plain
M'sieur le maire, you'll wear a different chain

Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again
Listen to me, there is something I must do

This woman leaves behind a suffering child
There is none but me who can intercede
In mercy's name, three days are all I need

Then I'll return, I pledge my word
Then I'll return

You must think me mad
I've hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change
A man, such as you

Believe of me What you will (Men like me can never change)
There is a duty that I'm sworn to do (Men like me can never change)

No! (24601) You know nothing of my life)
All I did was steal some bread (My duty's to the law You have no rights Come with me, 24601
Now the wheel has turned around (You know nothing of the world You would sooner see me dead)
Jean Valjean is nothing now)

I am warning you, Javert (Dare you talk to me of crime)
I'm a stronger man by far (And the price you had to pay
There is power in me yet (Every man is born in sin)
Every man must choose his way (My race is not yet run!)
I am warning you, Javert (You know nothing of Javert)
There is nothing I won't dare I was born inside a jail
If I have to kill you here I was born with scum like you
I'll do what must be done! (I am from the gutter, too)

And this I swear to you tonight
There is no place for you to hide
Your child will live within my care
Wherever you may hide away
And I will raise her to the light	

I swear to you, I will be there
