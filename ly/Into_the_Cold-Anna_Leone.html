		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beg myself to free all of the thoughts clinging to me
I heard them in the crowd calling my name, mmm
They took me by the hand, showed me the line, strong in the sand
Held me, yeah held me so true, mmm

I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
I could've waded into the waves
I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind

Memories made from gold 
Out of the fire, into the cold
They whispered I was right to be alone, ooh

I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
I could've waded into the waves
I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind

I thought I knew, I knew your rules
You spoke of freedom and everything I'll lose
I could've left you, I could've left you
I could've left you somehow

I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
I could've waded into the waves
I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
I could've lost my mind
