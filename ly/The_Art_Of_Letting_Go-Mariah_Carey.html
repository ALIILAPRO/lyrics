		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm making a statement of my own opinion
Just a brief little reminder to help myself remember
I no longer live in your dominion, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh-ooh
You're just trifling, nothing more than a liability
Got up and laid all your possessions
Outside the kitchen window right now

Letting go, letting go ain't easy (ooh)
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know
Is flinging your world around
And they watch, as you're falling down, down, down
Falling down, baby

Evidently your words were merely lies
Reverberating in my ears
And the echo won't subside
There's a deep, deep loss of hope
And the anger burns in me
I hope you don't get no ideas 'bout reuniting, baby
'Cause that's the last thing I truly need
Your audacity is too much to be believed, so
Go to MiMi on your contacts, press delete

Letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know
Is flinging your world around
And they watch, as you're falling down, down
Down, down

Maybe letting go, baby letting go
Ain't easy, ain't easy
Baby letting go, baby letting go (whoa, whoa)
Ain't easy, ain't easy (no)

Baby letting go, it ain't easy (oh)
'Cause somebody you used to know
Is flinging your world around
And you know what? (What?)
They watch as you're falling, as you're falling
Down
Fall
It ain't easy, baby
