		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Behold the realm of eternal darkness 
The void among the stars 
This immortal kingdom 
A shrine to wasting power 
A monolith abandoned 
To the aeons 

Behold the ancient ones 
Bound by their weakness 
They squander dominion 
Their reign in decline 

I watch from the shadows 
My hatred supreme 
I curse them in the forgotten tongue 
In the wake of legions past 

The light denied to the faceless ones 
My work of death to the last 
As i remain in isolation 
I will command the end of time 

They shall writhe in my wake 
They will cede to my rule 
For death is my faith 
I shall reign supreme 

Amongst these tortured wastes 
I hath endured an eternity 
The runes of my fathers 
Did yield their secrets to me 
The might of the fallen 
Hath now been revealed 

Behold the light of the burning sun 
Behold the antiqeous wakening 
Behold the usurper rise 
Behold the coming fire
