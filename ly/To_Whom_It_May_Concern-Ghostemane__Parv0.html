		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I broke the law in Madrid
And I'd do it again
I got a bitch in every city that I ever been
I thought the money would do something for the sadness in
Me but I'm deeper in the abyss than I have ever been
I've got 2 million other tracks, that all sound like this
So this flow is for the kids, that all miss that shit
But really I could give a fuck, when anybody miss
I'm too chaotic and the music gon' regret that shit

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it, oh
I always promised I would never rap about a narcotic
I'll keep my promise, but know that I'm still being honest
The help I need ain't coming
Now I'm pushing a button, to self destruct me
And no, I don't wanna talk about it
I'll never take you up on your offer to try to help me out of it
It's just a matter of time, until I rest my eyes
Go to sleep, and never come out of it

(This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run)
(I'm not sorry)
This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run
I'm not sorry
You can't get too close to me
You can't get too close to me
You can't get too close to me
I'll never be the "me" in your dream
I'm not sorry
(This is the end for me)
(This is the end for me)

This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run
I'm not sorry
You can't get too close to me
I'll never be the "me" in your dream
I'm not sorry
This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run
I'm not sorry
You can't get too close to me (yeah)
You can't get too close to me
