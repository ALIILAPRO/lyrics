		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger 

I can feel your body, yeah
It's in your eyes I see you want it
You crave it, you need it, yeah
So come get it, I've got it, yeah

Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger

'Cause I've been waiting all night
I don't need something right
And I feel like pulling you in
You don't need another one
I'll be everything you'll ever want
Ever want

Don't need a heart tonight
Just want our body moving side to side
Don't think about it, boy, just move for me
Move for me, move for me

(Kiss me like a stranger)
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
(Kiss me like a stranger)
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavor
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
