		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh
(Got the beat by powers and we just made a banger)

ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch, we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
All a nigga got is fam 'cause I don't got a friend
This ain't Silence of the Lambs, you ain't wearin' my skin
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, yeah, we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
They'll never stand tall, they'll never be gone
Back in Hell with the dawgs, singin' war songs

Drowning in the gases from a war, scared to admit we lost
Drowning with a president who really should of took a loss
I frown at society, hope atom bomb just take us all
I frown at society, hope atom bomb just take us all

My access to oblivion, I kill reptilian
I power up, Nathan Fillion, homie, six million
I'm feelin' this, building a cult, killing my enemies as a result
You a bitch, your mom a bitch, your mom's a ho, and I'm killing you all

ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch, we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
All a nigga got is fam 'cause I don't got a friend
This ain't Silence of the Lambs, you ain't wearin' my skin
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, yeah, we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
They'll never stand tall, they'll never be gone
Back in Hell with the dawgs, singin' war songs

La-di da, pocket full of cream, call it HÃ¤agen-Dazs
With the, sauce I can make an atheist go, "Oh my God"
Lactose, you ain't making bread so now you lack toast
Brag, boast, most people say I'm an asshole
Cash rules everything around me, but niggas want the clout now
You say you with the shits 'til a nigga air you out now
Air a nigga out and hit 'em with the click, clack, baow
Nigga, you's a bitch, your white tee is a night gown

ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, bitch, we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
All a nigga got is fam 'cause I don't got a friend
This ain't Silence of the Lambs, you ain't wearin' my skin
ZXLTRXN and ZillaKami, yeah, we back on again
I'm just chillin' with my dawg, that be my evil twin
They'll never stand tall, they'll never be gone
Back in Hell with the dawgs, singin' war songs
