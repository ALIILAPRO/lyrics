		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know why I do this every time
Driving to your place this late at night
You're my oxygen when I'm this high
This high

No one takes me down
Spins my world around
Like you do, like you do
Every time you call
I pick up and fall
Back to you, back to you

Crazy how your love's got a hold on me
Try to say goodbye, but I just can't leave
Never seem to find the velocity
To set my body free
Space is what I need
But I can't fight your gravity
But I can't fight your gravity

I can feel the weight inside my bones
Pulling on my heart when I'm alone
Grounds me like a force I've always known
Always known

No one takes me down
Spins my world around
Like you do, like you do
Every time you call
I pick up and fall
Back to you, back to you

Crazy how your love's gotta hold on me
Try to say goodbye but I just can't leave
Never seem to find the velocity
To set my body free
Space is what I need
But I can't fight your gravity
But I can't fight your gravity

Woo, ooh
