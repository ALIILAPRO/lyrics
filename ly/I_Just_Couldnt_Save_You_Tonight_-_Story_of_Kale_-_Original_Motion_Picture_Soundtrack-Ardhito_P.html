		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living with something that I couldn't see
And somehow fade internally
If you came a long way to get to know me
Or maybe it just meant to be?

Come here, I just found a new recipe
The flower, the bricks and the sea
My intuition says you will like me
And I don't know where should I be

And maybe you wanna be a star?
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight

Falling in love is a new world for me
Do you wanna be my company?
From thousand of miles you will like gettin' here
No need no anniversary

And maybe you wanna be a star
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight

And maybe you wanna be a star
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight

And maybe you wanna be a star
It may seem you wanna be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight
I just couldn't save you tonight

And I just couldn't save you tonight
