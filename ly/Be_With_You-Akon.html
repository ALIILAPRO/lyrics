		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know they wanna come and separate us but they can't do us nothin
You're the one I want and I'm a continue lovin'
'Cause you're considered wifey and I'm considered husband
And I'm a always be there for you

Either way you look at it I ain't goin' no where from my muffin
'Cause she gonna hold it down, cant no body tell her nothin'
You got the kind of love that always make up after fussin'
And that's what gets me closer to you

And no one knows (no one knows)
Why I'm into you (why I'm into you)
'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes (in our shoes)
And no one know (no one knows)
The things we've been through (things we been through)
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through (put you through)
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you

Seems like every day that go by things are gettin' harder
Want to be the one that give you the whole enchilada
'Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada
You ain't got to match with the shoes
All about knowing your woman and doing things to keep her longer
Stickin' together forever, watch it grow stronger
That's the way it has to be, everything proper
Keepin' it always true

And no one knows (no one knows)
Why I'm into you (why I'm into you)
'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes (in our shoes)
And no one know (no one knows)
The things we've been through (things we been through)
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through (put you through)
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you

You are everything in my life, see the joy you bring
And ain't no one I can compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me, no matter what
And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
