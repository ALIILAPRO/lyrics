		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's crazy how they love you
Then they hate you
Then they love you again

I'm the one that made me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your love made me cold and heartless, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pressure made my diamonds flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't let nobody change me
Won't let nobody claim me
'Cause I'm the one that made me

Yeah, I'm the one that made me
Drop float, then I make the girls go crazy (Go)
And I'm so on my own wave, could you blame me? (Nope)
Speaking on my name in the press 'cause he ain't me (Damn)
You could do it too, lil' homie, ain't gotta hate me (Nah)
Money made me do it, I'm watching for where the snakes be (Yeah)
Lotta folk turned they back, it was my dream
Pain made me love the hate that you gave me (Damn)
Amen (Amen), hundred thousand when the day end (Day end)
I feel like Floyd, hit my money dance (Money dance)
I'm buy matching ice for all my friends (Friends)
My mama need a new Benz (Benz)
Young boy, never goin' broke again ('Gain)
I feel like Khaled now, all I do is win (Win)
I know my role when I play it like a champion (Swish)
A lot of boys throwin' shots, it don't phase him

I'm the one that made me, yeah, yeah, yeah (I'm the one)
Your love made me cold and heartless, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Made me cold and heartless, yeah)
Pressure made my diamonds flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah
(All this ice I got, woah)
Can't let nobody change me
Won't let nobody claim me
'Cause I'm the one that made me

Yeah, my life is on amazing
My life, don't take for granted
I'm far from a beginner (Yeah)
We celebrate, doin' dinner
She love that I'm independent
I love she independent
Respect them type of women (Respect)
Champagne (Champagne), on the jet take away the pain (That pain)
Went from no-name (Name), now they know my name (Know my name)
We was ghost, bae (Ghost, bae)
We was both way (Both way)
Back on the charts
I know you missing me (You miss me)

If I could choose love or success
I would choose you over death
If I could do it all over again
I would chose next

'Cause I'm the one that made me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your love made me cold and heartless, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Made me cold and heartless, yeah)
Pressure made my diamonds flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah
(All this ice I got, woah)
Can't let nobody change me
Won't let nobody claim me
'Cause I'm the one that made me

I'm the one that made me, yeah
I'm the one that made me
No, I won't let it change me
Yeah, I'm the one that made me
