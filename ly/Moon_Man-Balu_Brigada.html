		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Shakin' hands with the crowd, actin' like a politician
Yeah, I was talkin' to the girl with the candy-colored lipstick
I circle back around the room hopin' nobody would notice
But they noticed
Well, I've been orbitin' your love, goin' circles in a spaceship

Spendin' up all my time just thinkin'
How can I keep my world from spinnin'?
I cannot come back down until I do

So I'll be your man on the moon (ah-ah, ah-ah)
I'll be your moon on the moon (ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah)
If I can't get closer to you (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Can I be your man?

I tried to make it back down, but I couldn't stick the landing, yeah
Why these guys wanna talk?
They speak another language
Don't understand it

Spendin' up all my time just thinkin'
How can I keep my world from spinnin'?
I cannot come back down until I do
So I'll be your man on the moon (ah-ah, ah-ah)
I'll be your moon on the moon (ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah)
If I can't get closer to you (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Can I be your man on the moon? (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Your man)

I cannot keep myself from spinnin'
I cannot keep myself from spinnin'
I cannot keep myself from spinnin'
I cannot keep myself from spinnin'
I cannot keep myself from spinnin'
I cannot keep myself from spinnin'
I cannot keep myself from spinnin'

So I'll be your man on the moon (ah-ah, ah-ah)
I'll be your moon on the moon (ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah)
If I can't get closer to you (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Can I be your man on the moon? (Ah-ah, ah-ah, your man)
