		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come down to the other land
The way they move through all your heat
They never will understand
That you were always
My do or die

That you were always
My do or die

Come down to the other land
The way they move through all your heat
They never will understand
That you were always
My do or die

My do or die
Oh-oh
My do or die

That you were always
My do or die
