		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Intro:
Hop in the whip, you want a
You want a, yea yea
You want a, yea
Yea

Verse 01:
Hop in the whip, you want a good time,
We don't need to talk about it, she don't wanna kill time,
He didn't ever give you loving but you wanna feel mine,
I can't give you what you want but baby it'll feel nice (Woah) 

Pre-Chorus 01:
Bear in mind,
I know you're just one drive,
Your signals on my line,
I want to see you, 
See you 

Chorus 01:
With you on my mind,
I can barely breathe,
Know you're just a drive,
I've got an empty seat for you,
Yeah oh oh,
Yeah oh

With you on my mind,
I can barely breathe,
Know you're just a drive,
I've got an empty seat for you,
Yeah oh oh,
Yeah oh

Verse 02:
They don't ever gotta know about it what we doing as friends.
You just keep it in the room cause I don't usually do this often but with you it depends,
With you it depends who's breaking the silence,
Hit up my phone looking violent,
You just want something that's vibrant yeah yeah

Now you're asking if I'm down in your ends,
You hit it right on the head thats a hundred percent
Out in your ends yeah
Tunnel vision, gotta go when I move I advance 
Out in the moment, take me there I wanna drown in the ocean 
Out in the open, take you there I gotta see you in motion 

Pre-Chorus 02:
Bear in mind,
I know you're just one drive,
Your signals on my line,
I want to see you,
See you 

Chorus 02:
With you on my mind,
I can barely breathe,
Know you're just a drive,
I've got an empty seat for you,
Yeah oh oh,
Yeah oh

With you on my mind,
I can barely breathe,
Know you're just a drive,
I've got an empty seat for you,
Yeah oh oh,
Yeah oh
