		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Thursday night, sun's going down
It's what you feel when you light up this town
The skies will open, stars will shine bright
We won't forget what happens tonight

I'll go left, you'll go right, we will meet in the end
I'm electric tonight 'cause I feel it again
We won't stop 'til we're there and my feet hit the ground
We're cheering tonight and we're loving the sound

We could light the night up, woah, woah
We could light the night up, woah-oh-oh
We could light the night up, woah, woah
We could light the night up, woah-oh-oh

Oh, oh (light up the night)
Oh, oh (light up the night)
Oh, oh (light up the night)
Oh, oh

I'll go left, you'll go right, we will meet in the end
I'm electric tonight 'cause I feel it again
We won't stop 'til we're there and my feet hit the ground
We're cheering tonight and we're loving the sound

Oh-oh, oh-oh
It's in the air, it's in the air
It's in the air, it's in the air, woo
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
It's in the air

Oh, oh
Oh, oh (woah)
Oh, oh (woo)
Oh, oh (oh-woah-oh)

I'll go left, you'll go right, we will meet in the end
I'm electric tonight 'cause I feel it again
We won't stop 'til we're there and my feet hit the ground
We're cheering tonight and we're loving the sound

We could light the night up, woah, woah (light up the night)
We could light the night up, woah-oh-oh (light up the night)
We could light the night up, woah, woah (light up the night)
We could light the night up, woah-oh-oh (woah)
We could light the night up, woah, woah (woah, woah)
We could light the night up, woah-oh-oh (woah, woah)
We could light the night up, woah, woah (woah)
We could light the night up, woah-oh-oh (woah)
