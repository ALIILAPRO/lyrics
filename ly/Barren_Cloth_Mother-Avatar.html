		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Barren cloth mother
A life lost to starvation
I'm a creature bred to grant the wisdom of his suffering

Barren dead landscape
Retreated mind, stagnation
I'm a restless ghost inside a sick and nameless, dying child

Nameless evil, songs so sad
I make up names I've might have had

Lifelike conception
The clockwork heart's illusion
My own Hades, lies
My unseen world, my misery

Lifelike contraption
I'm forced to make decisions
I am tortured, torn and choose the delusion
I have chosen death

Nameless evil, songs so sad
I make up names I've might have had
She's eyeless
She's breathless
I'm losing myself to rage

For if we all shall be equal in death
You too must suffer
Suffer and know we hate you

Nameless evil, songs so sad
I make up names I've might have had
She's eyeless
She's breathless
I'm losing myself to rage

Suffer and know we hate you
