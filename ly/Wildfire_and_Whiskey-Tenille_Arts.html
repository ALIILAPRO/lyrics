		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot summer night, hand in mine
You're looking so right, it's dangerous
Don't know if I can trust myself

With those blue eyes and the moonlight
Shining so bright 
Out on the edge of town
This spot only you and me know about

Dancing to an old truck radio
In a wide open field where we're alone
Got my heart feeling like a sparkle in the dark
When you kiss me

Drunk off your lips, yeah they're making me go
Crazy for you baby and I'm losing control
It's spreading fast and every sip is hitting me
Like wildfire, wildfire and whiskey

When you feel that there's no going back
Already lit the match
We gotta burn it down
So keep spinnin' me 'round and around and around

Dancing to an old truck radio
In a wide open field where we're alone
Got my heart feeling like a sparkle in the dark
When you kiss me

Drunk off your lips, yeah, they're making me go
Crazy for you baby and I'm losing control
It's spreading fast and every sip is hitting me
Like wildfire, wildfire and whiskey

Tomorrow we could be ashes on the ground
We did too much, too fast
Feeling like hanging around, right now

We're dancing to an old truck radio
In a wide open field where we're all alone
Got my heart feeling like a sparkle in the dark
When you kiss me

Drunk off your lips, yeah they're making me go
Crazy for you baby and I'm losing control
It's spreading fast and every sip is hitting me
Like wildfire, wildfire and whiskey
When you kiss me

Like wildfire and whiskey
