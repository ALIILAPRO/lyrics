		  (Rise 'n Shine)

Love is blind, but she don't love no broke niggas
I'm the kinda guy she want
Not the kinda guy you need
'Cause I'll be outside in the morning
This kinda loving toxic
Money be the only thing I need
But you're the kinda girl I want
Still spoil you with Givenchy
Love is blind, but she don't fuck with broke niggas

Light feels like a savior when you're in the dark
Drugs like a speaker, I can hear your heart
Unpaid bills all on the table
But you feel like a million on the dance floor
We sway to the tune of the paper
Only money make you change behavior
Have you sittin' on clouds when we date, ah
Ah-ah

She want my love, she try get me with a spell (ah)
She wanted paradise now she going through hell (ah)
There's repercussion tryna get a niggas like me like that
The spiritual baths send them bonds right back (I'm mad)
You wanted love, would've given it for free
Now it's guaranteed, mentally enslaved with me (that's dark)
Shoulda known it that from start
Now all I can do is love you from a far (toxic love)

Go faster, the way you moving
Slow motion, the way you grooving
Ecstasy got me moving
It gets messy in heaven
Loving you is like walking through hell
I dey for skreet, I hope I excel
If I dey for you, only time will tell

Love is blind, but she don't love no broke niggas
I'm the kinda guy she want
Not the kinda guy you need
'Cause I'll be outside in the morning
This kinda loving toxic
Money be the only thing I need
But you're the kinda girl I want
Still spoil you with Givenchy
Love is blind, but she don't fuck with broke niggas

Padlock heels just to let her know it's real
Only when I hold you, I know how you really feel
I don't say it much but you already know the deal
But you know you really give a angry nigga chills
She said, she said, "Wettin pon my head", I said, "Owo eyo"
She said, "Loving wey I give it ain't enough", she said

She want a man that, uh
She want a man with some money, uh
And when I'm broke, I feel lonely
Don't say you love me just for conversation
Because with me there's only elevation
You know I don't like complications
When I stress I need medication
Girl, don't put me on hold, just hold me

Love is blind, but she don't love no broke niggas
I'm the kinda guy she want
Not the kinda guy you need
'Cause I'll be outside in the morning
This kinda loving toxic
Money be the only thing I need
But you're the kinda girl I want
Still spoil you with Givenchy
Love is blind, but she don't fuck with broke niggas

The kinda guy she want
Not the kinda guy you need
'Cause I'll be outside in the morning
This kinda loving toxic
I need
The kinda girl I want
Givenchy
But she don't fuck with broke niggas
