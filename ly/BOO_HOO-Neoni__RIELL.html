		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tag you're it
Here we go again
You're such a hypocrite
When you start a fire and hide the matches
Been down that rabbit hole
Swore I would never go
Back to back to bad habits
I'm through
Around and around we go
Sick of the vertigo
Abracadabra screw you
White lies
Red eyes
I've had enough
Fake nice
Surprise
I've had enough
White lies
Red eyes
I've had enough
Fake nice
Surprise
Boohoo
You don't like me well that's good for you
Boohoo
Say you're over it well that makes two
Throw your pity pity pity party
Bring your friends but you got nobody
You you don't like me
I don't like you
Boohoo
Boohoo
Hide and seek
Don't play with me
Let's cause a scene
Cause I'm so done with your pretending
Our bridge is falling down
I burned it to the ground
Done with bad habits
I'm through
Cry crocodile tears
But like them I disappear
Abracadabra screw you
White lies
Red eyes
I've had enough
Fake nice
Surprise
Boohoo
You don't like me well that's good for you
Boohoo
Say you're over it well that makes two
Throw your pity pity pity party
Bring your friends but you got nobody
You you don't like me
I don't like you
Boohoo
Boohoo
Boohoo
Boohoo
You you don't like me
I don't like you
Boohoo
Boohoo
Boohoo
Boohoo
