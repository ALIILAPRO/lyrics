		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn it up and shake the ground
Tell me what's on your mind
Come on now don't be shy
This is the perfect time
This is the perfect time
Okay we found this empty house
It's the sirens, call 'em out
Get the homies round 'em out
Get loud

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I'mma keep it
Yeah there is nothing to high
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight

Break it down, it's alright
Bring it out to the light
Breathing it out, stepping it out, yeah
Let the music free your mind, your mind
Yeah, okay we found this empty house
It's the sirens, call 'em out
Get the homies round 'em out
Get loud

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I'mma keep it
Yeah there is nothing to high
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight

You are not alone
I'm your safety zone
You are not alone
Don't need to hide what you can't control
I'm your safety zone, safety zone, safety zone

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I will keep it
Yeah there is nothing to high
Tell me all your secrets tonight

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I'mma keep it
Yeah there is nothing to high
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me, tell me, tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me, tell me, tell me all your secrets tonight, tell me all your secrets tonight...
