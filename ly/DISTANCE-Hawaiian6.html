		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the distance
from your heart to you?
Silence, it whispers in my ear.
There are some questions
in my pocket.
There is soundless rain.
Globe. Universe.
A spiral of life.
All the time
people born and die.
A ring drawn by a soul.
The natural providence.
I am wrapped in a dirty blanket.
And I know my own size.
Wipe my tears all I can do
and pour my coffee.
The night brings me loneliness.
The season brings me madness.
I hide in my closet
and wait the sun.
The T.V. said that
no one can live this life alone.
But I know that
everyone is born alone
and they also must die alone.

The night brings me loneliness.
The season brings me madness.
I hide in my closet
and wait the sun.
The T.V. said that
no one can live this life alone.
But I know that
everyone is born alone
and they also must die alone.
I'm sick of it, but again
today the darkness will come.
The same hand that wipe my tears
now holds a knife to my wrist.
The red tears which flow
from my wound.
Tears of farewell.
In the pure white world
and from my pain.
A small voice says
you are never alone.
My heart is right here.
What's the distance
from your heart to you?
