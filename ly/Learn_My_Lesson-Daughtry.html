		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight the sunset means so much
The one thing that you know you'll never touch
Like the feeling, the real thing
I reach out for the sweet dream
But somehow the darkness wakes me up

And I've felt this emptiness before (I've felt this emptiness before)
But all the times that I've been broken
I still run right back for more

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
That if you strike the match
You're bound to feel the flame

You think that I'd learn the cost of love
Paid that price long enough
But still I drive myself right through the pain
Yeah, well it turns out I haven't learned a thing

Sometimes I think I'm better off
To turn out the lights and close up shop
And give up the longing, believing in belonging
Just hold down my head and take the loss

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
That if you strike the match
You're bound to feel the flame

You'd think that I'd learn the cost of love
Paid that price long enough
But still I drive myself right through the pain
Yeah, well it turns out I haven't learned a thing

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
That if you strike that match
You're bound to feel the flame

You'd think that I'd learn the cost of love
Paid that price long enough
But still I drive myself right through the pain
(Still I drive myself right through the pain)
Yeah, well it turns out I haven't learned a thing

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
I haven't learned a thing
I haven't learned, I haven't learned
I haven't learned a thing
