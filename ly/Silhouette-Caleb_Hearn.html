		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hoodies still stained from your perfume
Should've thrown it out, but I really didn't want to
Your silhouettes framed on the wall of my bedroom

I see you moved on
And it hurts that it's not how I thought you would leave
But you're gone now
I wish you never would've walked out

'Cause now I'm staring at this mirror
That we both used to know
Back when this felt like forever, oh no

Just break me
You promised me safety
When all I knew was chaos
You told me you'd be there
Break me
I was dumb to think you
Would ever love the same
I guess I was a fool
'Cause you left me right here
When you said you'd be there

And I don't sit at home 'cause I know when I'm there
All I think about is the time that you were with me
Do you ever even miss me?
Maybe I should try to realize
That there's not you and I
And forget about our pastime
Should've known before we flat lined

'Cause now I'm staring at this mirror
That we both used to know
Back when this felt like forever, oh no

Just break me
You promised me safety
When all I knew was chaos
You told me you'd be there
Break me
I was dumb to think you
Would ever love the same
I guess I was a fool
'Cause you left me right here
When you said you'd be there

Windows where I go
I see you on every wall in my home, yeah
Can't sleep in my room
'Cause I still see you in all the shadows

Break me
You promised me safety
When all I knew was chaos
You told me you'd be there
