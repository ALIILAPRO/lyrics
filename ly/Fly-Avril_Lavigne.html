		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a light inside of all of us
It's never hiding, you just have to light it
It's the one thing that you gotta trust
It's like a diamond, you just have to find it
So if you ever feel like giving up
Yeah, just remember that

We were all meant to fly
Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to
It's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon you'll find that
It's your time to fly
Your time to fly

A little help is all it ever takes
Somebody has to tell you it's worth fighting
A single step becomes a leap of faith
That's when you realize you started flying
So don't you ever say you're giving up
No, there's no looking back

'Cause we were all meant to fly
Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to
It's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon you'll find that
It's your time to fly
It's your time to fly

Just reach up
Don't give up
Until you've touched the sky
Just reach up
Don't give up
Until you've realized

That we were all meant to fly
Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to
It's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon you'll find that
It's your time to fly, fly
It's your time to
It's your time to shine, shine
Soon you'll find that
It's your time to fly, fly
(Spread your wings across the universe)
It's your time to
It's your time to shine, shine
(There's a light inside of all of us)
Soon you'll find that
It's your time to fly
