		  Yeah
It's Barbie and it's Kim Petras (woo, ah)

I've been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?
I just want you here by my side
I don't wanna be here, baby, on my own
Yeah, don't you wait, don't think about it
Yeah, don't you wait, just come on over now
I've been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?

Ooh, look at me
Like what you see
I've been feeling lonely, baby, you got what I need
Gimme what I like
Tryna, uh, tonight
Got an appetite that only you can satisfy (satisfy)
I could ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it all night
Watch me ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it all night
Wanna feel the rush
Wanna feel your touch
Don't talk your talk unless you're gonna back it up

If you want me, let me know
Tell me now, don't hesitate (hesitate)
You got one chance, baby, don't
Let the moment slip away, no

I've been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?
I just want you here by my side
I don't wanna be here, baby, on my own
Yeah, don't you wait, don't think about it
Yeah, don't you wait, just come on over now
I've been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?

Kimmie bad (bad), Nicki ready
Yes, we brag, we throw jabs
Bitch'll get dragged, we be like, "Gag", call her Kim Petty (Petty)
When I r-ride it, I ride it steady (steady)
Brand new Range, I just painted it Betty (Betty)
I set trends from Queens to Beijing ('jing)
I'm not the one that do the imitating ('ting)
Puff, puff, pass 'cause you know we blazing (blazing)
When I put it on him, he say, "It's amazing" ('mazing)
All this cake, he doing a tasting (tasting)
I send shots, get ready, they may sting (brrt)
It's Barbie and it's Kim Petras (oh)
Main character syndrome, they extras (okay)
W-w-we ain't answering questions (uh)
Click on a bitch 'fore she finish her sentence (sentence)

If you want me, let me know
Tell me now, don't hesitate (hesitate)
You got one chance, baby, don't
Let the moment slip away, (no) no

I've been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?
I just want you here by my side
I don't wanna be here, baby, on my own
Yeah, don't you wait, don't think about it
Yeah, don't you wait, just come on over now
I've been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?

Ah-ooh, whoa
