		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh huh huh
Oh yeah
Work, work

Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me
Baby
And now we're six months older
And everything you want and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me oh

Uh huh huh
Oh, oh
Uh huh huh
Doo doo doo
La la la la

Uh huh huh
Oh, oh
Uh huh huh
Doo doo doo
La la la la

Somebody tell me
Won't you tell me
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, show me you can take you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
One step further and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two?
Uh huh huh
Oh, oh
Uh huh huh
(Doo doo doo) I can't work any harder than I do
La la la la

Uh huh huh
Oh, oh
Uh huh huh
Doo doo doo
La la la la

Somebody tell me
Won't you tell me
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money
Oh

Oh
Why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God
I don't even think that I love you
Won't you tell me
Give you money
All to give you money, oh
La la la la

Uh huh huh
Oh, oh
Uh huh huh
Doo doo doo
La la la la

Somebody tell me
Won't you tell me
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money
Oh

Somebody tell me
Won't you tell me
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money, oh

Somebody tell me
Won't you tell me
Why I do the things that I do?
