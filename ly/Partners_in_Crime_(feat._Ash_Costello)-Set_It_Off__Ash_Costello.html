		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'll never takes us alive
We swore that death will do us part
They'll call our crimes a work of art
You'll never takes us alive
We'll live like spoiled royalty, lovers and partners
Partners in crime
Partners in crime

This, the tale of, reckless love
Living a life of crime on the run
I brush to a gun to paint these states 
Green and red
Everybody freeze
Nobody move
Put the money in the bag
Or we will shoot
Empty out the vault 
And me and my doll will be on our way
Our paper faces flood the streets
And if the heat comes close enough to burn 
Then we'll play with fire 'cause

You'll never takes us alive
We swore that death will do us part
They'll call our crimes a work of art
You'll never takes us alive
We'll live like spoiled royalty, lovers and partners
Partners in crime
Partners in crime

Here we find our omnipotent outlaws 
Fall behind the grind tonight
Left unaware that the lone store owner 
Won't go down without a fight
Where we gonna go
He's got us pinned
Baby I'm a little scared
Now, don't you quit
He's sounded the alarm
I hear the sirens closing in
Our paper faces flood the streets
And if the heat comes close enough to burn
Then we're burning this place to the ground 'cause

You'll never takes us alive
We swore that death will do us part
They'll call our crimes a work of art
You'll never takes us alive
We'll live like spoiled royalty, lovers and partners
Partners in crime

The skies are black with lead-filled rain
A morbid painting on display
This is the night the young love died
Buried at each others side
You never took us alive
We swore that death would do us part
So now we haunt you in the dark
You never took us alive
We live as ghosts among these streets
Lovers and partners
Partners in crime
Partners in crime
Partners in crime
