		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna make assumptions but it looks like from the picture you posted
That you're actually unhappy but you think that nobody can notice
And maybe it's all in my head and maybe it's just 'cause I know you so well
But you don't stop loving someone just 'cause it's over
And I just wanna say, are you okay?

Wish I could be the one that you call too much at 4 AM 'cause you can't stop crying
Drive you home when you get too drunk and you say you're fine but I know you're lying
Wish I could be the thing you need and I could come and save you like before
Oh, but that's not my job anymore

If I'm being honest I know that I made the right decision
It hurts letting go but it hurt more keeping that position
'Cause I gave it all to you when you asked me to but some things I can't fix
No, some things I can't fix

Wish I could be the one that you call too much at 4 AM 'cause you can't stop crying
Drive you home when you get too drunk and you say you're fine but I know you're lying
Wish I could be the thing you need and I could come and save you like before
Oh, but that's not my job anymore

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Wish I could be the one that you call too much at 4 AM 'cause you can't stop crying
Drive you home when you get too drunk and you say you're fine but I know you're lying
Wish I could be the thing you need and I could come and save you like before
But that's not my job anymore
