		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They talk about Lola this, Gator that (that's wild)
Say that (that's brazy)
Fuck out of here, nigga, eat ten (uh-huh)
You know my body
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe, Lo'
Talk about all this extra shit
Do it look like I give a fuck?
Matter fact, say less, you heard?
Fuck out of here
Gator, Gator, Gator

Give me that head (huh), provide the liqs (huh)
I got my own (Mm), I'm not convinced (nah)
I hear the talk (huh), the clout for fame (haha)
But nothin' get around a bitch from 'round the way (huh)

I can't be layin' up with no fucker, give this pussy to no sucker
Walk that dog, nigga, go and get your mother (get your mother)
I don't be playin' 'bout my brothers, can't run game without them numbers
I'm from the gutter, bitch, go and get your mother (go and get your mother)
Go and get your mother (go and get your mother)
Go and get your mother (bitch, go and get your mother)
Bitch, go and get your mother (go and get your mother)
I'm from the gutter, bitch, go and get your mother

I was always on go before the green light (skrr)
A bitch had glow before the ring light (uh-huh)
Dub a nigga more than once what it be like (huh)
Every nigga hurt to the chest, he'll be aight (ha)
Bitches out here frontin', doin' the same thing that Suki did (uh-uh-uh-uh)
This much is for the fellas, it ain't nothin' wrong with being coochie whip (mwah)
Wipe me down like Boosie did (he did)
Side eyein', like who this bitch? (bitch)
Don't act up for that act right, don't fool around with that movie shit (huh)
Don't walk around like I made it (uh-huh)
Could've put on for the town, but instead bitch, you baited (I know you hate it)
Niggas panickin' in their savings (huh)
You already countin' up counterfeit, lil' nigga, why would you fake it? (haha)

Give me that head (huh), provide the liqs (huh)
I got my own (Mm), I'm not convinced (nah)
I hear the talk (huh), the clout for fame (haha)
But nothin' get around a bitch from 'round the way (huh)

I can't be layin' up with no fucker, give this pussy to no sucker (Mwah)
Walk that dog, nigga, go and get your mother (get your mother)
I don't be playin' 'bout my brothers, can't run game without them numbers
I'm from the gutter, bitch, go and get your mother (go and get your mother)
Go and get your mother (go and get your mother)
Go and get your mother (bitch, go and get your mother)
Bitch, go and get your mother (go and get your mother)
I'm from the gutter, bitch, go and get your mother

Keep the guac' aside of me (uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Walk a dog nigga, Rottweiler, tug 'em out the street (uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Not your type, I'm out your league
Keep 'em busy on the V12, knock 'em out the V (skrr)
No, I ain't passin' out no na-na-na-na-na-na-na
And I passin' on no na-na-na, don't feel on my twat
And I'm a up it up by any means, I don't support crimes (grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
He said, "I don't know officer, but that shit ain't mine" (grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
I don't care about the he said, she said, we said
Don't condone bad behaviour, that bitch can't be fed (you know my body)
I don't care about the he said, she said, we said
Focus on the business, only reasons I ain't speak yet (haha)

Give me that head (huh), provide the liqs (huh)
I got my own (mm), I'm not convinced (nah)
I hear the talk (huh), the clout for fame (haha)
But nothin' get around a bitch from 'round the way (huh)

I can't be layin' up with no fucker, give this pussy to no sucker (mwah)
Walk that dog, nigga, go and get your mother (get your mother)
I don't be playin' 'bout my brothers, can't run game without them numbers
I'm from the gutter, bitch, go and get your mother
Go and get your mother
Go and get your mother
Go and get your mother
Bitch, go and get your mother
I'm from the gutter, bitch, go and get your mother
