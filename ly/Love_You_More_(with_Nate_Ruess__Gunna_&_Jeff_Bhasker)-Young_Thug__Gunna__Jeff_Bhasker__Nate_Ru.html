		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, I'm not tryin'
To be the last thing you see when you turn your light off
You're makin' me feel somethin'
But I know that it's wrong
Can't you see?
It's not who I wanna be, yeah

'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything
'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything

Hoping you call 'bout anything
I love when you call me about anything
I love how you don't doubt anything
Like I said, get anything
'Cause I love the way you call my phone
And textin' me, "Good morning"
Two shots of Patr√≥n, and we sexin' 'til the morning
Hate when you don't cum, you done told a nigga it's corny
Walking 'round with an attitude, oh, I'm supposed to be in a party
Girl, you know I love you, ain't disrespect whenever I'm tardy
Walking 'round with a shoppin' cart, we tearing down Barney's
Oh, girl, I want you badly

'Cause I love you more than anything (go 'head, oh, go 'head)
Oh, I love you more than anything (love you more than anything, anything)
'Cause I love you more than anything (oh yeah, oh, oh)
Oh, I love you more than anything (more than any, more than anything)

Don't ask about petty things
Don't have to beg, she get anything
I love her bad, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything (love you more than anything, anything)
'Cause I love you more than anything (oh yeah, oh, oh)
Oh, I love you more than anything (More than any, more than anything)

(Metro)
Oh, yes, I love you, how I do you
Put you up, I want more for you
Grab my heart, so I hold you close
I won't let go of you
You the definition of loyal, and I know it's true
I give my heart to you
Hope you know love lost 'cause I love you
