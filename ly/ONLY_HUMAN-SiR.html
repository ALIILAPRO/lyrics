		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In between Heaven and Cloud Nine
There we lie, her and I
Her kiss is soft as her eyes
There's nothin' to fight about in the sky

So why am I tryna pull this angel down from Heaven where she belongs?
I wish I could stay here forever but I gotta go back home
Someone else is out there missin' me while I look down from up above
And I know right here I would not be if she knew that I was

Only human
Less than perfect
See, this is right where I wanna be
But she deserves so much more than me
'Cause I'm only human

Back in the world I call my own
I'm always gone and she's alone
We live next to pain and misery
But she believes we're meant to be

I just can't find the words to tell her that the king she calls her own
Is out chasin' amazin' grace while she waits for him by his throne
Someone else is out there lovin' me while she wishes she could
I know she'd be so much better off if I just left her for good

But I'm human
Ohh, less than perfect
See, this is right where I wanna be
But she deserves so much more than me
'Cause I'm only human

Riskin' it all for a floating, fleeting feeling
Can't climb the wall with my energy depleting
Know what you'll say but the words ain't so appealing
Riskin' it all for a floating, fleeting feeling

If I don't move, I'll never heal
Open my heart, can't take the real pain
Can't avoid the choices I've made
But if I stay, if I stay, I would be

Riskin' it all for a floating, fleeting feeling
Can't climb the wall with my energy depleting
Know what you'll say but the words ain't so appealing
Riskin' it all for a floating, fleeting feeling
