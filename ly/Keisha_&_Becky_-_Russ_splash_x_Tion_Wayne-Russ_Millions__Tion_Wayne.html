		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Very sexy, Keisha, Becky
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm

Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that ass, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky

Russ with the rush and Tion Wayne
Do you love me? Or love the fame?
Hottest drill artist in the game
Pull up and bark it, let it rain
Excellent head on your neck with brain
Temperament's nuts right now, don't play
Mhm-mhm, drip, drip like my chain
Racked-Racked up cakey, not Paigey
You're crazy, don't get blazed (Bullet)
Pump man out with that pumper (Bow)
Cali weed, I love ganja (Love)
Oh my gosh, look at her bumper, bumper
'Course I left with her number ('Course)
Brown and leng, give her this thunder
That's your girl, she left with my jumper (Huh)
Hundred stabs, she screaming for mother

I ain't into verbal or beefin'
Or the internet talk or tweetin'
They love Snapchat, cams and speakin'
Me, I was knockin' at man on G-wing
Visit days in the field was a scary place
Nigga, T-Wayne was the reason
Even on that, I don't like conversation
Back then, chains they was confiscatin'
Go and check my light-skinned in Enfield
Check my dark-skinned ting in Tottenham
Pull up in a Range or the Merc, got options
Uptown, I don't see the opps often
But catch me in Central London
'Cah I love the finer things
Man, I love dem diamond things
I ain't going inside 'til my Niners in
We ain't going inside 'til line is in

Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that ass, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky

Peng-Peng-Peng-Peng ting from Bellingham (Bad)
No love, just suck this elephant (Suck it)
No wap, grip, splash, mans wettin' 'em (Wet)
Energy, got 'nuff adrenaline
Sweet one, pull up, pull up, what's good? (Pull up)
Make man sprint in his brand her boogs
We buy things that you wish you could
Man's getting paid if I'm in that shubs

Eediat boy, only chases puss'
Don't ride out when his boy get uhh
Cream of the crop, flex on the opps
Touch bust down and get touched with a uhh

Bad boy D, take my cucumber
That's your girl, come get your lover
She goes wild under these covers
Ratchet hoes, can't bring them to mother (Oh nah)

Very sexy, Keisha, Becky
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm

Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off (Uh)
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off (Boom)
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Boom, boom, Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that ass, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky

Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off (Uh)
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off (Boom)
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Boom, boom, Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that ass, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky
