		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no, here we go again
Fighting over what I said
I'm sorry
Yeah I'm sorry
Bad at love, no, I'm not good at this
But I can't say I'm innocent
Not hardly
But I'm sorry

And all my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I got it bad, baby
Got it bad

Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say?
(Ooh-ooh, oh, oh-ooh-ohh-ooh)
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

And I hope I never see the day
That you move on and be happy without me
Without me
Oh, what's my hand without your heart to hold?
I don't know what I'm living for
If I'm living 
Without you, ooh

All my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I've got it bad, baby
I got it bad

Oh, tell me you love me (ooh)
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say?
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
My heart's like
(Ooh-ooh, oh, oh-ooh-ohh-ooh)
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

Everything I need (ohh)
Is standing in front of me (ohh)
I know that we will be 
Alright, alright, yeah
Through the ups and downs (downs)
Baby, I'ma stick around (ohh)
I promise we will be 
Alright, alright

Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone 
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone (yeah, yeah)
On days like this, I do (days I like this)
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say?
(Ooh-ooh, oh, oh-ooh-ohh-ooh) heart my heart say, hear my heart say
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

(My heart's like)
Everything I need (ohh)
Is standing right in front of me (ohh)
I know that we will be alright, alright, yeah
