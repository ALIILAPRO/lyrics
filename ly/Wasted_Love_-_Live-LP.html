		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't want to love
I was happy on my own
I wish I never had a taste of your sweet song
I was rolling like the stone
Taking any road
There was something in the way you turned me on
All the pretty words you said fell through my fingers just like sand
Ever since that solid day you took my hand
Wasted love
Wasted love
Wasted all my time and all my love on you
When times were rough
You used me up
Wasted love on you
Did you ever really see?
Was it ever really me?

Why'd you keep me in a cage, you should've set me free
'Cause every single time you lie the light comes searing through my pride
And if you had a heart now I know it wasn't mine
Wasted love
Wasted love
Wasted all my time and love on you
When times were rough
You used me up
Wasted love on you

All along I knew something was not right
But I was hoping I could change your mind
Oh
All along no matter how I tried and tried
You kept taking, taking, taking every breath I had inside
Oh
Wasted love
Wasted love
Wasted all my time and all my love on you
When times were rough
You used me up
Wasted love
Wasted love
Wasted love
Wasted all my time and all my love on you
When times were rough
You used me up
Wasted love on you
Wasted all my love on you
Wasted all my love on you
