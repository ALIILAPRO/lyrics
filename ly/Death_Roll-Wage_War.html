		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Terrified in darkness
Another victim in its sight
So cold, so heartless
A hunger never satisfied

Eyes of death, mouth of hell
This wretched swamp we know so well

The hate that we hide
Crawls up from the depths
We gave you an inch
But you went for the neck

Take what you want, prey on the weak
We are the broken, we are the beast
Hunters of all, swallow you whole
Dragging you down in a death roll

Death roll

Condemned from birth
Underneath the dying sun
There can be no future here
When your instinct's "eat the young"

Hand in hand through the wasteland
We wave our final goodbye

Kill em all 'til there's nothing left
Kill em all 'til there's nothing left
Kill em all 'til there's nothing left
Cold blooded 'til the last breath

Take what you want, prey on the weak
We are the broken, we are the beast
Hunters of all, swallow you whole
Dragging you down in a death roll

Death roll
