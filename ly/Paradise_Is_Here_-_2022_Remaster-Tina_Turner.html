		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you want to live some, move out into the fast lane 
You say you need excitement to make you come alive 
Some place a million miles from the shadows that surround you 
I look for your attention, you're lost out in the future 
Where lovers ask no questions and shadows never fall 
Some pilgrim bound for paradise, no compromise 

But paradise is here, it's time to stop your crying 
A future is this moment and not some place out there 
Tonight I need your love, don't talk about tomorrow 

But right now, I need your loving 
Right now, give it to me 
Right now, I want your loving 
Right now, now, now, now, now 

You talk about your new plans to move on up the stairway 
You dream about the high life that's waiting for you there 
A world of fame and fortune that's just around the corner 
But I don't need no high life to make me feel a woman 
I don't need to reach for no castles in the sky 
Just put your arms around me, devour me 

'Cause paradise is here, it's time to stop your crying 
The future is this moment and not some place out there 
Tonight I need your love, don't talk about tomorrow 

But right now, I need your loving 
Right now, so give it to me 
Right now, uh, I want your loving 
Right now, ohh
I want your loving right now

Right now
Right now, ohh
So right now
Ohh, need your loving right now (don't say tomorrow)
Right now (to give me sorrow)
Right now (don't say tomorrow)
Right now (to give me sorrow)
Right now (don't say tomorrow)
Give it to me (to give me sorrow)
Right now (don't say tomorrow)
Right now (to give me sorrow)
Need your loving (don't say tomorrow)
Right now, ohh (to give me sorrow)
Right now (don't say tomorrow)
I want your loving right now, ohh (to give me sorrow)
(Don't say tomorrow)
