		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't 

I been looking at the stars tonight 
And I think, oh, how I miss that bright sun
I'll be a dreamer 'til the day I die 
But they say, oh, how the good die young
But we're all strange 
And maybe we don't wanna change 

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 
But the gun still rattles 
The gun still rattles, oh 
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 

I spent a lot of nights on the run 
And I think, oh, like I'm lost and can't be found
I'm just waiting for my day to come 
And I think, oh, I don't wanna let you down
'Cause something inside has changed 
And maybe we don't wanna stay the same 

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 
But the gun still rattles 
The gun still rattles, oh 
But the gun still rattles 
The gun still rattles, oh 

Oh, and I don't want a never-ending life 
I just wanna be alive while I'm here 
And I don't want a never-ending life 
I just wanna be alive while I'm here 
And I don't want to see another night 
Lost inside a lonely life while I'm here 

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go 
But the gun still rattles 
The gun still rattles, oh 
But the gun still rattles 
The gun still rattles, oh
