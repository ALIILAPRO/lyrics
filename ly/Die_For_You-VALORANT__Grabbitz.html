		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time slows down when it can get no worse
I can feel it running out on me
I don't want these to be my last words
All forgotten 'cause that's all they'll be

Now there's only one thing I can do
Fight until the end like I promised to
Wishing there was something left to lose
This could be the day I die for you

What do you see before it's over?
Blinding flashes getting closer
Wish that I had something left to lose
This could be the day I die for you
This could be the day I die for you

This could be the day I die for you
This could be the day

Everything I know, everything I hold tight
When to let it go, when to make 'em all fight
When I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind
When I gotta live, when I gotta die, gotta die
Everything I know, everything I hold tight
When to let it go, when to make 'em all fight
When I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind
When I gotta live, when I gotta die

This could be the day I die for you
Everything I know, everything I hold tight
When to let it go, when to make 'em all fight
When I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind (this could be the day)
When I gotta live, when I gotta die

Feeling like there's nothing I can do
This could be the end it's mine to choose
It's taken me my lifetime just to prove
This could be the day I die for you
Don't let it be the day

What do you see before it's over?
Blinding flashes getting closer
Sacrificing everything I knew
This could be the day I die for you

This could be the day I die for you
Everything I know, everything I hold tight
When to let it go, when to make 'em all fight
When I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind (don't let it be the day)
When I gotta live, when I gotta die
