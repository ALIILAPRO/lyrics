		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm anxious, kinda sad
Hard to be your best when you lost the best you had
Spending days just on my phone
Wondering where it all went wrong
I'm nervous , pretty wired
I said your name too much
Now my lungs got tired
Thinking maybe I'm to blame
I just need someone to hate

Oh, oh, oh, oh 
You made this so damn hard for me
You and your god damn honesty
It got me thinking

I wish you woulda cheated
And smashed my heart to pieces
I wish I had a reason I could hate your guts for leaving
I wish you were the villain
A psycho with no feelings
So how do I move on
When you did nothing wrong (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Wish you did something wrong (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
But you did nothing wrong 

Know it's messed up, kinda bad
But I wish we didn't talk and you just left like that
I'd be angry instead of numb
Dammit, who have I become

Oh, oh, oh, oh 
You made this so damn hard for me
You and your god damn honesty
It got me thinking

I wish you woulda cheated
And smashed my heart to pieces
I wish I had a reason I could hate your guts for leaving
I wish you were the villain
A psycho with no feelings
So how do I move on
When you did nothing wrong (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Wish you did something wrong (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
But you did nothing wrong 

In the middle of the night
I start to fantasize 
That you would ruin my whole life
Oh
'Cause you're the best I had
And I keep running back
Like a god damn fool tryna change your mind
You were all mine
Can't believe 

I wish you woulda cheated
And smashed my heart to pieces
I wish I had a reason I could hate your guts for leavin'
I wish you were the villain (oh-ooh-woah)
A psycho with no feelings (oh-oh)
So how do I move on (oh)
When you did nothin' wrong?
