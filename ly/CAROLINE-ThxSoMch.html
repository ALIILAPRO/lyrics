		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caroline, I'll take you to my cemetery
And I'll be fine, I'll work it
I'll work it out
Count your days
I'll roll myself my Mary Jane (ooh)
Caroline
We'll work it, we'll work it out

Listen out, I pray for every beating soul
I'll waste until I become flesh and bone
Hear me out, I'm one foot out the window pane
I've got to leave her, but in a klutzy easy way

Now I'm falling into your grace
I thought it all was good until I wrote my plans down
Never thought I'd feel heartbreak
Until I looked at you and then I held my hand out
Friends saying that I'm okay
But if I'm okay, I'm the same kid
Who would've thought that we'd be both fucking the same bitch?

Caroline, I'll take you to my cemetery
I'll be fine, I'll work it
I'll work it out
Count your days
I'll roll myself my Mary Jane (ooh)
Caroline
We'll work it, we'll work it out

Hey, I promise that when I'm gone
I'll still connect the dots
From hell I'll haunt you, goddamn
I'll take these words written in vein
Cover them up in lace
Diamonds that I'll engrave them

Now falling into your grace
I thought it all was good until I wrote my plans down
Never thought I'd feel heartbreak
Until I losing you and I held my hand out
Friends saying that I'm okay
But if I'm okay, I'm the same kid
Who would've thought that we'd both be fucking the same bitch?

Caroline, I'll take you to my cemetery
I'll be fine, I'll work it
I'll work it out
Count your days
I'll roll myself my Mary Jane (ooh)
Caroline
We'll work it, we'll work it out

(We'll work it, work it)

Caroline
We'll work it, we'll work it out
