		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all

It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
Rain on me
On me

Rain on me

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me

Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain

Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind

I can feel it on my skin
It's coming down on me
Teardrops on my face
Water like misery
Let it wash away my sins
It's coming down on me
Let it wash away

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me

Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain, rain
Rain

Hands up to the sky
I'll be your galaxy, I'm about to fly
Rain on me, tsunami
Hands up to the sky
I'll be your galaxy, I'm about to fly
Rain on me

Rain on me

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me

Rain on me
