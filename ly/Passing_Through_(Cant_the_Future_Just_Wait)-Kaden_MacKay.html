		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't the future just wait?
Can't the deadlines come fashionably late?
I could push every goal back
Take control back
If they'd roll back the rate
At which time starts to fly
Never landing or standing by
Never taking a break
Ever making me retry
We "nickel-and-dime" every "quarter to two"
But maybe it's time to let time pass through
If the future is bright
It doesn't shine with that "end of the tunnel" light
More like a deer in the headlights
Sudden red lights
Or "you're dead" lights
As the anglerfish bite
It's not fair
The past is clear but it's clear back there
What's ahead? No one knows
But it's closing in, we swear
Still not in my prime, I have so much to do
But maybe it's time to let time pass through
I can't just rewrite decisions when life gets strange
Should I go with my gut on which door I should shut?
I'm unsure
I'd keep exploring this rut
But what good is time without change?
Move on
'Cause things never last
Just move on
'Cause it goes too fast and the past has passed
So move on
No one likes an ending
So what's with the attention we keep on giving them?
Why are we still spending so much time
Dreading our lives instead of living them?
Why do we try to divert the river
When the water is what will deliver us where we need to go?
We may never know why
Time is always in limited supply
But we'll live to regret it
If we get it
And then let it slip by
It can never rewind
Once you've lost it, it's hard to find
Take the journey in stride
When your plans have been sidelined
Every hourly chime could begin something new
So maybe it's time to let time pass through
Not passing by, but passing through
'Til the well runs dry
Just passing through
