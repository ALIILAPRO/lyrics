		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You coming around
But you act so cold
So cold, so cold
You show them wrong
'Cause you just say no
No no, no no
You torture me
But I just won't scream
I'm dead inside
Even in my dreams

You're fucking with my head
Yeah, yeah
You're fucking with my head
You're fucking with my
Fucking with my head
Yeah, yeah
You're fucking with my head
You're fucking with my
We're fucking with my head
We're fucking with my head

You don't know why
I just wanna be alone
No no, no no
Ask you nicely
But you won't go
Won't go home
You scream in my ear
But can't hear a thing
Oh, I take you down
But you just won't hate

You're fucking with my head
Yeah, yeah
You're fucking with my head
You're fucking with my
We're fucking with my head
Yeah, yeah
You're fucking with my head
You're fucking with my
We're fucking with my head

Stop
You're fucking with my head
Yeah, yeah
You're fucking with my head
You're fucking with my
We're fucking with my head
Yeah, yeah
You're fucking with my head
You're fucking with my
We're fucking with my head
You're fucking with my head
We're fucking with me
Fucking with me
Fucking with me
Fuck you
