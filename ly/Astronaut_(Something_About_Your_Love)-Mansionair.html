		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow down, stepping up my game
Tied to you, try not sink on through the cracks
And maybe I could forget this town
And maybe I should get out

Oh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it, oh?
There's something about your love
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Right now, I'm feeling like a astronaut
I fade into the thought of coming back to you
And maybe I should forget this town
Then maybe I could get out
 
Oh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it, oh?
There's something about your love
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Oh
There's something about your love
Can you feel it, oh?
There's something about your love
Can you feel it?
