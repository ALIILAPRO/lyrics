		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no way to say this song's about someone else
Every time you're not in my arms
I start to lose myself
Someone please pass me my shades
Don't let 'em see me down
You have taken over my days
So tonight I'm going out

Yet I'm feeling like
There is no better place than right by your side
I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind

La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
When you are gone I think of you

All these places packed with people
But your face is all I see
And the music's way too loud
But your voice won't let me be
So many pretty girls around
They're just dressing to impress
But the thought of you alone has got me sweating
I don't know what to say next

I'm feeling like
There is no better place than right by your side
I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind

La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
When you are gone I think of you

La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
When you are gone I think of you

I'll pretend the night is so beautiful
Take a photo with the bros
La da dee
La da da doo
They won't see through my disguise
Right here behind my eyes
Replaying in my mind
La dee da yeah

I'm feeling like
There is no better place than right by your side
I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind

La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
When you are gone I think of you

La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
There's only me
There's only you
La da dee
La da dee doo
La da dee me
La da dee you
La da dee
La da dee doo
When you are gone I think of you
