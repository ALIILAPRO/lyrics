		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're a ship without a storm
Cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness lit at peace

We're a laugh without a tear
Hope without the fear
We are coming home

We're off to the witch 
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime

We're all born upon the cross 
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself but the only way is down

We don't come alone
We are fire we are stone
We're the hand that writes and quickly moves away 

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line

Two eyes from the east 
It's the angel of the beast
And the answer lies between all good and bad

We search for the truth 
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase is worth the pain 

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line yeah
We're the last in line oh

Yeah 

We're off to the witch 
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime

We're all born upon the cross 
You know, we're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself but the only way is down

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line oh
We're the last in line 

See how we shine

We're the last in
We're the last in line
We're a ship without a storm
We're cold inside the warm
We're the last without a tear
We're the throw without the meal
We're the last in line
See how we shine
We're the last in line
