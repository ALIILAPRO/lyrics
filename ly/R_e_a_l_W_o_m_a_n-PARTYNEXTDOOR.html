		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now, I'm with a model that's taller than me (hey)
The way she lookin', she been eatin' whole wheat (hey)
I checked her bookin', she been busy for a week (hey)
She and her girls, I ain't even gotta creep (huh)
Do what she want (want), yeah (yeah)
Everything she ever wanted
Give me just what I want, yeah (what I want)
That's the type, that's the type of girl I'd make my wifey (yeah)
That's the type
That's the type of girl I'd give the chains and the cherry-red GLE (chains and a cherry red bling)
That's the type
That's the type of bitch I'd tell her friend that he can't do it like me (me)
I'm so proud of her (I'm so proud)
She make me real proud of her (I'm so proud)
And the bitch so pricey, yeah (ooh)

I spent mills on her (on her, I spent mills)
And I put trends on her (on her, and I put the trends on her)
Think you're my real woman (woman, this is my real woman)
Hollywood Berry ain't got nothin' on her (on her)
She can't wait to hear ain't got nothin' on her 
I'm droppin' some dead prez as a bonus
I'm lockin' it in till the very end

Shawty met a boss like me and put a hundred down on condo dowtown with me
Shawty is experienced, put a period when we drunk drivin' that Bentley
Last night, we were sippin' Henny and now we doin' deals
Tomorrow, we'll be hungover and hangin' here, baby (baby)
Huh, life is good, the worst is over now (now, yeah, yeah)
I bet, love ain't never made more sense than right now (now, yeah, yeah)
Okay, it's 4 am and now I'm 'bout to turn these lights down
But first I'm 'bout to tell you how I'm proud
Hey, now watch how (oh, yeah)

I spent mills on you (oh yeah, on you)
And I put trends on you (on her, and I put the trends on you)
Girl, you're my real woman (oh yeah, yeah, woman, this is my real woman)
Hollywood Berry ain't got nothin' on her (on her, woah)
She can't wait to hear ain't got nothin' on her (on her, nothin' on, yeah, woah)
I'm droppin' some dead prez as a bonus (I'm some dead)
I'm lockin' it in till the- (till the very end)

I'm turnin' up
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm turnin' up
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm turnin' up
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
