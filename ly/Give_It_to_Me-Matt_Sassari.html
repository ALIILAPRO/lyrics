		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See us in the club
See us in the club
See us in the club
See us in the club
See us in the club
We'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor
You'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Ah

Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-i-a way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

See us on the floor
We acting real nice
If you see us on the floor
You'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling? I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air"
Air, air, air, air, air, air, we missed you
Oh (damn, improve)
Oh (damn, improve)
Oh (damn, improve)
Oh (damn, improve)
Oh (damn, improve)
Oh (damn, improve)
Oh (damn, improve)
Oh (damn, improve)
