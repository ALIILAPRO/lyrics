		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

It's the love you save for the way I know we've been apart
It's an endless circle of poison arrow to my heart

Singin' I, I love what you do to me, need you to stay with me
I, I love you too much to let go

How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

It's a constant thought of my baby taking up my time
It's a non-stop vision of you that's playing on my mind

Singin' I, I love what you do to me, need you to stay with me
I, I love you too much to let go

How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

When you call my name
When you call my name
Say my name baby
When you call my name

When you call my name
Say my name baby
