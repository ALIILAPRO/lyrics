		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fire it up, fire it up
Fire it up

Born to raise hell since I lost my heaven
Couldn't find nine, kid, I'm on cloud seven
Cherry top lover with a chemical metal
Heater on high like a pot on kettle
Jukebox gospel, raise it up another level
Young street apostles with their hallelujah peddles
Preachers in the bleachers, keep on dancin' with the devil
Swingin' with the king like an Elvis made of velvet

Bring the big beat back
Bring the big beat back, whoa
Let me see your light, spark the dynamite
Here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
You gotta fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
Blaze on

Nuclear radio, kiss the devastation
Cradle to the stadium, burnin' on the pavement
Fishin' for religion, on a mission salvation
History's the soundtrack, wake your generation

Bring the big beat back
Bring the big beat back, whoa
Let me see your light, spark the dynamite
Here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
You gotta fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til the damage is done
Blaze on

Hi-hi-higher, hi-hi-higher
Hi-hi-higher, woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hi-hi-higher, hi-hi-higher
Hi-hi-higher

Let me see your light, spark the dynamite
Here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til the damage is done
Blaze on

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til you get what you want
You gotta fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
'Til the damage is done
Blaze on
Blaze on
Blaze on
