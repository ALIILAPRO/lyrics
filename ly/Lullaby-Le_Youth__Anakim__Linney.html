		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Floating
Falling into who you are
We’re still searching for the spark
What’s that feeling?

Golden
Find it glowing in the dark
Let the colors shape the scars
What’s that feeling?

Can we just lay here?
Take me back to younger years
Running wild without our fears
When it was easy 

Can we just stay here?
Drift into another time
Hearts colliding with the sky
Can you feel it 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby 

Can you feel it 
Can you feel it 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby 

Whispers
Hear the whispers of the wind
Find them underneath your skin
Where they hiding?

Listen 
When we’re dreaming open wide 
Don’t forget those starry eyes
Live in wonder 

Can we just lay here?
Take me back to younger years
Running wild without our fears
When it was easy 

Can we just stay here?
Drift into another time
Hearts colliding with the sky
Can you feel it 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby 

Can you feel it 
Can you feel it 
Can you feel it 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby 

Can you feel it 
Let’s get lost in a lullaby
