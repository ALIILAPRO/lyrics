		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought you'd go away
Did not believe the things you'd say
Now you're gone
I don't understand why you'd leave for some distant land
Could you ever feel the same
I'm calling out your name
I still feel the pain

Crying, crying for your love
I'm crying, crying for your love

Still I look all over for you
There's nothing left that I can do, yeah babe
You're on the streets
You know it's wrong
It's not where a woman belongs
Better run while you can
I'm calling out your name
I still feel the pain

Crying, crying for your love
I'm crying, crying for your love

Why'd you lead me to the door
Can I see you anymore

Crying, crying for your love
I'm crying, crying for your love
