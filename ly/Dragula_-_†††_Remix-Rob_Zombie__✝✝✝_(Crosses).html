		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Superstition, fear, and jealousy)

Dead I am the one, exterminating son
Slipping through the trees, strangling the breeze
Dead I am the sky, watching angels cry
While they slowly turn, conquering the worm

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Dead I am the pool, spreading from the fool
Weak and what you need, nowhere as you bleed
Dead I am the rat, feast upon the cat
Tender is the fur, dying as you purr

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Do it baby, do it baby
Do it baby, do it baby
(And burn like an animal)

Dead I am the life, dig into the skin
Knuckle crack the bone, twenty-one to win
Dead I am the dog, "Hound of Hell", you cry
Devil on your back, I can never die

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Do it baby, do it baby
Do it baby, do it baby
(And burn like an animal)

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Dig through the ditches
And burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula!
