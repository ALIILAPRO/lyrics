		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found a cure
Ooh, for your heartache
Before you wake
Before you wake

Don't take no medicine
Take a little of this
It worked for me
And it can't miss

Found a cure, oh, try it
It's by far better than
Any kind of medicine
'Cause it'll take
Away the tears

And that ain't all you get
Whatever it is
Love will fix it

Found a cure
Found a cure
Found a

Ooh, for loneliness
I promise this
I promise this
For all your hopes and
All your empty dreams
Coming at you
Is a sure thing

Found a cure, oh, try it
It's by far better than
Any kind of medicine
'Cause it'll take
Away the pain

And here's the big surprise
Whenever it rains
You'll have blue skies

Found a cure, telling you
Found a cure, found a cure

Ooh, love will fix it
Ooh, love will fix it
Ooh, love will fix it
Ooh, love will fix it

Found a cure, oh, try it
It's by far better than
Any kind of medicine

'Cause it'll take
Away the tears
And that ain't all you get
Whatever it is
Love will fix it

Found a cure, telling you
Found a cure, right away now
Found a

Ooh, love will fix it
Found a cure
Gonna be good
Good, good to to you

Ooh, love will fix it
Found a cure
Fix it alright

Ooh, love will fix it
Ooh, love will fix it
Found a cure
Ooh, love will fix it.
