		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply

Trust
Trust who?
Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Ah, trust who?
Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
I'll take it
Just tell me it can't be that crazy
And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oh, (just) save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things
That I do believe, but I don't even
Want you to get in my mind
I'm supposed to be in your mind (whoa)
For the first time in a long time
(For the first time in a long)
First time in the longest time

First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply

Yeah 
(Now, oh, baby) ayy
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Trust
Trust who?

Trust me and I can set you free
Left your man, came straight to me
You the real MVP, my love
Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, my love
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? (Love)

I've given you enough time
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Hurtin' deeply, deeply

Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
How many times did I ask about this, on God?
Why you let me find out like this, on God?
Houston, we got a problem, my dawg
All my niggas love you, got us all involved
Ain't no goin' back to how we started off
No, no, no, no
