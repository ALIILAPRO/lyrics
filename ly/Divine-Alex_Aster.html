		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make my life divine

Take me out and spin me like gold (you know how I get as the night goes)
Tell me lies like we'll never get old
It's the kind of night
You'll regret when you're alone
Write me in the stories we're told

Take a look at my mind
You'll see I love you, love you, love you every time
Just a piece of paradise
Gonna last me, last me, last me for my whole life

You make my life divine
Just by being mine
You make my life divine
Just by being mine

I don't need my dreams to come true (if they don't, if they do, if they do)
I just want to dream them next to you
Take me far away
Can you take me far away?
Hold me like the sky holds the moon

Take a look at my mind
You'll see I love you, love you, love you every time
Just a piece of paradise
Gonna last me, last me, last me for my whole life

You make my life divine
Just by being mine
You make my life divine
Just by being mine

You're out this world and I'm out of my mind
Birkins and pearls won't hold me at night
I don't want another me
I know how crazy I can be
Keep the baubles and bottles of the sparkling wine
I can be heavenly if you just let me be
You say we're fine, but what does that mean?
They say cash is king but I say love is queen

Take a look at my mind
You'll see I love you, love you, love you every time
Just a piece of paradise
You make my life divine

You make my life divine
Just by being mine
You make my life divine
Just by being mine
Just by being mine
