		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're born to fly
So let's keep living 'til it all falls down
Let's close our eyes
And let the moment drive the whole world out

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you

Waving colored flags
We won't surrender, there's no standing down
There's a playing field
It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you

In this together
Woah, woah
Oooooh

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
