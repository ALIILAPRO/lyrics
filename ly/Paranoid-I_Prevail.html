		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something isn't right
I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around it follows me home
I think I'm paranoid

Something isn't right
I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around it follows me home
And I get so stressed out
With nobody here to listen
When my head gets loud
From the weight of this vision

All this emptiness inside
I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die
Wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head?
I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head?
I think I'm paranoid, I think I'm paranoid
(I think I'm paranoid)

Is it all in my head?
(I can't escape the noise)
Is it all in my head?
(I think I'm paranoid)
Take me to the edge
Like hands around my neck
Hangin by a thread again
(I think I'm paranoid)

Something isn't right
Think they start to notice
Hear it in the night
In and out of focus
And I get so stressed out
With nobody here to listen
Got a head full of doubt
From the weight of this vision

All this emptiness inside
I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die
Wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head?
I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head?
I think I'm paranoid, I think I'm paranoid
(I think I'm paranoid)

Is it all in my head?
(I can't escape the noise)
Is it all in my head?
(I think I'm paranoid)
Take me to the edge
Like hands around my neck
Hangin by a thread again
(I think I'm paranoid)

All this emptiness inside
I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die
Wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head?
I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head?
I think I'm paranoid
