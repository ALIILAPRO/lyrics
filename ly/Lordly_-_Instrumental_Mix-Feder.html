		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And once we run the show everyone will know
That we will be the ones that hold the highest truth
And once we run the show everyone will know
That we will be the ones that hold the highest truth

I'm from that game, strong on my face
I tell 'em don't go, we love, we love, that's my place
There's nothing to it, I, I just do it
Nothing but love under the sun

And once we run the show everyone will know
That we will be the ones that hold the highest truth
And once we run the show everyone will know
That we will be the ones that hold the highest truth

There lies a kingdom in my heart
A reign of light that lights up the dark
When I stand to it, I, I just do it
Nothing but love under the sun

And once we run the show everyone will know
That we will be the ones that hold the highest truth
And once we run the show everyone will know
That we will be the ones that hold the highest truth
