		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah

Put that shit on like AB, ballin' on them like KD
I'ma need me a straitjacket, "Why?" 'Cause I'm goin' crazy
She wanna be my Queen Bey, want me to be her JAY-Z
Bitch asked me for a Jeep, told her, "This Maybelline, bitch, that's maybe"
"So, when you goin' to the top?" Lil' bro said, "Take me"
I used to be on the block, boy, but I don't know no Tay Keith
Somebody come pour me out, bitch, I'm in this shit waist deep
Your hundred thou' to my hundred thou', used to put fives on eighthy
The car I'm in is an eight-speed, hope the cops don't chase me
Middle fingers to the law, bitch, I'll never let 'em break me
Postin' another nigga bands, nigga, you can't even pay me
Told the bitch I don't want her pussy, the bitch proceeded to rape me
How I taste? Shit, I taste sweet
Shit around here ain't sweet
Fuck 'em niggas, man, they sweet
Pussy-ass niggas, gay sweet
Put me in a Kanye suite
Havin' drip like an AC
Havin' drip like a leak
My style ain't free, you gotta pay me
Maybach Mercedes
Bitch, I named her Sadie
Better turn on the PlayStation, bitch cannot play me
Auntie caught me prayin', 10K to my auntie
I'm like, "Auntie, you raised me," but she like, "Nah, you ain't gotta pay me"

Put some respect on my name like Baby
Chief Keef (bang), play with the ki', Zaytiggy (Ziggy)
Doin' all that talkin', SayCheese (talk, but she like, "Nah, you ain't gotta pay me)
Bitch say she wanna be a city girl, so JT, JT
Bitch say she wanna be a city girl, so JT, JT
JT, JT (yeah)
JT, JT (yeah)
Put some respect on my name like Baby (woo)
Bitch, I'm the Huncho, pay me (Huncho)
Bang, bang, huh, Chief Keef (bang)
Play with the ki', Zaytiggy (Ziggy)
Doin' all that talkin', SayCheese (talkin')
Bitch say she wanna be a city girl, so I'ma call her JT (JT)
Can't save a ho, you can't make me (nah)

Steppin', two feet (step)
I told that bitch to scrub the ground, she thought she was goin' to Freaknik (scrub)
Ever since my bro The Rocket took off, I been too geeked (Rocket)
Brrp, now my crew geeked (brrp)
Get tactical with my technique (tactical)
You wanna kick it? Call Messi (go)
You wanna kick it? Call Ronaldo
I got narcotics and Narcos (Narcos)
White diamonds, Jack Harlow (white)
Remember trappin' in my cargos (trap)
Now it's pounds in the cargo (cargo)
Walkin' out of Wells Fargo (walk)
I'll spin with my twin, Charlo (spin)
So you know I'ma crash, GEICO (crash)
Put me next to Elon (Elon)
I'm high steppin' like Deion (woo)
My heart froze so cold, nigga, I'm on the shelf with Freon (ice)
What you doin' in my section? (Huh?), we don't know this peon
Your bitch lookin' so sexy (bitch), I'm tryna see what she on (she on)
Maybach, call it Quaybach (Quaybach)
Never trap where I stay at (nah)
Niggas thought I couldn't make it (huh?) 
Just like Diddy, told 'em take that (take that)
I'm breakin' shit, Kit-Kat (break it)
Somebody tell me where the lick at (where?)
Then pop a pill, Tic-Tac (pill)
You not alone, where your strap at? (Graow)

Where your strap at? (Graow)
Where your strap at? (Graow)
Maybach, call it Quaybach
My heart froze so cold, nigga, I'm on the shelf with freon

Bro finna appeal
They ain't got shit, keep it real
Pussy, we don't fuck with you, we never did and never will
Brodie put up three seals
Know I had to seal the deal
Watch what you be postin' on that Reel, real get you killed
Hellcat doin' tricks, more tricks than a seal
Broke-ass nigga kill his mama just to inherit her Will
Wrap the Range Rover teal, banana Hellcat peel
'Bout the bills they killl, I'm pullin' up with my ills
Ain't from the H, but I'm trill, I was trill up in the field
You not smokin' gas, that's ill, Chief So be smokin' that kill
Sip codeine when I'm ill, she wanna touch me, see if I'm real
She told me we gettin' married, I said, "Get the fuck out of here"
I call the shots 'round here, you could play, not 'round here
Got a diamond up in my ear, this bitch bigger than my ear
Bitch, I'ma send you a car, your ass'll never drive here
Yeah, Chief So drive spaceships, but that shit'll never fly here
