		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They think I'm the one that can bridge the gap, huh
I came to L.A to work, but first, where the bitches at?
They're tellin' me TAO or The Highlight Room
If you wanna go through, you gotta bring the strap (okay)
No way could I trust these hoes (yeah)
I'm taking their phone if we bring them back
I don't wanna get done, like, nah (come on)
They don't understand, I'm giving them U.K. slang
My brudda, my fam', my akh
You say "The feds just done a sweep", we say "The boy dem run in my gaf"
You say "On God, no cap", we say "Swear on your life, don't gass"
You say "Spin the block", we say "Jump out and slide and crash"
You call it "machine", we call it a "mash"
Strip club and they're shakin' ass
But in my words, they're shakin' nyash
We don't trap in abandoned buildings
Shots get hit out of vacant flats
In other words, "apartments", hidden compartments get detached
Free all the members that got bagged
You say "What's up?" We say "Wah gwan?"
Got shotguns from a farm
We don't eat pork, we say "It's haram"
You call her "shawty", we call her "jawn"
Sexy gyal and we call them "leng"
Back then we would call them "peng"
Bare words that we got for guns
Like "waps" and "skengs"
You call them "Js", we call them "cats"
There's not much crystal meth
My hood's got junkies hooked on crack (woo)
Flick knives, we call them "nanks"
Zombie killers, we call them "ZKs"
Rambo knife by the name of "Ramz"
We say "cash, Ps, racks, Gs", we don't really call them "bands"
In L.A, it's Escalades, in the ends, it's Mercedes Vans
Watch my back, I'm paranoid
That's what I mean when I say that I'm "prang"
Clench my fist and I fist bump man
Anti-social, I don't shake much hands, huh
Well, it depends, you say "the trenches", we say "the ends"
You say "y'all", we say "you lot"
You say "restroom", we say "toilet"
We do have guns but they might be-
So man pull it apart and oil it
If a man violate, say "a man boyed it"
Live Yours ain't a gang, can't join it
We both whip crack the same, we fill up the Pyrex pot and boil it
In London, I'm verified, in N.Y, I'm valid (mmh)
Twelve hours away, I'm M.I.A
I can pull up on DJ Khaled
It's only an hour away from the ends, that's why I spend time in Paris
If I pull up on Saturday night
I ain't come here to talk, this ain't Jimmy Fallon (ah, yeah)
I just pulled up with a chick, bro said that he hit, I'm a bit embarrassed, huh
All she's gettin' is dick and Chick-Fil-A, we ain't eatin' salmon
I might hit one time and vanish, I got unlimited funds on the Amex
One day I'm on the block in London, next day, I'm chillin' in the sun on a hammock, huh
Controversy sells, I said "How can I be homophobic, my bitch is gay"
And it flew off the shelf
Thinkin' "Should I go with a label or stay independent and do it myself?"
Sat down with a boss and said "I ain't signed, but, bro, I ain't new to deals," uh
Stood outside of the night club, try make the trap line kick like Flight Club
All of my drip from Rodeo Drive, ain't none of this shit from China, uh
I don't want Nobu, I need me a yard food, so I'm in Inglewood
Dawg dem-
My dawg dem serve like Wimbledon
My dawg dem smart like Beethoven
I'm from where the Jack Boys active
Fam, don't sleep with your window open
Hoes gon' line man up and get a commission
Back shot give a gyal whip lash
Hit that, impact like a collision
I don't care if I'm givin' the lo'
Tell Rubi Rose that I'm in the Edition

(Hahaha)(uh)
(Okay)
(That boy, man, West London is in here, man)
(Central Cee, touched LA Leakers, baby)
(You know what it is, man, Central Cee, new song, "Doja")
