		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no money, there's no possessions
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession

I just want to be heard, loud and clear are my words
Coming from within man, tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution, in your heart and in your mind
You can find a conclusion, lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin' but a life-long lesson
And your pocketbook stressin'
You're a slave to the system, the jobs that you hate 
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinkin' about yourself, start thinking' about

There's no money, there's no possession
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit

'Cause everything is nothing
And emptiness isn't everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out, it's a big black hole
Take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never gonna fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possession
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit

Money, possession, obsession

Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair and clock in
You just can't win, you just can't win
And the things you own, own you
No

Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Fuck your money, fuck your possessions
Fuck your obsession, I don't need that shit
Money, possession, obsession
I don't need that shit
