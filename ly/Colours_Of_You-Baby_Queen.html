		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I speak in grey to match the shade on the inside of my brain
I decay when my tongue touches the edges of your name
White lies are colored by context
And oh my God, I've lost my innocence

I can't believe what you've done to me
Can't you see that I'm on my knees?
You look at me and the darkness leaves
And suddenly

I'm covered in the colors of you, ooh
Every single hue, ooh
Of purple and blue, ooh
Covered in the colors of you, ooh

You've changed my life into something I no longer recognize
And stained my eyes, now they paint in watercolor when they cry
I used to see the world in black and white
Now I, I

I'm covered in the colors of you, ooh
Every single hue, ooh
Of purple and blue, ooh
Covered in the colors of you, ooh

Red, orange, yellow, green, blue
Purple, pink, and indigo too
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue
Purple, pink, and indigo too
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue

Red, orange, yellow, green, blue

I'm covered in the colors of you, ooh
Every single hue, ooh
Of purple and blue, ooh
Covered in the colors of you, ooh
