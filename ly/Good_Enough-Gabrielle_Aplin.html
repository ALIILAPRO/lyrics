		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me how I can be good enough
I wanna be easy and open like you
The way that you navigate is effortless
The way that you talk and the way that you move
I love how you dance around your issues like they're just
Fickle and light shining, guiding you through
Wish I was more like you

When I hit the wall, I can't get around
You always see it in a way I can't see
You tell me it's there for me to lean on
I'm there on your plans, just to rest out with me
I love how you rise above the water, I wanna
In dangerous swim I'll wade a little too deep
You're all I see

'Cause you're more than just someone
After all I've said and done, I know you do
I just wanna be good enough for you
Good enough for you

On Saturday night, when you came around
You danced on the table to your favorite tune
And just as I thought you were coming down
You pulled me up and I was one with you
You take me to places that I'm too scared to go to
Miles away in the same old room
How'd you do what you do?

'Cause you're more than just someone
After all I've said and done, I know you do
I just wanna be good enough for you
Good enough for you
Good enough for you
Good enough for you

'Cause you're more than just someone
After all I've said and done, I know you do
I just wanna be good enough for you
