Reckless with your love
You, just, give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You, just, give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love
You, just, give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You, just, give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

I'm talking to myself like I used to do
The touch of someone else
Always gets to you
There's something in you eyes
Baby, I can tell it too
Ooh, you're just a stranger in the room

Better know what to say
Gotta know what to do
I can't feel a thing with you
Baby, I can't feel a thing
Can't feel the same as I used to do
Living a lie, never been true
But I get stronger everyday
While you're

Reckless with your love
You, just, give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You, just, give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love
You, just, give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You, just, give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Living in a void, a vice in ecstasy
Building up a wealth of animosity
Always in disguise
There's nothing left of you
Ooh, you're just a stranger in the room

Better know what to say
Gotta know what to do
I can't feel a thing with you
Baby I can't feel a thing
Can't feel the same I used to do
Living a lie, never been true
But I get stronger everyday
While you're

Reckless with your love
You, just, give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You, just, give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love
You, just, give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You, just, give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Reckless with your love
You, just, give it up
Fearless with your life
Reckless with your love
You, just, give it away
Fearless with your life

Ooh
You reckless 
Oh, with your love
Ooh
You reckless 
Oh, with your love

Ooh
You fearless
Oh, with your love
Ooh
You reckless
Oh, with your love
