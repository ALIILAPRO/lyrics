		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of the ruins 
Out from the wreckage 
Can't make the same mistake this time 

We are the children 
The last generation (the last generation)
We are the ones they left behind 

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change, change 
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains 

We don't need another hero 
We don't need to know the way home 
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome 

Looking for something 
We can rely on 
There's got to be something better out there 

Mm, love and compassion 
Their day is coming (coming)
All else are castles built in the air 

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change, change 
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains 

All the children say 

We don't need another hero 
We don't need to know the way home 
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome 

So what do we do with our lives?
We leave only a mark 
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark?
Is it all or nothing? 

We don't need another hero (hero)
We don't need to know the way home 
All we want is life beyond Thunderdome 

All the children say 

We don't need another hero (we don't need another hero)
We don't need to know the way home 
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
