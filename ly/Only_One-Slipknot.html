		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pain, made to order
Pain, made to order
Pain, made to order
Pain

I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave
Better get an army 'cause the fire left me unscathed
You bet your bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around 'cause I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the achtung, get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself, are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me totalitarian
The one and only motherfucker, top of the world man

'Cause I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels, what you gonna do?

All I hear is human noise
You made your own fuckin' choice
I belong to only me
Silence for my revelry

I can only die over time
Filthy hands, stay away from mine
Every reason is a right to hate
Painful clutch, death is fine, give me mine

Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away

Somebody explain this
You don't care 'cause you don't exist
What the fuck is this another joke? Reckoning

Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away (walks away)
Only one of us walks away (walks away)
Only one of us walks away (walks away)
Only one of us walks away (walks away)
