		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinking of
All the time that we spent when we used to be such close friends
Isn't it funny how crazy that life can get?
We live, laugh, love, every day until we forget
About each other and all the things we never did
I made promises that I wish I could've kept
Never knew what I had until the day that you left
I know you're out there somewhere
Wondering if I still care
Now we've grown apart and I hope you're doing well
Handling your depart, was the hardest thing I've felt
All the things we did that I will never tell
You'll always be in my heart, I hope you're doing well
I saw a meme the other day
And I pictured the smile on your face
All the inside jokes, the laughs, the plans we had, can never be replaced
Hate to think that we both have moved on
Especially since you've been so withdrawn
I've been also trying, but can't, accept the fact that what we had is gone
Wishing that I could go back
For a minute, and just hear you laugh
And if you're out there somewhere
I promise that I still care
Now we've grown apart and I hope you're doing well
Handling your depart, was the hardest thing I've felt
All the things we did that I will never tell
You'll always be in my heart, I hope you're doing well
I hope
I hope that you're well
I hope
I hope that you're well
