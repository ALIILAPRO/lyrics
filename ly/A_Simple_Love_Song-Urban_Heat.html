		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I heard the newsman say the world was ending
so I walked across town to where you stay
and on my way I picked a flower.
I was going to give it to you,
but before I could get there
it burst into flames.

I just want to write you a simple love song
but the world keeps falling apart.

So I took your hand in mine
and we started running. Man' we ran so fast
dodging embers of your neighbor's houses.
I stopped. I looked at you, you looked at me
and we saw the reflection of the burning hillside
in each other's eyes. And I asked you this:
If you're dancing at the end of the world,
is the world really ending,
or is it just the beginning?

I just want to write you a simple love song
but the world keeps falling apart.
