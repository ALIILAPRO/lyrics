		  Yeah, Nieve
Goon Trax
A SoulChef productions got me like

Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now (yeah, uh)
So let me have the mic

Uh, I'm getting older I'm no longer the young pro
So ain't no little kid going to tell me I'm done for
And you ain't even worth it to rhyme to
Just thought I'd go and leave a little note to remind you
In case you want to stir the pot up cause a little drama
You don't really want to battle
I'll say things you never thought of and have never seen
You caught a line and became a fiend
My dope rhyme like amphetamine, you had a dream
The type to make you think you fall through
Who you think you are? you ain't too big to sock too
I kick one, I grab the mic and I spit son
Try to share the soul laying low in my system
And say whatever it just don't
Matter anymore I know my future is destined to carry on
There's no baggage that's heavy on
My shoulders are very strong, you know

Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
So let me have the mic (have the mic)

Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
So let me have the mic (have the mic)

Uh, it's just the same old motif
The heart never safe pretty girls a cold thief, she got away
The way she move make you want to stay
It's kind of smooth how she stalk her prey, I walk away
Don't blame me if you see me look back though
She fit me to a Texas T, baby was black gold
And from my rap flow
I thought I had her but I guess it didn't matter
She didn't think it was that dope
Leave the girl with the woe is me
Just another slideshow in my poetry
Picture me rollin' in a five hundred
Buying roses in the dozen for the lady I want
Won't that be something?
But I'm worried it will never be
Too many games be played, love
We use it in a phrase like a spelling bee
Putting her spell on me, hypnotized
Was the devil in disguise, she decided the hell with me, yeah 

Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
So let me have the mic (have the mic)

Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
so let me grab the mic (grab the mic)
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while it's like this now
So let me have the mic (have the mic)

Yeah
