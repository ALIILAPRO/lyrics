		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I'm from space
Space soul fell down
I found the earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And ain't no place now, if I got you

Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere you go
Anywhere you go
Round the Universe
I'll be there, I'll be there
Wherever you go, wherever you go, babe

Think I'm from space
My soul fell down
I found the earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And it's my place now, if I got you
If I got you, baby
You, baby
You

I don't care, I don't care
Wherever you been
Cause now you with me
Floating through the night
Feels like we're dancing
Is this the feeling
The feeling of falling in love
Cause I know that we met before, babe

Think I'm from space
My soul fell down
I found the earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And it's my place now, if I got you
If I got you, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You

Think I'm from space
Space soul fell down
I found the earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And ain't no place now, if I got you

If I got you baby
You, baby
You, baby (if I got you)
You, baby
You
