		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Become one with imagination
No more fairytales (No more fairytales)
Our souls will unite together
We will lift the veil (Lift the veil)

Your touch has turned to stone
No fire in your bones
It's time to leave the past behind
The road is neverending
All dreams will start ascending
Beyond the boundaries of the mind

Break loose from the chains
Rise above the waves
Fighting in the darkness
Dancing in the light
Break out of your cage
Turn another page
Drowning in the river
Swim against the tide of life

Holding tight to the ever after
Living for a sign (Living for a sign)
To survive raging storms together
Through the eye of time (Through the eye of time)

The eye shows no reflection
No dreams without inception
Exist within oceans of time

Break loose from the chains
Rise above the waves
Fighting in the darkness
Dancing in the light
Break out of your cage
Turn another page
Drowning in the river
Swim against the tide of life

The coil in which we're living
Is no more than a prison
The scheme of life became deranged
Dark clouds with silver linings
Attain the mysteries of shadow and shine

Break loose from the chains
Rise above the waves
Fighting in the darkness
Dancing in the light
Break out of your cage
Turn another page
Drowning in the river
Swim against the tide of life
