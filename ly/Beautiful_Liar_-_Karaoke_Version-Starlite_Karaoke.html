		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a minute, girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face, I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy, yeah
We've seen this all before
Brothers taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far
For you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart
I'm telling you

Girl, I can tell you been crying
And you needing someone to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls
Don't you know that we love you

See what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy
I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know he been tired, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes
But I need my man
I don't think y'all understand
I'm telling you

Girl, I can tell you been crying (we understand)
And you needing someone to talk to (don't be ashamed, I'm your friend)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (I can tell he's been lying to you)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you (he's no good for you)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls
Don't you know that we love you

Girl, I can tell you been crying (I can tell you been crying)
And you needing someone to talk to (I can see it in your eyes)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (I can tell he's been lying)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you (I can see it in the way you move)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding (I know who you are)
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you (I know what you're feeling, girl)
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls
Don't you know that we love you, girl

Girl, take a good look at yourself
He got you going through hell
We ain't never seen you down like this
What you mean you don't need us to help
We known each other too well

Girl, you're my girl, we're your girls
Don't you know that we love you (oh, yeah, yeah)

Girl, I can tell you been crying (oh, yeah)
And you needing someone to talk to (I've been knowing you since you were ten)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (you can not hide from your friends)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you (girl)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls
Don't you know that we love you

Girl, I can tell you been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls
Don't you know that we love you
