		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So if I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?

Can I find enough patience in time?
Take a step back and rewind
Or stay, away
I decided to hide it and nobody know
What i was going through
Forget it, you've said it for the longest time
I don't wanna hear anymore
So tell me who to trust

if I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?
You say that I should find my own way back to life
Maybe you're right

Admit it, we're finished
It's killing me that you're unwilling
To give in to any of my flaws
Seamlessly, you're getting over me
So leave my open stitches
I'll be free

For the longest time
I was blindly swimming through a wave of rage
Torn inside, lost my mind
So go ahead and turn the page

If I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?
You say that I should find my own way back to life
Maybe you're right

Help me, I keep drowning I need a saviour
Help me, I scream but no one ever hears my voice
Help me, I need to swim away from danger
You can guide me back to life

Tell me what we're waiting for
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Tell me what we're waiting for
I don't even know anymore

If I sold myself a lie
Would you be my guiding light?
You say that i should find my own way back to life
Maybe you're right

Help me, I keep drowning I need a saviour
Help me, I scream but no one ever hears my voice
Help me, I need to swim away from danger
You can guide me back to life
