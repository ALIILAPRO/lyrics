		  Oh, Carolina
What you been fed?
'Cause I was walking in the dream,
What you mean?
How you been?
I never knew I'd get so red
I got so red

Raspberry, on the ferry, I was feeling kinda sea sick on that boat
Raspberry, on the ferry, I was feeling kinda sea sick on that boat
Whoa!

They call me yoma
I lost my head
'Cause I been sleeping like some queen
What you mean?
Where I been?
I never knew I'd get so red
I got so red!

Raspberry, on the ferry, I was feeling kinda sea sick on that boat
Raspberry, on the ferry, I was feeling kinda sea sick on that boat
Oh, on that boat
Oh, on that boat
Oh, on that boat
Yeah, on that boat
Yeah, on that boat
Yeah, on that boat

Oh, on that boat (that boat)
That boat (that boat)
That boat (that boat)
That boat (that boat)
That boat (that boat)
That boat (that boat)
That boat (that boat)
That boat!

Raspberry, on the ferry, I was
Raspberry, on the ferry, I was feeling
Raspberry, on the ferry, I was feeling kinda sea sick on that boat!
