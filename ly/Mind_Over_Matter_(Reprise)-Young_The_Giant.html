		  Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train
New York City, it rains
Fly to east L.A.
In big jet planes
(You know you're on my mind)

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

Mind over matter (mind over matter)
I'm in tatters thinkin' 'bout her
Taste my disaster (my disaster)
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed
(I'm watching you this time)

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

I missed that train
New York City, it rains
Fly to east L.A.
In big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow
Tokyo, snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed

Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind

(I missed that train)
(New York City, it rains)
(Fly to east L.A.)
(In big jet planes)

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
And if the world don't break

And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
