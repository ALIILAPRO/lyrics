		  Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out

Work it out

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

Work it out
No other time in your life

Work it out
Work it out, this time 
Work it out
This time 

Tell me to be strong
Won't you give me what I want
Once I find her
I can work it out
Work it out

Tell me to be strong
Won't you give me what I want
Once I find her
I can work it out
Work it out

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

This time 
Work it out
This time 
Work it out

This time 
This time 

This time 

Work it out

Tell me to be strong
Won't you give me what I want
Once I find her
I can work it out
Work it out

Tell me to be strong
Won't you give me what I want
Once I find her
I can work it out
Work it out

Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out

This time 

Work it out
Work it out
This time 
Work it out
Work it out

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

You feel so right
All ways, all night
You're free in your mind
No other time in your life

No other time in your life
No other time in your life
