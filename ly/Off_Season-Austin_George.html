		  (Oh, mm)
Yeah

Last night, lit a flame too good to explain
Took my heart back from out the grave, yeah
Promise one thing, baby, just don't ever change, uh
All these nights gonna save us, I was used to the pain
That was 'til you showed me a way, yeah, now, I gotta repay the favor
I was lost, almost ran out of patience
But it's even better, now, I had to wait

So tonight, you take control
Take my life and make it your own
And if I slide, don't let me go
Couple nights off, don't need 'em
Fuck an off season, yeah

You just need to know, I don't trust nobody else
When I met you I could tell
I ain't better by myself
Yeah, you just need to know, I never loved nobody else
You're the best I ever felt
I ain't better by myself
Yeah, you just need to know

You excite me even more than these drugs that I've tried, yeah
Flipped the script on my soul and my mind and
Made me wonder what things would be like if
We were doin' all the things that we say
Waking up out in Bali to the rain
Ass so big, we'd never make it outta place
The type of things that make it hard to behave, girl

So tonight, you take control (you take, you take)
Take my life and make it your own (make it your own)
And if I slide, don't let me go (don't let me go)
Couple nights off, don't need 'em
Fuck an off season, yeah

You just need to know, I don't trust nobody else
When I met you I could tell
I ain't better by myself
Yeah, you just need to know, I never loved nobody else
You're the best I ever felt
I ain't better by myself
Yeah, you just need to know

I still can't believe you found me
Many nights of doubting 
But you make it alright
I feel peace when you're around me
Chased this feeling, now, it's at the door

You just need to know, I don't trust nobody else
When I met you I could tell
I ain't better by myself
Yeah, you just need to know, I never loved nobody else
You're the best I ever felt
I ain't better by myself
Yeah, you just need to know
