		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah

But, baby, you don't understand
I don't want no other man
I spend all my serotonin on you
I did everything I can
Just to fuck it up again
I spend all my serotonin on you, ooh

Just say whatever you wanna say
A breakdowns wrapped around my face
Because I'm holdin' in the truth
And if I bite my tongue then maybe I won't cry
Had to hollow my lungs and let out a bad lie
I became such a fool, a husk, hallucinating

You don't understand
I don't want no other man
I spend all my serotonin on you
I did everything I can
And I fucked it up again
I spend all my serotonin on you, ooh

A hypochondriac (stay up 'til five, pass out on the floor)
I think of you blood pressure spikes (I think too much, why can't I let it go?)
I'll have a heart attack (I'm on your side, fuck takin' offense)
The things I do to see you smile (but why do you act like you were never my friend?)
You don't even have to call me back (you can't forgive and I won't forget)
I just want some closure, little peace of mind (my whole Goddamn life, I was playin' pretend)
You don't even have to give me that (and I can't get a word in)
Just sit down, listen to me because

You don't understand
I don't want no other man
I spend all my serotonin on you
I did everything I can
And I fucked it up again
I spend all my serotonin on you
