		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now we're fall down
I lost your hand in a twinkle
The floor was frozen
Weve gotta find another way
The way we were holding together
It keeps pulling me in deep water
And it feels like a kingdom
without an exit exit
Please tell me
how to go through this
Its necessary
so we can hold our hands again
When your eyes show me the way
Your breath it makes me
invincible
You dont have to be afraid
Cause Ill never ever leave you
alone again again
Now we're fall down
I lost your hand in a twinkle
The floor was frozen
Weve gotta find another way
The way we were holding together
It keeps pulling me in deep water
And it feels like a kingdom
without an exit exit
Please tell me
how to go through this
Its necessary
so we can hold our hands again
When your eyes show me the way
Your breath it makes me
invincible
You dont have to be afraid
Cause Ill never ever leave you
alone again again
Again I'm here
