		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shadows falling, baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
(It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad

(It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for living
You battle on with the love you're living on
You gotta be mine

We take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time

And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain
Near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion

And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Ah

Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
Pulse's racing, darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark

(It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
(It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for living
You battle on with the love you're building on

You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time

And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb and mountain
Near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion

And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky

I don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your goodbye
I don't want to hear your

And we got nothing and we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb and mountain
Near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion

And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
Don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your

And we got nothing to be guilty of
