		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do I even try
This life is a lie
In the end all we do is die
No I ain't feeling right
Can't last another night
I'm tired of this never ending fight
Why do I even try
This life is a lie
In the end all we do is die
In the end all we do is die
I'm forced to take these drugs to numb all my pain
Sad that this is real life feels like some R rated game
Off these pills i'm gonna die
It makes me wanna cry
I don't wanna take these percs to feel alive
Oh why, oh why
Do I have to take these drugs to feel alive
Oh why, oh why
Can't I heal my soul I want to fly
Why do I even try
This life is a lie
In the end all we do is die
No I ain't feeling right
Can't last another night
I'm tired of this never ending fight
Why do I even try
This life is a lie
In the end all we do is die
No I ain't feeling right
Can't last another night
I'm tired of this never ending fight
I'm tired of this never ending fight
I'm tired of this never ending fight
