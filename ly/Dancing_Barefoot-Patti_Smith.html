		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he

Here I go and I don't know why
I flow so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Headin' for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
It makes me come on like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, the chosen of she

Here I go, and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Headin' for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is recreation
She intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she

Here I go, and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
'Til I lose my sense of gravity

I'm dancing barefoot
In mid-air I spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

Oh, God, I fell for you
Oh, God, I fell for you
The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face
Oh, God, I fell for you
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself
Grave visitations
Oh, God, I fell for you
What is it that calls to us?
Why must we pray screaming?
Why must not death be redefined?
Oh, God, I fell for you
We shut our eyes we stretch out our arms
Oh, God, I fell for you
And whirl on a pane of glass
Oh, God, I fell for you
An affixation, a fix on anything, the line of life, the limb of a tree
Oh, God, I fell for you
The hands of he and the promise
That she is blessed among women
Oh, God, I fell for you
Oh, God, I fell for you
