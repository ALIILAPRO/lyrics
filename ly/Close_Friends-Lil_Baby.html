		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh this the one right here, Wicked
Okay
Yeah, yeah
(Run that back, Turbo)

We started off as close friends (close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (my girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (so cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (what they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got some' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

We started off as close friends (close friends)

Lately baby been actin' so rude (been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (what they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancé
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck them I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars but I done ran out of time
