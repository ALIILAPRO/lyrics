		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It ain't easy being with me
If I were you, then I would leave me
And move along, I know it feels so wrong, yeah, yeah
Love me from a distance
But don't give up, I need persistence
And need a push in the right direction
Even if it feels wrong, yeah (feels wrong)
Baby how you doing? We ain't spoke in a minute
Last time, I was loaded, I was pushing my limits
And you said I did something that I know that I didn't
Always making me wild, and make it seem like I'm tripping

I'm so close to the edge
I already know you gonna miss me when I'm dead
A lotta things that I'll always regret
But I've been doing my best
I know I've hurt so many people
They would swear that I was evil
I just need to love myself, before I love anyone else
I just need to find a reason to stay alive
And keep on breathing
Fool me again bitch, now we're even
Fool me three times, keep on dreaming

I'm so close to the edge
I already know, you gonna miss me when I'm dead
A lotta things that I'll always regret
But I've been doing my best
I know I've hurt so many people
They would swear that I was evil
I just need to love myself, before I love anyone else
I just need to find a reason to stay alive
And keep on breathing
Fool me again bitch, now we're even
Fool me three times, keep on dreaming
