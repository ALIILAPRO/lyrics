		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  there's nobody else but you and me
when it all goes dark it's all I see
I shoulda known there's only you
we're just a soul that broke in two

there's nobody else but you and me
when it all goes dark it's all I see
and if you were just a fantasy
I'd still come find you in my dreams

I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
there's nobody
there's nobody else but you and me
there's nobody
I feel it
there's nobody
I feel it
there's nobody
there's nobody
there's nobody else
there's nobody
there's nobody
no no no no no nobody nobody nobody nobody else
nobody else nobody else
no no no no no no no no nobody else
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no nobody nobody
no no no no no no nobody nobody no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

there's nobody else but you and me
and the sky is golden when we meet
you set the frame, I'll paint the scene
I'll mould to you like plasticine

there's nobody else but you and me
when it all goes dark it's all I see
and if you were just a fantasy
I'd still come find you in my dreams

I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
there's nobody
there's nobody else but you and me
there's nobody
I feel it
there's nobody
I feel it
there's nobody
there's nobody
there's nobody else
there's nobody
there's nobody
no no no no no nobody nobody nobody nobody else
nobody else nobody else
no no no no no no no no nobody else
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no nobody nobody
no no no no no no nobody nobody no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
there's nobody else but you and me

I feel it

there's nobody else

I feel it

there's nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody no no nobody else
