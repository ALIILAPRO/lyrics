		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so fuckin' tough, so motherfuckin' bad 
13 years of grief is all your folks ever had 
Just an ignorant cunt, talkin' such shit 
Tryin to act like a man, you little fuckin' punk kid 

Yeah
Son, look at you now 
Yeah
Son, look at you now 

Day of court, day of fear, in walks the judge 
Half a year nothing less, no he wouldn't budge 
Hand over your belongings and your motherfuckin' soul 
That's the joy of life, six months in the hole 

Yeah
Son, look at you now 
Yeah
Son, look at you now 

You raped your mother, yeah you beat her down 
Jesus can't protect you when your brain is unfound
Once so fuckin' tough, so motherfuckin' bad 
13 years of grief is all your folks ever had

Yeah
Son, look at you now 
Yeah
Son, look at you now
