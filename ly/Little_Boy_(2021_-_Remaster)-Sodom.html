		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mother's little freckled boy
He is the father's pride
A little beauty sweet beloved
The sunshine of their lives

There's something in the air tonight
Little boy
Send greetings to the other side
Little boy

Resting by your Teddy's side
Sleeping without guilt
With magic in your mind inside
No war inside your dreams

Gonna see the life below
Little boy
Dead means when you touch the ground
Little boy
No god will pray the world to leave
Little boy
Cause god himself the one who did
Little boy

The truth with dirt in it's face
With bubble in his hair
Innocence of babyhood
Never really care

I let you go,leave me alone
Little boy
My work is done, now it's your turn
Little boy
I can't look back just say good bye
Little boy
Appeared to me so shining bright
Little boy

How many ears need a man
To hear the people cry
How many times a man must look
Before he see the sky
How many years a mountain needs
Before it washed to the sea
How many times some people need
To get allowed to live
