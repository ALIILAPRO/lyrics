		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just love it when you come to me
And you want me
And it's all I expected

Here we are, alone in a room
Only dressed by a shadow, me and you
My lips are dry, better kiss me quick
Not a ticklish lick
Just put some pressure on it

That's it, right there
That's it, right there
That's it, right there
That's it, right there

Tangled tongues dancing around
Your hands on my skin, going down
You got me weak in the knees
I cannot control this
You got me tamed
Not many men can do this

You know my body (sexy) like nobody
Never felt so naughty (sexy), oh, boy, you got it (right there)
We don't need no bed (yeah), at least not yet (yeah)
It feels so good (it feels so good) when it's unexpected

Light as a feather, your fingertips
Searching my body (body)
You got me weak in the knees
I cannot control this
You got me tamed
Not many men can do this

You know my body (sexy) like nobody (right there)
Never felt so naughty (sexy), oh, boy, you got it (mm right there)
We don't need no bed (yeah), at least not yet (yeah)
It feels so good (it feels so good) when it's unexpected

I feel so good
so good, so good, so good
I feel so good
I feel so good

You know my body (yeah) like nobody (yeah)
Never felt so naughty (felt so good), oh, boy, you got it (right there)
We don't need no bed (yeah), at least not yet (yeah)
It feels so good (feels so good) when it's unexpected
You know my body (your touch) like nobody (your lips)
Never felt so naughty, oh boy you got it
(Your feather light fingertips)
We don't need no bed, at least not yet
(And it feels so good)
It feels so good when it's unexpected
So good

That's it, right there
That's it, right there
That's it, right there
That's it, right there
That's it
