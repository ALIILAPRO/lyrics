		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I find shelter in this way
Under cover, hide away
Can you hear when I say
I have never felt this way

Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on

Could I be, was I there
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown whenever you leave
Please teach me gently how to breathe

And I'll cross oceans like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too

And I'll send images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too

Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on

Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on

Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
