		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
And show the world, a burning light
They've never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side
The hunger satisfies

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the North
But I got a feeling
It's a feeling that's we're dying for
Just close your eyes, and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
And show the world, a burning light
They've never shined so bright
