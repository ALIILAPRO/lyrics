		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I been dirt
And I don't care
Ooh, I been dirt
But I don't care
'Cause I'm
Burning
Inside
I'm just a-yearning
Inside
And I'm the fire of life

Yeah, alright
Ooh, I've been hurt
But I don't care
Ooh, I've been hurt
But I don't care
'Cause I'm
Burning
Inside
I'm just a-dreaming
This life
And do you feel it?
Said do you feel it when you touch me?
Said do you feel it when you touch me?
There's a fire
Well, it's a fire
Yeah, alright
Ooh

Yeah, baby
Your love
Now, s'just a bit of 
Burning
Inside
Now, just a little
Burning
Just a dreaming
Just a burning
Just a dreaming
Just a dreaming

And do you feel it?
Said do you feel it when you touch me?
Said do you feel it when you cut me?
But there's a fire
But there's a fire
Just burning
Just a burning
Just a burning
Just a burning
Just a burning
Inside
