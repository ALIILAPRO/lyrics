		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cant find my way out
Look in my eyes now
Rip me to pieces and bury my bones in the ground
I sold my soul now
For some fame and some clout
Break down my mind I cant breath I cant
Stop
I don't know why
You try to hurt me
And break me until I start to fuckin cry
Its over this time
You fuckin lied and you wasted my time now I hope that you die
I'm gripping my nine
Bullet through my mind
I can not find a reason to get out alive
You ripped up my mind
Tore out my eyes
I cant see a thing yeah I'm fuckin blind
I cant find my way out
Look in my eyes now
Rip me to pieces and bury my bones in the ground
I sold my soul now
For some fame and some clout
Break down my mind I cant breath I cant
I want to put myself inside the ground
Biting on the end of a barrel is the way I go out
My mind is pain everyday I wake and hear sounds
I want to be silent why aren't I allowed
What is your way out and how do you cope
With all of the wrong in this place
When there's too much on in this life
I'm so lost on what to do and why I'm not okay
So I just wonder how to get out
I cant find my way out
Look in my eyes now
Rip me to pieces and bury my bones in the ground
I sold my soul now
For some fame and some clout
Break down my mind I cant breath I cant
