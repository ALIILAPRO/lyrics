		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Three to the right, four to the left.)

Every day we’re in danger of stranger events
If I called up a ranger, would they comprehend?
(Theoretically)
What if fear was a neighbor in favor with death?
World of horrors so profound,
This is the upside down.

In the eye of the storm,
Where the enemy is born,
We've seen everything and more.
Isn't it the strangest,
Isn't it the strangest thing?

Giving into the darkness,
Infecting your mind.
Taken over by evil,
Blood frozen inside.
(Theoretically)
What if everyone near me,
Couldn't see me or hear me,
Can you feel me in the light now?
Right side up or upside down?

In the eye of the storm,
Where the enemy is born,
We've seen everything and more.
Isn't it the strangest,
Isn't it the strangest thing?

Step right up, come right on through
Let the night love and numb you
The light is blinding,
But it’ll all be over soon.

Step right up, come right on through
Let the dark of the night love and numb you
The light is blinding,
But it’ll all be over soon.

Every day we’re in danger of stranger events
If I called up a ranger, would they comprehend?
(Theoretically)
What if fear was a neighbor in favor with death?
World of horrors so profound,
This is the upside down.

In the eye of the storm,
Where the enemy is born,
We've seen everything and more.
Isn't it the strangest,
In the eye of the storm,
Where the enemy is born,
We've seen everything and more.
Isn't it the strangest,
Isn't it the strangest thing?

Isn't it the strangest thing?
Isn’t it the strangest?
