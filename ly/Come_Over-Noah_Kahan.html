		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in the business of losin' your interest
And I turn a profit each time that we speak
Don't you know there's a coffin buried under the garden
It was there when we got here, will be there when we leave
And my house was designed to kinda look like its cryin'
The eyes are the windows, the garage is the mouth
So when they mention the sad kid in a sad house on Balch street
You won't have to guess who they're speakin' about

Come over
Come over

I'm in the process of clearin' out cobwebs
I was takin' the wrong meds, feels good to be sad
And my house is just barely big enough for my family
But it feels like a fortress when the weather gets bad
And my mouth was designed for my foot to fit in it
Oh, the words, they went missin' when the stock market crashed
And the Dow Jones keeps falling, but I promise you, darling
With the view in the morning, you won't ever go back

Come over
Come over
Come over
Come over

I know that it ain't much, I know that it ain't cool
Oh, you don't have to tell the other kids at school
My dad'll strike it rich, we'll be the big house on the block
Someday I'm gonna be somebody people want

But I'm in the business of losin' your interest
And I turn a profit each time that we speak
Don't you know there's a coffin buried under the garden
It was there when we got here, will be there when we leave
