		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La pit m-ga kai bigan
At making kayo
A ko may da la da lang
Bali taga ling saba yanko
Na is kung y pama hagi
Ang m-ga kwento
Ang m-ga pang ya yari nagaga nap
Sa lu pang pinnang a ko

Yo, every place has a ghetto
This is my version of it
Check it out
Listen closely all I got a story to tell
Version of my ghetto when life felt for real
Some would call it hell, to me it was heaven
God gave me the grace amazing ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch a meal
To live to eat to chill and
Havin' to pump the water out of the ground
The way we put it down utilizing what's around
Like land for farm and river for fish
Everyone help each other whenever they can
We makin' it happen, nothing to something
We be surviving back in the homeland

La pit m-ga kai bigan
At making kayo
A ko may da la da lang
Bali taga ling saba yanko
Na is kung y pama hagi
Ang m-ga kwento
Ang m-ga pang ya yari nagaga nap
Sa lu pang pinnang a ko

It's been a while but
I been back to my home, to my homeland
And this be what's going on
Man it feels good to be back at home (back at home)
It's been a decade and a journey all along
I was fourteen when I first left Philippines
Been away half my life and it felt like a dream
To be next to my mom with her home cooked meal
Man I felt complete, my emotions I feel
Now life has changed for me in the U.S.
But back at home man, life was a mess
I guess sometimes the life stresses get you down
On your knees
Oh brother wish I could have helped you out
Help me...

La pit m-ga kai bigan
At making kayo
A ko may da la da lang
Bali taga ling saba yanko
Na is kung y pama hagi
Ang m-ga kwento
Ang m-ga pang ya yari nagaga nap
Sa lu pang pinnang a ko
