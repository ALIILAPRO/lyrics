		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my spicy margarita, babe
Burn my tongue, make me shake
Mix it up or give it to me straight
Turn me on, make me say

Oh, oh-oh
Cabo, met that girl in Cabo
Wearin' Ferragamo
We was goin' shot for shot for shot like desperados
Snuck into the bathroom
She might be a problem
I should probably stay away

Girl, you crazy, couldn't even wait for the room (woo-ooh-oh, oh-oh)
Shakin', shakin' tryin' to keep up with you (woo-ooh-oh, oh-oh)

You're my spicy margarita, babe
Burn my tongue, make me shake (oh, my, my, my)
Mix it up or give it to me straight
Turn me on, make me say (oh, my, my, my)
Shots, shots, shots, shots, I just can't stop
You're the only one I want (you're the only one I want)
You're my spicy margarita, baby
Burn my tongue, make me say (oh, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my)

Mornin', sex me in the mornin'
Put on a performance
I be going shot for shot for shot, she think I'm Jordan
But she scream, "Derulo" (Derulo)
My ego enormous
Fillin' up your body, babe

Girl, you crazy, couldn't even wait for the room (woo-ooh-oh, oh-oh)
Shakin', shakin' tryin' to keep up with you, ooh-ooh-woo-ooh

You're my spicy margarita, babe
Burn my tongue, make me shake (oh, my, my, my)
Mix it up or give it to me straight
Turn me on, make me say (oh, my, my, my)
Shots, shots, shots, shots, I just can't stop
You're the only one I want (you're the only one I want)
You're my spicy margarita, baby (you're my spicy, yeah)
Burn my tongue (you're my spicy, yeah) 
Make me say (you're my spi-, uh, you're my-, oh, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my)
You're my dancin' freak

Is it hot enough? (Haha, haha)
Yeah, yeah, it's hot enough
Should I take it off?
Mm, hell yeah, you should take it off
Is it hot enough?
Yeah, yeah, it's hot enough
Should I take it off?
Mm, hell yeah, you should take it off
