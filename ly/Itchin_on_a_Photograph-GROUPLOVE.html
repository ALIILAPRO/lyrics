		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm itchin' on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
Yeah I'm giving up on looking back
Yeah I'm letting go of what I had
Yeah I'm itchin' on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
Yeah I'm letting go all of that I had
Yeah I'm itchin' on a photograph

Feel the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn
Ever wonder how you can see know
At this landing ground is so, you know you know,

Yeah I'm waiting on my mum and dad
Yeah I'm swinging on a branch that'll last
Yeah I'm going up then falling back
Yeah I'm itchin' on a photograph
Feel the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn
Ever wonder how you can see now
At this landing ground it's all while you were sleeping
It's all while you were

Feel the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn
Ever wonder how you can see know
At this landing ground is so, you know you know,

Feel the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn
Ever wonder how you can see know
At this landing ground is so, you know you know,

I'm itchin' on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
Yeah I'm letting go of all that I had
Yeah I'm living now and living last
I'm itchin' on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
Yeah I'm letting go of what I had
Yeah I'm living now and living loud
