		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen up,
I'm not a doll, I'm not a fool 
Losing my cool
I've got enough of all the stuff (okay)
Give me a buff, that's what I love (pew, pew, pew)

Step by step I'm going back
Back to a place where I take a little nap
Step by step I'm going back
Back to a place where I take a little nap

Step by step, bitch, you'll get trapped
Trapped in a hole deep down in the black
Step by step, bitch, you'll get trapped
Trapped in a hole deep down in the black

Yeah, yeah, yeah, going back, back
Okay, back, yeah, yeah, uh (pew, pew, pew)
Trap
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, uh

Never gonna be the same (no more)
This is just what I became (I know)
Bitches be screaming out my name (the fuck?)
Gotta stop playing this game (let's go)
You know it, I'm on it, it's all I ever wanted (yeah, ay, want)
Hello, I'm not stupid (yeah, stupid)
You're talking all this bullshit (bullshit)
Committed, you will quit, everything I build it (ay, ay, ay, I build it)

Hey bitch, have plans (plans)
Don't waste my fucking time (time)
Hey bitch, have plans
Don't waste my fucking time
Hey bitch, have plans
Don't waste my fucking time
Hey bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch (yeah)
Give me a buff, that's what I love

Step by step I'm going back
Back to a place where I take a little nap
Step by step I'm going back
Back to a place where I take a little nap

Step by step, bitch, you'll get trapped
Trapped in a hole deep down in the black
Step by step, bitch, you'll get trapped
Trapped in a hole deep down in the black

Yeah, yeah, yeah, going back, back
Okay, back, yeah, yeah, uh (pew, pew, pew)
Trap
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, uh

Listen up
I'm not a doll, I'm not a fool 
Losing my cool
I've got enough of all the stuff (okay)
Give me a buff, that's what I love

Step by step I'm going back
Back to a place where I take a little nap
Step by step I'm going back
Back to a place where I take a little nap
