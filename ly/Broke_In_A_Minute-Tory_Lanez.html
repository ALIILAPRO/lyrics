		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yo, word to Mazzi, nigga (ah)
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
Haha
Yo, when they swing that way to the right
You swing to the left, you heard?

Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, fucking your ho in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweler
The ice on my neck and my wrist and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's
Came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civilian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Uh, okay spin it, uh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his bitch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi, bitch, let me finish
I crack that Chevy for forty
My scammer busting bottles of the '08
I cannot cuff, shes fucking on my brozay
I'm just gon' fuck and treat her like a throwaway

Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, ugh, Moncler kick it
Fucked that lil' bih, made a viddie
She want to leak it, she want to send it
Aye, fuck that bitch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, bitch do scams off bitty
Bands in my hand look pretty
Hit another band on the gram I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted
But then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy, I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstorm Rack, swipe my gifty
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute

Woo, woo, woo
I ain't been broke in a minute
Damn, woo
I ain't been broke in a minute
Woo, woo, woo
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
Woo
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn
