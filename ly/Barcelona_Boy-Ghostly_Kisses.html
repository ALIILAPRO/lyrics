		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All night behind my window
Waiting only for you to show
Slowly walking by like you don’t know
My heart bleeds down on you below

On you
Barcelona boy
Where are you tonight?
On you
Barcelona boy
And I don’t know you
I don’t even know you at all

I wish you would only turn
Your eyes up my way for a second
Why won’t you look like the others would do?
Do I have to cast a spell on you?

On you
Barcelona boy
Where are you tonight?
On you
Barcelona boy
And I don’t know you
I don’t even know you at all
And I don’t know you
I don’t even know you at all

I’ll just keep hanging on
Pretending I don’t see
That I only want those who won’t love me
I know that I’m wrong
I don’t want to play no more
I’ll just keep waiting here for you
You keep me hanging on
Pretending you don’t see
When all you really want
Is only make-believe
I know that you’re wrong
I don’t want to play no more
I’ll just keep waiting here for you
Keep waiting for you

For you
For you
And I don’t know you
Barcelona boy
And I don’t know you
I don’t even know you 
I don’t even know you
