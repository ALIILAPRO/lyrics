		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silly me, sittin' in your parents' Corolla
Thinkin' we could be somethin' that's not actually over
Like a movie scene playin' when the credits are rollin'
But you always skip that part

Ooh, guess all good things aren't meant to last
Ooh, 'cause every time you call me back, it's just a

Can of hurt, can of worms
Every word that you ever
Said before, on the floor
Broke the door, seeping through the cracks
Can't put 'em back, it don't work like that
Oh, baby, you're my can of hurt (cool)

You fit me like that pair of jeans from the ninth grade
They look great on me if I hold my breath and turn sideways
But they hurt like hell if I keep 'em on me the whole day
What a perfect metaphor (perfect metaphor)

Ooh, guess all good things hit twice as bad
Ooh, 'cause when I think of what we had, it's just a

Can of hurt, can of worms
Every word that you ever
Said before, on the floor
Broke the door, seeping through the cracks
Can't put 'em back, it don't work like that
Oh, baby, you're my can of hurt

And just when I think it's the perfect time
To welcome you right back into my life
You touch my shoulder and I realize
Oh, baby, you're my can of hurt

Can of hurt, can of worms
Every word that you ever
Said before, on the floor
Broke the door, seeping through the cracks
Can't put 'em back, it don't work like that
Oh, baby, you're my can of hurt
