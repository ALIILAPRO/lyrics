		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
I feel the way you were going
I pictured you up on my TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing
Submission going down down
Dragging me down
Submission I can't tell ya what I've found

You've got me pretty deep baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're setting it out in heaven above

Submission going down down
Dragging me down
Submission I can't tell ya what I've found

For there's a mystery
Under the sea
And an octopus rock
Under the water

Submission going down down
You're dragging me down
Submission I can't tell ya what I've found

An underwater secret
Baby, oh, share it

I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
I feel the way you were going
I pictured you up on my TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing
Submission I'm going down down
Dragging me down
Submission I can't tell ya what I've found

What I've found
Submission
Submission
Submission
I'm falling down
You're dragging me down
Under the sea
