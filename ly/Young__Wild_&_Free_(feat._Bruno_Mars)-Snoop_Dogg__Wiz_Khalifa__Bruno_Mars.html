		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this thing on? Word

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just havin' fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out? (shit, ayy let me get a lighter, please)
That's how it's supposed to be ('cause you know I'm high as fuck)
Livin' young and wild and free (keep that in there)

Uh, uh-uh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not carin' what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day, I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what? It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just havin' fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Livin' young and wild and free

Uh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in here
It's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac

Blowin' everywhere we goin'
And now ya knowin'
When I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up

That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up

From the ground up
Pound up
This Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up
And mount up
And do my thang (uh)

Now I'm chillin'
Fresh outta class feelin'
Like I'm on my own
And I could probably own a buildin'
Got my own car
No job, no children
Had this science project
Me and Mac killed it

T-H-C
M-A-C
D-E-V
H-D-3
High as me
This is us
We gon' fuss
And we gon' fight
And we gon' roll
And live our life

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just havin' fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Livin' young and wild and free

Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed? (Yeah)
We're just havin' fun
And we don't care who sees
So what we go out (yeah)
That's how it's supposed to be (yup)
Livin' young and wild and free (young, wild)

So what? (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Weed
Fun
And we don't care who sees (we don't care who sees)

And that's how it's supposed to be
Livin' young and wild and free
