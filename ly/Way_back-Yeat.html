		  I just went took what it took on my side
I just went fucked with this thottie, on my slime
I just want fuck, I don't wan' hear 'bout these signs
I keep a blick tucked it's up by surprise
I don't give fuck, I just hide around
I get the cash, baby, yeah, I'm fine
Heard you wan' come to my city then suck on that blicky
Lil' baby, come fuck in the car

Hundred thousand, hundred thousand, hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, hundred thousand, look at it, look at it
Turn it to five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred
Turn it to a million, yeah, two million, yeah, three million
Hell yeah, I'm fuckin' this thot
Hell yeah, just been servin' that rock
Hell yeah, finna chop out the Tonk'
Hell yeah, finna swerve out the lot
I heard you say you got money coming in, bro, we all know that's a lie
We all know you a broke boy, bitch boy, lil' boy, you ain't got cash, you ain't fly
I just went took what it took on my side
I just went fucked with this thottie, on my slime
I just want fuck, I don't wan' hear 'bout these signs
I keep a blick tucked it's up by surprise
I don't give fuck, I just hide around
I get the cash baby, yeah, I'm fine
Heard you wan' come to my city then suck on that blicky
Lil' baby, come fuck in the car

I cannot fuck with that shit, I turn that mil' to like six

Fooded up, ridin' with that bitch, I been booted up
My money been dancin', my money been twerkin', my money slide
Bitch done cheated on 'bout my money, I need a bitch that with vibes
Everything we do is flawless, bitch, I don't give a fuck (yeah)
Ridin' 'round, I'm in the Tonka truck, fuckin' up (yeah, yeah)
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I fuck it up (yeah, yeah)
I got a check lil' bitch, you know I fuck it up (yeah, yeah)

Hell yeah, I'm fuckin' this thot
Hell yeah, just been servin' that rock
Hell yeah, finna chop out the Tonk'
Hell yeah, finna swerve out the lot
I heard you say you got money coming in, bro, we all know that's a lie
We all know you a broke boy, bitch boy, lil' boy, you ain't got cash, you ain't fly
I just went took what it took on my side
I just went fucked with this thottie on my sign
