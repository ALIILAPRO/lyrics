		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take all your goodness and shiness away
I'll tell you the things I've been longing to say
I'll break it to you just so you understand
The force and control that you hold in your hands

Make me the beat of your heart
Then fall into mine
One step at a time
You have no reason for doubting your feelings
Love isn't always the same

You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You

You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You

(Oh you are loved)

Live for the moment according to you
And so when the time comes you know what to do
Trust me, I'm giving no secret away
I'm drowning in you but I want it that way

Make me the beat of your heart
Then fall into mine
One step at a time
You have no reason for doubting your feelings
Love isn't always the same

You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You

You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You

You are loved
(Ooh you are loved)
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You

You are loved
(Ooh you are loved)
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You

Rise to my world, fly to my arms
I love you
I'll make it for good, I'll make it forever
you know you are loved

Make me the beat of your heart
Love isn't always the same
You are loved
Ooh you are loved

(Loved you are)
(Loved you are)
(Loved you are loved)
Ooh you are loved

(Loved you are)
(Loved you are)
(Loved you are loved)
Ooh you are loved

You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You
Ooh you are loved

You are loved
You are loved
You are loved
You I love
You
(You are the only one I love)

You are loved
(Loved you are)
You are loved
(Loved you are)
You are loved
You I love
You
(You are the only one I love)

You are loved
(Loved you are)
You are loved
(Loved you are)
You are loved
You I love
You
(You are the only one I love)
