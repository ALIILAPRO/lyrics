		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit, it's hard to choose
Huh, huh
Huh, huh
Huh, huh
Huh
It's hard to choose

So many goddamn drugs, it's hard to choose
Outside with my Glock, I keep my tools
Balenciaga boots, they size forty-two
We doin' what we want, we breakin' rules
Youngin sprayin' clips, we make the news
Cinematic films, we makin' movies
7.62 bullets rip right through 'em
Poppin' X pills, I'm feelin' like Lex Luger, ha (Oxy, Oxycontin)
Huh, huh (Oxy, Oxycontin)
Shit, it's hard to choose (Oxy, Oxycontin)
Huh, huh, huh (Oxy, woo)
Shit, it's hard to choose (Oxy, Oxycontin)

Homixide, yeah
Pop me a pill and I get in my mode (what?)
Diamonds they come out, they froze (what?)
Shorty so wet like a boat
Pussy so wet, lock down, like woah
Pop me a pill and I'm goin' X mode
Dug in that bitch like I'm Jo
Dug in they bitch she like, woah
Ride in the bitch like, let's go (let's go)
Yeah, yeah, I remember back then we was piss-poor broke (broke)
Yeah, now we eat caviar right with the hoes (hoes)
Yeah, and diamonds, they hittin' (they hittin')
I ride with my dog from beginnin' (from beginnin')
Don't play with this shit, get spinned (get spinned, spinned)
Yeah, get spinned

So many goddamn drugs, it's hard to choose
Outside with my Glock, I keep my tools
Balenciaga boots, they size four-two
We doin' what we want, we breakin' rules
Youngin sprayin' clips, we make the news
Cinematic films, we makin' movies
7.62 bullets rip right through 'em
Poppin' X pills, I'm feelin' like Lex Luger, ha
Huh, huh
Shit, it's hard to choose
Huh, huh, huh
Shit, it's hard to choose (Oxy, Oxycontin)
(Oxy, Oxy)
It's hard to choose (Oxy, Oxycontin)
(Oxy, woo)
It's hard to choose
