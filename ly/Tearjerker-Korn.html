		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I wish there was someone
Well, I wish there was someone to love me
When I used to be someone
And I knew there was someone that loved me
As I sit here frozen alone
Even ghosts get tired and go home
As they crawl back under the stones

And I wish there was something
Please tell me there's something better
And I wish there was something more than this
Saturated loneliness
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it
But I never can, it's just 
Saturated loneliness

Does the silence get lonely?
Does the silence get lonely, who knows?
I've been hearing it tell me
I've been hearing it tell me, "Go home"
'Cause the freaks are playing tonight
They packed up and turned out the lights

And I wish there was something
Please tell me there's something better
And I wish there was something more than this
Saturated loneliness
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it
But I never can, it's just 
Saturated loneliness

And the bathwater's cold
And this life's getting old

And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it
And I wish I could feel it, abduct it, corrupt it
But I never can
But I never can
Never can
Never can
Never can
