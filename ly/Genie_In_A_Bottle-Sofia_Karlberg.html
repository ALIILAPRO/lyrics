		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips
And blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby

Oh, oh, oh
My body's sayin' let's go
Oh, oh, oh
But my heart is sayin' no

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (oh yeah)
You gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come come, come on and let me out

The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby 

Oh, oh, oh
My body's sayin' let's go
Oh, oh, oh
But my heart is sayin' no 

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle 
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me 
I can make your wish come true 
You gotta make a big impression 
You gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come come, come on and let me out
