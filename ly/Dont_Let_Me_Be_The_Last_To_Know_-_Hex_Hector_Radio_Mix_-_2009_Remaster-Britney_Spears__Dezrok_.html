		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My friends say you're so into me 
And that you need me desperately 
They say you say we're so complete 

But I need to hear it straight from you 
If you want me to believe it's true 
I've been waiting for so long it hurts 
I want to hear you say the words, please 

Don't, don't let me be the last to know 
Don't hold back, just let it go 
I need to hear you say 
You need me all the way 
Oh, if you love me so 
Don't let me be the last to know 

Ooh yeah, baby

Your body language says so much 
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch 
But 'til you say the words it's not enough 
Come on and tell me you're in love, please 

Don't, don't let me be the last to know 
Don't hold back, just let it go 
I need to hear you say 
You need me all the way 
Oh, if you love me so 
Don't let me be the last to know 

Come on baby, come on darling, ooh yeah 
Come on, let me be the one 
Come on now, oh yeah 

I need to hear you say (I need to hear you say)
You love me all the way (you love me all the way)
And I don't want to wait another day 
I want to feel the way you feel 
Oh, come on 

Don't, (don't) don't let me be the last to know (just let me be the one) 
Don't (don't) hold back (hold back), just let it go (just let it go)
I need to hear you say (I need to hear you say)
You need me all the way (you need me all the way)
So, baby, if you love me 
Don't let me be the last to know
