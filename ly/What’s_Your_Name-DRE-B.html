		  Kiesha Niesha Daisha 
Linda Benda 
You know how I get em 
She showing out in the spot 
I tell her to come shake that lil ass in the middle 
Kiera Ciera Tiera and Sarah 
Damn these lil bitches clever 
The way that she grabbing them ankles 
cnd throw it
She proving that nobody better 
Then I tell her 
Drop it drop it drop it
You know how I rock it 
They done came in by the pair 
With they hands in the air
cnd they ready to pop it 
Then I tell em get 
You know she gone get it
Like she in a competition coming with it
I like the ones don't be asking too much 
They be already with it 

Girl drop it 
Turn around on me don't stop it
I like it when she go play in that thing
While I'm pulling her hair 
I be wildin
I went and hollered Lisa 
Pulled up in the auto
She taking shots out the bottle 
Tugging me 
Saying I'm acting brand new
So I ripped off the plastic no lotto
Poppin that big shit 
With a stallion bitch 
Her name Bridget 
Standing 6'2
Had to stand on the rail of the bed
With my leg in the air when I hit it 
Got a love hate relationship 
Still with cngelica 
Love to get high
But hate that I'm selling em
Got the baddest lil walk
Like to twirl her tongue round on a lollipop 
When she be mailing em 
Got a Spanish lil thing Mariana 
Stay to herself but be chillen with Carla 
She like to rub on my head 
Screaming damelo papi
Reminding go tip my barber 
I know a bunch of lil baddies 
Like Stella, Bella, Rebecca, Ella, 
You better apply a lil pressure 
Girl hold up a sec
What's your name

I tell her to come shake that lil ass in the middle 
Kiera Ciera Tiera and Sarah 
Damn these lil bitches clever 
The way that she grabbing them ankles 
cnd throw it
She proving that nobody better 
Then I tell her 
Drop it drop it drop it
You know how I rock it 
They done came in by the pair 
With they hands in the air
cnd they ready to pop it 
Then I tell em get 
You know she gone get it
Like she in a competition coming with it
I like the ones don't be asking too much 
They be already with it 

Know a yella named brandy 
cnd a dark complexion name Sandy 
Saying they love 
When the chocolate just melt in they mouth 
cin't referring to candy 
Met Bianca fine ass at the W
Like to lick on yo ear 
While she hugging you
Better have a safe word
Cause she like the handcuffs on your wrist 
When she ride and be fucking you
Got a way with my words 
With a slick talk 
Love Cynae walk-in in with that thick walk
Pumpin my head call me the future
So the mask coming off 
When that stick talk 
Debra been gone for a minute 
She be texting 
Miss how I kill it
She done moved out to Georgia 
Parents still here
So I'm banging her line when she visit 
Can't forget about Jasmine 
She right
But ain't thicker than yasmine 
She hit the dm right after I post up a pic
I ain't even much bragging 
Call up Deana and Tiffany 
They fed up with my shit 
They be sick of me 
Brianna and Brittney 
Rachel Bianca and Nikki 
Whitney Roxanna cpiffany
