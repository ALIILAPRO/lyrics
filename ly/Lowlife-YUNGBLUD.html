		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not gonna go out today
I gonna sit right here and wish the world away
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife
I don't care if the people stare
I'm gonna stay right here in my underwear
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife

You know I get embarrassed most of the days
When I'm walking 'round Camden with a smirk on my face
Put my hand in my pocket to find some change
Buy a bottle of gin to get the memories erased
'Cause you know what, life is extremely divisive
It's a fraudulent razor for you to trim your sides with
Young, dumb, living off mum
That's a line from a friend I thought I should bum
Now all the words are my own, but I don't want you to judge
I thought inspiration was all about fun
Life's been eating me up, it's poisoned my cup
And if I leave the house, I'll get hit by a truck

I'm not gonna go out today
I gonna sit right here and wish the world away
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife
I don't care if the people stare
I'm gonna stay right here in my underwear
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife

In the world of normal people, I'm a monkey
It's painted on their faces that they think I'm a junkie
In the way that I dress
The people I bed
The way I express
The things in my head
I don't go to the bar
I sit in the dark
I smoke a cigar
I play the guitar
I stay in my house
I put on my sounds
The neighbors tell me to turn it down, so

I'm not gonna go out today
I gonna sit right here and wish the world away
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife
I don't care if the people stare
I'm gonna stay right here in my underwear
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife

La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la
Lowlife
La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la
Lowlife

People come, people go
People high, people low
People stay, people change
People lie, people don't
I don't fulfill my potential
'Cause everyone around me is so self-referential
Hypocritical, maybe, a petulant baby
(Wah wah wah, shut up)
Shut up, you're driving me crazy
Call me a lowlife, that shit don't faze me
I'm alright on my own, I don't need you to save me

I'm not gonna go out today
I gonna sit right here and wish the world away
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife
I don't care if the people stare
I'm gonna stay right here in my underwear
'Cause I'm a lowlife, lowlife

La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la
Lowlife
La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la
Lowlife

Hello, mum
Nah, I'm not comin' over for Sunday dinner
I think I've had too much to drink
I love you
Lowlife
