		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, your skin is getting cold
Do you still love me? I wanna know
Charming sweet lies are getting old
Forgot how to breathe
When dancing slow, we're dancing slow
We're dancing, I would, I would

I'd do anything to see you again
I'd lose everything to get my revenge

So show me your smile and I'll show you mine
I'll wipe all your tears but I'll never cry
Drove 84 miles, no stars in the sky
Just me and my fears, with bodies to hide
They're so hard to hide, if I could I could
Time stands still the universe in suspense
Fire at will, all killers die in the end

And when I see you again
I swear I'll get my revenge
The universe in suspense
All killers die, disconnect
Dead decomposed rotted away
Through all the storms my corpse will say

I'd do anything to see you again
I'd lose everything to get my revenge
Time stands still the universe in suspense
Fire at will, all killers die in the end

I hate the world, I hate myself
What I've become, what I've been dealt
Do you still love me? I wanna know
