		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll just keep my eyes closed
If you promise you won't let go
'Cause I'm afraid one day I'll watch this fire die slow
I feel like a burden
Always wanting reassurance
'Cause I'm afraid that there's a chance I'm not your person

Maybe I should be alone
Delete me from your phone
Leave and close the door, my friends will say "I told you so"
Leave me here in pieces
You've got a million reasons
But I see the way you look at me and I just can't believe it

I'm not worth it
Anyone could see that you're
Just too perfect
To love someone like me

I'm nothing special
So why'd you settle?
You'd never admit this but you could do better than me
But I'm glad that you're settling (ooh, ooh)
Yeah, I'm glad that you're settling (ooh, ooh)

Driving down a backroad
Staring out the window
Holding back a tear 'cause you said I look beautiful
But I don't believe you
And maybe that's the issue
'Cause you kiss me and it feels too good to be true

My world begins to slow
I need you like a home
Where I can always go and close the door so I'll stay warm
You love me at my weakest
You hold me 'til I'm healing
I see the way you look at me and I just can't believe it

I'm not worth it
Anyone could see that you're
Just too perfect (just too perfect)
To love someone like me

I'm nothing special
So why'd you settle?
You'd never admit this but you could do better than me
But I'm glad that you're settling (ooh, ooh)
Yeah, I'm glad that you're settling (ooh, ooh)
Yeah ,I'm glad that you settled for me
