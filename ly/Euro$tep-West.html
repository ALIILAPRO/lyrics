		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I do not miss
Started from Cali and now I got bitches in Europe they singing my shit
Remember it's never the critic who counts
That's just the way that it is
Tell me
Why would I listen to you on this shit when you never could do what I did
Ahead of the curve
For me to put pen down to paper you gotta show me that you know what I'm worth
Own all my masters I'm never signing a three sixty it's ten for the verse
Ten for the watch
Shooter like Kerr
I been a boss
Ever since birth
I gotta check
Vaccarello made the shirts
I really feel like I'm chosen
Balling out like I'm Derozan
Fuck up the game need a Trojan
My bag be deep like the ocean
Baby I seen this already it ain't nothing new
We done came up but it's still the same crew
Titans of industry pillars of stone
Right when we spoke it we already knew
Right when we spoke it we already knew
I do not miss
I do not miss
Started from Cali and now I got bitches in Europe they singing my shit
Remember it's never the critic who counts
That's just the way that it is
Tell me
Why would I listen to you on this shit when you never could do what I did
Ain't got no time for no breaks
I had to do it my way
He'll never make it, that shit is too basic
Well bitch say it straight to my face
Nothing to think about imma be great
Most of you don't wanna do what it takes
Say that you want it
The louder the voice
The cheaper the words
You in the same place
They know that I'm one of one
None before and none to come
If I want it I just make it happen
If I speak it it's already done
Gotta confess
Everything coming my way imma take off the table don't give me no less
Don't give me no less
I do not miss
Started from Cali and now I got bitches in Europe they singing my shit
Remember it's never the critic who counts
That's just the way that it is
Tell me
Why would I listen to you on this shit when you never could do what I did
