		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish that every dream
Had a way to stay in my head
And every hour lost
Fit right in the palm of my hand
Never fell back out
Did it ever make sense?
I didn't wait around to find out
It's a lonely game
And if I'm bein' real, I doubt
It ever would've fazed me
I'm goin' lightspeed
Never slow down
I stay on my feet
Never knew how
Was it dumb luck?
Dumb luck that got me this far
I don't look down anymore
No use
It ain't a close one if I don't look
If I don't look
I had a better plan
I was gonna make my escape
out of the rat race track
That was shaped like a sideways 8
Now I'm running circles round it
Tripping up every now and then
Maybe on lines that I
Drew in the sand
Watch them dissolve
And melt
As I ran right through
As I ran right through
I'm goin' lightspeed
Never slow down
I stay on my feet
Never knew how
Was it dumb luck?
Dumb luck that got me this far
I don't look down anymore
No use
It ain't a close one if I don't look
If I don't look
