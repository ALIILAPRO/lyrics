		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun is not the brightest thing
The choir sings to an empty world of finer things
Even though it burns, you drown and sink
You know I am

Washing over you
Washing over you

It's not up to me
But it's alright if it makes you feel good
You can do this all night, it's not up to me
But it's alright if it makes you feel good
You can do this all night, but it's not up to me
But it's alright if it makes you feel good
You can do this all night, but it's not up to me
But it's alright, does it make you feel good all night?
