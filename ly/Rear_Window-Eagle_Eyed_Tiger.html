		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As you drive away do you look back
As I disappear in your window
I just smile and wave while you just go
Far away
I wish I could tell you how I feel
Muster up the courage and just spill
I'll just smile for now while you just go
Far away

And I just had to let you know
That I can't hide this anymore
Don't you know it hurts to see you go

All my thoughts and worries never end
Will things change if we are more than friends
I can't find the words and hesitate
What should I say
Can you see me as more than a friend
Or a joker who likes to pretend
I just smile and wave while you just go
Far away

Keep my feelings under lock
My heart is stuck in your glovebox
If you want to turn the key don't stop
You go, you go, you go

As you drive away do you look back
As I disappear in your window
I just smile and wave while you just go
Far away
If I reach out will you grab my hand
It's a leap of faith to understand
I'll just smile for now while holding on
Patiently
Waiting for an opportunity
Fill the highways with new memories
Watch the stars at night and wish for some
Bravery
As you drive away do you look back
As I disappear in your window
I just smile and wave until you come
Back to me

Dancing in your starlight glow
Our heartbeats touching through our clothes
When you kiss me I swear time does slow
