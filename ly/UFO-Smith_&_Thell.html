		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where oh where do I belong?
Where oh where do I belong?

I'm cornered at a party in a toxic conversation
It's shallow and it's hollow
So how am I the freak?
All the people around me are in dead end relations
The carnivores are keeping score but I just wanna leave

Cause I only want somewhere to call my home

I've been terrified
Running all my life
Flying object still unidentified
In the atmosphere all alone
Oh, won't you take me to where I belong

People talk to me
Still don't understand
I'm a human being
Not an alien
Pulled apart everywhere I go
Oh, won't you take me to where I belong

Where oh where do I belong?
Where oh where do I belong?
Where oh where do I belong?
Where oh where do I belong?

It finally showed up at just the wrong time
Been waiting my whole life for that one headline
It said “congratulations we found life on this planet”
But nobody paid attention, damn it.

Cause I only want somewhere to call my home

I've been terrified
Running all my life
Flying object still unidentified
In the atmosphere all alone
Oh, won't you take me to where I belong

People talk to me
Still don't understand
I'm a human being
Not an alien
Pulled apart everywhere I go
Oh, won't you take me to where I belong

Where oh where do I belong?
Where oh where do I belong?
Where oh where do I belong?
Where oh where do I belong?

(It's ok)
