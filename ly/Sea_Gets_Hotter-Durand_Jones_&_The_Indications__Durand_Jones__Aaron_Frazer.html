		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember the first time
That your shadow crossed my door
Sun from the shoreline
Made the dust dance 'cross my floor
Easy days of healing the scars
From the battles that we won
Now I read the headlines
Says, "There's harder roads to come"

The sea gets hotter
And the drums beat louder
And world seems colder
Singing that same ol' tune

And the times get harder
World's weight upon us
But it don't mean nothin'
'Cause we're leavin' soon

And so we cruise baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise baby
'Til land meets sea

A hand on the wheel now
And the other on your knee
Ain't worry 'bout nothin'
'Cause I feel you next to me
Grayin' with the gatherin' storm
And the smoke hangs on the breeze
I know that I got you
And you know that you got me

The sea gets hotter
And the drums beat louder
And the world seems colder
Singing that same ol' tune

And the times get harder
World's weight upon us
But it don't mean nothin'
'Cause we're leavin' soon

And so we cruise baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise baby
'Til land meets sea

So we cruise baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise baby
'Til land meets sea

So we cruise baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise baby
'Til land meets sea
