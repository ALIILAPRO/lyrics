		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What are you doing out in the middle of this field leaving your car?
I'm just not sure what he's thinking
He's getting back into his car, he's grabbed his bag
And from our vantage there's no one around him
You know, you wait for these things to end
But then you figure out it might wind up
He's completely alone
This is really starting to worry me, I gotta tell ya
I gotta tell ya

I been speakin' to the reaper, seein' spirits when I'm sleepin'
I been creepin' with them demons, shadows walk through the flames
Sippin' blood with the leeches
Fuck the God you believe in
When I look in the mirror, all I see is disgrace
All of this rage, feelin' my face
Blood on the end of my blade
Can't complain, everything okay
Scars on my heart, from feelin' this pain
Got a knife in my back, can't kill me though
Numb to it all, my feelin's froze
Pray to the sky, Lord, give me hope
Bitch, I'm born alone and die alone
K holes in my halo, slave for the peso
Middle finger, fuck that
Land of the free, feed cans to the teens
Never trust police, bitch, I bust back
Fuck the government, never trust that
All the people wanna know where the love's at
We already know where the fuckin' drugs at
Where the guns at, get your scope, blatt

Yeah, hey, hey
I was in my house with some glass shards breaking out the backdoor (yeah)
I'm a bear, she try claw (yeah) 
Then I broke her backbone
Wild, heard her dad call
Pushed me on the damn floor, told me, "Put my pants on"
I was thinkin' a lot of things, by any means
I'll kill this bitch nigga if he try to take me from fucking girl of my dreams
I'll kill first, put his ass in the dirt
Body bag 'cause he worth something that hurts
And he won't be the first
