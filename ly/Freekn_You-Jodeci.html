		  I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
(I wanna freak you) I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you
I wanna freak you

Every time I close my eyes
I wake up feeling so horny
I can't get you outta my mind
Sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
Just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
Freek'n you is all I need

Tonight, I need your body (I need your body)
Tonight, you got my time 
(Girl, whatever you want I will give it, baby)
Tonight you won't be sorry (yeah, oowee)
Tonight, you got my mind
You got my mind, all I wanna do is freak you

What must I say? (Oh, tell me)
What must I do? (What must I do?)
To show how much
I think about freek'n you (baby)
What must I say? (Tell me)
What must I do? (Yeah, yeah)
To show how much
I think about freek'n you

Oh, I could go on for days
But I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
But it wouldn't last 'cause I'm a freak
Oh, everything you say
Turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freek'n you

Tonight, I need your body (tonight I need your body, baby)
Tonight, you got my time (whatever you want, whatever you need)
Tonight you won't be sorry (you won't be sorry, baby, baby, no-no-no)
Tonight, you got my mind (whatever you want, baby, it will be fine, so fine)

What must I say? (Oh)
What must I do? (What must I do?)
To show how much (I think about freek'n you)
I think about freek'n you
What must I say? (Yeah)
What must I do?
To show how much (oh)
I think about freek'n you

Freek out and freek me up and down
Devante Swing
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down

Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you, baby, in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day and every freek'n night
I wanna freek you, girl
Your body's so freek'n tight

Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you, baby, in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day and every freek'n night
I wanna freek you, girl
Your body's so freek'n tight (freek'n tight)

What must I say? (Tell me)
What must I do? (Can I prove my love?)
To show how much (lickin' you all over your body)
I think about freek'n you (body, body, baby)
What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much (I think about freek'n you)
I think about freek'n you

What must I say?
What must I do?
To show how much
I think about freek'n you

I think about freek'n you

I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you (I think about freek'n you)
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you

I think about freek'n you

I think about freek'n you

I think about freek'n you
