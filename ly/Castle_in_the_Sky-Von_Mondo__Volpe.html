		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can´t get enough
I can´t get enough
I can´t get enough
I can´t get enough
I can´t get enough
I can´t get enough
I can´t get enough
I can´t get enough

I can´t get enough 
of this drug that they call love
I need, to feel like Im home again
You came from above
Your wings wither than a dove
I need you, I need you.

I can´t wait another minute
I can´t wait another second to be
with you for all the eternity
I feel like Im in a daydream
Every moment that I spent with you
With you.

Wont you take me home
And give me wings to fly?
We can be alone, in a castle in the sky
We can run away, and leave this world behind
Please just take me home, to a castle in the sky
Castle in the Sky.

I can´t wait another minute
I can´t wait another second to be
With you for all the eternity
I feel like Im in a daydream
Every moment that I spent with you
with you.

Wont you take me home
And give me wings to fly?
We can be alone, in a castle in the sky
We can run away, and leave this world behind
Please just take me home, To a castle in the sky
Castle in the Sky

Wont you take me home
And give me wings to fly?
We can be alone, in a castle in the sky
We can run away, and leave this world behind
Please just take me home, To a castle in the sky
Castle in the Sky
