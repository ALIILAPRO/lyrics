		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was daydreaming  
About my end
I found it gruesomely
I knew it completely  
That I was small
As I looked up to see

Isn't it perfect?
To have death in sight
Isn't it worth it?
To have peace of mind

I don't need a place to go
When I give up the ghost
Tulips of the spring should grow
As I decompose

The moon it was freeing
Dispersing light
Upon us as we breathed
And though it was fleeting
I felt the power  
The universe bequeaths

Isn't it perfect?
To have death in sight
Isn't it worth it?
To have peace of mind
Isn't it perfect?
To have death in sight
Isn't it worth it?
To have peace of mind

I don't need a place to go
When I give up the ghost
Tulips of the spring should grow
As I decompose
I don't need a place to go
When I give up the ghost
Tulips of the spring should grow
As I decompose
