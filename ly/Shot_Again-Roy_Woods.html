		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
B-Town shit, 6 side, OVO shit
Yeah, uh

Pass it to DeAndre like I'm Deshaun
My bitch is in the Bay, she feel like Kreayshawn
Know if it's a problem then the gang all knows
He say he want war, I told him that them things all smoke
Shorty rolled a blunt and then she dazed off
Nigga telling too much stories like it's made up
I don't really like when people talking like they know
Been the same code since I ever stepped up on the road
Mixing up Givenchy and some Gucci for my feet
Shorty said she coming to the Six to see the kid
Since I met my niggas we been riding ever since
First time that I got the Rollie, it was President, uh
Yeah, I went from underdog to big dog
Came from Brampton, now I'm running with the Six God
Heard them niggas talking like they really gon' approach
When we pull up on 'em nigga got amnesia, they don't know

Think I need a shot again
And I got a lotta problems that I can't let you know
So I think I need a shot again
Someone get the bartender, let me bring him to my booth
'Cause I think I need a shot again
Since it's hard to let you know and I keep it bottled in
So I think I need a shot again
You don't ask my how I am, you just ask what you can get

And it ain't hard for you to finesse a trick
And it ain't hard for my dog to hit a lick
He think he safe 'cause he nominated
My niggas got some Grammys now they said it's time for me
Brought her 'round my block, she said she never wanna leave
Threw a mansion party, bitches coming in in threes
I take pictures of the Persians, some bitches are from Belize
But alone's where I really wanna be
No, no you do not know me
All these hoes, what they want from me?
Y'all never know all the things I don't say in my songs, oh
Shot, shot, they're going through it again
I need a shot, shot, the way that shorty be tweaking, got lockjaw
You see that my head is spinning, shit is nonstop
I need to hit the club, I need a shot

I think I need a shot again
And I got a lotta problems that I can't let you know
So I think I need a shot again
Someone get the bartender, let me bring him to my booth
'Cause I think I need a shot again
Since it's hard to let you know and I keep it bottled in
So I think I need a shot again
You don't ask my how I am, you just ask what you can get
