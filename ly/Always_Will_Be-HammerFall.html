		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our sun is set, our day is done, I'm left here wondering
Is this the end, my final words to you
Day turned to night and now you're gone, I'm left here pondering
Can this be true, are we really through

You were the wind beneath my wings, taught me how to fly
With you I lived among the kings, how could this ever die

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever,
And I always will be

We were one, we were all, we were the only
Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

You were the angel of my life, taught me to be free
Now I'm a stranger in your eyes, walls are closing in on me

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are the one
And you always will be

When I turn to the east, I see no dawn,
But after darkness comes the light
And when I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are the one
And you always will be

Nah-nah-na, and you always will be
Nah-nah-na, and you always will be
And you always will be
My little one you are
And you always will be
