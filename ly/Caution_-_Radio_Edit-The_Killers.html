		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me introduce you To the featherweight queen
She's got Hollywood eyes
But you can't shoot what she's seen
Her mamma was a dancer and that's all that she knew
'Cause when you live in the desert
It's what pretty girls do

I'm throwing caution
What's it gonna be?
Tonight the winds of change are blowing wild and free
If I don't get out
Out of this town
I just might be the one who finally burns it down
I'm throwing caution
I'm throwing caution

Never had a diamond on the sole of her shoes
Just blacktop white trash
Straight out of the news
Doesn't like birthdays, they remind her of why
She can go straight from zero
To the Fourth of July

I'm throwing caution
What's it gonna be?
Tonight the winds of change are coming over me
If I don't get out
Out of this town
I just might be the one who finally burns it down
I'm throwing caution
I'm throwing caution
I'm throwing caution
I'm throwing caution

'Cause it's some kind of sin
To live your whole life
On a might've been
I'm ready now
