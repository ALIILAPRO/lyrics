		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ride the train to work every day
I reach my cubicle about 9 AM
I have to earn money to pay my bills
But I don't know how my
Life turned out this way

I'm a robot i'm a robot
I don't have any feeling in my heart

I have a wife and a child waiting at home
Occasionally, I give my dog a bone (WOOF)
If I am feeling wacky, then I might
Drink a quart of vodka
Spend the night down in the gutter

I'm a robot i'm a robot
I don't have any feeling in my heart

Don't you worry don't you worry about me
Don't you worry don't you worry about me
This is how my father was how his father was
Don't you worry don't you worry about me

I'm a robot i'm a robot
I don't have any feeling in my heart
I'm a robot i'm a robot
I don't have any feeling in my heart
