		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd forgotten the time love didn't frighten me
Been careful with my trust
Now we're together, you keep reminding me
It's not you, it's not me, it's us

If you never try, you'll never know
Life ain't as easy as the sayings go
It ain't always perfect, but with you, it is
I'm not sure if it's worth it

But I could get used to this
The way we talk and all you give
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
The way I feel when we kiss
I could get used to this
I could get used to this

I don't know if it's too close, too quick
I need time to adjust
And you have shown me that we both have to take the risk
For you, for me, for us

If you never try (if you), you'll never know (know)
Life ain't as easy as the sayings go
It ain't always perfect, but with you, it is
So tell me it's worth it

But I could get used to this
The way we talk and all you give
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
The way I feel when we kiss
I could get used to this
I could get used to this

Oh, I could get used to this
And it took the longest time to admit
That I know that you're the one, I'm so certain
And I finally found what I had been missing
It's this, it's this (oh)

The way we talk and all you give
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
The way I feel when we kiss
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
