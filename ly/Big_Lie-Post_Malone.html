		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know, I know
I know, I know

Run it up, run it up
Count it up, count it up
95 in my cup, nicotine in my blood
Go run it, run it, count it, count it
Go show me something, ey
Go chuck in that shit, keep on barkin' li'l bitch
Bitches tryn' get lit, ey
Ros√© poppin' with the Balmain on me and they keep on callin'
And they know I don't answer my cell
No I don't know your mama I got so much commas
Girl you know I'm only into myself

Say you flexin' that's a big lie, when I pull up give that bitch my line
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah yeah
Say you flexin' that's a big lie, when I pull up give that bitch my line
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah yeah
Say you flexin' that's a big lie, say you got the shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah yeah
Say you flexin' that's a big lie, say you flexin' that's a big lie
Say you flexin' that's a big lie, say you flexin' that's a big lie

Valet the park on the whip, the Caddy the 76
My woman gon' box on a bitch, they don't want no part in that shit
I got my money jumpin' I'm part of ballin' on Fade
Did it while shit came you can see that shit on replay
I just drop the top and I pull up to you party
I just grab a Bud then I pop the top on your boy they woulda'

Say you flexin' that's a big lie, when I pull up give that bitch my line
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah yeah
Say you flexin' that's a big lie, when I pull up give that bitch my line
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah yeah
Say you flexin' that's a big lie, say you got the shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah yeah

And I know who we are yeah, and I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money, I don't want your bitch just know it

Say you flexin' that's a big lie, when I pull up give that bitch my line
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah yeah

Say you flexin' that's a big lie, say you got the shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah yeah

And I know who we are yeah, and I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money, I don't want your bitch just know it

I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
