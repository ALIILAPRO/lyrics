		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, 
My mind is clear, I have no fear, 
Cuz now I know the other side of me, 
I'm letting go of who I used to be.
Now I'm alive, feeling born again, 
And I will fight until the bitter end. 

Took a thousand scars to find me, 
Every one of them reminds me, 

I won't ever surrender like that. 
I know better, to ever fall back. 
The enemy was living in my head, 
I ripped it out and left it there for dead. 
Now I'm alive I'm feeling born again, 
And I will fight until the bitter end. 

I found my way through jaded days, 
Cuz now I know the other side of me, 
I'm letting go of who I used to be. 
Now I'm alive I'm feeling born again, 
And I will fight until the bitter end. 

Took a thousand scars to find me, 
And every one of them remind me, 

I won't ever surrender like that, 
I know better to ever fall back. 
The enemy was living in my head, 
I ripped it out and left it there for dead. 
Now I'm alive I'm feeling born again, 
And I will fight until the bitter end. 
Bitter end. 

My mind is clear, I have no fear, 
It took a thousand scars to find me, 
Memories remain. 

I won't ever surrender like that, 
I know better to ever fall back. 
The enemy was living in my head, 
I ripped it out and left it there for dead. 
Now I'm alive I'm feeling born again, 
And I will fight until the bitter end. 

I won't ever surrender like that, 
And I know better to ever fall back. 
The enemy was living in my head, 
I ripped it out and left it there for dead. 
Now I'm alive I'm feeling born again, 
And I will fight until the bitter end. 
Bitter end.
