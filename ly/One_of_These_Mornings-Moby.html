		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone

One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone

One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone

One of these mornings
(One of these mornings)
Won't be very long
(Won't be very long)
You will look for me
(You will look for me)
And I'll be gone
(And I'll be gone)

And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me

One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
