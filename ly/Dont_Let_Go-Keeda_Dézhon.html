		  (Baby girl be looking at me)
(Just saw you getting the clue)
(This ain't just outta the blue)
Baby girl be looking at me
And I be looking at you
Just saw you getting the clue
This ain't just outta the blue
Baby girl just see what I see
The vibe between you and me
Baby girl just feel what I feel
And I know you getting the clue
Baby girl be looking at me
And I be looking at you
Just saw you getting the clue
This ain't just outta the blue
Baby girl just see what I see
The vibe between you and me
Baby girl just feel what I feel
And I know you getting the clue
Paris Tokyo London
We sipping a fancy bourbon
Yeah baby we living that urban
And playing under the curtains
We walking daytime around Paris
Every moment that I just cherish
We traveling the world together
Till the end and into the nether
We don't care about the weather
Hitting the bell like Mayweather
All velour yeah baby no leather
Hitting the round 2 like Mayweather
We don't care about the weather
We don't care about the weather
We don't care about the weather
Hitting the bell like Mayweather
Baby girl be looking at me
And I be looking at you
Just saw you getting the clue
This ain't just outta the blue
Baby girl just see what I see
The vibe between you and me
Baby girl just feel what I feel
And I know you getting the clue
Baby girl be looking at me
And I be looking at you
Just saw you getting the clue
This ain't just outta the blue
Baby girl just see what I see
The vibe between you and me
Baby girl just feel what I feel
And I know you getting the clue
We flexing the ice
And we rolling the dice
And then we go back to cuddling
Not checking the price
Just getting it right
Spending money like it was nothing
Baby I do like the fact
That our love reacts
My love for you is so kind
Baby always on my mind
Yeah my love for you is kind
Baby always on my mind
Yeah my love for you is kind
Yeah your beauty makes me blind
Yeah your beauty makes me
Baby always on my mind
Yeah my love for you is kind
Yeah your beauty makes me blind
Yeah your beauty makes me blind yuh
Baby girl be looking at me
And I be looking at you
Just saw you getting the clue
This ain't just outta the blue
Baby girl just see what I see
The vibe between you and me
Baby girl just feel what I feel
And I know you getting the clue
Baby girl be looking at me
And I be looking at you
Just saw you getting the clue
This ain't just outta the blue
Baby girl just see what I see
The vibe between you and me
Baby girl just feel what I feel
And I know you getting the clue
Aye
