		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ghostbusters)
If there's something strange
In your neighborhood
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

If there's something weird
And it don't look good
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

If you're seeing things
Running through your head
Who can you call?
(Ghostbusters)

An invisible man
Sleepin' in your bed
Oh, who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

If you're all alone
Pick up the phone
And call
(Ghostbusters)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
Ooh, I hear it likes the girls
Hm, I ain't afraid of no ghost
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

Mmm, if you've had a dose of a
Freaky ghost, baby
You better call
(Ghostbusters) ow

Lemme tell ya something
Bustin' makes me feel good

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

Don't get caught alone oh, no
(Ghostbusters)
When it comes through your door
Unless you just want some more
I think you better call
(Ghostbusters)

Ow, Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Uh, think you better call
(Ghostbusters)
Ha ha, who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters) 
I can't hear you

Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Louder
(Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Who can you call?
(Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)

Uh, it likes the girls too
(Ghostbusters)
