		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in the night
'Neath heavens torn asunder
You call on me to solve a crooked rhyme
As I'm closing in
Imposing on your slumber
You call on me as bells begin to chime

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Hiding from the light
Sacrificing nothing
Still you call on me for entrance to the shrine
Hammering the nails
Into a sacred coffin
You call on me for powers clandestine

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now
