		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riding high
When I was your star, mm
Lightning strike
Right at the heart, mm

Paradise calling
All I ever wanted
Something to believe in, oh-oh
Something to believe in, oh-oh
Both eyes wide open
So high, still falling
If you could only feel, oh-oh
If you could only feel

Our love
Our love

Light us up
Open the door, oh, oh, oh

We could find a way out the dark
This could be the spark
And you don't know the ways of the heart
This could be start

Paradise calling
All I ever wanted
Something to believe in, oh-oh
Something to believe in, oh-oh
Both eyes wide open
So high, still falling
If you could only feel, oh-oh
If you could only feel
Our love

We could find the way out the dark, the dark
You don't know the ways of the heart, the heart
We could find the way out the dark, the dark
You don't know the ways of the heart, this could be the start

Paradise calling
All I ever wanted
Something to believe in, oh-oh
Something to believe in, oh-oh
Both eyes wide open
So high, still falling
If you could only feel, oh-oh
If you could only feel

Our love
Our love
Our love
Our love
