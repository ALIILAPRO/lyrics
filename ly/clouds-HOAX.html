		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My head in the clouds
Your feet on my lap
I'm running my mouth
And talking to fast
Slow it all down
I love you 'tll my last breath

Coming to terms 
With coming of age
What did you learn
To think for you say
Watching her turn
I'm stuck in my ways

So say what you wanna say 
And stay if you wanna stay
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll be

So say what you wanna say 
And stay if you wanna stay
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll be

My head in the sand
When you're not around
Read the palm of my hands
And tell me how it all ends 
Slow it all down
I love you 'til my last breath

Come down to earth
You live and you learn
The longer you hold on
The harder it hurts
Let it all burn
We're stuck in the pain

So say what you wanna say 
Stay if you wanna stay
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll be

So say what you wanna say 
And stay if you wanna stay
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll be

When we don't see eye to eye 
And we just smile to pass the time
Promise you'll try and I will too
Say what you wanna say 
And stay if you wanna stay
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll be
Say what you wanna say 
And stay if you wanna stay
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll
