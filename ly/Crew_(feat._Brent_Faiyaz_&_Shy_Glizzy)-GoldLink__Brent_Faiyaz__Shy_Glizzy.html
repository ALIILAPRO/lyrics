		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank (no, no, no, no, no)
Don't hold no rank

Yeah, uh
Dirty ass, Maryland ass nigga
With a sick ass mouth and a slick ass flow, uh (uh-huh)
Got your bitch around me, nigga, ain't no playin' (yeah, goddamn)
When I'm comin' for the kitty, I'm a fool, goddamn (right there, just)
Do it for my niggas on the coast right there (right there, yeah)
Do it for my niggas in the Ghost right now (Westside, Westside)
Niggas got killed for the boy living dreams in the hills
And they watchin' for the boy right now
Goddamn, what a time, what a year (goddamn)
Uh, we are what them young boys fear (yeah)
I kill, never been killed, that's real, no lie
You can tell that from our peers right now (I want that)
Bet you wanna fuck me now (you do)
Uh, bet you wanna love me down (you do)
Uh, girl, you can't tie me down like Ray J said
But know I'm down
Uh, freaky deaky show me somethin'
Uh, shake it like you owe me somethin'
Uh, pushin' on the pussy like a button
Came four times, fifth time you gushin'
Uh, still gettin' rowdy in the function
Uh, bitches on my dick like it's nothing
Uh, everywhere I go now, always got shit bumpin', jumpin', bumpin', jumpin', yeah

Hey, nice to meet (hey)
I'm Young Jefe, who you be? (Young Jefe)
Dime piece in Southeast (dime) 
Got her clappin' to this beat (clap, clap)
She invite me to her crib, I walk in she see my heat (uh, uh)
She said, "But I live in the hills," bitch, that's just the way I sleep (uh-huh)
Stop that madness, I'm a savage
In traffic with MAC 11's (brrt)
Baddest bitch and she Spanish (ooh)
I fly her to Calabasas
We get nasty, I'm her daddy
She know a nigga ain't average
Ain't nothin' wrong with fake asses
Bitch, turn around let's make magic
I'm geekin', uh-huh, I'm on it (uh-huh)
Don't look at me like you want it (no)
Tell 'em that we ain't stuntin'
In fourth down we ain't puntin' it (woo)
King of District of Columbia (king)
Can't come here without a permit (uh)
This shit really a jungle, gorillas and anacondas (goddamn, goddamn, goddamn)

She see money all around me (hey, hey, hey)
I look like I'm the man, yeah (Young Jefe, holmes)
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank (no, no, no, no, no)
Don't hold no rank
