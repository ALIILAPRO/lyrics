		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's not fight it anymore; unpack the bags and close the door
I'll never leave you
Though you lied right from the start, I can't convince my foolish heart
Not to believe you

You've got other loves strung out and there's not the slightest doubt
That other loves have loved you before
But you do your things so well I'll dream of heaven and live in hell
Till I can't take it anymore

If I had one ounce of pride, I'd stand up or step aside
But I still love you
So I'll accept the crumbs you drop 'cause I'm a fool and I can't stop
Or rise above you

While you're making up your mind, I'll be praying all the time
Praying that you won't be letting me go
Yes, you do your thing so well I'll dream of heaven and live in hell
Till I can't take it anymore

While you're making up your mind, I'll be praying all the time
Praying that you won't be letting me go
Yes, you do your thing so well I'll dream of heaven and live in hell
Till I can't take it anymore
