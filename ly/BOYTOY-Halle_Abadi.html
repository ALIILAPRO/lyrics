		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want a sad boy, cryin' every night
Don't want a bad boy, he just wanna fight
Don't want a mama's boy
Who's lookin' for a housewife
Don't want a pretty boy
Who's ugly on the inside
Don't want a tough boy
Cuz his love is weak
Don't want a fboy
He's just gonna cheat
Don't want a lover boy
Who's talkin' bout forever
When we haven't even spent a night together
I don't want a playboy
Just wanna play with my
BOYTOY
He's so lucky, he's my
BOYTOY
Yeah, I know he love me
If I break his heart, I'll buy another to enjoy
All the girls are sayin'
Nothin's better than a boytoy
If he's a rude boy, Imma shut him down
If he's a frat boy, I'll get him kicked out
If he's a bitch boy, then I gotta be a bitch, boy
And if he mess up
Then I'll hook up with his
Homeboy
(Oops)
I don't want a playboy
Just wanna play with my
BOYTOY
He's so lucky, he's my
BOYTOY
Yeah, I know he love me
If I break his heart, I'll buy another to enjoy
All the girls are sayin'
Nothin's better than a boytoy
Nothin' better, nothin' better
Than a boytoy
Nothin' better, nothin' better
Than a boytoy
Nothin' better, nothin' better
Than a boytoy
All the girls are sayin'
Nothin' better than a BOYTOY
