		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stock in my seat can't move no way the other guys knows the game to play
I'm watchin' her
I'm watchin' me
I'm gettin' brave

Oh
Take him apart say listen to me.
Look on the floor and all is spinning round

Someone told me this was just a dance

And take a chance ain't met before
Do you think I really have a chance?
Hypnotic tango
Tango
Tango!

Rough diamond he smiles 
She looks at him

Ain't gonna be 
No story in love

Take me to the dance
Floor by the hand

Give me this night 
In a foreign land.
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Hypnotic
Hypnotic

Hypnotic
Hypnotic 
Look on the floor
And all is spinning round

Look on the floor 
And all is sinning round
