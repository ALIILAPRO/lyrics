		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you're running away from me
I swear i am the one running
Thought about this again and again
Over again
知ってる

Do you miss me?...

Sometimes I wish that you were all mine
一度くらい
I see you out by yourself, but I know you think about me all of the time
My friends have all heard your name,
Tell me how do I explain
Why I can't relate to anyone,
And all that's running through my brain
Is the need to always leave the house
Want to feel good?
I don't know how
But when I'm with you I feel so free
I need to know, do you miss me?

Do you miss me?...

Sometimes I be silent it's all secret when it comes my turn
Don't take it personally, boy
Familiar with being burned
It's running through my head again and again
I need to know...

(You and me together song My angel Strong when I need you Something I never wanted
until now But now you're flying through the clouds Leaving me standing in a field of wheat
その何度も思い出す現象
この現象を言葉にするとしたら
I... I miss you)
