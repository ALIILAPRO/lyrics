		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're nowhere even near me
But everywhere I go I feel you
Can you feel me?
Why can't I just forget you
I want to shed my skin to remove you
Can you hear me?

Now I'm giving up, I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste of your venom

How dare you play the victim
These tortured eyes, they see right through you
Right through you
But still you keep my captive
And make me feel like I deserve you
But I hate you, hate you

Now I'm giving up, I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste of your venom

I feel asphyxiated
It's more than I can take
But nothing ever changes in the end
No more I'm suffocating
You've gone and lost your grip
But nothing ever changes in the end

Here we go again
Hate you, hate you

Now I'm giving up, I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste of your venom

Giving up, never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste of your venom
