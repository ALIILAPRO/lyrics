		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nerd girl, I don't deserve you
I don't get the references you refer to
I love your Lipsmackers and
Your lack of perfume
I hope to get you home by curfew wORD UP!

There's a special kind of girl
That goes to my shows
And I don't mean the groupie hoes
All along the front row
She's more like a wallflower
Like the one that Stryker sniped
I'm elixir when I'm with her
Cause I think I like her type
She might seem shy in person, it's no lie
She's always nervous
But the verdict is - she's worth it
She gets crap, but don't deserve it
She look like Emily Strange
Always ravin' 'bout her faves
Wanna conquer her like Kang
When you kiss like Cassie Lang
There's no way I can
Pronounce Neo Geo Evangelion
I can't refute, cause she's so cute
And so I suck my belly in
X-23 and Hellion, odd couple, to be kind
She's in my heart and in my mind
And now she's in my rhymes
She's wordy and verbose
Prolific and prone to prose
Always sick and has a cold
Stuffed nose she's gotta blow
I've got many cold remedies, many old enemies
I've got a girl that kicks their
Ass like River from Serenity!

Nerd girl, I don't deserve you
I don't get the references you refer to
I love your Lipsmackers and
Your lack of perfume
I hope to get you home by curfew wORD UP!

Her parents are divorced
And there's often daddy issues
Try not to take advantage while I
Hand her all my tissues
She hips me to the bands she
Likes I couldn't be more clueless
Every word comes out her mouth - is
Now on my to do list she's romantic
Known to panic with anxiety attacks
Literary, it's so scary
Reading BrontÃ«s back to back
She's playing Ragnarok on
Her mother's Magnavox
She's underneath my skin like
A million nanobots
She's like Annie Potts in 'Busters
Get my freak on like I'm Egon
Say third base right to her face
And she will be like 'BE GONE' if not now
I know I can wait like Lucas and the locusts
And you know this - we'll buy glow sticks
Stay up late, perfect the slow kiss
You can't resist Chris cause
He helps you de-stress
While you play Animal Crossing
On your Nintendo DS
Baby, if we can't be a couple
Give up on getting married
I'll remember we connected
And how it happens so rarely
(I'm serious, girl)

Nerd girl, I don't deserve you
I don't get the references you refer to
I love your Lipsmackers and
Your lack of perfume
I hope to get you home by curfew

Nerd girl, I don't deserve you
I don't get the references you refer to
I love your Lipsmackers and
Your lack of perfume
I hope to get you home by curfew

Nerd girl, I don't deserve you
I don't get the references you refer to
I love your Lipsmackers and
Your lack of perfume
I hope to get you home by curfew wORD UP!
