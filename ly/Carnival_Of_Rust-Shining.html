		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you breathe the name of your saviour
In your hour of need and taste the blame
If the flavor should remind you of greed?

Of implication, insinuation and ill will
'Til you cannot lie still
In all this turmoil, before red cape and foil
Come closing in for a kill

Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but a carnival of rust

It's all a game avoiding failure
When true colors will bleed all in the name
Of misbehavior and only things we don't need

I lust for after no disaster can touch
Can touch us anymore
And more than ever, I hope to never fall
Where enough is not the same it was before

Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but a carnival of rust
Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but a carnival of rust

Don't walk away, don't walk away
Oh, when the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Oh, when the heart is yearning
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Oh, when the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Oh, when the heart is yearning
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Oh, when the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Oh, when the heart is burning
