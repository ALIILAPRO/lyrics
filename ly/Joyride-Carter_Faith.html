		  Hmm-mm, hmm-hmm

Hold it in, breathe it out
Now we're spinnin' way above the clouds
Look at me and I won't look down
The rest of them don't matter anyhow

Take this fast car nowhere slow
'Cause, baby, you're my open road
It don't matter where we've been
It don't matter where we go
'Cause lovin' you's a joyride for the soul

Hmm-mm

On the hood of your Silverado
Watch the sky swirl pink and gold
All the forevers in this moment
We're endless and never gettin' old

Take this fast car nowhere slow
'Cause, baby, you're my open road
It don't matter where we've been
It don't matter where we go
'Cause lovin' you's a joyride for the soul

Hmm-mm, hmm-hmm

I'm gonna love you like you only love once
Like you only live once (yeah, you only live once
I'm gonna love you like you only love once
Like you only live once (yeah, you only live once
I'm gonna love you like you only love once
Like you only live once (yeah, you only live once
I'm gonna love you like you only love once
Like you only live once, yeah, you only live once

Hmm-mmm

Take this fast car nowhere slow
'Cause, baby, you're my open road
It don't matter where we've been
It don't matter where we go
'Cause lovin' you's a joyride for the soul
No, it don't matter where we've been
It don't matter where we go
'Cause lovin' you's a joyride for the soul

Hmm-mm, hmm-hmm
