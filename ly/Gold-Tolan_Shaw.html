		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two things that you should know about me
I'll treat your heart so tenderly
Lay give some love down at your feet
Come take my hand and you will see
A little bit of romance in every little moment

Good as gold
Trade you all my money for your gold
Worship you 'cause honey you're like gold
You'll be my queen
Worth your weight in gold
You're good as gold

Everyone wants a love that shines
But such a treasure's hard to find
More precious than a downtland mine, girl
I'll cherish you if you'll be mine
I will be your rich man, if you would take my hand

Good as gold
Trade you all my money for your gold
Worship you 'cause honey you're like gold
You'll be my queen
Worth your weight in gold

Copper, silver, energy
All those things I'd surely trade
Give them all away to make you mine

Gold
Trade you all my money for your gold
Worship you 'cause honey you're like gold
You'll be my queen
Worth your weight in gold
You're good as gold

Good as gold
Good as gold
You're good as gold
You're good as gold
