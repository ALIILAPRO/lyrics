		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
Lyft on a bitch, finna walk when they sniffin' a brick
I fucked that bitch in the back with the Burberry on
I fucked that bitch in the back with the Burberry on
Yeah

I fucked that bitch in the back with the Burberry on, uh, yeah
And 'til this day, that lil' bitch know all my songs
My choppa like Kid N Play, put a bullet hole in your afro, aw
Walk in the bank, I'm laughing, aw
These niggas square like Madison, oh
I ball out like Madison, oh
Fourth quarter shawty, shoot up your party
I'm a different man when I'm off of the molly
Used to take five Xans to the face in the morning
Now I take Percs, my stomach turnin'
Stopped taking Percs, my stomach burnin'
May take a half when I hit it from the back
I'ma beat the shit up like Ike-y Turner
Check that bitch like she got Nike on her

Look at my wrist, it dance
Look at your bitch, she dance too
Look at me, I'm the man
Percocets, don't do Xans, boo
Run up on me, I blam
I got my hand on my ham, ooh
Run up on me, I blam
I got my hand on my hammer
You swipe like a credit card scammer
Bad bitch, yeah, I know she a scammer
Fucked the bitch, then I'm out of the jammer
Dunk on a bitch, NBA, I'm jammin'
Bad bitch from the back, I'm crammin'
Her pussy like wonderland
Gold on her body like Wonder Woman
Fly in that bitch, I'm Wonder Man

Slick back, lil' bitch, like a Perc
She on the dick, do the work
Can't take the dick, she gon' squirt
Fuckin' that bitch 'til she hurt
Usin' a condom won't burn
I'm in this 'Rari, I swerve
Smokin' on all of this herb
I feel like I'm leavin' Earth
I keep a .30, no Perc
Boom, boom, boom
Blow a bitch down, it's gon' hurt
All that bullshit for the birds
Kick that shit right to the curb
I keep that drink like a clerk
Dealin' with pain, I deserve
Two times that 33 third
223s and they berserk
I get that check on the first
I get that check on the second
And I get that check on the third
Beefin' with me, get you murked
Lookin' for me, better search
I just been givin' them hell
My brother whippin' them bales
He do that shit by his self
I did this shit by myself
256, that's a deal
Swerving in this 'Rari and this bitch is all black, yeah
Hanging with them plugs, talking down and you get zapped, yeah
All that bullshit they talkin' is big cap, yeah
I'm talkin' real shit, that trill shit, no cap, yeah
Real rap, yeah, had to bring it back, yeah
1400, 800, nigga, them big facts, yeah

I fucked that bitch in the back with the Burberry on, uh, yeah
And 'til this day, that lil' bitch know all my songs
My choppa like Kid N Play, put a bullet hole in your afro, aw
Walk in the bank, I'm laughing, aw
These niggas square like Madison, oh
I ball out like Madison, oh
Fourth quarter shawty, shoot up your party
I'm a different man when I'm off of the molly
Used to take five Xans to the face in the morning
Now I take Percs, my stomach turnin'
Stopped taking Percs, my stomach burnin'
May take a half when I hit it from the back
I'ma beat the shit up like Ike-y Turner
Check that bitch like she got Nike on her
