		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once I was a sentimental thing,
Threw my heart away each spring,
Now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter,
All I've got to show?s a splinter for my little fling!

Spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post,
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Morning?s kiss wakes tres and flowers,
And to them I'd like to drink a toast,
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
Spring can really hang you up the most.

All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
I know the tune, "this is love, this is it!"
Heard it before and I know the score,
And I've decided that spring is a bore!

Love seemed sure around the new year,
Now it's April, love is just a ghost,
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear? 
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Spring is here, there?s no mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast;
My heart tries to sing so they won?t hear it breaking,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

College boys are writing sonnets,
In the "tender passion" they're engrossed,
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Love came my way, I hope it would last,
We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of son,
Full of sweet promise but something went wrong!

Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
"sulfur and molasses" was the dose,
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

All alone, the party's over,
Old man winter was a gracious host,
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most!
