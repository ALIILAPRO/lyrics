		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish I could synthesize
A picture perfect guy
Oh I, oh I

Where all the boys at with emotional stability?
Nice car, a CEO, and almost just as smart as me
Where all the boys at with financial security?
A doctor, a model, a man of possibilities

They say 
Expectations are too high
And you'll never find a guy like that
It's driving you mad, honey
They say 
That its just a waste of time
Get your head out of the sky
But why?
Here we go

Oh I, wish I could synthesize
A picture perfect guy
Oh I, oh I
Six feet tall and super strong
We'd always get along
Alright, alright

Ooh, he'd pick me up at eight
And not a minute late
'Cause I don't like to wait, no
Kind and ain't afraid to cry
Or treat his mama right
That's right, that's what I like

I need a man who don't get jealous 'less I want him to
A gentleman to take care of me in the bedroom
Romantic love but keep it rough
Am I asking too much?

They say 
Expectations are too high
And you'll never find a guy like that
It's driving you mad, honey
They say 
That its just a waste of time
Get your head out of the sky
But why?

Oh I, wish I could synthesize
A picture perfect guy
Oh I, oh I
Six feet tall and super strong
We'd always get along
Alright, alright (alright, oh no no)

Ooh, he'd pick me up at eight
And not a minute late (no)
'Cause I don't like to wait, no
Kind and ain't afraid to cry
Or treat his mama right
That's right, that's what I like

I've been looking high and low
For a man who's just right
And treats me mighty fine
So come on, baby
Show me what you got

Oh I, wish I could synthesize
A picture perfect guy
Oh I, oh I (hey)
Six feet tall and super strong (hey)
We'd always get along
Alright, alright (alright)

Ooh, he'd pick me up at eight
And not a minute late (no)
'Cause I don't like to wait, no
Kind and ain't afraid to cry (ain't afraid to cry
Or treat his mama right (that's right)
That's right (that's right)
That's what I like (that's what I like)
