		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you sayin'?
You when you callin' me with my thang
What up with it? And damn I'm the old-
Bro, on yo' payroll?
Deal with it, I don't want it that's my-
Delta they don't wanna stop, okay
Diamonds yeah they bright, okay
Yeah, they don't wanna talk, okay
Blue skies and they turn to gray
She just wanna touch my face
She wanna tie the knot like lace
Yeah, I can't really run away
'Cause she's the one I wanna chase
Why do I like her? Why do I like her?
I hate making music, every time
I do this shit, i just feel stupid

Bitch, I'm never fallin' for a stupid bitch
What I gotta do to make you
Understand I'm through with it?
I don't wanna talk
Every time I see you I gеt pissed
Shut the fuck up
I been told you I don't give a shit
I don't likе to talk down
But when I'm talkin' 'bout you
Then it's different i don't give a fuck now
If you cared about me like you said
You would've listened
I can't work, I'm too distracted
Target like it's DOA, leave 'em in a casket
Talk about it every day, leave
It in the past, man
Tired of these people talkin' down, man
I had it she said "Zootzie, you're my hero"
(But that's not even my name)
I don't think they really know me
(But I told her it's okay) drive fast, yeah
We gonna turn your man into a hashtag
This will be the one that
Everybody fuckin' laughed at

They told me that I'm moving different
Just because I'm getting paid
Hollow tips gon' make him squat
Like he was tryna lose some weight
I'm sorry, not really, I lied to you
Sincerely show you why I hate you
There's just so much I can't change about you

Uh, they don't wanna stop, okay
Diamonds and they bright, okay
Yeah, they don't wanna talk, okay
Blue skies, yeah, they turn gray
She just wanna touch my face
She wanna tie the knot like lace
Yeah, I can't really run away
'Cause she's the one I wanna chase
I don't even like her, lit like a lighter
Freestyle off the dome, I don't need a writer
Can I take you home? yeah
You just make it tighter
I'ma make him spin, yeah, just like a tire
Okay, I got racks all on
My body, and I'm coolin', chillin'
Girl, you make me so hot
I'm not really coolin', coolin'
Break the conventions, yeah there's no ruling
I don't need your brain
I don't need no schooling

They said they know the fast way
To go and make it
I said, "Shut the fuck up, you're mistaken"
Heard he talkin' shit
I'ma turn his ass to bacon
You're wasting your time
You should go and get a payment
I don't wanna talk to you right now
I I I I If he test me
I'ma empty out these rounds
You don't wanna talk to me right now
I don't get why they just talk so loud

I don't even like her, lit like a lighter
Freestyle off the dome, I don't need a writer
Can I take you home? yeah
You just make it tighter
I'ma make him spin, yeah, just like a tire
(Delta) okay, I got racks all on
My body and I'm coolin', chillin'
Girl, you make me so hot
I'm not really coolin', coolin'
Break the conventions, yeah there's no ruling
I don't need your brain
I don't need no schooling
