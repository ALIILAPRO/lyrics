		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How'd you hear me walkin' by?
I was sneakin' sneaky-like, yeah
Guess the halls, they amplify my tip-toein'
I was hidin' well
But I can't now, no, not anymore
I've been found
Now I'm slippin' on the floor
Runnin' now
Holding on to my life 'til I can't run
In the dark, I will survive

I hear a heart beatin' to
The rhythm of the night of course it's mine
How else could I handle what
Could be my demise?
Before I left my safety zone
I should have rationalized
No protection or armor
Just tryna find a few supplies
One, two, three, four, five, six
That's all I really need 'til I come
Back to do it all again
Makin' amends with the deepest darkness
It's my only friend
Hidin' from the death the demon
Offers up until the end


Hide in the Miracle Station
He's got the lowest skills in observation
Gotta live up to expectations
To stay alive just one day more

How'd you hear me walkin' by?
I was sneakin' sneaky-like, yeah
Guess the halls, they amplify my tip-toein'
I was hidin' well
But I can't now, no, not anymore
I've been found
Now I'm slippin' on the floor
Runnin' now
Holding on to my life 'til I can't run
In the dark, I will survive

I see myself clearly becomin'
His next victim
Don't have to think twice, boy
I would never contradict him look at him
He's terrifying and he used to be a-okay
Probably caught up in a daze
Thinkin' about the good ol' days
Of the cartoon world that he once inhabited
What a beautiful musical world
Sammy was so talented
Now with everybody's fate sealed
Drowned in the ink
The studio's become a hayfield
I'm just tryna find a sink
So I can clean out my
Eyes of everything I've witnessed
I'll never be a part of
This inky creature's hitlist
Gotta live up to expectations to stay
Alive just one day more


How'd you hear me walkin' by?
I was sneakin' sneaky-like, yeah
Guess the halls, they amplify my tip-toein'
I was hidin' well
But I can't now, no, not anymore
I've been found
Now I'm slippin' on the floor
Runnin' now
Holding on to my life 'til I can't run
In the dark, I will survive

Careful got to be so careful
I've never been so prayerful in my life
But nothing's gonna slow me down
Or break my stride careful
Got to be so careful
I've never been so prayerful in my life
But nothing's gonna slow me down
Or break my stride

Hide in the Miracle Station
He's got the lowest skills in observation
Gotta live up to expectations
To stay alive just one day more


How'd you hear me walkin' by?
I was sneakin' sneaky-like, yeah
Guess the halls, they amplify my tip-toein'
I was hidin' well
But I can't now, no, not anymore
I've been found
Now I'm slippin' on the floor
Runnin' now
Holding on to my life 'til I can't run
In the dark, I will survive

How'd you hear me? Sneaky, sneakin'
In the dark, I will survive
