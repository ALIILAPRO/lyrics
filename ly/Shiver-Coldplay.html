		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?

But on and on, from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care

Oh-oh
Did you want me to change?
Well I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear

I'll always be waiting for you

So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?

But on and on, from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care, if you care

Oh-oh
Did you want me to change?
Well I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear

I'll always be waiting for you

Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you, I will always be waiting

And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear, so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you

So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me
