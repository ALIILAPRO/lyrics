		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear the rolling thunder
It's always got a story to tell
If ever you should wonder
You're only falling under its spell

Wait for me darling, I'm almost home
Ignore the thunder, â€˜cause we are all outnumbered

Weary as a lover
Who, saddled with fatigue, never stalls
If ever you should wonder
The farther in, the deeper the fall

Pray for me darling, I'm almost home

cnd when the storm breaks up
Will you still stay close to me?
I know the nightmare's all but done
Can we ever go back to being
Rain on open water?

Fear and love together
The two are never safe for the soul
Stoking at the embers
That with ignition burn out a hole

Pray for me darling, I'm all alone

When the storm breaks up
Will you still stay close to me?
I know the nightmare's almost done
But can we ever go back to being 
Rain on open water?

This is the best I ever could do
This is the last I've given for you
cnd as our bombs fall 
Tears from the sky
I won't reply 

This is the best I ever could do
This is the last I've given for you

When the storm clears up
cnd there's no one close to me
When my nightmare's just begun
Can we ever go back to being
Rain on open water?

Storm clears up
Still stay close to me
When my nightmare's just begun
Can we ever go back to being?
