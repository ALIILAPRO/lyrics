		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mother said that I was holy
My father said that I would burn
My mother said I was an angel
My father said that I would turn
So I believed these words and I turned on myself
'Cause maybe he's right, maybe I'm worthless
Or maybe he's wrong and my mother was right
I got a killer in me to give me purpose

Oh, I can feel a holy war
I can feel a holy war within
No, I can't take a holy war
No, I can't take a holy war again

Is this what you wanted?

I'm gonna bring a little hell
I'm gonna bring a little heaven
You just keep wanting more
With your blood and your whore
I'm gonna bring a little hell
I'm gonna bring a little heaven
It's a beautiful tragedy
You wanna be sick like me
'Cause I can bring a little hell

I was told that I was nothing
Yeah, I was told that I was so pure
And I was told that I was dirty
Yeah, I was told I was the cure

I ask myself, am I God or shit?
Am I the high, the low? I'm fucking worth it
And I ask myself, am I love or hate?
You are the reason I have and why I can't quit

Oh, I can feel a holy war
Yeah, I can feel a holy war within
No, I can't take a holy war
No, I can't take a holy war again

Is this what you wanted?

I'm gonna bring a little hell
I'm gonna bring a little heaven
You just keep wanting more
With your blood and your whore
I'm gonna bring a little hell
I'm gonna bring a little heaven
It's a beautiful tragedy
You wanna be sick like me
'Cause I can bring a little hell

In between, in between
In between hell and heaven
I'm in between, in between
In between hell and heaven
I'm in between, in between
In between hell and heaven
I'm in between, in between
In between hell and heaven

Is this what you wanted?

I'm gonna bring a little hell
I'm gonna bring a little heaven
You just keep wanting more
With your blood and your whore
I'm gonna bring a little hell
I'm gonna bring a little heaven
It's a beautiful tragedy
You wanna be sick like me
'Cause I can bring a little hell

In between, in between
In between hell and heaven
I'm in between, in between
In between hell and heaven
I'm in between, in between
In between hell and heaven
I'm in between, in between
In between hell and heaven

In between, in between
I'm in between, in between
