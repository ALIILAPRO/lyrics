		  Mmm
Wow, ayy, ayy, ayy
Since I have a lover

Feel like a million bucks or somethin'
Feel like we need to be up to somethin'
Not tryna press my luck or nothin'
Don't wanna love you just for fun
Soon as I felt your touch
Feet just left the ground
I been tweakin' since the first time around
Second time around, gettin' on the gown, gotta say a vow

I smoke, you smoke, get lifted, we gone
From the Eastside to the tours I go on
Got too much to do and the days don't get no longer
Cooped up for the winter, we gon' drop this love next summer (summer, summer, summer)
I smoke, you smoke, get lifted, we gone
From the Eastside, to the tours I go on
Got too much to do and the days don't get no longer
Cooped up for the winter, we gon' drop this love next summer

Oh, ah-ah-ah, oh, ah-ah, ah
Since I have a lover (since I have a lover)

Spill like I got nothing left to say
Remember when you wouldn't come out to play
The fear of it, happy it's out the way
You paid me some mind, I had to change
You ain't gotta say too much
My heart just spun around
I been tweakin' since the first time around
At your mama house, sleepin' on the couch, tryna keep it down
Since I have a lover, no more lonely nights
The type of love that you supply, can't televise
Don't need advice, plus you my vice, like what I like
You light my fire, you get me high, reach a new height

I smoke, you smoke, get lifted, we gone
From the Eastside to the tours I go on
Got too much to do and the days don't get no longer
Cooped up for the winter, we gon' drop this love next summer

Summer (summer)
Oh, ah-ah (oh, oh)
Since I have a lover
(Say it one more time)
Since I have a lover
Oh, ah-ah-ah (since I)
Oh, ah-ah-ah

Since I have a lover
Since I have a lover
Since I have, since I have (since I have a lover)
She's an easy lover, man
She'll take your heart and you won't know it
Crazy that lil' shawty cuttin' right into my soul, I know
Since I, since I have a
Such an easy lover, checkin' for no other (since I have a lover)
She's an easy lover, man
She'll take your heart and you won't know it
Crazy that lil' shawty cuttin' right into my soul, I know
Oh, I know
