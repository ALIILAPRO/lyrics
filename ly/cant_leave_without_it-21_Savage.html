		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car (yeah)
We don't abide by the law (no)
You don't know what I done saw (saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (stick)
Checks I deposit (checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

Lot of model bitches check for me
Nigga, don't check for me 'less you got checks for me
I kept a stick like a hobo, no checkin' me
Way back when D-Lo had the spot in Trestletree
So many hoes had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through
They sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee

One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro
Break yourself, leave his brains on the dashboard

I'm with Ced and Lil' Baby (yeah)
We got four choppers that's full (21)
Way before rappin', on God, I was trappin'
Sneakin' my Glock in Le Coeur (on God)
I got my K from Osama Bin Laden
Lil' nigga he signed this shit (straight up)
I'm 4L Gang, if you reach for my chain
Then a nigga gon' die in this bitch (on God)
A-B-C-D-E-F-G Wagon, y'all niggas doin' that big cappin' (21)
I ain't with the friendly shit
Closest thing y'all gettin' to a handshake is the beat clappin' (21)
Your mama gon' have to make a GoFundMe
Y'all niggas keep doing that sneak jabbin' (straight up)
Gucci had to kill the whole woods
Just to make Young Savage this motherfuckin' mink jacket (21)

VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (no)
You don't know what I done saw (saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (stick)
Checks I deposit (checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

Cash in and cash out (cash in and cash out)
I am not lookin' for clout (nah)
I knew I would figure it out (I knew)
I took the millionaire route (run it up)
Popped a pill got my head in the cloud (huh?)
Say my name, it'll bring out a crowd (crowd)
We got paid, now my family proud (on God)
I been drippin' this drip since a child

I hit your bitch, she a jump off
Cartier bracelets for her, they don't come off
They get the swag from Atlanta and run off
I make the best one, it stick like a town hall
Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out
S65, I'm in a robot
I'm a real one, I ain't running from nobody
Hellcat fast, you know that I show out
Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out
Rich nigga, I come straight out the poor house
Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Dead and Me, Ced and more ahks
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house
I'm with Savage in the city doin' donuts (skrrt)
Youngins with me, they got fire, they gon' go nuts
Quarter-million in a baby blue Goyard
Buy it cash then I go in the motor
Drive fast, ain't no pullin' me over
Play with bags, you can tell by the odor
No alcohol, go get me a new soda

VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (no)
You don't know what I done saw (saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (stick)
Checks I deposit (checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

Yeah, niggas tryna drip like the boy, yeah
I don't gotta get no award, yeah
Live in the bank, don't do fraud, yeah
Two hundred racks on my arm, yeah
I been fuckin' superstars, yeah
Her pussy good, buy a car yeah
You niggas ain't makin' no noise, yeah
You niggas ain't makin' no noise (on God)
