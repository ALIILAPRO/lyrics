		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't you call me
What we both know I am
Ooh you know I am
Ooh you know I am

Why don't you call me
What we both know I am
What I am
What I am
What I am

And I said
Why don't you call me
What we both know
Why don't you call me
What we both know

And I said
Why don't you call me
What we both know
What I am
What I am
What I am
