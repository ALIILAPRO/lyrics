		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hand in hand
The flowers understand
That we're fine, you and I
Hands are tied
I don't mind
I'll make you be okay

But recently, everyone says they are seeing less of me
I could do better if I had energy
Be like I used to be
And frequently, I picture myself walking straight into the sea
Laughing as the waves come rolling to my knees
What a place to be

Side by side
You keep me safe from their static getting through
Please be fine
It's too late now
To go leave
You behind

But recently, everyone says they are seeing less of me
I could do better if I had energy
Be like I used to be
And frequently, I picture myself walking straight into the sea
Laughing as the waves come rolling to my knees
What a place to be

And it's a lovely day for
Swimming
Pretend I didn't see the red flags that said don't go
Cause if the storm out there's beginning
I'll find it for myself
And not cause someone told me so

But recently, everyone says they are seeing less of me
I could do better if I had energy
Be like I used to be
And frequently, I picture myself walking straight into the sea
Laughing as the waves come rolling to my knees
What a place to be
