		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If all the enemies threw a party
Would you light the candles?
Would you drink the wine?
While watching television?

Watch the animals
And all the tragedies 
To sell your arteries 
To buy my casket, go!

It better be black
It better be tight
It better be just my size

I'm stuck in these metro malls 
And airport halls
And all these schoolgirls 

I'm not asking
You're not telling
He's not dead
He only looks that
Way I know it
Take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self destruction 
Hopeless for ya
Sing a song for
California 

I bought the enemies rooms to hang
Where there were knives again 
You can watch them stab me on your television 
Stop the halls
Because the bathroom walls
Would never like to say
About the lives you're putting down

It better be white
It better be cut
It better be just my size

Until my capillaries 
Burst of boredom
I'll be waiting

I'm not laughing 
You're not joking
I'm not dead 
I only dress that
Way I know it
Take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self destruction 
Hopeless for ya 
Sing a song for 
California

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Whoever you are
Whoever you are 

La la la la 

Cause we got the bomb 
We got the bomb 
Lets go!
We got the bomb
We got the bomb
Lets go!
We got the bomb 
We got the bomb 
Lets go! 
We got the bomb 
We got the bomb
Lets go!

Way I know it
Take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self destruction 
Hopeless for ya 
Sing a prayer for
California 

We got the bomb
We got the bomb
We got the bomb
We got the bomb
