		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I knew then what I know now
And are we ever gonna get to higher ground
I wish I knew then what I know now
And are we ever gonna get to higher ground (higher ground, higher ground)

Free your head and look up at the sun
We're never leaving
Spread your wings and watch yourself become
Already dreaming

I lean you break, you push I bloom
My conscience shakes when our shadows move
Spread your wings and watch yourself become

We're never leaving (leaving, leaving)
We're never leaving

I wish I knew then what I know now
And are we ever gonna get to higher ground
I wish I knew then what I know now
And are we ever gonna get to higher ground (higher ground, higher ground)

Free your head and look up at the sun
We're never leaving
Spread your wings and watch yourself become
Already dreaming

I lean you break, you push I bloom
My conscience shakes when our shadows move
Spread your wings and watch yourself become

We're never leaving

We're never leaving

We're never leaving (leaving, leaving)

We're never leaving (leaving)
