		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your cruel device
Your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch
(Don't touch)
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much
(Too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins
(And pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screamin' my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin
(Deep in)
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch
(Don't touch)
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much
(Too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

I wanna love you but I better not touch
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
