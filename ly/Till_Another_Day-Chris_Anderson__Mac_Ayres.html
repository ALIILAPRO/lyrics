		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could make it there
I could make it back
But everywhere I turn baby it's a trap
Seen a pretty place 
Can you meet me there?

I been laughing out
But can I get a line?
It seems it's only jokes time after time 
Nobody call
Till another day

And oh, have you ever wanted to float away?
And oh, have you ever 
Wanted to float away?

And oh (Don't think nothing's gonna change nothing)
Have you ever wanted to float away?
And oh (Give me one reason to go and change my mind) 
Have you ever wanted to float away?

And oh (Don't think nothing's gonna change nothing)
Have you ever wanted to float away?
And oh (Give me one reason to go and change my mind) 
Have you ever wanted to float away?

I'm on Fire 
Shit's burning
Fire
Fire
(Nothings gonna change nothing)
Fire
Shits burning up
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire 
Fire
