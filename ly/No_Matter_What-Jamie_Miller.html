		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're hearts been broken, bruised 
And pieces went missing
But if you let down all your walls 
I swear that I'll fix it
I know you're scared to hurt those close to you
Oh, I've been in that position 
So no matter what you say or do, I'll always listen

Just know 

Even on the dark days
Even through the heartache 
Even when you're too afraid to say you need someone
Even when it's hopeless
Darling, you should know this 
I'm not giving up on you 
I'm here no matter what
No matter what

Is there a cloud above your bed 
Tonight as you're sleeping?
Is there a hole inside your chest 
Where your heart was beating
I know you're hearing voices in your head
But darling ,don't believe them
'Cause crying's just the sound of a broken heart healing

Just know 

Even on the dark days
Even through the heartache 
Even when you're too afraid to say you need someone
Even when it's hopeless
Darling, you should know this 
I'm not giving up on you 
I'm here no matter what 

And I know it might get harder
On the way to brighter days
But no matter how bad it gets
I'm gonna love you anyway

Even on the dark days
Even through the heartache 
Even when you're too afraid to say you need someone
Even when it's hopeless
Darling, you should know this 
I'm not giving up on you 
I'm here no matter what
No matter what
