		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just hear me out, I know you're down
When hope looks lost, there's no one to be found
But I won't give up on you (I won't give up on you)
You gotta dig deep, and bury all the thoughts
The thoughts that tell you, you're not good enough
The critics, the cynics, say you'll never make it
Prove em' all wrong, they are mistaken

Though you may walk alone, you're worth more than you know (More than you know)

Look me right in the eyes, I promise everything will be alright
We are all in this fight, (Though the night may be dark a new day brings new light)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh

I always get built up, but broke right back down
I ask the questions, with no answers to be found
What have I done? What did I say? I guess this is just the price I pay

Though you may walk alone, you're worth more than you know

Look me right in the eyes, I promise everything will be alright
We are all in this fight, (Though the night may be dark a new day brings new light)
Remember all the times, all the times you felt so alive
When all the pain subsides, (Lets go back there, take me back there)

Hold on, 'cause you don't know what is going to happen
Stay strong, your life's worth more than you know

When your mind gets tired, and your heart grows cold
When you find yourself at the crossroads, just don't let go
When your mind gets tired, and your heart grows cold
When you find yourself at the crossroads, just don't lose hope

Look me right in the eyes, I promise everything will be alright
We are all in this fight, (Though the night may be dark a new day brings new light)
Remember all the times, all the times you felt so alive
When all the pain subsides, (Lets go back there, take me back there)

Hold on, 'cause you don't know what is going to happen
Stay strong, your life's worth more than you know
