		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two hearts beat as one
Disguise your mind and feel the hold
This drone that was of our love
In time we move
This turning factor
Feel the groove
Release the touch that moves you

Oh this is her
No regrets
I embrace your defense
Took the best
You were my wish
I admit that I will never feel alone
Once I call, oh, you home

Push towards the dance floor
And together we'll show them who's boss
We'll set a fire once more

Oh this is her
No regrets
I embrace your defense
Took the best
You were my wish
I admit that I will never feel alone
Once I call, oh, you home

Oh maybe its not now or later
Till you save the best for last
I want to be everything you need, oh

Oh this is her
No regrets
I embrace your defense
Took the best
You were my wish
I admit that I will never feel
No I will never feel alone
I stumbled in mighty tone
Where the record spins around
Please turn me over
Find me into sleep
Oh girl
Please wait
Bring me home
