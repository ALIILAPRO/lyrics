		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You would have loved me as I was so I changed it all
You would have loved me as I was so I changed it all
You've been toying with the line, for a while
Gently stroking my ego

I opened myself, watched from a bird's eye
The rush of being adored by you, it felt so raw
It used to feel good when you looked at me
It used to feel good

But no you can't have it, you can't have it now
It used to feel good when you stood with me
It used to feel good
But no you can't have it, you can't have it any more


Did you ever tell her who she was sleeping next to?
Or did you hide that too?
Sometimes I see her face and I feel an ache
It use to feel good
It use to feel good

You would have loved me as I'm so I changed it all
You wouldn't love her as she was so I changed it all
You would have loved me as I'm so I changed it all
You wouldn't love her as she was so I changed it all

It used to feel good when you looked at me
It used to feel good
But no you can't have it, you can't have it now

It used to feel good when you stood with me
It used to feel good
But no you can't have it, you can't have it any more
It used to feel good
It used to feel good
It used to feel good
