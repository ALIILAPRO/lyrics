		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's still something there
Between the wires that you're scared of
All the things you're not aware of
But you know, you know you feel
You belong to me and I belong to you
And so on and so on again we go on
As if nothing else were real

[Chorus]
And I need you behind the gun
I'll be the one to come undone
And I need you behind the gun
I'll be the one to come undone
I'll be the one to come undone

[Verse 2]
I can take you there
But it hurts to go so crazy
All the details get so hazy
It slows down faster every day
When the sun goes down
We cover all the mirrors
Just to see a little clearer
Why it was we were afraid

[Chorus]
And I need you behind the gun
I'll be the one to come undone
And I need you behind the gun
I'll be the one to come undone
I'll be the one to come undone
