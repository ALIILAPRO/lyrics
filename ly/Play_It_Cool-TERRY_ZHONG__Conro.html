		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Across the room
The spotlight dancin' on you
(Dancin' on you)

I hope these words they come out right
Can't be waiting on me all night

Just gonna play it cool
Can't take my eyes off of you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I can't get some time with you

Just gonna play it cool
(If I can't get some time with you)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
(If I can't get some time with you)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)

Making a move don't wanna act like a fool
(Act like a fool)

I hope these words they come out right
Can't be waiting on me all night

(If I can't get some time with you)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
(If I can't get some time with you)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)

Just gonna play it cool
Can't take my eyes off of you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I can't get some time with you

Just gonna play it cool
(If I can't get some time with you)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
(If I can't get some time with you)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)

Just gonna play it cool
