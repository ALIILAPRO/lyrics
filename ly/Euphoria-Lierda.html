		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know how he gets when I'm around you
You know how he gets when I'm around you

Why you tryna be somebody in the city when the lights go down
Stay the night I'll fuck you good
I'll be there till the sun goes down (sun goes down)
Say you wanna see lights
Euphoria just for the night
Baby you know ima hit it right
Do all the things he won't like
Yeah you know girl (you know girl)
You know how he gets when I'm around you
You know how he gets when I'm around you

Fuck what you think about it
You can try to find things that you find in me
If you he ain't tryna give you everything you need
You should leave that door find your way to me
Down baby
Sit down
Baby listen
To the sound
Got my lips down on your hips now you know

Somebody in the city when the lights go down

You know
I got all my cs I got Louis I got more
Anything you need baby
I can give it all oh
I can give it all yeah
Baby show me what you want yeah

Why you tryna be somebody in the city when the lights go down
Stay the night I'll fuck you good
I'll be there till the sun goes down (sun goes down)
Say you wanna see lights
Euphoria just for the night
Baby you know ima hit it right
Do all the things he won't like
Yeah you know girl (you know girl)
You know how he gets when I'm around you
You know how he gets when I'm around you
