		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my, my, my, what you do to me
Like lighting when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heavens and stars above

Ooh Lord have mercy I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jumpstart my heart with your love

There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

I couldn't leave even if I wanted to
'Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers
The scent of your lingers
My mind running wild
The thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
Though you can give it all
But it's never enough no

There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

Hold me in your arms
Burns like a fire
Electricity
When you're close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity
