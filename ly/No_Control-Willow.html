		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

I know I said I'd fix it all
But then I drank and smoked too much
just like I always do, it's not you
I don't want you back
I'm so confused, I thought you wanted that

I try to stick to the facts
I try to learn from the past
My head's down when I search for the path
Like I always do, always do
I'm an equation, I don't know the math

Don't wanna see, don't wanna speak
Forget to breathe, forget to be
Just like I always do
It's not for you, it's not for me
Forget to speak the truth
I always do, always do

Saw you last night tryna get the past right
Just like you do
Until I change my mind

Ooh

I fuckin' had enough
My mind and heart are breakin' up
But now it's just too much to love that way
I'll bear the pain of all the moments gone

Where you tried to save me
And I'm stuck to the ceiling, barely feeling
All my control is gone
All my control is gone

Don't wanna see, don't wanna speak
Forget to breathe, forget to be
Just like I always do
It's not for you, it's not for me
Forget to speak the truth
I always do, always do

Saw you last night tryna get the past right
Just like you do
Until I change my mind

(Ooh) ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh
