		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A ghost of a mist was on the field 
The grey and the green together 
The noise of a distant farm machine 
Out of the first light came 

A tattered necklace of hedge and trees 
On the southern side of the hill 
Betrays where the border runs between 
Where Mary Dunoon's boy fell 

Easter here again, a time for the blind to see 
Easter, surely now can all of your hearts be free 

Out of the port of Liverpool 
Bound for the North of Ireland 
The wash of the spray and horsetail waves 
The roll of the sea below 

And Easter here again, a time for the blind to see 
Easter, surely now can all of your hearts be free 

What will you do? 
Make a stone of your heart? 
Will you set things right? 
When you tear them apart? 
Will you sleep at night? 
With the plough and the stars alight? 

What will you do? 
With the wire and the gun? 
That'll set things right 
When it's said and done? 
Will you sleep at night? 
Is there so much love to hide? 

Forgive, Forget 
Sing "Never again."
