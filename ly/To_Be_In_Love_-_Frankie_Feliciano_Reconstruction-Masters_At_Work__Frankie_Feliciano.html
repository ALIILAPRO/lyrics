		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Want you to take your broom and swept up my yard
You better brush it good or we could fall apart

Don't give me no shortcut thing you have all day & night
I had to satisfy, so you better do it right

Work what you're waiting for
Work put your back in it
Work just a little bit more
Work sure you're wanting it now
Work till your body's hurting
Work working hard and long
Work when you finish that
Work I want you God damn tongue

Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up
Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up

It's what you come to do, just remember that
And don't pick me fruits, you can put them back
You start of working nice, with your big broomstick
Now you're easing back, like you're afraid of brick

Work what you're waiting for
Work put your back in it
Work just a little bit more
Work sure you're wanting it now
Work till your body's hurting
Work working hard and long
Work when you finish that
Work I want you God damn tongue

Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up
Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up

Oh yes, yes baby, I like the work you do on my yard
You do reel good work yard man

I find you lookin' nervous like you're afraid to fail
Now you're making excuse 'bout your feeling pain
Just don't waste my time cause you will get me mad
Have a bit down there, that could bite your broomstick hard

Work what you're waiting for
Work put your back in it
Work justa a little bit more
Work sure you're wanting it now
Work till your body's hurting
Work working hard and long
Work when you finish that
Work I want you God damn tongue

Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up
Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up 

Ladies, you know that if you don't have a yard man
You can't be a hard man
You know what I'm talking about
Guys you know what I'm talking about too, not so?

And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come
And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come
So if a boy want to test you, tell him come, come
And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come

Work, work, work, work, work
