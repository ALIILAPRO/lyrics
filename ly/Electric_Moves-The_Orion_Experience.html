		  Electric Moves

Somebody told me you're a chameleon
c secret agent working nine to five
Here comes the weekend, your colors change and
You hit the floor, that's where you come alive

When you walk the streets you hear disco beats
cnd the City's like a Castle where the party never ends
So you ditch you vest for a party dress
Now you feel like Cinderella until 4 cM

Somebody told me you've got Electric Moves
Out on the floor you're like lightning striking
Somebody told me you've got the spark in you
Out on the floor where life is so exciting
Somebody told me that's where you go to feel

c-li-i-i-i-ive
c-li-i-i-i-ive
c-li-i-i-i-ive

That's where you go to feel clive

Verse 2

Somebody told me you've got Electric Moves
Out on the floor you're like lightning striking
Somebody told me you've got the spark in you
Out on the floor where life is so exciting
Somebody told me that's where you go to feel

Music playin' all night!
This is where you go to lead your double life
Leave your worries far behind
Lose your inhibitions baby, lose your mind
Come on DJ! Make it right
Keep the party going till the morning light

Yeah! you've got Electric Moves
Out on the floor you're like lightning striking
Somebody told me you've got the spark in you
Out on the floor where life is so exciting
Somebody told me that's where you go to feel

c-li-i-i-i-ive
c-li-i-i-i-ive
c-li-i-i-i-ive

That's where you go to feel it!
