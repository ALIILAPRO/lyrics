		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted wanna jump inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

Honey got a sexy all steamin'
She givin' hotness a new meanin'
Perfection mama you gleamin'
Inception you got a brother dreamin', dreamin'

Damn baby I'm feignin'
I'm tryna holler at you, I'm screamin'
Let me love you down this evenin'
Love you love you ya you know you are my demon

Girl we could form a team and
I could be the king you could be the queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleanin'
I love you long time so you know the meanin'

Oh baby I can't come down so please come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

Boy I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted wanna drown inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

Honey got me runnin like I'm Flo Joe
Signs her name on my heart with an X-O
Love's so sweet got me vexed oh
I wanna wish it right back like presto, yes

Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around 'fore I toast to the best time
We L-O-L back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love I confess I'm

Somethin' 'bout her smile and that combo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin' like Mr. Roboto

Oh baby I can't come down so please come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

Boy I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna drown inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

This has been a switch up
Switch up, switch up
I just can't not
Sunk in your bed rock
Caught up in your love shock
Knocked out by your cold shot
I'm stuck in your head li-
Switch up
Can't get out won't quit
Makin' me feign, give it to me
I want it all, know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy
Switch up
Addicted I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it it
Switch up
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase ya out of my memory
I just can't
Switch up
