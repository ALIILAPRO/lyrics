I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round
With somethin', somethin'
They Like my sound
They think I'm funky

My name is Moto Moto
Yeah, You say it double
Say my name
[Moto Moto]
Say it again
[Moto Moto]
I am nice and smooth
So nice and sassy
[Sassy]
No other Hippos, yeah
Don't wanna get next to me

I like em chunky, chunky, chunky
chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
Chunky, chunky, chunky
chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
Plumpy

I like em hippos
That's in the wild
I like they attitude
I like they style
The way they walk, walk
The way they talk, talk
I like 'em witta appetite
To eat a shark, shark
And when a dog barks, she'll eat em too
I love every inch,
Oh yes I do

I like em chunky, chunky, chunky
chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
pumpy, plumpy, plumpy
Chunky, chunky, chunky
chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy

Ain't nothing wrong
With lovin' chunky
I like 'em funny
I like 'em spunky
I like 'em witty
I like 'em smart... with brains
Girl I Like your big...
[What you say]
Your big ol' heart
What
Girl you crazy
She drive me crazy
[Crazy]
I love my lady
She nice and shapely
[Shapely]
She nice and spacey
Take so much space up
Like a big ol' spaceship
Movin' so gracious
Yes

It's all in the way she moves
It's all in the way she moves
It's all in the way she
It's all in the way
It's all in the way she moves
When she do, when she do,  she do,  she do,
she do, she do, she do, she do, she do, she do,
she do, she do, she do, she do, she do, she do,
she do, she do, she do, she do, she do, she do,
she do, she do, [Get it girl] she do, she do, she do,
she do, she do, she do, she do, [Get it girl]she do, she do,

Chunky, chunky, chunky

Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
pumpy, plumpy, plumpy
Chunky, chunky, chunky
chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
plumpy

Ain't nottin' wrong
[Chunky]
[Plumpy]
Ain't nottin' wrong
With loving chunky
[Chunky]
Chunky, chunky, chunky
and plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
