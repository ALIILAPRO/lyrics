		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Don't give up, no, no)
(Don't give up, no, no)
(Don't give up, no, no)

Do you ever feel like the tear drops just won't dry?
(They just won't dry, they just won't dry)
Smiling in a crowd when all you wanna do is cry
(You wanna cry, you wanna cry)
Do you ever feel? Do you ever feel alone?
(Alone, alone, alone, alone)
Do you ever feel like there's just nowhere to go?
(Nowhere to go)

When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Got you feeling low
When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Don't give up, no, no

Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no

Dancing with the sun but there's thunder in your mind
(Thunder in your mind, thunder in your mind)
You're gonna be okay
I know it's hard but you'll survive
(Yeah, you'll survive, yeah, you'll survive)
Do you ever feel? Do you ever feel alone?
(Alone, alone, alone, alone)

When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Got you feeling low
When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Don't give up, no, no

Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no

Keep running through the clouds
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna make it out
You'll keep flying
When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Don't give up, no, no

Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no
