		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Sittin' here stuck in traffic, five o'clock madness
Shoulda took the long way home
Like some copper field magic, showed up like a rabbit
Stopped light or runway show
Dark sunglasses on
I pull right over
Gotta take my chances
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me, woo

Hey girl, tell me
What you doin' later tonight?
Call me crazy
But I was thinkin' maybe we might
I'll take you downtown, table for two
I keep it laid back, just me and you right now
I'm trippin' over my feet
'Cause the way that you were lookin'
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Takin' off your sunglasses, if you don't mind me askin'
What's your name and where you from?
I know we're movin' kinda fast but I gotta kinda have it
Put your number in my phone
We can be so classic
June and Johnny Cash it
Now I got you laughin'
So tell me, were you lookin' at me?

Hey girl, tell me
What you doin' later tonight?
Call me crazy
But I was thinkin' maybe we might
I'll take you downtown, table for two
I keep it laid back, just me and you right now
I'm trippin' over my feet
'Cause the way that you were lookin'
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

We can be so classic
June and Johnny Cash it
You and me right now

Hey girl, tell me
What you doin' later tonight?
Ooh, call me crazy
But I was thinkin' maybe we might
I'll take you downtown, table for two
I keep it laid back, just me and you right now
I'm trippin' over my feet
'Cause the way that you were lookin'
I was hopin' you were lookin' at
Baby, hey, what you doin' later tonight?
Call me crazy
But I was thinkin' maybe we might
Oh, the way that you were lookin'
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
