		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Alright, it took me three days
To send you this but, sorry
I was in a depression
But I'm trying to come out of it now"

Every morning I wake up
From a dream of you
Holding me
Underwater
Is that a dream or a memory?

Held my breath for a decade
Dyed my hair blue
To match my lips
Cool of me to try
Pretty cool I'm still alive

I beat it like a dead horse
I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record
I sang along
To a silly little song

I said I beat it like a dead horse
I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record
I sang along
A shitty never ending song

Sometimes it's good to be
The bigger person
But I'm so small I can't compare
And after all, it's only fair
Yeah

I got what I deserved
I was the other woman first
Other others on the line
But I kept trying to make it work

I beat it like a dead horse
I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record
I sang along
To a silly little song

I said I beat it like a dead horse
I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record
I sang along
To your shitty little song

(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya) 
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya) 
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)

When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried

I beat it like a dead horse
I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record
I sang along
To a silly little song

I said I beat it like a dead horse
I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record
I sang along
And now you get another song

(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya) 
(ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya) 
(ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
And now you get another song
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya) 
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
And now you get another song
