		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought that you would be 
standing here so close to me 
there's so much I feel that I should say 
but words can wait until some other day 

Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear

Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you

Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long time
Haven't felt like this my dear

Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams
I dreamed about you

Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Long, long time
