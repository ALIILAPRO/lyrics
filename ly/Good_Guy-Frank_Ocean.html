		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
Ahh, first time I done saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do
Ahh, here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

Bitches, nigga
All the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah, I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga
That shit, Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how to feel about bi-
