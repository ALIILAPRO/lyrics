		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night when the sky turns red up above
I feel the beat in my veins, and I'm searching for love
You know that hips don't lie, I leave you hypnotized
Just give me one more try to make you feel that vibe

When it goes (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
My body is a weapon (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
We're gonna hit the floor (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
We're gonna make it happen (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
Now gimme some more

I will push it to the limit
And everybody's feeling the sound of the night
I don't wanna stop, we push it to the limit
Together we will crash the morning light

ブ·チ·ア·ガ·レ boom, boom, boom, moving
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, shaking
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, jumping
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, stomping
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

(アゲ) キラっとしちゃう
(アゲ) フワっとしちゃう
(アゲ) ドキっとしちゃう
(アゲ) 小悪魔しちゃうけど
大丈夫?
瞳に映した
笑顔の魔法で
罠に誘い込む

When it goes (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
My body is a weapon (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
We're gonna hit the floor (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
We're gonna make it happen (ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
Now gimme some more

I will push it to the limit
And everybody's feeling the sound of the night
I don't wanna stop, we push it to the limit
Together we will crash the morning light

ブ·チ·ア·ガ·レ boom, boom, boom, moving
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, shaking
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, jumping
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, stomping
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

I'm here for the moment
Here for the beat
Here for the love and the friends I need, you know
That I'll be there for good, whoa

I'm here for the moment
Here for the beat
Here for the love and friends I need, you know
That I'll be there for good (ra-ta-ta-ta)

I go fucking crazy 'cause I'm waiting for the drop
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Let's go

So tell me baby, can I get a- (ooh, ooh)
So hear me now (ooh, ooh)
You know what I want (ooh, ooh)
Now everybody's getting down

I will push it to the limit
And everybody's feeling the sound of the night
I don't wanna stop, we push it to the limit
Together we will crash the morning light

ブ·チ·ア·ガ·レ boom, boom, boom, moving
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, shaking
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, jumping
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (ooh, ooh)
Boom, boom, boom, stomping
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Everybody (ooh, ooh)
Out of control (ooh, ooh)
Everybody (ooh, ooh)
Out of control (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now everybody's getting down
