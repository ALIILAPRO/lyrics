		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't think we should be together
This is the end of our forever
I think we should go our separate ways
You call me a narcissist but you're manipulative
Remember all the time and energy that I'd give
Almost gave you my heart then you decided
To turn you back on me and start acting self righteous
You put a mask on every day when you wake up
Guess that was the reason that we had to break up
You change your face like it was fucking makeup
And I'm so god damn sad but I will never ever say it cuz
It don't show
It don't show
Everything that glitters damn sure ain't gold
I'm still in love and you'll never know
It don't show
It don't show
It don't show
It don't show
Everything that glitters damn sure ain't gold
I'm still in love and you'll never know because
It don't show
It don't show
Life made you this way I guess it's not your fault
People and their drama and sexual assault
Constantly crying but won't tell me the cause
Losing your sanity writing on the walls
Drowned yourself in vanity trying to hide your flaws
Ready to give my heart you said it's not enough
You've got all these demons and they're always acting up
I'll always forgive you though because I miss those night calls
Truth is that I'm still so mad that you left
You were in a dream and I overslept
When we got close It seems I overstepped
You're weighted down by all the secrets that you've kept but
It don't show
It don't show
Everything that glitters damn sure ain't gold
I'm still in love and you'll never know
It don't show
It don't show
It don't show
It don't show
Everything that glitters damn sure ain't gold
I'm still in love and you'll never know because
It don't show
It don't show
Sometimes I wish I was invisible
Sometimes I wish I was invisible
