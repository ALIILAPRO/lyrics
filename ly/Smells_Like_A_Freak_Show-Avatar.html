		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smells like a freakshow
Right where I want to be
Come taste the dirt
The dirt, the dirt
I smell a freak show
There's something wrong with me
Want it to hurt
It hurts, it hurts
I

I need something to sedate me
But I can't afford the high
Give me something to help me escape
Smells like a freakshow

God in a casket
Gone for eternities
We've got no rules
No rules, no rules
I god in a casket
Lost all authority
Come watch the fools
The fools, the fools
I

I need something to sedate me
But I can't afford the high
Give me something to help me escape
Smells like a freakshow
Smells like a freakshow

I need something to sedate me
But I can't afford the high
Give me something to help me escape
Smells like a freakshow

To sedate me but I can't afford the high
Give me something to help me escape
Smells like a freakshow
