		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mistral came along just like a hurricane
Blew down all the walls and gave me life again
Turned the world around
Blinded me with sound (and there's no other way)
Took my hand and led me through the labyrinth
Showed me all the sadness and the suffering
Tears she turned to joy
And through the wall of noise told me

No need to worry about the world (about the world)
You can't see the beauty for all the hurt (for all the hurt)
Turn the world around (oh oh oh oh)
Blind them with your sound
'Cause it's the end of night

(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)

Mistral came into my life like a wind of change
Crept in through my eyes and seeped inside my brain
When stars were growing dim
She showed me the world within and told me

No need to worry about the world (about the world)
You can't see the beauty for all the hurt (for all the hurt)
Turn the world around (oh oh oh oh)
Blind them with your sound
'Cause it's the end of night

(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)

This must be the end of night (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
This must be the end of night (oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
