		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you're just the same as I used to know
Always playing games in the strangest ways
And you come and go, go, go, just like before, 'fore, oh
I should've known
Oh, you're just the same as I used to know
Always playing games in the strangest ways
And you come and go, go, go, just like before, 'fore, oh
I should've known

(I should've known)
And you're running me of hope
(I would've known)
Just walking down my road
(I could've known)
It's in my blood and bones (whoa)

But it's just like an old friend
Coming up, yeah, I know them
Drop top in the driveway
Locked up 'cause it's slow then
I've been looking for problems
One look and I'm all in
Is it late in the morning?
If I fall down then I can keep crawling

And it's just like an old friend
Coming up, yeah, I know them

Oh, you're just the same as I used to know
Always playing games in the strangest ways
And you come and go, go, go, just like before, 'fore, oh
I should've known

(I should've known)
And you're running me of hope
(I would've known)
Just walking down my road
(I could've known)
It's in my blood and bones (whoa)

And it's just like an old friend
Coming up, yeah, I know them
Drop top in the driveway
Locked up 'cause it's slow then
I've been looking for problems
One look and I'm all in
Is it late in the morning?
If I fall down then I can keep crawling

And it's just like an old friend
Coming up, yeah, I know them
Drop top in the driveway
Locked up 'cause it's slow then
I've been looking for problems
One look and I'm all in
Is it late in the morning?
If I fall down then I can keep crawling

I got a couple old friends
I swear I'm tryna make amends
Forget the years I haven't been
And we can ride around again like before
Making them fire on lows
I got a couple old friends, ya

And it's just like an old friend
Coming up, yeah, I know them
Drop top in the driveway
Locked up 'cause it's slow then
I've been looking for problems
One look and I'm all in
Is it late in the morning?
If I fall down then I can keep crawling

(I should've known)
And it's just like an old friend
Coming up, yeah, I know them
(I would've known)
Drop top in the driveway
Locked up 'cause it's slow then
I've been looking for problems
One look and I'm all in
Is it late in the morning?
If I fall down then I can keep crawling
