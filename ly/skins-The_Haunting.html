		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am an anarchist
When I'm gone I won't be missed
But I don't want to die like this
I want to heal
And I don't want to lie like this
I want to feel
But I don't need that anymore
I want to...
Hurt
Feel
Taste
Real
Blood
Spill
Love
Kill
I need no introduction
Welcome to the greatest show
I can teach you how to ruin your relationships
With everyone important that you know
Tell me if you want to...
Hurt
Feel
Taste
Real
Blood
Spill
Love
Kill
Hey, did I ruin your night?
Hey, did I ruin you?
Hey, did I ruin your night?
Hey, did I ruin you?
I am an anarchist
I am your fool
