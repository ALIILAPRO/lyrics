		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words a cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving, fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer her name to the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothing and, honey, if nothings gained?

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit here and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's getting late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mac explained, there will be darkness again

Let it hurt, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me 'cause if secrets were like saints
Keep my body from the fire, hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me, and if secrets were like seeds
When I'm laying on the marble, marble of flowers you have made

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit here and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's getting late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mac explained, there will be darkness again

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't have hoped to know, but here I stand

And there's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit here and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's getting late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mac explained, there will be darkness again
