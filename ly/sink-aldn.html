		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what, what's all, to him?
Don't complicate, I'm the one that's won
And I've got to tell you why I run
Every time I'm in too deep

But I just can't sink
But I just can't sink
I just can't sink
But I just can't sink
But I just can't

Tie me up, concrete my feet
Drop me off a bridge, I still, I still stay up all night
Tell me why you run every night? You wait for me
You leave on your light

But I just can't sink
I just can't sink
But I just can't sink
But I just can't

You can't let me walk around your mind
You can't let me waste any more of your time
I've fallen far

But I just can't sink
But I just can't sink
I just can't sink
But I just can't sink
But I just can't
But I just can't sink
I just can't sink
But I just can't sink
But I just can't
