		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in a cab
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up
They're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, "who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?
She's gotta be from out of town"

So hard with my girls not around me
Its definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up
They're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
Something stops me every time (every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up
They're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up
They're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
