		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's another cold day
In that old November way
Once again it's begin

I'm stuck and
Out astray
And you came in like a wave
Through the same paled grin, I gave

Just breathe
Just breathe

And the gulp's from the gut
I'm flat on the floor
There's no use riding waves

Crashed to the shore
Disaster paths' aftermaths
One splash
To the ground

And I'm at best an island
And you're an ocean
You surround
And you came in like a wave
Through the same pale grin, I gave
I can just breathe
Just breathe
I can just breathe

Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
