		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  flawless your pure elitist cult looks so flawless now
the concept of annihilation I'm a sinner without cause
an aberration unbound blackness lays her wings on me
the mirror lies but I stand still I hammer all the
nails inside the burning chaos of my mind feel it flow
feel it blow feel it rage inside your heart feel it
turn feel it burn nothing's left to tear apart burn
you see me burn you feel me burn beneath the rays of
a colder sun burning ice and velvet rain 
(I know I have to die for) falling from the liar's
den (get rid of all this sorrow) begging for the hands
of rain (you know you have to die for) a venom leech
is what I am (inside I feel so hollow) self-deceive
your brain crawling in the corner of your brain impostor
guess is what I am guess is what I've always been been
so disgusted by this world yet I feel it crawling underneath
you feed my wrath and heal my fury turn me to the beast
I despise rain of glass nails of fear winds of hatred
gather here cold emotions turn to dust all the shit
you worship I distrust I can't have enough of burning
hatred shape my wings in blood and anger I feel it
flow and serves me right there's nothing left inside of me
