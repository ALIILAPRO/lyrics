		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  1 AM still early
Spreading 'round your perfume
Running 'round with them memories
With that heart full of chrome
High up on that sofa
So far from home
I could tell that he hurt you
Drained everything from you
But if you tryna be alone
Let it all go, baby let 'em all go
But if you tryna be alone
Let your girls go, baby let your girls know
You
Say so much in your silence
And your eyes
Your eyes whisper with violence
1AM still early
Just touching my zone
Jaw swinging from early
Tryna float through the lows
Running from the morning
I've been running from home
When I heard those eyes calling
It's easier to fall in
But if you tryna be alone
Let 'em all go, baby let 'em all go
But if you tryna be alone
Let your girls go, baby let your girls know
You
Say so much in your silence
And your eyes
Your eyes whisper with violence
You
Say so much in your silence
And your eyes
Your eyes whisper with violence
Say so much in your silence
You
Say so much in your silence
And your eyes
Your eyes whisper with violence
You
Say so much in your silence
And your eyes
Your eyes whisper with violence
