		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter what they tell us
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true

No matter what they call us
However they attack
No matter where they take us
We'll find our own way back

I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know I'll love forever
I know no matter what

If only tears were laughter
If only night was day
If only prayers were answered
Then we would hear God say

No matter what they tell us
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true

And I will keep you safe and strong
And shelter from the storm
No matter where it's barren
A dream is being born

No matter who they follow
No matter where they lead
No matter how they judge us
I'll be everyone you need

No matter if the sun don't shine
Or if the skies are blue
No matter what the end is
My life began with you

I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know, I know
I know this love's forever

That's all that matters now
No matter what

No, no matter (no no matter what)
No, no matter (no no matter what)
No, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no no matter what)
No, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no no matter what)
No, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no no matter what)
No, no matter, that's all that matters to me (no no matter what)
And no, no matter what, that's all that matters to me (no no matter what)
And no, no matter what, that's all that matters to me
