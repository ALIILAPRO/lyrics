		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's gonna tell you when it's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on
Thinkin' that nothing's wrong
And who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up when you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up when you call?
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams? (To your dreams?)
Who's gonna plug your ears
When you scream? (When you scream?)

Oh, you can't go on
Thinkin' that nothing's wrong, oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna hold you down when you shake?
And who's gonna come around when you break?

You can't go on
Thinkin' that nothing's wrong, oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?
You can't go on
Thinkin' that nothing's wrong, oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
