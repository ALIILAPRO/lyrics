		  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge

I know you want it
The thing that makes me
What the guys go crazy for
They lose their minds
The way I wind
I think it's time

La-la, la-la, la
Warm it up
La-la, la-la, la
The boys are waiting
La-la, la-la, la
Warm it up
La-la, la-la, la
The boys are waiting

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge

I can see you're on it
You want me to teach the
Techniques that freaks these boys
It can't be bought
Just know, thieves get caught
Watch if you're smart

La-la, la-la, la
Warm it up
La-la, la-la, la
The boys are waiting
La-la, la-la, la
Warm it up
La-la, la-la, la
The boys are waiting

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge

Oh, once you get involved
Everyone will look this way, so
You must maintain your charm
Same time maintain your halo
Just get the perfect blend
Plus what you have within
Then next his eyes'll squint
Then he's picked up your scent

La-la, la-la, la
Warm it up
La-la, la-la, la
The boys are waiting
La-la, la-la, la
Warm it up
La-la, la-la, la
The boys are waiting

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge
