		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it rains inside my head
All the words run dry
Walls are breathing hands are reaching up
To touch my thigh

No they don't have to take you away
No they don't have to take you away
No they don't have to take you away
No they don't have to take you away

Sometimes it's bright inside my head
Just like the spark in my eyes
And hands are breathing ones are reaching up
Cause that's the time we rise

No they don't have to take you away
No they don't have to take you away
No they don't have to take you away
No they don't have to take you away
(That's breaking away again)
No they don't have to take you away
