		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my love
It won't Let me sleep
It pulls the blankets right off of my feet
It tears the very fabric of my dream

And my heart, won't let me leave
It's pealing itself off my sleeve
It's feeding me false memories

We turn dust into diamonds
And words into birds
Promise me passage all over the world
The truth is we never get past the front door
I settle my debt, but I always want more

More, more, more
More, more, more

Out here
Is the last place I wanted to be
A foot soldier in your standing army
With my best years somewhere far behind me

Now here
Lies a golden opportunity
While you're sifting through all the debris
I can go some fine place where you'll never find me
You're miles behind me
You'll never find me, now

All this love
Will end as cold
You get the vials with things you don't know
But you'll feel it deep down in your soul

And know, only time can tell
If I go in you're prison cell
Is this the road to heaven?
Or will we burn in hell?

Your youth springs eternal
You never grow old
Your truth looks perverted, encrusted in gold
I have forgotten what I came here for
My cup running over
But I still want more

More, more, more
More, more, more

Out here is the last place I wanted to be
A foot soldier in your standing army
With my best years somewhere far behind me

Now here
Is a golden opportunity
While you're sifting through all the debris
I can go some fine place where you'll never find me
You're miles behind me
You'll never find me, now

Oh, my love, set me free
Forget me
Let me sleep

Oh, my love, set me free
Forget me
Let me sleep
