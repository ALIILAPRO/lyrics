		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine.
I got a love, and I know that it's all mine.
Oh, oh whoa

Do what you want, but you're never gonna break me.
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me.
No, oh whoa

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine.
I got a love, and I know that it's all mine.
Oh, oh whoa

Do what you want, but you're never gonna break me.
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me.
No, oh whoa

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine.
I got a love, and I know that it's all mine.
Oh, oh whoa

Wish that you could, but you ain't gonna own me.
Do anything you can to control me.
Oh, oh no

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

There's a place that I go,
That nobody knows.
Where the rivers flow,
And I call it home.

And there's no more lies.
In the darkness, there's light.
And nobody cries.
There's only butterflies.

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

The sun is on my side.
Take me for a ride.
I smile up to the sky.
I know I'll be all right.

The sun is on my side.
Take me for a ride.
I smile up to the sky.
I know I'll be all right.
