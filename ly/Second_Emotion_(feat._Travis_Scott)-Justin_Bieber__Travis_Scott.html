		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try to bite my tongue but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turning my head
If somewhere else to go, no I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (you do)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

High heels on, heard you coming 'fore I seent ya
Movies all around but you look like the feature
Had another meeting now my plan is to meet ya
Got my hands out all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare
When you're posted up, I wanna be there
The way you curved up, it just ain't fair
No it ain't

Try to bite my tongue but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turning my head
If somewhere else to go, no I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (you do)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

Got me feeling giddy like, la, la, la, la (yeah)
Struck a match it got me litty like, la, la, la, la (it's lit)
You got the keys to my city like, la, la, la, la (straight up)
Do you second that emotion, baby? (Yeah)

Mm, yeah
Out to big boys (it's lit)
Spring her off the hitch (yeah) 
Everything legit
Movin like the blitz (blitz)
Crib like the Ritz (like the Ritz)
So you know it's room (skrrt)
So, baby, please 
(Hold up, nah, nah, nah, that was the first time she did that)
Don't like to talk to bitch (yeah)
Just like to play the wish (skrrt)
I know the problem is
They 'bout it 'bout it, kid (I'm tryna pop another one in)
Oh, you sent the jet out for me?
You tryna ball harder than me?

Did I come across your radar?
Cross your mind now and later?
Do you feel like you know me?
This is still part of nature
Let's ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor, baby?

Try to bite my tongue but I can't take it (ooh-wee)
I got whiplash from me turning my head (hey, hey, hey)
If somewhere else to go, no I can't make it (ooh-wee)
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (you do)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

Got me feeling giddy like, la, la, la la 
Struck a match it got me litty like, la, la, la, la 
You got the keys to my city like, la, la, la, la
Do you second that emotion, baby?
