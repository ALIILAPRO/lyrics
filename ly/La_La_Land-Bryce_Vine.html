		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh shit, you live in the Canyon
How big is your mansion? Yeah
Fresh out of school
Now you working and focus on fashion
Pretty girl, and you let go
Got time, but you got goals
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California

La la la la la
Yeah, I met her at a One Oak
La la la la la
Now we at the same house party
La la la la la
If you wanna waste time
Baby, waste your time with me in California
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California (California)

Oh shit, you born in the Hamptons
I heard that's expensive
Damn, and you famous on Insta'
Your pics is a blessing
I think you could be a centerfold
No need for the money, though (no need for the)
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California (California)

La la la la la
Yeah, I met her at a One Oak
La la la la la
Now we at the same house party (ayy)
La la la la la
If you wanna waste time
Baby, waste your time with me in California (uh)
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California (uh)

I'm a California N-I-G-G-A
Fuck wit' me, girl, I look like bae
My grass is greener, girl, without no snakes
Them other niggas full of games, girl, this not no prank
Just broke up wit' yo' man, it's the right time (right time)
We throwin' money at a stripper, that's the right vibe (right vibe)
I come alive at night time (night time)
She said all she really wanna do is fuck, I said, "Likewise" (ayy)
I like you on top like cilantro (like cilantro)
You like it in your mouth like blanco (like blanco)
I run the city, come fuck wit' a Pablo (fuck wit' a)
I want you, not the code to your iPhone (ayy)
Straight player (straight player)
Your friends said don't fuck wit' me, straight hater (straight hater)
Wasting time in Cali, ain't really wastin' time
'Cause you meet a ball player, that's a come up, right?

La la la la la
Yeah, I met her at Coachella
La la la la la
Why you acting like you don't remember?
La la la la la
If you wanna waste time
Baby, waste your time with me in California
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California
