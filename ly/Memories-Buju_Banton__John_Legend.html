		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now what shall I do
You confess to me that you feel the same way too girl
John, come forth and rock the world, chuh

I guess I am not over you like I thought I was
Guess I was fooling myself, 'cause I'm still in love
Still in love with you woman
I still have dreams of you and I
Can't get over you woman no matter how I try

It's driving me crazy
Thoughts of you with another man
I'm losing my lady, so sad I am
I guess I'm not over you like I thought I was
I guess I was fooling myself 'cause I'm still in love

(Chuh)
Even when I try tell myself the things I say 
Wasn't meant to be this way
Love is not a game to play, yes we went our separate ways 
But the memories
Even when I try tell myself the things I say 
Wasn't meant to be this way
Love is not a game to play, yes we went our separate ways
But the memories

Treasure yuh body but I cherish yuh mind
Even though it's complicated which is most of the time
A life without your love ain't working out fine
Perception and reality clearly define
I bet you never know di love me have inna mi heart
We mek simple mistakes tear us apart
Forgetting where we coming from and how it all start
Using harsh words, bitter arrows and sparks
We live inna di same house and we nah talk
We used to be on, now we're totally off
How I wish this was never our past
Oh, there is no love lost, know that

Even when I try tell myself the things I say 
Wasn't meant to be this way
Love is not a game to play, yes we went our separate ways 
But the memories
Even when I try tell myself the things I say 
Wasn't meant to be this way
Love is not a game to play, yes we went our separate ways
But the memories

Over many moons since we part
But ah memories remain with the love inna mi heart
Care not how many friendships I start
The spot weh you touch still tender and soft
To be honest I do miss the fires and sparks
But I rather live on di rooftop or somewhere in a park
No when we did we mess up? Where lies the blame?
She left me a message explaining her pain
She said, "I tried even avoid"
Surrounding distractions and outside noise
But we both make mistakes and we both lied
Oh and now here we are

Even when I try tell myself the things I say 
Wasn't meant to be this way
Love is not a game to play, yes we went our separate ways 
But the memories
Even when I try tell myself the things I say 
Wasn't meant to be this way
Love is not a game to play, yes we went our separate ways
But the memories
