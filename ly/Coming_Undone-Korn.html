		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep holding on
When my brain's tickin' like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along mockingbird
You don't affect me

That's right
Deliver it to my heart
Please strike
Be deliberate

Wait
I'm coming undone
Irate
I'm coming undone
Too late
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

Wait
I'm starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

Choke, choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I tasted sorrow on my tongue
And this sweet sugar gun does not protect me

That's right
Trigger between my eyes
Please strike
Make it quick now

Wait
I'm coming undone
Irate
I'm coming undone
Too late
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

Wait
I'm starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

Wait
I'm coming undone
Irate
I'm coming undone
Too late
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait
I'm starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
