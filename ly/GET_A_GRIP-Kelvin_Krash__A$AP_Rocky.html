		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bitch you better get a grip, grip, baby)
Yeah, yeah (get a, get a grip)
(Comin' from the Southside)
(Bitch you better get a grip, grip, baby)
Better stand on somethin, man (bitch you better get a grip, grip, baby)
I hate y'all lame ass niggas, man (comin' from the Southside)
Let me put you on to game
(GRIM)

It's the nigga
The prettiest nigga you love to hate
You silly, my nigga, I love the hate
Upgraded that bitch now she up to date
Niggas want smoke, well it's up today
They showin' fake love, I reciprocate
I'm flippin' the weight like it's real estate
Came in the game as a featherweight
It's safest to say that I fluctuate (my weight up, wait)
My diamonds gon' buss like the pressure tank
I'm changin' my name to a dozen chains
That amongst a dozen other names
Pretty motherfucker A.K.A 'bout to probably go and fuck your dame
Fuck your mother, motherfuck the fame
Nigga, I'm heavyweight, ah, nigga lift heavy weights, ah
One in the, ah, nigga like, ah, we get the, ah, we get the, ah
I'm self-made, I'm basically sayin' I made myself
It's safest to say that I saved myself
These niggas so broke they can't pay themselves
Don't play that boy record, he played the shelf (woo)
Break yourself, I made 'em a boss and said, "Pay yourself"
I gave them a bracelet, told 'em, "Embrace yourself"
Pace yourself, wait
But I ain't for sale, mobbin' this bitch and I paint my nail
Conjugal visits in Sweden jail, ain't have no no no toothpaste or gel
And I got the baddest Fenty out
I would never ever snitch or tell, bitch
