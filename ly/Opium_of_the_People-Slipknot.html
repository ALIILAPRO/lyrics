		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch those idiosyncrasies
Watch all the idiots fall on me
Running out of ways to get outta the way
Take another shot just to stay the same
But I need some balance back it off
Fill your lungs till it makes you cough
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause I don't think ill make it through tonight

The only way
Is all the way
The only way
Is all the way

Oh, my, god
Its judgment day and I'm not prepared
Everybody out there is runnin' scared
So take a little bit off the top
I don't care just make it stop

I won't give another soul to you
I won't give another life to you

You have to stop
Stop
Do one thing and say something cryptic
But the styles always clash
One thing I know for sure
The hypothetical won't work any more
One wrong move and they will pound
My nails are tight inside my wrist
This sacrament
Is sacrilege and sentimental
Deity experimental
Faith is accidental

I won't give another soul to you
I won't give another life to you
I won't give another thought to you
I won't give any more of my hope to you
