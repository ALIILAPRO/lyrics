		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you want, what you like, it's okay
I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right, I don't care
I can keep a secret, could you?

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer
(Ha)

Ooh
Ooh

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I
We're cool for the summer

Tell me if I won, if I did, what's my prize?
I just wanna play with you, too
Even if they judge, fuck it, I'll do the time
I just wanna have some fun with you

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer
(Ha)

Ooh
Ooh

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I (you and I)
We're cool for the summer (ha)
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

Shh, don't tell your mother
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

Take me down
Take me down into your paradise
(Don't) don't (be) be scared 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try (wanna try)
'Cause you and I (you and I)
We're cool for the summer

(Take me down) we're cool for the summer
(Don't be scared) 'cause I'm your body type
(Just something) just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I (you and I)
We're cool for the summer (ha)
Ooh
We're cool for the summer
