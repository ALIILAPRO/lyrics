		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are we crazy?
Livin' our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're livin' in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're livin' in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

Ah-ha, so good
Your rose-colored glasses on
And party on (woo)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumblin' around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free (ah-ha)
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumblin' around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweepin' it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're livin' in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

Ah-ha, so good (so good)
Your rose-colored glasses on
And party on (woo)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumblin' around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free (ah-ha)
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Turn it up, it's your favorite song (oh)
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumblin' around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free (ah-ha)
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm (woah, oh, oh)

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ayy, up in your high place, liars
Time is tickin' for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
The greed over the people
They stumblin' and fumblin' and we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions (woah)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song (hey)
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up (turn it up, turn it up, yeah), keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (like a wasted zombie)
Yeah, we think we're free (ah)
Drink, this one's on me (ah)
We're all chained to the rhythm (we're all)
To the rhythm, to the rhythm (we're all, chained to the rhythm)

It goes on, and on, and on 
It goes on, and on, and on (turn it up, it goes on and on and on and on)
It goes on, and on, and on (on and on and on it goes)
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm (we're all chained to the rhythm)
