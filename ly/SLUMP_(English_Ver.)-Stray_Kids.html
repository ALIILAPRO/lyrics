		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where you going? (where you going?)
It's hard to keep up
You're moving so fast leaving me behind
Gimme an hour (gimme an hour)
That's all I need (that's all I need)
It's now or never, I'm running out of time

The seconds are relentless, I'm helpless as they keep flying by
Stuck here in the desert, I feel like I'm in an hourglass
Maybe I can stay and be comfortable living in the past
But I don't wanna be alone, so can you take me to you now

Too fast, I try to follow but I'm losing hope
We used to walk together down this winding road
But you're so far ahead it seems impossible to catch up

And now I'm walking on my way, all alone, I'm feeling so cold
Not getting anywhere, I feel like I'm in slow mode

Used to be a winner, everything was all black and white
Now I'm bottom of the pile, a dusty photo

I'm afraid I'm gonna be left stranded by myself
All the foolish dreams I had inside of me are broken

Everything I wanted in the distance out of reach
Am I the only one that's gon' stay here forgotten, ey

So many thoughts are inside of my head
I'm always drying these tears on my face
How could I ever get used to the fact that 
The songs and the lyrics, they all sound the same

"Come on, I know you can do it", I have to repeat it again and again, yeah
I wanna look in the mirror, telling myself that I did a good job, ey

Everyone gonna be watching, I gotta show 'em all of me
But I've been insecure lately, 'cause I don't know what they want from me ey
Feeling so nervous
I wanna go forward but everyone else overtaking me
Blocking my vision, my body is shaking
I don't know if I can keep up, yeah, yeah

Too fast, I try to follow but I'm losing hope
We used to walk together down this winding road
But you're so far ahead it seems impossible to catch up

And now I'm walking on my way, all alone, I'm feeling so cold
Not getting anywhere, I feel like I'm in slow mode

Used to be a winner, everything was all black and white
Now I'm bottom of the pile, a dusty photo

I'm afraid I'm gonna be left stranded by myself
All the foolish dreams I had inside of me are broken

Everything I wanted in the distance out of reach
Am I the only one that's gon' stay here forgotten, ey
