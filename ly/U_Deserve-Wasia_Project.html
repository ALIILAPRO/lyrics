		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Digging through my mind and memories
I remember once you told me
That nobody'd care if I disappeared
And I believed every word

Everyday I'd stare at my reflection
But all I ever saw was imperfection
I'd cry at the mirror
But no one would hear
You never let them listen

Wish that the weather wasn't so grey
Wish I was better, and knew what to say
It feels like I'm playing a dangerous game

Fake it 'til I make it
'Til I'm finally okay

Hadn't seen the sun for an eternity
Skirting round the borderline of sanity
I'd scream at the wind but no one would listen
You never let them in

Tell me that I'll reach a destination
'Cause oh my God, I'm running out of patience
Swear on my life I'll be alright
Just tired of these burning eyes

Wish that the weather wasn't so grey
Wish I was better, and knew what to say
It feels like I'm playing a dangerous game

Fake it 'til I make it
'Til I'm finally okay

Take back your conscience and your crimes
Every minute of your time
Get the fuck out of my mind

Take back your weapons and your words
Put the seconds on reverse
All this hatred u deserve

You deserve, you deserve

Wish that the weather wasn't so grey
Wish I was better, and knew what to say
It feels like I'm playing a dangerous game

Fake it till I make it
'Til I'm finally okay

Now I hardly ever feel depleted
'Cause when I smile I genuinely mean it
Knowing myself I don't need help
From you or anyone else

Jealousy corrupts your standards
Like melodies with empty lanterns
But when he laughs it heals my heart
It makes me feel enough
