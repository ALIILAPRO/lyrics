		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't care if you like me
Even if I had a million dollars
Couldn't save my friends
From the snakes and the sharks
That we're swimming with
They keep selling their bullshit
But I'm not buying it
So I'ma fake it till I make it to the golden age
Burning down the city
When I break this cage
So everybody listen when I have to say
Hey
I couldn't put it nicely
Oh no oh oh
Cause if I told you what I thought in my head
Uh oh oh oh
I wouldn't take it lightly
Oh no oh oh
Cause some things aren't better unsaid
Uh oh oh oh
And I could care less if you like me
Another trillion dollars
Said it's all well spent
While the poor don't eat
And the rich stay rich
What does that really say about the world we're in
So I'ma fake it till I make it to the golden age
Burning down the city when I break this cage
So everybody listen when I have to say
Hey
I couldn't put it nicely
Oh no oh oh
Cause if I told you what I thought in my head
Uh oh oh
I wouldn't take it lightly
Oh no oh oh
Cause some things aren't better unsaid
Uh oh oh oh
And I could care less if you like me
There's rumor round town that's going around
That the city all sleeps while the sirens sound
Talks cheap till we all fall down
Heard the birds weren't real
And we don't roam free
I couldn't put it nicely
Oh no oh oh
Cause if I told you what I thought in my head
Uh oh oh oh
I wouldn't take it lightly
Oh no oh oh
Cause some things aren't better unsaid
Uh oh oh oh
And I could care less if you like me
