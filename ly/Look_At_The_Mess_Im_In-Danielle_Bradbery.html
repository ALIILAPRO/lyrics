		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at the mess I'm in
Look what I've gone and done
Took all my promises
And broke 'em all one by one
So I guess this is what I get
Two empty bottles of wine
A ghost in an empty bed
And a diamond that lost its shine
Nobody left to blame
I've ruined everything
Look at the mess I'm in

Look at these painted walls
Listen to what they say
You coulda had it all
But you let it slip away
So now I'm just doin' time
Hopin' your mind will change
A head full of your goodbyes
And a heart like a hurricane
Too late to apologize
And I'm a little too drunk to drive
Ooh, look at the mess I'm in 

(Ooh) ooh

So I guess this is what I get
Two empty bottles of wine
A ghost in an empty bed
And a diamond that lost its shine
I got nobody left to blame
'Cause I've ruined everything
Ooh, look at the mess I'm in
Look at the mess I'm in
