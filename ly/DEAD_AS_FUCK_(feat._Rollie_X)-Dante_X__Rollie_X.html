		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I'm dead
I'm dead as fuck
I think I'm about to make my big bucks
I told the dumb bitch like good luck
Dante X ima come up
Need to stay away from me
I hate that shit
Slit my wrist
Fuck my life like it's a bitch
Getting turned up in the whip then dip
Baby I'm dead I'm dead now
Everybody talking that shit
Don't talk loud
Watch me flip my bird
Then I walk it out
What you talking about
Bitch I'm on big screens
With the big names
Need a big chain
Need to get more gwuap
Maybe drug slang
Need to get real high
Get the propane
Need to get real high
Baby I'm about to get fucked up
We can fuck all night with the lights off
Baby I'm about to get me numb
Would you love me till the end when I die slow
I don't wanna tell you how I feel
Maybe I'm just some mother fucking creep
I'm crawling out the dungeon that's for real
Bitch I'm dead as fuck
Why'd you do me
Why'd you do me
Bitch why'd you do me
Girl I always look around
Why'd you do me
You said you'll love me till the end
Why you do this
I'm on some big shit
Bitch why'd you do me
Baby I'm about to get fucked up
We can fuck all night
With the lights off
Baby I'm about to get me numb
Would u love me till the end
When I die slow
Yeah
When I die slow
Yeah
When I die slow
Yeah
Bitch I'm dead as fuck
Fucked up again
Baby I'm dead
I'm dead as fuck
I think I'm about to make my big bucks
I told the dumb bitch like good luck
Dante X ima come up
