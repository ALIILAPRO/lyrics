		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, we gonna play now, ready for the show
I'm about to take down, you already know
Get the fuck outta my face now, yeah
You gotta go man, I'm on the chase now
Leave me on my own
I got a chance to break now
Here I fucking go
Take control of fate now, I control my flow
And I know that I'll be great how
Putting on a show
I know that I'ma stay loud
Drowning out the no's
The haters always thinking that they
Can fucking break me
They're better of eating their
Own words like pastries
Hate me and you better
Find some fucking safety
I'm coming in hot like a
Bad bitch in pasties
Ey, can't save me, no, I ain't lazy, no
But society has me going so crazy, oh
Don't blame me, no, my mind's hazy, oh
And I'm sick of me feeling this way daily
Oh

And I will always live my
Life till it's over
And I will not forgive those who hold me down
And I will never give up, I'm moving forward
And I will never miss my chance, take it now

And I will always live my
Life till it's over
And I will not forgive those who hold me down
And I will never give up, I'm moving forward
And I will never miss my chance, take it now

You got one life, so live it right
Keep your friends tight and
Your family in sight
Never cease to fight for the
Things you think are right
'cause you just might find you
Control your own mind, ey
You'll be fine, ey, just take your time, ey
Enjoy the climb, ey, enjoy the grind, ey
You never really know what's
On the other side
Till you give that shit a try
Know the limit is the sky, ey
Make 'em take it back
What they said about you
Every time they doubt you
Make that shit about you
Forget about the clout, yo, fuck
The word of mouth, yo
Keep your head down, yo
Work until you're found, yo
Fight until you make it, yo
Don't think it, no, just take it
Don't wait for someone to break it, take
Control and don't just fake it, yo
You can make it happen
You just gotta take some action
Take the ship and be the captain, ey
Head on out and don't look back, yeah

And I will always live my
Life till it's over
And I will not forgive those who hold me down
And I will never give up, I'm moving forward
And I will never miss my chance, take it now

And I will always live my
Life till it's over
And I will not forgive those who hold me down
And I will never give up, I'm moving forward
And I will never miss my chance, take it now

And I will never give up, I'm moving forward
(And I will never give up
I'm moving forward)
And I will never miss my chance, take it now
(And I will never miss my chance
Take it now)
