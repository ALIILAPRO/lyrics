		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To really love a woman 
To understand her you gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought see every dream 
And give her wings when she wants to fly 
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know ya really love a woman 

When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one 
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her that it's gonna last forever 
So tell me have you ever really 
Really really ever loved a woman? 

To really love a woman 
Let her hold you 
'Til ya know how she needs to be touched 
You've gotta breathe her really taste her 
'Til you can feel her in your blood 
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes 
You know ya really love a woman 

When you love a woman 
You tell her that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her that you'll always be together 
So tell me have you ever really 
Really really ever loved a woman? 

You got to give her some faith hold her tight
A little tenderness gotta treat her right 
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you 
You really gotta love your woman, yeah

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one 
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her that it's gonna last forever 
So tell me have you ever really 
Really really ever loved a woman? 

So tell me have you ever really 
Really really ever loved a woman? 
Just tell me have you ever really 
Really really ever loved a woman?
