		  Dinah
Is there anyone finer
In the state of Carolina?
If there is and you know her
Show her to me

Dinah
Got those Dixie eyes blazin'
How I love to sit and gazin'
To the eyes of Dinah Lee

Every night why do I
Shake with fright?
'Cause my Dinah might
Change her mind about me

Oh, Dinah
Should you wander to China
I would hop an ocean liner
Just to be with Dinah Lee

Dinah
Is there anyone finer
In the state of Carolina?
If there is and you know her and you know her
Show her to me

Dinah
Got those Dixie eyes blazin'
How I love to sit and gazin'
To the eyes of Dinah Lee

My Dinah every night why do I
Shake with fright?
Because my Dinah might
Change her mind about me

Dinah
If you wander to China
I would hop an ocean liner
Just to be with Dinah Lee

Every night why do I
Shake with fright?
'Cause my Dinah might
Change her mind about me

The name of this song is Dinah
Said it
The name of this song is Dinah
Snag it
The name of this song is Dinah
Ah, tell it
The name of this song is Dinah

Dinah
Wander to China
The state of Carolina
Listen, and you know her
I would like to have you show her to me

Dinah
Got those Dixie eyes blazin'
How I love to sit and gazin'
To the eyes of Dinah Lee

Oh, Dinah
Should you wander to China
I would get me an ocean liner
Just to be with Dinah Lee
