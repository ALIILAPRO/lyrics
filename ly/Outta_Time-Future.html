		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Super
I see you makin' hella noise, but I ain't enthused, ah
Feed me Don, Don, Don, Don Perignon

Gotta be in a rush, I can't be runnin' out of time (out of time)
What you mean what's on my mind? (What's on mind? Cash)
Federal Reserves on my mind (Freebandz, ayy)
I got the plug online (on my line)
Go crazy, lavish, put the spaceship on Davins, yeah 
Compellin', you can hear the guns yellin'
I can't take no vacations, I can't lose 
Been poppin' mollies and they watchin' like parole 

I see you makin' hella noise, but I ain't enthused (I ain't enthused)
Kidnap, no flinch (flinch), I'ma set back and reminisce (yeah, yeah)
Fuck that bitch, she gotta learn to water whip it
Zone 6 nigga ridin' in a V12, that's too Venice 
I don't wanna show 'em no slack (slack), I gotta get me a sack (Pluto)
Takin' their clean batch, still fighting my demons
I'ma drop my top this summer, I mean this 
Tryna give me that mouth while I make a scene with it (super sloppy)

Who knew I'd get this much attention?
Be cool before you get put on suspension
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Mia Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on Jet Skis

I'm gettin' frustrated and all for us
You see I bought the Bentley truck for us
I put in some hours every single night
Somewhere in the clouds, done lost sight
Khaled put a whole nigga on ice
Fucked on a gold digger more than twice
For the crazy bitches playin' sheisty
Had to crazy wrist, I didn't ice it

I'm infatuated with shinin'
I'm infatuated with shinin' (on my line, brrp)
I'm infatuated with shinin'
Give you motivation at it's finest

Who knew I'd get this much attention?
Be cool before you get put on suspension
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Mia Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on Jet Skis

Go crazy, lavish, put the spaceship on Davins, yeah
Compellin', you can hear the guns yellin'
I can't take no vacations, I can't lose
Been poppin' mollies and they watchin' like parole

Gotta be in a rush, I can't be runnin' out of time
What you mean, what's on my mind?
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Mia Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on Jet Skis
