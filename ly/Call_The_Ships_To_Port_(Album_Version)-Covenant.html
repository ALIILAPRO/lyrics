		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A billion words ago
The sailors disappeared
A story for the children
To rock them back to sleep

A million burning books
Like torches in our hands
A fabric of ideals
To decorate our homes

A thousand generations
The soil on which we walk
A mountain of mistakes
For us to climb for pleasure

A hundred clocks are ticking
The line becomes a circle
Spin the wheel of fortune
Or learn to navigate

A choir full of longing
Will call our ships to port
The countless lonely voices
Like whispers in the dark

A choir full of longing
Will call our ships to port
The countless lonely voices
Like whispers in the dark

A second of reflection can
Take you to the moon
The slightest hesitation can
Bring you down in flames

A single spark of passion
Can change a man forever
A moment in a lifetime
Is all it takes to break him

A fraction of a heartbeat
Made us what we are
A brother and a sister
For better or for worse

A billion words ago
They sang a song of leaving
An echo from the chorus
Will call them back again

A choir full of longing
Will call our ships to port
The countless lonely voices
Like whispers in the dark

A choir full of longing
Will call our ships to port
The countless lonely voices
Like whispers in the dark

Tonight we light the fires
We call our ships to port
Tonight we walk on water
And tomorrow we'll be gone

Tonight we light the fires
We call our ships to port
Tonight we walk on water
And tomorrow we'll be gone

Tonight we light the fires
We call our ships to port
Tonight we walk on water
And tomorrow we'll be gone

Tonight
Tonight
