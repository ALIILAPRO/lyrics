		  Vroom
Hundred 50
Back in Phili
Richard Milli
You don't got no time to be fuckin with me, baby
Show you love
Show me pity
Running two man you been playing who's who
Where do we stand this ain't fucking Blue's Clues
And I can be a better me if I could find a new you

Showing you, loving you, act like you hate it
Things that you say when you're drunk when you're faded
Put your names in lights how the fuck you do me shady
Let him stay the night, he's tryna fuck you on the daily
Selling a dream I was nothing but a friend to you
Don't try to play me I was nothing but a ten to you
But its been different you been acting distance
Run away from me right now
Saw you in his whip and you was smiling
Tears keep falling from my eyelids
Imma let a nigga keep trying
He ain't finally love you like I did

Vroom
Hundred 50
Back in Phili
Richard Milli
You don't got no time to be fuckin with me, baby
Show you love
Show me pity
Running two man you been playing who's who
Where do we stand this ain't fucking Blue's Clues
And I can be a better me if I could find a new you
