		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I messed it up, alright
And there's no doubt about it
I had to pick this fight
'Cause I'd go mad without it

Bending like a willow when a storm is brewing
Oh yeah, that's you
But, hey, I take the rap
This one's my mishap
And there's no doubt about it

He tells me that he won't take the bait
That I have a tendency to exaggerate
And maybe he's right, but that is beside the point
Well, then why do I let it upset me?
Yes, and why am I biting my nails?

I made a mess this time
And there's no doubt about it
Hands down, the fault is mine
And I'm prepared to shout it

Out across the rooftops if it makes you happy
Oh, yes, I could
So, hey, I take the blame
This one's got my name
And there's no doubt about it

He says with forbearance in his eyes
Most couples we know are able to compromise
He's too good for me, that's one thing I know for sure
If that's true, why do I let it upset me?
There I go, stomping my feet like a child

But he is a good man
He tries to understand why I freak out
He worries, and I know, it's an honest reaction

I messed it up, alright
And there's no doubt about it
I had to pick this fight
I'd have gone mad without it
Hissing like a wild cat when I should be purring
But you know me
This isn't where it ends
I could make amends
And there's no doubt about it (this isn't where it ends)
No doubt about it (this isn't where it ends)
No doubt about it (this isn't where it ends)
