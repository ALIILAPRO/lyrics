		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night, night
With half a tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
As the sirens fill the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here, now, now, now, babe?
We see a storm is closing in (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Pretending we ain't scared

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never (oh yeah)
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, nah, nah
A quarter tank and almost gone
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line, now, now, now, babe
We see a storm is closing in (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I reach out for your hand

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh, ooh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh, ooh, yeah)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on, hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (ooh, yeah, uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (ooh, uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never (oh yeah)
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on, hold on)

Ooh
Hold on, ooh, yeah, oh
Hold on

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (hold on, uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on, hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on, ooh, yeah)
