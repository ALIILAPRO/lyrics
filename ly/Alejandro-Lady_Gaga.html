		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you
Won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She got a halo around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro
Ale-ale-jandro

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro
Ale-ale-jandro

Stop, please
Just let me go Alejandro
Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gonna fire fight, gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro
Ale-ale-jandro

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro
Ale-ale-jandro

Don't bother me
Don't bother me, Alejandro
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Fernando

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro
Ale-ale-jandro

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro
Ale-ale-jandro

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro
