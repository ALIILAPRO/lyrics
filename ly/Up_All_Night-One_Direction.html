		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels like we've been livin' in fast forward
Another moment passing by
(Up up all night)
The party's ending but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight
(Up up all night)

Katy Perry's on replay
She's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way
Yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
'Cause we got the flow now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you
Up, up, up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night

Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh
(Up up all night)
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back

Katy Perry's on replay
She's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way
Yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
'Cause we got the flow now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you
Up, up, up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night

Katy Perry's on replay
(Up all night)
She's on replay
(We're gonna want to stay up all night)
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
(We're gonna want to stay up all night)
Up all night, up all night
(We're gonna want to stay up all night)

I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one (she's the one)
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
'Cause we got the flow now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you (do it all with you)
Up, up, up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
