		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch me
Watch me as I strip
See the way I bleed yeah
Touch me
Follow through my lead
I need you just to breathe, I
Need to save my thoughts
They be red at dark
Can't slow down baby
I've already taken off
With blue pills and darts
Tried to numb my heart
But I can't seem to let you go
I love the blues baby
Need your abuse
Let me feel the pain
I miss the way you played me
I've been on a noose
Been stuck in a loop
Of needing you
Even though you run like venom through me
I can feel you in the creases of my mind
And I'll do anything for your body on mine
And you might be the worse be the worse for me
But I don't care
Cause love was never fair
When we make love I feel the hurricanes from your legs
When we lie to each other
But don't care what was said
So I know
All the things you need
So please
Come and do your worst to me
I love the blues baby
Need your abuse
Let me feel the pain
I miss the way you played me
I've been on a noose
Been stuck in a loop
Of needing you
Even though you run like venom through me
You see me
(I see you)
I see you
(You see me)
Baby why'd you say I'm all
Then claim I'm nothing
(No)
Why are you running for
(Not tryna run babe)
I've got all you want
I'll let you run like venom through me
I love the blues baby
Need your abuse
Let me feel the pain
I miss the way you played me
I've been on a noose
Been stuck in a loop
Of needing you
Even though you run like venom through me
