		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Great Wind God Aeolus
I don't know if you know this
But our path to home is
Blocked by an impenetrable storm
I ask for your assistance
So we at last can go the distance
Can you cast the perfect wind for
Us and aid our journey home?

Ha ha ha i am the wind, twisting and turning
I give the fire enough to stay burning
Let's play a game

A game?

That's what I'm serving and if you win
You will get what you're yearning

Deal

Take a look right here at this bag
It has the winds of the storm all trapped
All you gotta do is not open this bag

Sounds too easy, what's the catch?

Ha ha ha keep your friends close as
Your enemiеs closer
Never rеally know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag
Open, you gotta say "no, sir"
Sometimes killing is a must

What?

Cause the end always justify the means
Friends turn into foes in rivalries
So keep your friends close
And your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
