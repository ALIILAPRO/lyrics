		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you see
Somehow the world will change for me
And be so wonderful

Live life, breathe air
I know somehow we're gonna get there
And feel so wonderful

I will make you change your mind
These things happen all the time
And it's all real
I'm telling you just how I feel

So wake up the members of my nation, it's your time to be
There's no chance unless you take one and the time to see
The brighter side of every situation, some things are meant to be
So give me your best and leave the rest to me

I know it's time
To raise the hand that draws the line
And be so wonderful

Golden sunshine
I know somehow it's gonna be mine
And feel so wonderful

Show me what you can become
There's a dream in everyone
And it's all real
I'm telling you just how I feel

So wake up the members of my nation, it's your time to be
There's no chance unless you take one and the time to see
The brighter side of every situation, some things are meant to be
So give me your best and leave the rest to me

Leave it all to me (leave it all to me)
So make it right (make it alright)
And see it through (you got to)
You know won't be free until you

Wake up the members of my nation, it's your time to be
There's no chance unless you take one and the time to see
The brighter side of every situation, some things are meant to be
So give me your best and leave the rest to me
Leave it all to me, (leave it all to me), leave it all to me, just leave it all to me
