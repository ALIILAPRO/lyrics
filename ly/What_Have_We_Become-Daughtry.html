		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All those years
One day changes everything, and
Gone and your life and the passion fades away
Saving for something
That you'll never see in your days
Shutting out everything that you need

(Looking through distorted eyes)
Beautiful disaster
(Adding up a million lies)
So much for “ever after”
Building up your wall
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we used to crowd away
Giving in or leaving this now
Now we have what we have become
All the tears
We never thought we'd see the day when
The trappings of your life would seem to disappear
Goin through the vacancy you leave behind
Not what you have promised,
Not what you believed

(Looking through distorted eyes)
Beautiful disaster
(Adding up a million lies)
So much for “ever after”
Building up your wall
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we used to crowd away
Finding out the truth, when nothing really matters
Chase the light that's blinding even as you crowd away
Now we have what we have become
Now you fight to ease your pain
Now you know it's not the way out
Now you know it's not the way out
Not the way out

Building up your wall
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we used to crowd away
Finding out the truth, when nothing really matters
Chase the light that's blinding even as you crowd away
Now we have what we have become
