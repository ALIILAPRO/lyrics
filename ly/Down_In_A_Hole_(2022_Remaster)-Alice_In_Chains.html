		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bury me softly in this womb 
I give this part of me for you 
Sand rains down and here I sit 
Holding rare flowers 
In a tomb, in bloom 

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved 
See my heart I decorate it like a grave 
You don't understand who they thought 
I was supposed to be 
Look at me now a man 
Who won't let himself be 

Down in a hole, feelin' so small 
Down in a hole, losin' my soul 
I'd like to fly, but my wings have been so denied 

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place 
I've eaten the sun so my tongue 
Has been burned of the taste 
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth 
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath 

Down in a hole, feelin' so small 
Down in a hole, losin' my soul 
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied 

Bury me softly in this womb 
Oh I want to be inside of you 
I give this part of me for you 
Oh I want to be inside of you 
Sand rains down and here I sit 
Holding rare flowers in a tomb (oh I want to be inside of you) 
Oh I want to be inside

Down in a hole, feelin' so small 
Down in a hole, losin' my soul 
Down in a hole, feelin' so small 
Down in a hole, outta control 
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied
