		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got endorphins running through my veins
I got endorphins keeping me awake
And I can't help making big mistakes

You see, endorphins are running through my veins and it's pathetic
Endorphins are rushing out my brain and it's pathetic
Mighty morphing into a piece of shit and it's pathetic
I'm so pathetic
I'm so pathetic

Endorphins are running through my veins and it's pathetic
Endorphins are rushing out my brain and it's pathetic
Mighty morphing into a piece of shit, it's so pathetic
I'm so pathetic
I'm so pathetic, ah

Yeah, alright, yeah, alright, yeah, alright
I'll give it up up in the morning
Said alright, yeah, alright, yeah, alright
I'll deal with the crush in the morning
Fucking right, fucking right, fucking right
Well, giddy up up, get the call in
Guess I might, guess I might, guess I might
Be seeing my crush, seeing her

I got endorphins running through my veins
I got endorphins keeping me awake
Now I can't help making big mistakes
I gotta give it up up, give it up
I got endorphins running through my veins
I got endorphins keeping me awake
But I can't help make 'em anyway
I gotta give it up up, give it up

Yeah, alright, yeah, alright, yeah, alright
Transfusing my blood in the morning
Yeah, alright, yeah, alright, yeah, alright
Be snoozing that lust in the morning
Do you right, do you right, do you right
I'll give it all up in the morning
What a life, what a life, what a life
Still feeling that crush, feeling that

I got endorphins running through my veins
I got endorphins keeping me awake
Now I can't help making big mistakes
I gotta give it up up, give it up
I got endorphins running through my veins
I got endorphins keeping me awake
But I can't help make 'em anyway
I gotta give it up up, give it up up

Endorphins are running through my veins
Endorphins are running through my veins and it's pathetic
Endorphins are rushing out my brain and it's pathetic
Mighty
Mighty morphing
I'm so pathetic
I'm so pathetic
I'm so pathetic
I'm so pathetic

Endorphins are running through my veins and it's pathetic
Endorphins are rushing out my brain and it's pathetic
Mighty morphing into a piece of shit, it's so pathetic
I'm so pathetic
I'm so pathetic
