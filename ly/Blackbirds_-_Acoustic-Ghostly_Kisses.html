		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel the veil touching your skin
Hear the voice of the warm wind
Have you ever flown to the sun?
On wings as thin as the sky?
 
Whispers sing through my window
On dreamless days when the light goes
My eyes stray to the clouds way above
See how the blackbirds they fly?
 
Alive
Alive
Alive
I would feel alive by your side
 
Will you drown in the ocean?
Wash away all of your sins? 
Will the darkness pull you deep inside?
And cleanse you of all your fears?
 
I see your world through my window
I dream of lives that I can't know
Is there a place where I won't feel alone?
Where love or death is no more?
 
Alive
Alive
Alive
Where I feel alive
Endless sky
Alive
Alive
Alive
I would feel alive by your side
