		<p>
		  Yeah, come on
Look

I let you in on purpose (purpose)
I guess that I deserve it (deserve it)
At Fight Club like Tyler Durden (Durden)
You know that it hurts, hurts
You know that I'm probably hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
But, girl, I know for certain (for certain)
The end of the day, it's worth it (it's worth it)

'Cause, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
You're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(You're perfect to me)
Ooh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
Oh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
God made a perfect person
You're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(You're perfect to me)
Baby, you're perfect
(You're perfect to me)
Ooh, baby, you're perfect
(You're perfect to me)
Ooh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
God made a perfect person

Me and bucket hat Ben
And you know we out here again
Girl, I'm tryna fuck with your friend
Y'all look like twins
Tell me where ya at? Where you been?
Tell me what you're on? What ya did?
Sounds exotic
If you got another, I'll pop it
Bringin' up the past, baby, just stop it
Talkin' 'bout ex boyfriends makes me nauseous
Let's move on to a whole another topic
Girl, like where I'ma take you shopping
Girl, which island in the tropics
Girl, know we got a whole lot of options
Girl, let me get you poppin'
Girl, look (yeah, yeah)

You gotta let me know soon (uh)
I never met one like you

I let you in on purpose (purpose)
I guess that I deserve it (deserve it)
At Fight Club like Tyler Durden (Durden)
You know that it hurts, hurts
You know that I'm probably hurtin' (ayy, ayy)
But, girl, I know for certain (ayy, ayy)
The end of the day, it's worth it (it's worth it)

'Cause, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
You're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(You're perfect to me)
Ooh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
Oh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
God made a perfect person
You're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(You're perfect to me)
Baby, you're perfect
(You're perfect to me)
Ooh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(You're perfect to me)
Ooh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
God made a perfect person

Look
I let you in on purpose (purpose)
I guess that I deserve it (deserve it)
At Fight Club like Tyler Durden (Durden)
You know that it hurts, hurts
You know that I'm probably hurtin' (ayy, ayy)
But, girl, I know for certain (ayy, ayy)
The end of the day, it's worth it (it's worth it)

'Cause, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
You're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(You're perfect to me)
Ooh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
Oh, baby, you're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
God made a perfect person
You're perfect (perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(You're perfect to me)
(You're perfect to me)
(You're perfect to me)
(Perfect to me)
