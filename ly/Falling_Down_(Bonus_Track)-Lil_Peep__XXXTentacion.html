		<p>
		  Girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(Now let's do that song for Peep)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (yeah)

Girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Darling, your love is like walking a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fightin' (oh-oh-oh)

Girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around, yeah
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

His name will live, brother
Bro, I got, I feel hella shitty 'cause it's like, yo
Like, if I would've known he was so cool
And it's like, yo, if I would've watched interviews sooner
Bro, we were so alike
It's unfortunate because it's like, yo, when people die
That's when we like, you know?
'Cause your remorse kinda makes you check 'em out

Darling, your love is like walking a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fightin' (oh-oh-oh)

Girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around (yeah)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So girl, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (yeah)
