		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly, jolly Christmas this year

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly, jolly Christmas this year
