		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is
No

(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
