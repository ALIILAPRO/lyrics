		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day unfolds
Never felt so cold, I never knew I was turning away
Thought I can't explain, I only love you now that you missed
As I stand in the rain, leave me to go through this

I don't think I could face another sleepless night
If I could only trace that elusive light
In a dreamland flight to your agonising eyes
A never ending flight, my silent cries

Still I close my eyes and my mind becomes clear
Still I dream, and there you are
How still you lie and how your eyes bring back the fear
Still I can't face what's going on here

Everything that I've ever felt has gone
At last my spirit breathes
I see no point in going on
So goodbye
It's time for me to leave
