		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've got a choice but still, we'd rather choose to suffer
'Cause there's no escape once the fuse is lit
Locked in this pantheon
Swimming with concrete shoes
The reaper comes to take the best of you
Can you see the writing on the wall?

There is a subtle space that we'll all discover
'Cause there is a seat reserved for the spirit
Passing through one by one
Riding a torpedo
We wash away into the overflow
Can you see the writing on the wall?

We're barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again and again and again and again and again
Again and again and again

Do you really wanna live forever? Oh

We are so lost staring into all the colour
It hurts but reality is counterfeit
We came from the beyond
Living a cameo
One final breath and then we split in two
Can you see the writing on the wall?

We're barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again and again and again and again and again

Even the doomed refuse
We were born to lose
Do you really wanna live forever?
'Cause those afraid to die will never truly live
They'll never truly live

Even the doomed refuse
We were born to lose
Do you really wanna live forever?

We're barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again and again and again and again

We are barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again and again and again and again and again
