		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothin' on me
I'm only one call away

Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
Come on, come on, come on
Reachin' out to you, so take a chance

No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothin' on me
I'm only one call away

Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
Come on, come on, come on
You and me can make it anywhere
But for now, we can stay here for a while, ayy
'Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile

No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothin' on me
I'm only one call away

And when you're weak, I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holdin' on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long, darlin'
And when you feel like hope is gone
Just run into my arms

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothin' on me
I'm only one, I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothin' on me
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away
