		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That girl is giving you the eye
And I and I and I don't like it how she makes you laugh so much
How when you're talking, that you touch
She's instantly more pretty and more interesting than me
She is thinking before she speaks
She is not all red and angry
I bet she doesn't like to eat
I bet her feet don't even stink!
I know your eyes are just for me but

Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand

Tonight we have not got on well
I know I have given you hell
I wish we should have stayed at home
'Cause now I'm standing on my own
And you are having a nice time
With a girl I really don't like
I know your eyes are just for my but

Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand

Baby, please don't break my heart
'Cause you are the only one I love
I'll be by your side till the very end
'Cause you're my only friend

Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand

Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand
