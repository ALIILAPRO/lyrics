		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sip red, sing to the devil (Pluto)
Sip red, sing to the devil (yeah)
Sip red, talk to the devil ('Tro)
Rack, racks don't stuck together
Racks on racks stuck together
Sip red, talk to the devil
I'm 'bout, I'm 'bout to just, I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to
Let's walk on this motherfucker right quick

Racks on racks stuck together
Sip red, talk to the devil (Pluto)
Rosetta stones forever (let's go)
High yella, canary yellow (hot yellow)
Hot chocolate, Cinderella
Trap off a tractor-trailer (tractor)
Blue paper stuck together
Bad bitch gon' fuck my bezel (for sure)

Strapped up with heavy metal
Sip lean, talk to the devil
Hi-Tech, stay confidential
AP, a presidential
Never go against the ghetto
Stay true, got hoes in Belgium (uh-huh)
New bitch, new car, it's levels (uh-huh)
I piss Codeine on peasants
Freebandz, you got it, let's get it (free)
Get a check, then flip it in the trenches (yeah)
In the 'jects pullin' up in a Bentley (skrrt)
Cartier with buffs, they vintage (ah)
Pour a eighth, see the rings on glisten (yeah)
Real ice make a bad bitch listen (yeah)

Racks on racks stuck together
Sip red, talk to the devil
Rosetta stones forever
High yella, canary yellow
Hot chocolate, Cinderella
Trap off a tractor-trailer
Blue paper stuck together
Bad bitch gon' fuck my bezel (mm-mm)

You know it's high price levels
Two Ms, that's on the pedal (uh)
This bitch make that bitch jealous
This cup ain't never fail us (uh)
My J's, they match yo' melon
You know it ain't no tellin' (uh)
Rather go duck a felon
The bankroll tucked for bailin' (uh)
When I lean, when I lean (when I lean)
Blew out what I'm inhalin' (yeah)
This gas broke out, propellant (it's lit)
Back to back like a train
Think twice tryna derail us
The gang like the Goodfellas
Took off, propane propellers
She like gold watch, gold chain
African Cinderella (ooh)
Mix her in my vanilla, you can't find this wherever (ooh)
Thug in all types of weather
In space, lookin' for better (mmm-mm-mm)
When I lean, when I lean, when I lean (when I lean)

Racks on racks stuck together
Sip red, talk to the devil
Rosetta stones forever (yeah)
High yella, canary yellow (it's lit)
Hot chocolate, Cinderella (ooh)
Trap off a tractor-trailer (trap)
Blue paper stuck together
Bad bitch gon' fuck my bezel (for sure)

Ooh, ooh-ah
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ah
