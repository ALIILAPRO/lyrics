		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya, I just wanna kiss and go, I just wanna feel that mood, ya
Don't you know I'll rock, I'ma hit that brand new diamond
Rocking like a Scott, do you see my limited Nike
No fingers without rings like Kobe Bryant

Spend million dollars and I work it out
Switch your tie while I swervin' out
Just weapon high, we gotcha homies down
It's gonna swervin' out, it's gonna swervin' out

Sit up and you watch my freakin' crew
They ain't give a second chance, it's true
Pull up on your block, hey, you move
Mommy said I need to check the bank and be twerkin'

I got rollie, rollie, rollie in my bag
Hunnit, hunnit, hunnit on my sack
I just wanna freakin' love with you
I just wanna rock, I just wanna love with you

I got rollie, rollie, rollie in my bag
Hunnit, hunnit, hunnit on my sack
I just wanna freakin' love with you
I just wanna rock, I just wanna love with you

See (see) the light (the light) be fire (be fire) oh, yeah (oh, yeah)
And now see (see) the light (the light) be fire (be fire) oh, right (oh, right)

Ya, I always end up as issues
But I don't give a (shh)
I make the money with my buddy
Baby, don't, don't doubt me
I don't check cheeze, you see my rollie
Red five diamonds, it'll keep shining bright

Sit up and you watch my freakin' crew
They ain't give a second chance, it's true
Pull up on your block, hey, you move
Mommy said I need to check the bank and be twerkin'

I got rollie, rollie, rollie in my bag
Hunnit, hunnit, hunnit on my sack
I just wanna freakin' love with you
I just wanna rock, I just wanna love with you

I got rollie, rollie, rollie in my bag
Hunnit, hunnit, hunnit on my sack
I just wanna freakin' love with you
I just wanna rock, I just wanna love with you

See (see) the light (the light) be fire (be fire) oh, yeah (oh, yeah)
And now see (see) the light (the light) be fire (be fire) oh, right (oh, right)
