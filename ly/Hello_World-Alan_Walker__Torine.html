		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life, I've been walking on my own
Along the lonely road of the heart
On my side, I got symphonies and songs
To help me find my way through the dark

Oh, six in the morning with nowhere to go
Sing hello world, it feels so good to be home
Lost in the dark, but I'll never be alone
Sing hello world, it feels so good to be home

(Sing hello world, it feels so good to be home)

Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes and said hello to the world (hello to the world)
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes and said hello to the world

All night long, I've been talking to myself
The voices in my head don't cry
On my mind, I become somebody else
So this is how it feels to say goodbye

Oh, six in the morning with nowhere to go
Sing hello world, it feels so good to be home
Lost in the dark, but I'll never be alone
Sing hello world, it feels so good to be home

Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes and said hello to the world (hello to the world)
Hello, hello, hello world
(I open my eyes and said hello to the world)
