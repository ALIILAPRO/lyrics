		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faith lies in
The ways of sin
Chased the charmed
But I don't want them anymore 

And in their eyes I was alive
Fool's disguise
Take me away from you

Shame my tongue
Fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep
I was happier than I'd ever been

When you decide
That your life is a prize
Renew, revive
It's alright honey
It's alright, yeah

Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel OK?
It scares the disenchanted
Far away

Yeah, I want something new
But what am I supposed to do about you
Yeah, I love you, it's true

Life's a bummer
When you're a hummer
Life's a drag

Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free

Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free

Do you feel
Love is real
