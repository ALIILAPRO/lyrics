		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now, usually I don't do this but, uh
Go head on and break 'em off wit' a lil' previews of the remix

Now, I'm not trying to be rude
But hey, pretty girl, I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in your grill
Tryin' to get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field

So, baby gimme that "toot toot"
And lemme give you that "beep beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty-fours
While they sayin' on the radio

It's the remix to "Ignition"
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' (wishin' now)
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like "So what? I'm drunk" (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (fun)

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce (come on)

Now, it's like "Murder She Wrote"
Once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
But still they can hear you screamin' more
Girl, I'm feelin' what you're feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition

So, gimme that "toot toot"
Lemme give you that "beep beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty-fours
While they sayin' on the radio (check it out)

It's the remix to "Ignition"
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' (wishin' now)
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like "So what? I'm drunk" (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (fun)

Crystal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere, as if the party was catered (catered)
We got fellas to my left (left)
Honies on my right (right)
We bring 'em both together, we got jukin' all night
Then after the show, it's the (after party)
Yeah, and after the party, it's the (hotel lobby)
Yeah, around about 4, you gotta (clear the lobby)
Then take it to the room and freak somebody

Can I get a "toot toot"?
Can I get a "beep beep"?
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro (yeah)
Bouncin' on twenty-fours (come on)
While they sayin' on the radio (check it out)

It's the remix to "Ignition"
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' (come on)
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like "So what? I'm drunk" (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (check it out)

This is the remix to "Ignition" (come on now)
Hot and fresh out the kitchen (yeah)
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' (wishin' now)
Sippin' on coke and rum (yeah)
I'm like "So what? I'm drunk" (uh-huh)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (come on now)

Girl, we off in this Jeep
Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Stroke it round and round
To the remix
We just thuggin' it out
