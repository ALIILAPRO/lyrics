		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run the track like an athlete
Don't let anyone pass me
Break my bones, but I'll take what's mine
Town known for where the sun don't shine
I don't wanna hear these kids laugh
I wanna take my own path
I don't wanna hear this shit

Yeah, 10th of July 'round that
Time that I noticed you
Looked into your eyes, felt alive
I was bulletproof
Always been a mess, did my best
But got kicked out only threw a fist at the
Kids with a big mouth
Only had my dogs and my pride
But you didn't care you saw through it all
Left my pain on the silver chair
Yeah, didn't really think that
It could happen
Knew you were the one 'cause
You broke my habit's

Break, break, break break, break, break
Take a water break girl, it's tragic
Sipping till I'm dry
I don't need medication, quiet down
I'm fine chasing you like chasing my highs
No goodbyes, never leave me here
No more pills, I'll be clean this year

10th of July 'round that time
That I noticed you
Looked into your eyes, felt alive
I was bulletproof
Always been a mess, did my best
But got kicked out only threw a fist at the
Kids with a big mouth
Only had my dogs and my pride
But you didn't care you saw through it all
Left my pain on the silver chair
Yeah, didn't really think that
It could happen
Knew you were the one 'cause
You broke my habit's
