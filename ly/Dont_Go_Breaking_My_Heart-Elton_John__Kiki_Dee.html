		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't go breakin' my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breakin' my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh honey, when you knocked on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

Ooh-ooh
Nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
Ooh-ooh
Nobody knows it (nobody knows it)
But right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh-oh
I gave you my heart

So don't go breakin' my heart
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart

Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
Now it's up to us, babe
Whoa, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I got your heart in my sights

Ooh-ooh
Nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
Ooh-ooh
Nobody knows it (nobody knows it)
But right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh-oh
I gave you my heart

Don't go breakin' my heart
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart

Ooh-ooh
Nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
And right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh-oh
I gave you my heart

Don't go breakin' my heart
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my
Don't go breakin' my
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
Don't go breakin' my heart
Don't go breakin' my
I won't go breakin' your heart
