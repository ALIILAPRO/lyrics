		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go
Go to the mountain if you must
Go to the burning bush
If it would ease your troubled mind
I'll be prepared to stay behind?

I know you better than you think I do
Don't worry, dear, this is why I fell in love with you
The man in the looking glass
Is looking back at you at last

You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide

If happy times are too few and far between
It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
So disappear, vanish if you wish
Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness

And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go
May not be true to say that you'll return one day
But in your present state you may as well not be here at all
You wear a thin disguise it's from yourself you hide
Just take a look at us we are heading for a fall

Now presiding in this court of hip-hop, Justice, my rap forte
Judge, jury, bailiff or prosecuting D.A
Ceteris paribus, my modus operandi
Is carpe diem whether de facto or de jure, comprende?
The People vs you and your Sensei
Teaching that style of word-play, weaker than Wednesday
Regardless of what your friends say, they're all dissable
Stricken from the record and deemed inadmissible
While this long arm of the law grabs the mic to
Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
The def sentence of this Live litigator
Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
Stenographer are steady logging the jargon
That your counselors are barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
But when you read back verbatim, what they're saying to persuade them
They realize exactly how I've played them
I come with the truth, whole truth, and nothing but
'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with Live will
I brew skill with refills from now until
Plagiarizing MC's get their flows distilled

Baby I don't die without you by my side
As long as you return into these arms that burn
Baby I won't die just take a look inside
Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

I won't die, if you leave me high
I won't die if you're not by my side

And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
