		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up in a new day with sensation
Let go of my yesterday frustrations
'Cause all of my lessons
They turn into my blessings
With more patience
So I'm proclaiming
That this day is gonna be wonderful
I said it
And so it's so
And so it's so
This day is gonna be wonderful
I said it
And so it's so
And so it's so
'Cause I know my words
They come with worth
They come with power
So I speak of substance
And I say abundance
It is ours
And I say that justice services me right
I know there's protection on my life
Oooh
Peace
I allow it
Yeah, this day is gonna be wonderful
I said it
And so it's so
And so it's so
My day is gonna be wonderful
I said it
And so it's so
And so it's so
Oooh
I'm holding onto my light
All things on purpose it's all aligning (for me)
I know abundance is mine
Oooh
