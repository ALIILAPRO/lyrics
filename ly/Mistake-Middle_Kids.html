		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my darling, pick you up just to let you drop
When we got started, I was guarded
I almost forgot about you
It was charming, the way we danced around the truth
We were smiling and always hiding
And when I feel we're somehow quickly slowing

Thought I was healthy but I'm choking
It must be catching up, my smoking
I wish that I never played

You're standing out in the rain tonight
Like you've got something to say to God
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back
You're standing out in the rain tonight
Like you got something to say to God
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back
You wanna make it okay

What's the problem? Spilling up some of my guts
One day you're fine, the next you're crying
And suddenly your engine just stops going

Thought you were healthy but you're choking
It must be catching up, your smoking
I wish that you never played

You're standing out in the rain tonight
Like you've got something to say to God
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back
You're standing out in the rain, tonight
Like you've got something to say to God
Have you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back?
You wanna make it okay

You're standing out in the rain tonight
Like you've got something to say to God
And he's got a debt to pay back
For something he did way back
You're standing out in the rain tonight
Like you've got something to say to God
Have you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back?
You wanna make it okay
