		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nigga, I'm the winner
I'm the chosen
I'm much better than these niggas you been fucking with
Whatever
Block me out your phone
Block me out the gram
Block me out your life like forever
Said I don't give a damn
Bitch whatever

"Life is like a film" or whatever
"Come and get your fill in" or whatever
Let your heart be still, motherfucker
Let the fucking skills keep on coming
I'll do the fucking the drills so I'm better
No more fucking pills, I was running
No more fucking tabs, brain was broken
Almost fucking crashed, God said no way

Nigga I'm the winner
I'm the chosen
I'm much better than these niggas you been fucking with
Whatever
Block me out your phone
Block me out the gram
Block me out your life like forever
Said I don't give a damn
Bitch whatever
