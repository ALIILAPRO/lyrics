		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I'm gonna break every heart 'til it's no man's land
I'll draw all my scars on them
Ooh, I'll make 'em scared of the dark so they understand
Why I want a no man's land

Every pair of high heels is a knife in disguise
So be nice and goodbye
Got nails as sharp as Wolverine
Just ask my ex-men what they see
I don't ever knock unless I'm knocking someone out
Takes more than a lock to keep me out

Ooh, I'm gonna break every heart 'til it's no man's land
I'll draw all my scars on them
Ooh, I'll make 'em scared of the dark so they understand
Why I want a no man's land

A no man's land, a no man's land
A no man's land, a no man's land
A no man's land, a no man's land
A no man's, I want a no man's land

Catch me like a grenade, feel me detonate
Friendly fire, violent desire
Razor blades and ricochets
Guns of august, cunt crusades
Conquer and divide, baby, it's fate

Ooh, I'm gonna break every heart 'til it's no man's land
I'll draw all my scars on them
Ooh, I'll make 'em scared of the dark so they understand
Why I want a no man's land

A no man's land, a no man's land
A no man's land, a no man's land
A no man's land, a no man's land
A no man's, I want a no man's land

Fuck
