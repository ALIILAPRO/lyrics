		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not easy on my bed sheets
It's not easy on my nerves
It's not easy on my conscience
It's not easy on my soul
This is not what you wanted
What you wanted for me
I know that much now
My apologies

You would call me a harlot
You would call me a whore
But see I'm a man now
I'm worth so much more

But I've got the heart of a hustler
With a hustler's pain
I've got the heart of a hustler
With all the hustler's shame
I've got the body of a lover
With a masochist's brain
I've got the heart of hustler
I'm playing a dangerous game

The mind says no sir
But the body says please
The heart stays silent
Such a silent tease
And I don't know why I'm telling you this
Maybe I've gotta get it off my unholy chest
There's a road once traveled
But one I haven't walked down yet
And it calls my name (it calls my name)
Yes it calls my name
It's a darker path
And it calls my name

I've got the heart of a hustler
With a hustler's pain
I've got the heart of a hustler
With all the hustler's shame
I've got the body of a lover
With a masochist's brain
I've got the heart of hustler
I'm playing a dangerous game

I'm playing a dangerous game
I'm playing a dangerous game
I'm playing a dangerous game
I'm playing a dangerous game

I've got the heart of a hustler
With a hustler's pain
I've got the heart of a hustler
With all the hustler's shame
I've got the body of a lover
With a masochist's brain
I've got the heart of hustler
I'm playing a dangerous game

I've got a hustler's heart
I've got a hustler's heart
I've got a hustler's heart
I've got a hustler's heart
I've got a hustler's heart
I've got a hustler's heart
I've got a hustler's heart
I've got a hustler's heart
