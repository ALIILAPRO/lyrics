		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It must've been very hard
To have lived and never learn't
To be content with who you are
We all want the same things don't we
To find the one who opens channels to our hearts
A path you never found upon your own.

[Chorus]
Forever can be...
Something to believe in...
But this was one of those times
Forever can be...
Something to bleed for...
But this is one of those times

So you dug deep down inside yourself
You revealed an old man
So pained to be what makes you who you are
We all want you to see the you we see
The one that carries the worlds tragedies alone
The cross you choose to bear upon your own.

[Chorus]

For those you left behind

Save the world so you don't have to save yourself
You save the world so you don't have to look at yourself
And fill the void left inside your fragile hearts
Those haunted images never left you alone...

[Chorus]
