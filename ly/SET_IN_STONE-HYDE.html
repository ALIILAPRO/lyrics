		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A jealousy grows in his head
It's escalating thread by thread
Unbalance frame over his bed
Planning a spree there's no time left

We can't breathe, we can't dream
These empty prayers are all we know
We can't breathe, we can't dream
We're sacrificing flesh and bone

Infectiously the hatred spreads
It's escalating thread by thread
Hypocrisy just leaves more dead
Planning a spree and we're running

We can't breathe, we can't dream
These empty prayers are all we know
We can't breathe, we can't dream
We're sacrificing flesh and bone

正当化された銃の所持
銃口は国民に向けられる

I believe we can heal
Refusing to be set in stone
I believe we can heal
We'll show them, we are not alone

We can't breathe, we can't dream
These empty prayers are all we know
We can't breathe, we can't dream
We're sacrificing flesh and bone

正当化された銃の所持
銃口は国民に向けられる
正当化された銃の所持
銃口は国民に向けられる
