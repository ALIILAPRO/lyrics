		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby
Ooh, ooh, hey

Ah, she got cherry lips, angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise

She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Got me lifted, driftin' higher than the ceilin'
Ooh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?

Ooh, sweet-talkin' lady, love how you entice
Sugar with just the right amount of spice
Charmin', allurin', everyone's desire
She's out to get you, you can't run, you can't hide

She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
I say, so far from typical but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, well baby, don't you be surprised

Got me lifted, driftin' higher than the ceilin'
Ooh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

So fly, ooh, hey
Oh, babe
Yeah, hey

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?
Said sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
But you won't get me tonight

Got me lifted, driftin' higher than the ceilin'
Ooh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?
So, sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?
