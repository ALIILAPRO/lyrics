		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? No

What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake
You broke the sweetest promise that you never should have made

I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"

How could you do this, babe?
(What about your promises, promises?)
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you babe

(What about your promises, promises, promises? Oh)

What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face
Doesn't look so innocent, your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"

How could you do this, babe? (Oh)
(What about your promises, promises?)
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

Since you admitted it (oh)
I keep picturing (oh)
Her lips on your neck (oh)
I can't unsee it (oh)
I hate that because of you
I can't love you, babe

What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away

How could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you babe

I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
We ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you babe

What about your promises, promises?
