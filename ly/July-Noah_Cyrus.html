		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in bed

You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

So tell me to leave, I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day, I'm not enough, but I still stay

Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by
While we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on

You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

So tell me to leave, I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day, I'm not enough, but I still stay

If you want me to leave, then tell me to leave, and baby, I'll go

You remind me every day, I'm not enough, but I still stay
