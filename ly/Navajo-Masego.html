		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find the
Say the only words I know that you'll
Until I, until I
Say the only words I know that you'll
Until I

I know you see it, girl
This ain't sitting real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle, uh
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me

I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
She be slangin' thangs like a simian (now I know)
All my life I wanted me an Indian (there she goes)
Now she's far away
But I had to know

Listen, I know you see it, girl
This ain't sitting real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle, uh
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me

I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
But she be slangin' thangs like a simian (now I know)
All my life I wanted me an Indian (there she goes)
Ooh, girl let me in (whoa)

In the street with a wedding ring
And she hit the bar
City babe, are you down to cheat?
He looked in her eye
Chivalry is it really dead?
He pulled out a tip (pay up), uh 
Jumpin' right on him
Thinkin' when's it good to intervene
Then I lost her
Lost her to the world and the girls and imposters
Entertain? I doubt it'll pay and it cost her
I ain't mad at me but it hurts

And I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
Now she only worried bout' the Benjamin's (grab the gold), uh
All my life I wanted me an Indian (there she goes)
I swear that eye's on me
But I don't know
I swear that eye's on me

Yeah, uh
I swear that eye's on me
Yeah, yeah
I swear that eye's on me
Yeah, uh
I swear that eye's on me

I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
