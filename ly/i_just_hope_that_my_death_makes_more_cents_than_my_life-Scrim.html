		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Yeah, money goin' up
Goin' up, yeah (turn me up, up, up, up)
I keep goin' up, goin' up, yeah, yeah
I keep goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, up, yeah
Money goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, yeah

Cash up, mask up, yeah, mhm
Drank up, paid up, nah, mhm
When I'm up, spend it up, yeah, mhm
When I'm up, don't give a fuck, nah, mhm (let's go, let's go, let's go)

I just bought my girl Chanel and a Birkin bag (turn me up)
I just rolled past twelve with the percocet
I been doin' too well to be feelin' sad
I just spent a hundred K on my mom and dad
I might spend another hundred on my bitch car (on my bitch car)
Damn, my pockets too swole to be pissed off
Pullin' up, lookin' like I came from Yellow Stone
Hit my realtor like, "Yeah, I need another home"
I might take off like a gamble
Tell my plug I need a Kia phone
I done dropped seven figures in the trap house
Dope dick, yeah, all my bitches tapped out
Masked up in the stu, I done left the streets
Still paranoid, always keep my heat in me
Young North, in the GLE I feel like Yeat
Young Wetto in the Uris, man, I feel like Keef
Got the AR in the Ram like I'm Casey Dunn
I got plenty bitches lyin' sayin' that we fuckin'
All these bitches on my wood like a tree hugger
I got family, they can't wait to see my under 'cause I'm

Cashed up (yeah), masked up, yeah, mhm
Drank up, paid up, nah, mhm
When I'm up, spend it up, mhm
When I'm up, don't give a fuck, nah, mhm

Yeah, money goin' up
Goin' up, yeah (turn me up, up, up, up)
I keep goin' up, goin' up, yeah, yeah
I keep goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, up, yeah
Money goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, yeah

Cash up, mask up, yeah, mhm
Drank up, paid up, nah, mhm
When I'm up, spend it up, yeah, mhm
When I'm up, don't give a fuck, nah, mhm (let's go, let's go, let's go)

Yeah, mhm (turn me up)
Nah, mhm
Yeah, mhm
Nah, mhm
