		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Hoo) (It's the Rascals)

Baby don't you know you got all my love (all my love)
Baby don't you know you got all my love (all my love)

Hold up, wait, before you go just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, uh?

See what you don't understand
Is falling in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, I call you my man?
Thought, would I ever fall in love, ever fall in love again?

'Cause you give me chills, every time we chill
I spend all of my days
Doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection all my attention
You don't gotta question, If I'm really
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)

Hold up, wait, shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go

See what you don't understand
Is falling in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, I call you my man?
Thought, would I ever fall in love, ever fall in love again?

'Cause you give me chills, every time we chill
I spend all of my days
Doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you baby
(Boy you got all my time)
I'm lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection all my attention
You don't gotta question, If I'm really
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)

Savin' my trust
Don't mess this up
(You got me fallin' in love, you got me fallin' love)
(You got me fallin' so hard) Boy you change the way I breathe
When you put your lips on me, I adore you
So let me make it clear that you're the boy that all I need
Oh baby

Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you baby
(Boy you got all my time)(baby)
I'm lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection all my attention
You don't gotta question, If I'm really (baby)
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' it, lovin' it baby

Baby don't you know you got all my love (all my love)
Baby don't you know you got all my love (all my love)
