		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?

And here you are again
Bad news from a bad friend
They call you an omen, only here to torment
Wicked and hellbent, a damned soul pretending
But I don't believe them, oh oh oh oh

You don't want me to stay alone
That's why you gotta sing your song
You keep tapping at my door
Nevermore, nevermore, nevermore

But can I ask you something?
A favor from you my friend
The song you keep singin'
Nevermore, nevermore, nevermore

Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?

Raven can you hear me?
Thought you loved me, but you fooled me
You drove me to madness, no one here to witness

Vicious and relentless
A villain in a black dress
Too late I should have listened, oh oh oh oh

You want me to be alone
Remind me of what is gone
Singing from dusk till dawn
Nevermore, nevermore, nevermore

A question before I go
A favor from you my foe
The song you keep singin'
Nevermore, nevermore, nevermore

Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?

Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh raven, won't you sing me a happy song?
