		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could, I could, I could be your
I could be your, I could be your

You don't gotta say all the bad things
Sipping on your brain like it's codeine
We could run away to a paradise
So pick anywhere you like

And take a second for the city lights
Yeah, we'll just sit here 'til we get it right
'Cause I ain't ever gonna change my mind
I hope you know this

You know, you know, you know, you know
I could be your lifeline
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't
You don't gotta hurt baby
If the world is coming down
I won't let you drown
Even if you start to lose your hold
I won't let you go, no
You know, you know, you know, you know
I could be your lifeline (I could, I could, I could be your, I could be your)
I could be your lifeline (I could, I could, I could be your, I could be your)
I could be your lifeline

I know what it's like bein' hopeless
Bruises on your mind like it's broken
But there's a better life on the other side
So pick anywhere you like

And take a second for the city lights
Yeah, we'll just wonder 'til we get it right
'Cause I ain't ever gonna change my mind
I hope you notice
You know, you know, you know, you know
I could be your lifeline
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't
You don't gotta hurt baby

If the world is coming down
I won't let you drown
Even if you start to lose your hold
I won't let you go, no
You know, you know, you know, you know
I could be your lifeline (I could, I could, I could be your, I could be your)
I could be your lifeline (I could, I could, I could be your, I could be your)
I could be your lifeline (I could, I could, I could be your, I could be your)
I could be your lifeline (I could, I could, I could be your, I could be your)
I could be your lifeline

I could, I could, I could be your
I could be your, I could be your lifeline
