		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you ever think is "Gimme, gimme"
But you never give back (eh eh eh)
All I ever do is over think and drink
Until I attack (eh eh eh)

We know how to talk it into the ground
We know how to wear it out
If we ain't gon' say that
Gonna end up in a grave and baby

How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said, oh my
How do we take back?
'Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said, oh my
Hey

I fed you a fantasy
But you've been drunk on reality (eh eh eh)
All you want is to be wanted
As long as you get it out of me (eh eh eh)

We used to be a jungle, sticky and wild
It used to be we owned the night
All the stupid games we play
And all the shit that we've been sayin'
(Eh eh eh)

How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said, oh my
How do we take back?
'Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said, oh my

Remember, remember the first time we collided
We lost it, we lost it
Yeah!

How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said, oh my
How do we take back?
'Cause no one wins
When love breaks down, we both die
I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
How do we take back what's been done,
What's been said, oh my

Ooh my
How do we take back
