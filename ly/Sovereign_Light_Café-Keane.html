		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powder Mill Lane and the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns

I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide eyed dreamers and wiser too

We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade and watch night
Coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

I'm begging you for some sign but you still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day
Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade and watch night
Coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drums and the lovers appear to take turns
As the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

I wheel my bike off the train, up the north trade road
And look for you on marley lane in every building and every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from the road

But you've got nothing to hide, you come to change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy but you won't go far

Let's go down to the rides on east parade
By the lights of the palace arcade and watch night
Coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drums and the lovers appear to take turns
As the stars of the Sovereign Light Café


La la la la la la la la la yeah, yeah
I'm going where the people know my name
