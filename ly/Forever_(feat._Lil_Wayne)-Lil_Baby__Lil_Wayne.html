		  (Who made this beat?)
(Twysted Genius, baby)

If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (gimme that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step out, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
Now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud
Seem like all of my bitches plastic
No, you niggas don't want smoke
Let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let 'em catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active

Wrap it, make sure they can't smell it
Drive too far? Don't matter, I'll mail it
Tryna steal swag, I see it, I smell it
Used to get mad, probably beat up my celly
Now I sell bags every day in my city
Ain't doin' no playin', when they come, be ready
I got murder on my mind like that lil' nigga Melly (free Melly)
Big boy rocks, stud the same size as Nelly (ten karats)
Long as I live, I'ma get this cheddar
Ever since the bitch left, doin' lil' better
Which car I'ma drive? It depends on the weather
Rolls-Royce truck pull up like, "Hello"
Pretty, tall, light skin, shake like Jell-O
If the bitch act bougie, I'ma take her to the ghetto
If I ain't smokin' Runtz, then it's probably Limoncello
You got a lil' boy 'cause you not on my level
Sell P's every day in the hood on my schedule
Young nigga give a old ho groove like Stella
Jam don't shake like that, that's Jell-O
Made a whole M on the road, then lay low
I'm a real boss in my hood, I got say-so
I was havin' choppas 'fore I heard about Dracos
Put me in the casket with a bust down halo, yeah

If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (gimme that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step out, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
Now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud
Seem like all of my bitches plastic
No, you niggas don't want smoke
Let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let 'em catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active

Suavé (huh), sippin' promethazine latte (yeah)
Sticky-ass weed like Scotch tape (yeah)
Big beast, call me Banijay (hoo)
Me and Lil Baby compadre (yeah)
What these niggas talkin' 'bout? Blasé (huh)
Diamonds on me, that's pavé (huh)
So bright, can't see, that's a blind date (huh)
Molly freak tryna get highway (ooh)
I got M-O-L-L, why wait?
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like, "Where the hell is my grave?"
Heartbeat beatin' at a high rate
World stop spinnin', start to vibrate
It's a cold world, so my house in Miami still came with a fireplace
Pupils dilate, don't judge me
I'm with a sex slave, she like rough D
I got a text straight from the plug, he said "There's a drought"
I said, "Funny", now we laughin'
And only time that we act, is when we act asses
Nigga, we active
So if you 'bout that life, get out that casket

If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (ooh, gimme that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together (yeah, yeah)
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step out, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
Now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud
Seem like all of my bitches plastic
No, you niggas don't want smoke
Let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let 'em catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active

Yeah, fuck 'em we get active, yeah
We can get active, yeah
Still got some active, yeah
Fuck 'em we get active
Fuck 'em we get active
