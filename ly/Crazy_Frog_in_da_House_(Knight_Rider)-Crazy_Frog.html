		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the people were waiting for crazy face
He said he'd meet them at his favorite place
Dressed in black stain, white linen and lace
With his head held high and a smile on his face

He said
Ladies and gentlemen, the prince is late
As he stood outside the church-yard gate
And polished up on his thirty eighty and said
I got it from Jesse James

All the people were waiting for crazy Face
He said he'd meet them at his favorite place
Dresses in black stain, white linen and lace
With his head held high and a smile on his face

And he said
Ladies and gentlemen, the prince is late
As he stood outside the church-yard gate
And polished up on his thirty eighty and said
I got it from Jesse James
