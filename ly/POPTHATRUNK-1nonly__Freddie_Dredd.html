		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bubble bath, and grip my '44 up off the dresser)
(Now I'm finna go up on a fuckin' spree) 
(dwilly, I'm scared)
(Bubble bath, and grip my '44 up off the dresser)
(Now I'm finna go up on a fuckin' spree-spree-spree-spree) ayy, ayy

I might shoot it, get the .44 and pop tha' trunk
Like what the fuck? These bitches goofy
Do the most, like fuck it, uh, fuck it
Runnin', poppin', 'cause I know he wanna try to do shit
Pistol got it, watch it stoppin' bullets
.30 keep it movin' (ayy), like stop

I cannot leave a trace, but I think I gotta go
Spillin' blood, it's a race and I'm always needin' more
Homicide on my mind, why you think you 'bout to die?
See the Freddie in your room and you 'bout to meet the doom

Pop it, pop it, rock it, sock it
Walker's thirty bullets knock him
Got a pocket rocket, shock 'em, hundred bands up in my wallet
He be talkin', talkin', talkin', take the money from his pockets
Pistol got it, watch it, stop it
Watch it, watch it, where you walkin', little bitch
I don't wanna fuck, I don't wanna fuck sticks
Pop it out the truck, pop it out the truck kiss
Own this .44, I bring the magazine
The paper coming up, the blue and green is what you lackin'

I might shoot it, get the .44 and pop tha' trunk
Like what the fuck? These bitches goofy
Do the most, like fuck it, uh, fuck it
Runnin', poppin', 'cause I know he wanna try to do shit
Pistol got it, watch it stoppin' bullets
.30 keep it movin' (ayy), like stop

I cannot leave a trace, but I think I gotta go
Spillin' blood, it's a race and I'm always needin' more
Homicide on my mind, why you think you 'bout to die?
See the Freddie in your room and you 'bout to meet the doom

Rock steady, Glock heavy, I just wanna get it goin'
Speed it down now get a grip
Where's my gun? It's on my hip
Off the rip, I just wanna break it down and make it flip
On your block, I'm about to pop it off and make you flop
Get it off the get-go, I need more money, oh no
I rob the plug and do the dash and hit the gas and almost crash
They never see me coming, I just took 'em by surprise
Little did he even know, he's about to meet demise

I might shoot it, get the .44 and pop tha' trunk
Like what the fuck? These bitches goofy
Do the most, like fuck it, uh, fuck it
Runnin', poppin', 'cause I know he wanna try to do shit
Pistol got it, watch it stoppin' bullets
.30 keep it movin' (ayy), like stop

I cannot leave a trace, but I think I gotta go
Spillin' blood, it's a race and I'm always needin' more
Homicide on my mind, why you think you 'bout to die?
See the Freddie in your room and you 'bout to meet the doom
