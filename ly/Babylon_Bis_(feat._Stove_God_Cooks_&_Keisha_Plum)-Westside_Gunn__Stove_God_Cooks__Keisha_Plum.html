		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

Ayo, you know my drug of choice, let me sniff Fifth Ave
You know I'm way out your league boy, your raps too trash
My denims two thousand a leg, a deuce on the dash
Since Hitler 1, I been over your head
I'm makin' ravi on the top floor, penthouse wave
The bitch had a nosebleed, told her cocaine pays
Ever seen a million in art? The visuals caught
My frame is housing your brain, playing Yves Saint Laurent
The streets hot, I got a Glock just to flaunt
Nigo zip-up with the sharks, selling nickels in the park
Beggars tickle, then they spark
Niggas fickle, got no heart
Green beam on my mark, fiend lean in the dark
Have you seen, have you saw I'm a G inside my guard
Two divas on my arm, two-seaters out in Prague
I went from four and a baby, to Roc Nation, to Shady
Then I wore Celine boots, them bums tried to play me
Wore a Goyard bag, bum niggas tried to gay me
Like I'm not the same nigga who brought you Pray for Haiti
Seem like it's everybody hate West lately
Hit him in his head, rudeboy shot Jakey
Make sure the fish scale tasty, guess who baeski

Louis lovers, shootouts all summer
The switch do numbers, they thought them broke days would humble us
That's before the plug Dikembe Mutumbo'd us
All four door panels off so we could stuff enough
I was water whippin' on my Prince shit
This what it sound like when doves swimming in the kitchen
Purple rain turn to coke fog, I'm the dope God
Write my name in the steam on the pot
Kilo wrappers drop on marble floors, caught lightning in a bottle in Marcy
Then West turned me from a rapper to a artpiece
Shine the sun on me, I'm feeling like Dan Marjerle
You see a sparkle once you break the corner piece
I can't sell a quarter key, I don't wanna break it up
Have them niggas run down on you, oh you was fakin' huh
Scorpions on the apron, whip Damian Lillard, I had O's in a Blazer
Hang me on the gold cross, bitch I'm really the savior
Stove Jesus had coke dreams sleep in the manger
Bitch, I'm major, bitch- you know who the fuck I am

I'm a genius, I'm a God, I'm a priceless piece of art
I'm the truth, I'm the light, I write these songs best at night
My medusa head red, I'm a goddess in the bed
Roses grow between my legs, roses grow between my legs
Fuck around and you'll end up dead
She was on the run from the feds
Sleep with one eye open, menage with two ARs in the bed
Dior scarf to tie up her hair, tie up all loose ends
To leave a witness is a sin
Keisha Plum flow, Westside Gunn the inspo
Gxfr like Pablo Escobar mixed with Griselda Blanco
Chopard diamond glows
In the summertime, we serve 'em snow
Cocaine eskimos, igloo full of bricks
Grimiest from the 716
I'm a genius, I'm a God, I'm a priceless piece of art
I'm the truth, I'm the light, I write these songs best at night
My medusa head red, I'm a goddess in the bed
Roses grow between my legs, roses grow between my
The scorpion is the predator, the scale is for balance
God is the greatest, Superflygod
Brrt
