		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To be more than a conqueror
You have to learn to enjoy the pain
If you want to survive the game

You can try to defeat me
You don't know it's the pain that'll feed me
And I'm gonna take back what you took me for
'Cause I was born for this
All the bones that you're breakin' (breakin')
You pretend that you're the one that can save me (save me)
Now I'm takin' it back, it was never yours (never yours)
I'm fightin'

Fightin' for my focus
Give the pain a purpose
Light the fire inside
Feel it come alive (come alive)
Show 'em what I'm made of
Victories for the brave ones
Who never bowed a knee
When it's do or die (do or die)
One more time

Survivin' the game, I can be unstoppable
Gonna walk through hell, gonna shake the walls
Survive, survivin' the game (survivin' the game)
Livin' the impossible
I'm the champion, indestructible (survive)
Survive, 'cause I'm survivin' the game

I can be unstoppable
Gonna be indestructible
I can be unstoppable
Gonna be indestructible

All the liars around me
Like the wolves of the walls, they surround me
In the face of the fear, I keep standin' tall
'Cause I will conquer this
I come out like a lion (lion)
I was born to be demon-defiant (defiant)
And I won't ever let this kingdom fall (fall)
I'll show 'em

Show 'em what you're made of
Victories for the brave ones
Never bow the knee
'Cause it's do or die (do or die)
One more time

Survivin' the game, I can be unstoppable
Gonna walk through hell, gonna shake the walls
Survive, survivin' the game (survivin' the game)
Livin' the impossible
I'm the champion, indestructible (survive)
Survive, 'cause I'm survivin' the game (game)

I am more than a conqueror
The past behind me, life is ahead
I'll take the way of the warrior
I walk alone, no fear to the death
One more time

Survivin' the game, I can be unstoppable
Gonna walk through hell, gonna shake the walls (survive)
Survive, survivin' the game (survivin' the game)
Livin' the impossible
I'm the champion, indestructible (survive)
Survive, 'cause I'm survivin' the game (survive)
Survivin' the game (survive)
Survivin' the game, livin' the impossible
I'm the champion, indestructible (survive)
Survive, 'cause I'm survivin' the game (survive)

I can be unstoppable
Gonna be indestructible
I can be unstoppable
Gonna be indestructible
