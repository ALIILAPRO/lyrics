		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm holding on, on, yeah
I'm holding on
Feeling's too strong, mmm, yeah
So I'm holding on, yeah

Now with both hands on it, I'ma hope
That you put your phone down, I'ma hope
Your girl tryna tell you I'm a hoe
I curved her a while ago
Now I go high, you go low
Why, oh, why, would you meet me at the middle?
You come and go
And come right back to my pillow (skrrt)
La di da di, Bugati in the driveway (skrrt)
Park sideways like it's my place
Hit your hot spot, that's a fireplace
Water on my wrist, she gon' hydrate
Gotta give me 24 hours
'Cause I'm with 24hrs
Got the money and the power
The world weighed me down but

I'm holding on, on, yeah
I'm holding on
Feeling's too strong, mmm, yeah
So I'm holding on, yeah
I'm holding on
24hrs
I'm holding on
24hrs

Now Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday are her days
Ayy, if it ain't a race, why you run in the first place?
'Cause I'm a hurry
To show you I'm the best one
I'm right now here and the next one
If you love her, let her go
I can't let you go
I'm holding on like a three-year-old in your arms
Just like the chain I got charm
Been on it for so long
Bugati still on your lawn
She a beast, she Queen Kong
She take it off and take it all
And I put both hands on it for 24hrs

I'm holding on, on, yeah
I'm holding on
Feeling's too strong, mmm, yeah
So I'm holding on, yeah
I'm holding on
24hrs
I'm holding on
24hrs
