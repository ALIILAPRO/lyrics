		  Santana, aye
It's Dipset, bitch
There it go 
Baby, don't stop now
There it go 
Baby, don't stop now

There it go
Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinkin' 'bout gettin' at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ayy, girl 
You make 
My whistle blow
There it go 
Bring it here, baby
There it go 
Bring it here, baby

Top down and I'm at it again
It's hot now and I'm at it to win, you heard me?
Who want it with me? Nobody want it with me
Oh, I'm so fly, oh, mami come and get me
Sit it down, back up, bring it on back up
Move it 'til you feel somethin' hard on your back, huh
There it go 
If you want it, come get it
I ain't kiddin' I'm with it 
Here it go, go
So girl 
Let me
See you get low
There it go
Yeah, just like that
Move the thang like a boomerang and come right back
There it go 
I don't need to ask I proceed to grab her
Chicks love my G'd up swagger 
There it go

There it go
Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinkin' 'bout gettin' at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ayy, girl
You make 
My whistle blow
There it go 
Bring it here, baby 
Come on
There it go 
Bring it here baby 
Come on
Ayy, girl
Let me 
See you get low

There it go 
Set it down, baby
There it go 
Set it down, baby (oh)
There it go
It's Dipset (oh)
There it go 
Aye, aye, aye
There it go 
It's Dipset (oh)
There it go 
Aye, aye

I got to get it, I'm so hot terrific
So not fair to the other guys that's in it
I know not a limit, just know sky's the limit
'Til then I'm doin' my, doin' my, doin' my thing
So baby keep movin' your, movin' your, movin' your thing
And that'll keep you in the, you in the, you in the ring (or maybe not)

Ayy, girl
You make me 
Want to know

You do it like a pro, lil' lady
If so bring it here, let it show, lil' lady
There it go
Let's go, lil' lady 
To the crib, to the telly, you know, lil' lady
Um, yes girl 
Um, yes we can have a cum-fest, girl
'Til the sun sets girl (girl)
But first I gotta get you undressed, girl
So take off them clothes and get undressed, girl

Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinkin' 'bout gettin' at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ayy, girl
You make 
My whistle blow
There it go 
Bring it here, baby 
Come on
There it go 
Bring it here baby 
Come on
Ayy, girl
Let me 
See you get low

There it go 
Set it down, baby (go 'head)
There it go 
Set it down, baby
