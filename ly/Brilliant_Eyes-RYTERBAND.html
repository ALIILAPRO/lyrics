		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You move like dust in the sunlight
Hear the waves and you harmonize
They say I'll know it when it feels right
Well everything is golden
The moment that you open
Your brilliant eyes
Your brilliant eyes

You find the space between the raindrops
Never brace, just shrug it off, shrug it off
Hold my face when I feel lost
Everything is golden
The moment that you open 
Your brilliant eyes

Play on the high wire
It'll be alright
Dance on the skyline
It'll be alright
Outside of time
Three thousand miles 
You're in my view
Ooh

When we're sinking in the pillows
Speak your mind with a laugh that knows
Something told me to follow
Your brilliant eyes

See inside what I'm afraid of
I might hide but I'm not giving up, giving up
Leave me a light, you know I'll meet you
Where everything is golden
The moment that you open 
Your brilliant eyes

Play on the high wire
It'll be alright
Dance on the skyline
It'll be alright
Outside of time
Three thousand miles 
You're in my view

Your brilliant eyes
Brilliant Eyes
Play on the high wire
It'll be alright
Dance on the skyline
It'll be alright
Outside of time
Three thousand miles 
You're in my view
