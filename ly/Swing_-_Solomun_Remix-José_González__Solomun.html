		  Ooh

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing what nature gave you
Swing and move like you don't care
Swing to the rhythm inside you
Swing to the waves in the air

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing what your mama gave you
Swing your bum like seaweed
Swing what your papa gave you
Swing your hands like forest leaves

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby
Move, move
Move your body, buddy

Sing to what nature gave you
Sing like the whales in the sea
Sing to the sound that surrounds you
Swing to the beat of the rhythm machine

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby (swing your belly, baby)
Move, move
Move your body, buddy (move your body, buddy)

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby (swing your belly, baby)
Move, move
Move your body, buddy (move your body, buddy)

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby (swing your belly, baby)
Move, move
Move your body, buddy (move your body, buddy)

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby (swing your belly, baby)
Move, move
Move your body, buddy (move your body, buddy)

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby (swing your belly, baby)
Move, move
Move your body, buddy (move your body, buddy)

Swing, swing
Swing your belly, baby (swing your belly, baby)
Move, move
Move your body, buddy (move your body, buddy)
