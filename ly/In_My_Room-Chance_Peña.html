		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say counting stars,
you play the part of a soul missing home
Were you counting stars?
Cause you packed your bags, had your heart set to roam
when you left for Georgia
Said your friends didn't want ya
but I swear I do
Say what we are
Time's not a problem, do you think we were moving too fast?
Guess we weren't meant to last
I can't move on from that and
I don't have the words
So I'll keep counting stars
inside of my room
inside my room
(in my room)
(my love, where did you go? where'd you go?)
