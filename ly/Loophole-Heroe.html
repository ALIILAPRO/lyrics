		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me wanna hide
You make me wanna go
You made me wanna lie
You make me wanna hold

I don't know about you
Sometimes i wish
Fade away
Into the darkness

I don't know about them
Sometimes i wish
To disappear
And never look back

No one cares
No one knows
No one gives a shit

No one cared
No one helped
No one gave a shit

No one felt 
No one showed
No one talked to me

No one said
No one called
No one noticed me

And if i could run away
Leave it all behind
And just go straight

And if i could run away
Run away
Run away

You make me wanna fight
You make me wanna love
You make me wanna try
All the things you've done
