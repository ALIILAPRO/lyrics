		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you okay?
'Cause you're the one who needed space
And finally now I'm doing fine
You would rather see me cry
Are you okay?
You're acting like we never changed
And finally I can sleep at night
Makes you wanna lose your mind

I know that you've been scared of love
And everything it did to us
But how am I supposed to open up?
When you were just so good at closing off
You're up and down, I'm inside out
You ripped my heart right from my mouth
And then I had to go and pick it up
And play it like I didn't give a fuck

You called up my phone fifty times from that party
Three AM, you thought I'd be there in a heartbeat
Your life but you might wanna put down the Bacardi
Mean this sincerely, dude

Are you okay?
'Cause you're the one who needed space
And finally now I'm doing fine
You would rather see me cry
Are you okay?
You're acting like we never changed
And finally I can sleep at night
Makes you wanna lose your mind

You called my friends, you called my dad
You begged for help to win me back
And they would never say it to your face
But no, they never liked you anyways
You missed my birthday and my shows
You made me feel so damn alone
And somehow now you got so much to say
Don't got time to listen anyway

You called up my phone fifty times from that party
Three AM, you thought I'd be there in a heartbeat
Your life but you might wanna put down the Bacardi
Mean this sincerely, dude

Are you okay?
'Cause you're the one who needed space
And finally now I'm doing fine
You would rather see me cry
Are you okay?
You're acting like we never changed
And finally I can sleep at night
Makes you wanna lose your mind

Are you okay?
Are you okay?
(Are you okay?)
