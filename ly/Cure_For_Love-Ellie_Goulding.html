		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scars in my mind from the ones left behind and it's war
How many times have I asked who I'm doing this for?
Put myself on the line just so they're feeling less insecure
Won't do it no more

I can't fight the fever in my veins
The weakness in me always calls your name
Quiet, but my heart beats like a drum
Here's to being lonely (here's to being lonely)

I don't need a cure for love, I'm movin' on
Given too much, didn't get enough
Sick, but not broken-hearted tonight
I don't need a cure for love, yeah, I'll move on
Given too much, didn't get enough
Sick, but I'm gettin' started tonight
I don't need a cure for love

Guess it's like poison, I'm hearin' your voice like a drum
I'll be my medicine, know I'll be better alone
Caught up in emotions and now I'll be lettin' 'em go
Gotta let it all go

I can't fight the fever in my veins
The weakness in me always calls your name
Quiet, but my heart beats like a drum
Here's to being lonely (here's to being lonely)

I don't need a cure for love, I'm movin' on
Given too much, didn't get enough
Sick, but not broken-hearted tonight
I don't need a cure for love, yeah, I'll move on
Given too much, didn't get enough
Sick, but I'm gettin' started tonight
I don't need a cure for love

Sick, but not broken-hearted
Now I know where my heart is
Don't need someone to start it tonight
Sick, but not broken-hearted
Now I know where my heart is
Don't need someone to start it, no

I can't fight the fever in my veins
The weakness in me always calls your name
Quiet, but my heart beats like a drum
Here's to being lonely (ooh, here's to being lonely)

I don't need a cure for love, I'm movin' on
Given too much, didn't get enough
Sick, but not broken-hearted tonight
I don't need a cure for love, yeah, I'll move on
Given too much, didn't get enough
Sick, but I'm gettin' started tonight
I don't need a cure for love
Sick, but not broken-hearted
Now I know where my heart is
Don't need someone to start it, no
I don't need a cure for love, yeah, I'll move on
Given too much, didn't get enough
Sick, but I'm gettin' started tonight
I don't need a cure for love
