		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did it start? Well, I don't know
I just feel the craving
I see the flesh and it smells fresh
And it's just there for the taking

These little girls
They make me feel so goddamn exhilarated
I fill them up, I can't give it up 
The pain that I'm just erasing

I tell my lies and I despise every second I'm with you
So I run away and you still stay
So what the fuck is with you?

Your feelings, I can't help but rape them
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same
My heart inside is constantly hating
I'm sorry, I just throw you away

I don't know why I'm so fucking cold
I don't know why it hurts me
All I wanna do is get with you
And make the pain go away

Why do I have a conscience?
All it does is fuck with me
Why do I have this torment?
All I wanna do is fuck it away

I tell my lies and I despise every second I'm with you
So I run away and you still stay
So what the fuck is with you?

Your feelings, I can't help but rape them
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same
My heart inside is constantly hating
I'm sorry, I just throw you away

I tell my lies and I despise every second I'm with you
I run away and you still stay
So what the fuck is with you?

Your feelings, I can't help but rape them
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same
My heart inside is constantly hating
I'm sorry, I just throw you away (I hate)

(I) just thrown you away
(I) just thrown you away
(I) just thrown you away
(I) just thrown you away
