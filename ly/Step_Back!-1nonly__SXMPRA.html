		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uhm, it's a good time to say, "Holy smokes"

Said, "What's up? Bitch, what's happenin'?"
Bitch tryna suck on my dick, I might tap it
See this .40 round clip, the grip, I might grab it
My hollow point tip, yo' lip, it cause havoc
So out my way, bitch, move it, fuck it up
I got like way too many bands, pockets flooded up
And what I got in my advance, make yo' stomach fucked
I keep a strap up on my waist, it got a hollow tucked

'Cause like, damn, move out my way
Got new money comin', bitch, stack my pape'
I leave his ass wanted, I ain't catch a case
New whip, no keys, electric race
Like, what the fuck? You bitch, you jake, you fake
You off the grid, your face decay
I shoot yo' limbs, my K, two dicks, I got two twins (ayy)

'Cause I'm boomin'
All these pussy bitches that be talkin' nothin' to my face
He wanna pull up with a gat and get sprayed, fuck that
Got two dicks on me, got one for your bitch
And the other with a laser, you get tased
Slide through, go drift in a Civ' after talkin' to yo' bitch
Leave a red dot beam to your face
And my money makin' money, where your bands go? (Ayy)
Bitch, fuck around (ayy)
I'ma pull up (ayy), and I'll catch another case
Like, damn, shit, huh?
What yo' clique gon' do?
When I slide to yo' crib, what yo' blick gon' do?
Got yo' girl up on my line, what yo' bitch gon' do?
Curb stomp a pussy bitch (ayy), what my Rick's goin' through
Like, damn, shit, and I keep that boom
If it's over me and you, who yo' bitch gon' choose?
Flex a hundred dollar shoes, what yo' fit gon' prove?
And you see me goin' up (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Why you look confused, huh?

Tell a pussy boy that I said, "Step back"
Motherfucker wanna talk, but I'm gettin' the bag
I see the reason that the motherfuckers takin' it bad
They know they never wanna be the one to step like that, like
Boom, bitch, you don't want this
I'ma pull up with the glick, pussy wanna talk shit, like
Every motherfucker wanna talk about another
But they never wanna be the one to pull up the numbers
See me doin' good, now they wanna say, "I said so"
Tell me why they never gave a minute from the get-go
Tell me why they never wanna motherfuckin' let go
Tell me why my legacy is 'bout to be in set stone

You don't really wanna play on my ninth life
Like, oh, my, put them in a lyrical drive-by, I slide by
Spittin' like a motherfuckin' villain
I'ma never let them ride 'til they pickin' the right side
The cyanide in yo' drink, go bye-bye
Make plays, get bank, for my own time
Stay away from the motherfuckers tryna be
The ones to take a blade to my name, I choose life
Revenge on my chest, I stay in my best
They stayin' mad that I be winnin', do I make you upset?
I'm makin' moves, and now they comin'
'Cause I'm gettin' some bread
But you weren't there when I was broke
And now you think that we friends
Forget it

Da-da-da-da-da-damn, move out my way
Got new money comin', bitch, stack my pape'
I leave his ass wanted, I ain't catch a case
New whip, no keys, electric race
Like, what the fuck? You bitch, you jake, you fake
You off the grid, your face decay
I shoot yo' limbs, my K, two dicks 
I got two twins (two twins, got twins, got twins, got twins)
