		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stir it up, little darlin', stir it up, me on, baby
Come on and stir it up, little darlin', stir it up, oh-oh

It's been a long, long time, yeah (stir it, stir it, stir it together)
Since I've got you on my mind (oh-oh-oh-oh) oh-oh
Now you are here (stir it, stir it, stir it together), I said
It's so clear
To see what we could do, baby, (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Just me and you

Come on and stir it up, little darlin'
Stir it up, come on, baby
Come on and stir it up, yeah
Little darlin', stir it up, oh-oh

I'll push the wood (stir it, stir it, stir it together)
Then I blaze ya fire
Then I'll satisfy your heart's desire (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Said, I stir it together (stir it, stir it, stir it together)
Every minute
All you got to do, baby, (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Is keep it in, and

(Stir it up) oh, little darlin'
Stir it up, baby
Come on and stir it up, oh-oh-oh
Little darlin', stir it up, wo-oh mmh, now, now

Quench me when I'm thirsty
Come on and cool me down, baby, when I'm hot (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Your recipe is, darlin' is so tasty
When you show and stir your pot

So, stir it up, oh
Little darlin', stir it up, wo, now
Come on and stir it up, oh-ah
Little darlin', stir it up

Oh, little darlin', stir it up, come on, babe
Come on and stir it up, wo-o-a
Little darlin', stir it up, stick with me, baby
Come on, come on and stir it up, oh-oh
Little darlin', stir it up, stir it, stir it, stir it, stir it, stir it
