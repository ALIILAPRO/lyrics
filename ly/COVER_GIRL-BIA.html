		<p>
		  Uh (uh)

(Aziz) I'm not fuckin' no nigga, if he don't deserve it
Blew a bag on that pussy 
'Cause he know I'm worth it (blew a bag, blew a bag)
Maybelline, CoverGirl for certain
And my body on point, they be like "Who's your surgeon?" (BIA, BIA)
Turns out, I'm never in a drought
If I'm what these niggas say, I look better in person (BIA, BIA)
I'm already gettin' used to the lurkin'
Man these bitches can't stop
They the regular version (skrrt)

Whip's German, the coins I earned 'em
Bitches baby daddy's, I'm still curvin' (next)
Hundred thousand dollar car, just to send the doors in (skrrt)
Made him quit the drink 
'Cause it was fuckin' up his organs (uh)
Niggas act like Future 
But they say the want a Lauren
The irony, huh
Quit tryin' me (huh)
Okay take me out to Barney's if you proud of me
I like baguettes, I like Pateks
Boy if you drownin' me (facts), ay

I'm not fuckin' no nigga, if he don't deserve it
Blew a bag on that pussy 
'Cause he know I'm worth it (blew a bag, blew a bag)
Maybelline, CoverGirl for certain
And my body on point, they be like "Who's your surgeon?" (BIA, BIA)
True story, you broke niggas want me
I been countin' hunnids ever since I was a shorty (uh)
I get to the money and you know it's mandatory (uh)
Askin' for my time and you know you can't afford it (uh)

I'ma spend his money (cash), I'ma save mine (BIA, BIA)
'Cause I'ma bail him out if he do jail time (uh)
Or empty out the safe, if he ain't worth the wait
'Cause I'ma get mine, I do him real slime
I promise you gon' love it, I'll be worth the chase
'Cause I can be the Dreka to your Kevin Gates (BIA, BIA)
He tryna fuck me raw, we on the second date
He got these bitches thirst but I just can't relate

Spend that bag for a real bitch
Spend that bag if you love me
I got ten thousand niggas wanna feel this
But you can only get it if you lucky

I'm not fuckin' no nigga, if he don't deserve it
Blew a bag on that pussy 
'Cause he know I'm worth it (blew a bag, blew a bag)
Maybelline, CoverGirl for certain
And my body on point, they be like "Who's your surgeon?" (BIA, BIA)
True story, you broke niggas want me
I been countin' hunnids ever since I was a shorty
I get to the money and you know it's mandatory (facts)
Askin' for my time and you know you can't afford it (can't afford it)

BIA, BIA, uh
