		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This love is getting kinda dangerous
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My mind, it's turning like a cloud of dust
My heart always wants to run

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

White horse

Someday, maybe you could have your way
Right now's just not the time
Some things a man's just got to do
I wish you could change my mind

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

White horse

If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there

If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

White horse
