		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm obsessed with the way that she dress
She looking good in that tight red dress
Pull it up
Bend over
Open up
You're getting closer
I'm obsessed with the way that she dress
She looking good in that tight red dress
Pull it up
Bend over
Open up
You're getting closer

Baby, I'm going to need it again so come over
Don't nobody know you like I know you
Make her say she love me
I own her
She knows I'm the only one
That can make her fold up
Hold up
Catch your breath don't slow up
She put it down and I control her
Hands on her neck
She getting wet
Im going to put her to the test
Im going to put her to the test

Your my little secret
Baby can you keep it
We both know the reason
I don't want it girl I need it
But if she finds i'm cheating
She'll tear me to pieces

You know I'm your best kept secret
So show it like you know and believe it
Now you're wrapped around
No don't make a sound
Got you showing up without a reason
I got on your favorite dress
You see me in it and I know your impressed
It's not over til i'm closer

I'm obsessed with the way that she dress
She looking good in that tight red dress
Pull it up
Bend over
Open up
Your getting closer
I'm obsessed with the way that she dress
She looking good in that tight red dress
Pull it up
Bend over
Open up
Your getting closer
