		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you 
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should've been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you 
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you, baby

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

(Yeah)
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm bein' honest, yeah
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be without you

So one last time 
I need to be the one who takes you home (babe)
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart (babe)
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah

One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
