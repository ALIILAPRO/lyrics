		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bring back the love, to me
Hold me back into it
Was never enough, for you
Take me back again

Bring back the love, to me
Hold me back into it
Was never enough, for you
Feels like, we'll never be the same again

Bring back the love, to me
Hold me back into it
Was never enough, for you
Take me back again

Bring back the love, to me
Hold me back into it
Was never enough, for you
Feels like, we'll never be the same again

All I ever know is the look in your eyes
Hold me like you did
Never was the one to leave your side
Take me back again

All I ever know is the look in your eyes
Hold me like you did
Never was the one to leave your side
Take me back again
