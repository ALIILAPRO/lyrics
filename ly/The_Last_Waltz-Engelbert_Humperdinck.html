		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wondered should I go or should I stay,
The band had only one more song to play.
And then I saw you out the corner of my eye,
A little girl, alone and so shy.

I had the last waltz with you,
Two lonely people together.
I fell in love with you,
The last waltz should last forever.

But the love we had was going strong,
Through the good and bad we get along.
And then the flame of love died in your eye,
My heart was broke in two when you said goodbye.

I had the last waltz with you,
Two lonely people together.
I fell in love with you,
The last waltz should last forever.

It's all over now, nothing left to say,
Just my tears and the orchestra playing.

La la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la.

I had the last waltz with you,
Two lonely people together.
I fell in love with you,
The last waltz should last forever.

La la la la la la la la la.
