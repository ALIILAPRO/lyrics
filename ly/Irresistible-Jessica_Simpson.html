		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I don't know what it is
But something about you is so irresistible

Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase But I can't stop fanning the fire
I Know I meant to say no

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
And irresistible to me
(Yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I can't stop myself from falling
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no
(I meant to say no)

But he's irresistible (irresistible)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
(I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical
Deeper than spritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Can't you see whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
he's so irresistible
Baby you know it's more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful

He's so irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
(I can hardly breath)
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

He's irresistible
Up close and personal (irresistible to me)
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
