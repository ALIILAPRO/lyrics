		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
'Cause Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh, let's go

Now, he sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I mean the big fat man with the long white beard
He's coming to town
