		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna hear all that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' commas, how much you need and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on me?
Where your ass was at, dog, I'm 'bout it, come slide
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was servin' pies?

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinkin' Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumpin'
Runnin' through the pussy like a nigga goin' joggin'
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'Gram, now you poppin'
Where your ass was at when I was trappin' in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rollied up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryna come in the spot wouldn't open up the door
Burglar bar doors got my young nigga cuffin'
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin' "Honest"
Blowin' on the O, yo, we call that ho onion

Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was, "What's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're payin' back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and that commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man, I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at? I had the 6 on my shoulders

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Sixty for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fuck 'em like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezin' on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezin' on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my cup?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Where you ass was at, when I was trappin' in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin' "Honest"
Blowin' on the O, yo, we call that ho onion
