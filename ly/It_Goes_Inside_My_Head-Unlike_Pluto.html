		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So psychedelic 
I feel the colors and it's so chromatic 
I crashed a Maserati and I'm laughing
I like these thoughts when they come out to play

Oh, oh-oh
It goes inside my head
And brings out someone else instead, ayy
Confuse the system
Reboot it, crash it all again, ayy
Goes inside my head
And brings out thoughts I never kept, ayy
And I can never access it, it's chemically fed, ayy

So stylistic 
Vintage metal tee that's so chromatic
Bet you've never heard a song, I'm laughin' (ooh)
I like these thoughts when they come out to play

Oh, oh-oh
Ooh, it goes inside of my head
Ooh, unlock these thoughts you think are unsafe

It goes inside my head
And brings out someone else instead, ayy
Confuse the system
Reboot it, crash it all again, ayy
Goes inside my head
And brings out thoughts I never kept, ayy
And I can never access it, it's chemically fed, ayy

A spiral that unwinds, oh no
It loosens up my mind, oh no
Sublime are the thoughts I hide
Let 'em free, let the chaos fly 

It goes inside my head
And brings out someone else instead, ayy
Confuse the system
Reboot it, crash it all again, ayy
Goes inside my head
And brings out thoughts I never kept, ayy
And I can never access it, it's chemically fed, ayy

Confuse the system
Reboot it, crash it all again, ayy
