		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Left alone in space and time,
Missing out on what was mine,
Want to close my eyes for what is real,
Close my eyes for what I feel

holding on to what was true,
I don't know anyone like you,
Trying hard to capture what I feel,
You were close but yet so far,
We just had a love bizarre,
I don't understand the things you said,
Understand what's in your head

why! oh why! did you have to leave me, have to say goodbye!
Oh why! did you have to leave me, give it one more try,

why! oh why! did you have to leave me, have to say goodbye!
Why! oh why! did you have to leave me, give it one more try,

Left alone in space and time,
Missing out on what was mine,
Want to close my eyes for what is real,
Close my eyes for what I feel

in the end you are to blame,
I move on, forget your name,
But it's hard to live without you loving me

why! oh why! did you have to leave me, have to say goodbye!
Oh why! did you have to leave me, give it one more try,

why! oh why! did you have to leave me, have to say goodbye!
Why! oh why! did you have to leave me, give it one more try,

why! oh why! did you have to leave me, have to say goodbye!
Why! oh why! did you have to leave me, give it one more try
