		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm at another party again
Don't wanna be here but I am
I'm way too weird to make friends
My mom says "Try to fit in"
So I'm at party again
Don't wanna be here but I am
I'd rather be home in my bed
I gotta get out of this place
Looking for the fire escape
Social attractions
Hope no one noticed me standing
Alone by the bathroom
I'm just emotionally damaged
I fall in love with a stranger
A hopeless romantic
I don't wanna make small talk
I don't wanna begin
Acting like we give a fuck
Faking like we are friends, yeah
I don't wanna make small talk
This is where it ends
This is where it ends, 'cuz
I'm at another party again
Don't wanna be here but I am
I'm way too weird to make friends
My mom says "Try to fit in"
So I'm at party again
Don't wanna be here but I am
I'd rather be home in my bed
I gotta get out of this place
Looking for the fire escape
Social attractions
(Looking for the fire escape)
Emotionally damaged
(Looking for the fire escape)
Social attractions
(Looking for the fire escape)
Emotionally damaged
(I'm at another party again)
At another party
At another party
I'm at another party again
(I'm at another party again)
I'm at another party
I'm at another party
I'm at another party again
