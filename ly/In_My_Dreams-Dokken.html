		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains

Toss and turn all night in the sheets
But I can't sleep
Night after night, don't know what it means
In my dreams

What can I say or do?
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

Calling your name but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles, waiting to see you
In my dreams

What can I say or do?
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

Oh, in my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams, it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams, you'll always be
In my heart and in my dreams

In my dreams, it's still the same
In my dreams, you're still by me
In my dreams, just the way it used to be (in my dreams)
In my dreams, what can I say?
In my dreams, you're still by me
And in my dreams, you'll always be

In my dreams, you'll always be
In my dreams, your love is strong
In my dreams, you're still the same

In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
