		  (Troy Taylor, you the GOAT)

Ayy, I'll give up my hoes before I let her go
Swear I might propose, more than a champagne toast
All my Compton bros tell me
"Daddy-o, you better take care of home before she's adios"
You should know that I don't brag, but I gotta boast
I shower you with darling gifts, I do the most
I paint the walls, I decorate, I made your flowers grow
It ain't about who had it first, but 'bout who hold you close

We should be vibin' at home
So I can kiss you from head to toe
We never been here before
Playin' Brandi, singin', "Never Say Never"
You should be puttin' it on (uh, uh)
Wanna be with you eternally
I'ma set the tone, I've been takin' notes
I'll give up my hoes 'fore I let her go

Ayy, I'll give up my hoes 'fore I let her go
Ayy, but would you lie for me if you were under oath?
I'll let you see my childhood crib, let you meet my folks
Now wait 'til everybody sleep before we do the most
Took your puppy to the groomers while you at South Coast
Always askin' me what color you should paint your toes
Girl, walk back to me, so I can lick your lipgloss off
She know exactly what I need, that's a female boss (oh, yeah)

We should be vibin' at home (vibin' at home)
So I can kiss you from head to toe
We never been here before
Playin' Brandi, singin', "Never Say Never"
You should be puttin' it on (uh, uh)
Wanna be with you eternally
I'ma set the tone, I've been takin' notes
I'll give up my hoes 'fore I let her go
We should be vibin' at home (ooh-wee)
So I can kiss you from head to toe (kiss you from your head to your toes, baby)
We never been here before
Playin' Brandi, singin', "Never Say Never" (Never Say Never)
You should be puttin' it on (uh, uh, puttin' it on)
Wanna be with you eternally (with you eternally)
I'ma set the tone, I've been takin' notes (oh, yeah)
I'll give up my hoes 'fore I let her go
