		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know we ended things
But I swear it's not over
Cause life's a game of chess
And I wanted your soul first
I'm obsessive baby
I don't mean to be a downer
And when you get with me
You belong to me, I'm your owner
I wanna be your only thought
The only thing in your head
And I want you to dream of me
At night, sleeping in bed
Don't worry about other girls
Cause those connections will end
It's just me and you baby
Just me and you 'til death
So let's just worry about us
And don't worry about the trust
Because I'll keep your location
And you know that's a must
So let's just worry about us
And don't worry about the trust
Because I'll keep your location
Cause I'll keep your location
Baby I control your brain
Only I can win this game
You can't run away from me
I live in your fantasies
It's not my fault
You fell in love
Nobody else
Is good enough
And when you look into my eyes
I see that you just wanna die
But baby I'll keep you alive
Cause I need you right by my side
I guess
I'm outta my mind
