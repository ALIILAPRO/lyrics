		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, sun rise the eyes open (know what it is)
Uh, yellow bus, the kids laugh (know what it is)
Bell ring, I'm rushin' out (know what it is)
Huh, I wasn't too fond at math (know what it is)
I wasn't too fond off class (know what it is)
Unless there was an interesting lady interested in conversatinh (know what it is)
And if there wasn't, I wasn't (know what it is)
Ironically, that was the only way I passed (know what it is)
Hahahahahahahahaha, I laughed (know what it is)
For hood rat shit, I was a fan (know what it is)
Growin' up middle class made a nigga have (know what it is) 
Much more to prove just to prove he a man

You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is, you makin' somethin' out of nothin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'

The bitches love a little juve'
I mean that literally and figuratively, hope you understood me
I prove it from the holes 
I make a dump a whole lotta bullets on yo' block to prove he ain't a pussy
The irony is steamer like
Tryna straighten out my act so my mind could get some peace tonight
Or maybe a little peace tonight
Little do she know, I'll be sneakin' in my piece tonight
In case we hit a lick tonight, uh
I wasn't raised like that
But I gotta find the way to raise my stats
I'm tryna be 99 at shooting
And 99 overall rating
When I raise my strap
Yeah, huh, see, I don't mean to blame the kitty kat
But just to separate them chocolate legs, I do whatever I can
Gettin' money and respect is the plan
That's the only way to turn a little boy to a man

When you a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is, you makin' somethin' out of nothin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is, you makin' somethin' out of nothin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
