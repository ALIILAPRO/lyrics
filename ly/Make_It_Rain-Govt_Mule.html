		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took all my money, my best friend
You know the story, here it comes again
I have no pride, I have no shame
Gotta make it rain
Make it rain

Now since you're gone, deep inside it hurts
Just another sad guest on this dark Earth
I wanna believe, in the mercy of the world again
Make it rain
Make it rain

Night's too quiet, stretched out alone
I need the whip of thunder and the wind's dark moan
I'm not Abel, I'm just Cain
Open up the heavens
Make it rain

Close to heaven, crushed at the gate
They sharpen their knives on my mistakes
What she done, you can't give it a name
Make it rain
Make it rain

Without her love
Without her kiss
Hell can't burn me, much more than this
I'm burning, with all this pain
Put out the fire
Make it rain

I'm born to trouble, born to fate
Inside a promise I can't escape
It's the same old world, nothing looks the same
Gotta make it rain
Make it rain

You've got to make it rain
Oh, you've got to make it rain
Make it rain
You've got to make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
You've got to make it rain
Make it rain
