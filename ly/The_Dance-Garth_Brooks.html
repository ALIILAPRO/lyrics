		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking back
On the memory of
The dance we shared
'Neath the stars above
For a moment
All the world was right
How could I have known
That you'd ever say goodbye

And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance

Holding you
I held everything
For a moment
Wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known
How the king would fall
Hey who's to say
You know I might have changed it all

And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance

Yes my life
It's better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance
