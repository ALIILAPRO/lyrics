		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Held you close when it got colder
Placed your head upon my shoulder
Now it feels like you don't know me
If it's real, then can you show me?

These are all the things that we'll choose to remember
Did you cross your fingers when you said forever?
Did it look the same with the other before me?
Am I just a name you flip through in your story

Of people
You've made to love you?

You could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
Oh, you could've given me a warning
If you knew that all your walls would cave in
Yeah, I could've given in some more
But you had me holding open the door
Oh, you could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holdin' out, holdin' out

Oh, I could've saw the spark in your eyes fading
All these steps that I'm retracing
'Til I get lost and time stops forever
Feel like I'm locked, but you're not, you're better

These are all the things that we'll choose to remember
Did you cross your fingers when you said forever?
Did it look the same with the other before me?
Am I just a name you flip through in your story

Of people
You've made to love you?
How can you have someone to lean on
If they don't get through?

You could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
Oh, you could've given me a warning
If you knew that all your walls would cave in
Yeah, I could've given in some more
But you had me holding open the door
Oh, you could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holdin' out, holdin' out

Oh, you could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
Oh, you could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
Oh, you could've
