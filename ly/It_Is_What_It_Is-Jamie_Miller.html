		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some things look good on paper
Some things are written in the stars
Some stories are worth telling
And then there's ours

Some things look like forever
That picture-perfect dream come true
Some people make you better
And then there's you

I guess it is what it is
Wrong place, wrong time
But I couldn't resist
Those night time white lies
Stuck on your lips
You were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again

I guess it is what it is
False hope, broke me
Like I'm something to fix
Road-trip type love
Then we drove off a cliff
You were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is

I gotta hand it to you
You played the victim all too well
It's hard to know you're lying
When you're lying to yourself

If the tears won't work
You won't find those words
That'll ever fix my heart
'Cause the day I fell for you
Is the day I fell apart

I guess it is what it is
Wrong place, wrong time
But I couldn't resist
Those night time white lies
Stuck on your lips
You were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again

I guess it is what it is
False hope broke me
Like I'm something to fix
Road-trip type love
Then we drove off a cliff
You were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is

Wrong place, wrong time
But I couldn't resist
Those night time white lies
Stuck on your lips
You were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again

I guess it is what it is
False hope broke me
Like I'm something to fix
Road-trip type love
Then we drove off a cliff
You were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is
