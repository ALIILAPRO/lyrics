		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I see that lantern trimmed low burning in our home
And though I feel like crying, I swear tonight, I'll cry no more

And how many times have I prayed
That I would get lost along the way?

Dream with the feathers of angels stuffed beneath your head
The regulator's swinging pendulum
Dream with the feathers of angels stuffed beneath your head
The regulator's swinging pendulum

Come with me and walk the longest mile
Come with me and walk the longest mile

Is his wallet leather? Is his wallet fat?
For not a year later it's got you lying on your back
You should have closed your windows and got another dog
You should have chained up all the doors and switched up all the locks

And how many times have I prayed
The angels would speed me away

Dream with the feathers of angels stuffed beneath your head
The regulator's swinging pendulum
Dream with the feathers of angels stuffed beneath your head
The regulator's swinging pendulum

Come with me and walk the longest mile
Come with me and walk the longest mile
Come with me and walk the longest mile
Come with me and walk the longest mile
