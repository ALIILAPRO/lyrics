		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could pack up this house, get out of town
Drive across country, one taillight out
You wouldn't need anything else now, would ya?
Just all my books and your old Daytona

Yeah, it's fine
Where you going, sunshine?
We got time
Sit back and I'll drive you to

All the pretty places
Pull us away from where the pain is
These open skies
Leaving the past behind
I would for
All the pretty places

Watch the sunrise, sunset, same day
When was the last time you did that anyways?
Singing to the radio, don't worry, baby
With the windows down, I can feel it in the air tonight

Yeah, it's fine
Where you going, sunshine?
We got time
Sit back and I'll drive you to

All the pretty places
Pull us away from where the pain is
These open skies
Leaving the past behind
I would for 
All the pretty places

I'll go anywhere
Let's go right now
I'll go anywhere
Doesn't matter how far
I'll go anywhere
All I need is you
I'll go anywhere
All we got is us now

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me to

All the pretty places
Pull us away from where the pain is
These open skies
Leaving the past behind
I would for
All the pretty places

I'll go anywhere
Let's go right now
I'll go anywhere
Doesn't matter how far
I'll go anywhere
All I need is you
I'll go anywhere
All we got is us now

I'll go anywhere
Let's go right now
I'll go anywhere
Doesn't matter how far
I'll go anywhere
All I need is you
I'll go anywhere
All we got is us now
