		<p>
		  When I find an outlet
When I find an outlet
I’m gonna plug myself in
I’ll plug myself in
When I turn the light out
When I turn the light out
I’m gonna tuck myself in
I’ll tuck myself in
There’s a ghost in my bed
It’s got the shape of you
There’s a ghost in my head
It sounds just like you
I’d like to spend a year abroad
I’d like to spend a year
Maybe take myself across the sea
And see what there might be to see
I’ll meet you on a beach in France
You’ll teach me that new TikTok dance
We’ll find a way to be
There’s a ghost in my bed
It’s got the shape of you
There’s a ghost in my head
It sounds just like you
I built this house around you
We took down the walls to improve the view
I built this house around you
It was never meant for two
We’re probably getting old enough
We’re probably getting old enough
To talk about the olden days
And all the ones we loved along the way
As signposts along the way
There’s a ghost in my bed
It’s got the shape of you
There’s a ghost in my head
It sounds just like you
I built this house around you
We took down the walls to improve the view
I built this house around you
It was never meant for two
When the winds creep in through the cracks in the door
Will we see them for what they are
A final resting place for somewhere that we’ve been before
Back when we believed that time would soften all the splinters we ignored
I built this house around you
We took down the walls to improve the view
I built this house around you
It was never meant for two
