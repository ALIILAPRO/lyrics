		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm done
I don't know where to run

People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight
Maybe we could start

I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?

It's so unreasonable
I know you

Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets

Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

I found myself
Found myself
Found

I found myself
Found myself
Found

Before this gets out of hand
No more distance let's just dance
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picture that?

Yeah, I don't know who you been dealing with
But I guarantee that you ain't been with this
Because if you had, you'd forget about the past

Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage, trust I can manage that
Can you picture that?

Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

I found myself
Found myself
Found

I found myself
Found myself
Found
