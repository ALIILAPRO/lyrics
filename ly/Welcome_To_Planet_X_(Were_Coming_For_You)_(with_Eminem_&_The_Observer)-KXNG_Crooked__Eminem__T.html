		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I live in a world that's different than your world
Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy
Those things don't exist in my world anymore
Welcome to my world
Welcome to Planet X motherfucker

It used to be parks
It used to be jungle gyms
Now they just stories passed down orally from my great-grandmother Nem
It used to be public pools
Kids loved to swim 'til the summer's end
Now it's enough poison in the water to slaughter your son and your daughter
You can blame the government
Let me tell you how it all started
The middle class was evaporated then the filthy rich couldn't stand the stench of the dirt
Poor of course who had the world oversaturated
So a new world order was activated
No more black, no more white, no more brown, no more yellow, no more red
Just high born citizens and low born citizens
And all that race shit was eradicated
You're either rich or you're poor now
Digital identity chip implanted in everybody born now
Being poor is like fighting a war now
No energy to fight the real enemy because you're worn out
Living life on a tight rope, but the trickery is the tight rope
It's slippery as a ice lope
Every second somebody is falling off
So we figure we embrace the misery
Nigga we never liked hope
'Cause hope was the buzzword
That they used to brainwash us, fuck that we unlearn
Now the rich people concerned
'Cause they know our return is confirmed by holding a gun firm
What's that in the distance?
You fucked slums raw 'til they gave birth to a resistance
You scared looking at your window
You see your own fucking children crawling over your fences

One by one they all come slow to meet their fates
Two by two I bury them in the shallow graves
Three by three they come at me, their guns and swords were drawn
Now four by four before the Lord they'll choose a withching spawn
'Cause we're coming for you
(Coming for you, coming for you)
La la la la la we're coming for you
La la la la la we're coming for you

Yo, what you gon' do now
It's too late for talking, I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearing the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now
Who got the juice now?
Aye yo, what you gon' do now
You wanna truce now
I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearing the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now
Who got the juice now?
Oil addiction, water polution
(Who got the juice now?)
Soil contamination and overconsumption
(Tell me who got the juice now?)
Wiped out two thirds of the planets fresh water
(Who got the juice now?)
And crop reserves creating a vast wasteland on a global scale
(Who got the juice?)

One by one they all come slow to meet their fates
Two by two I bury them (I bury them, I bury them) in the shallow graves
Three by three they come at me their guns and swords were drawn
Now four by four before the Lord they'll choose a withching spawn
'Cause we're coming for you
(Coming for you, coming for you)
La la la la la we're coming for you
