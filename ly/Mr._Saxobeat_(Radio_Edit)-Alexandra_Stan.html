		  You make me dance, bring me up, bring me down, play it sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat
Makes me dance, brings me up, brings me down, plays it sweet
Makes me move like a freak, Mr. Saxo
You make me dance, bring me up, bring me down, play it sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat
Makes me dance, brings me up, brings me down, plays it sweet
Makes me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat

Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah

Mr. Saxobeat, Mr. Saxobeat
Hey, sexy boy, set me free, don't be so shy, play with me
My dirty boy, can't you see that you belong next to me
Hey, sexy boy, set me free, don't be so shy, play with me
My dirty boy, can't you see, you are the one I need

You make me dance, bring me up, bring me down, play it sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat
Makes me dance, brings me up, brings me down, plays it sweet
Makes me move like a freak

Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah

You make me dance, bring me up, bring me down, play it sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat
Makes me dance, brings me up, brings me down, plays it sweet
Makes me move like a freak
You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, Mr. Saxobeat
You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, Mr. Saxobeat
