		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

Everything still cool, being me, I can't lose
I know you getting confused, they like, "How you do it so smooth?"
Gotta stay in tune, with your love, I can't lose
Say nine, say ten, make sure you gon' lose, yeah (we love you, Tecca)

I can see you wanna vibe with me
Just say you wan' vibe with me
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You getting a lot of me
Probably why you callin' me
Is that why you callin' me?
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You getting a lot of me
I can see you wanna vibe with me
Just say you wan' vibe with me
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You getting a lot of me
Probably why you callin' me
Is that why you callin' me?
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You gettin' a lot of me

Mixin' different shades up, ballin' like the fall
Trap money, real money, yeah, I want it all
I just take my best feelings, put it in a song
I know I was right, I know you was wrong
Yeah, I got a vision, let it capture in 4K
We forever young, you won't see me in old age
I'ma do what I want right now, I can't wait 'til it's too late
Everywhere up in the world right now, ten bands in the suitcase

Everything still cool, being me, I can't lose
I know you getting confused, they like, "How you do it so smooth?"
Gotta stay in tune, with your love, I can't lose
Say nine, say ten, make sure you gon' lose, yeah

I can see you wanna vibe with me
Just say you wan' vibe with me
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You getting a lot of me
Probably why you callin' me
Is that why you callin' me?
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You getting a lot of me
I can see you wanna vibe with me
Just say you wan' vibe with me
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You getting a lot of me
Probably why you callin' me
Is that why you callin' me?
Feelin' like I won the lottery
You getting a lot of me
