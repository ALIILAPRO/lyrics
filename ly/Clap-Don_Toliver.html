		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So and so and on and on (oh, yeah)
If I want you gone, you gone
I send that pack, you goin' long (oh, yeah)
Either way you holdin' strong
I'm lookin' back how far we come (uh, huh)
Oh, yeah, I did that
Hello? (hello?) What's up? (What's up?)
You try to play around with me, or you gon' fuck (yeah)
On and on
Hear that clap, hear that clap, on and on

Don't stay too long, you might fall in love
Praying to the stars and my God above
She won't leave 'cause my diamonds VV's
Had to kick her back in, caught a flight overseas
Gettin' it off already, I'm playin' with p's
Sippin' on that almond, it's that Texas and tea

Show me some respect, girl, don't you hide it
I don't need no Henny, I get violent
I done caught this wave, and, oh, it's vibrant
Catch me in a Lamb', I put in mileage, ah
Show me some respect, girl, don't you hide it
I don't need no Henny, I get violent
I done caught this wave, and, oh, it's vibrant
Catch me in a Lamb', I put in mileage, ah

So and so and on and on (oh, yeah)
If I want you gone, you gone
I send that pack, you goin' long (oh, yeah)
Either way you holdin' strong
I'm lookin' back how far we come (uh, huh)
Oh, yeah, I did that
Hello? (hello?) What's up? (What's up?)
You try to play around with me, or you gon' fuck (yeah)
On and on
Hear that clap, hear that clap, on and on
Hear that clap, hear that clap, on and on
Hear that clap, hear that clap, on and on

I thought we had love, you needed my company
I capture that to my heart like that Rosary
You not knowin' me, now I'm ridin' out to that Jodeci
You love to play around (uh, huh), You need a golden league

Show me some respect, girl, don't you hide it
I don't need no Henny, I get violent
I done caught this wave, and, oh, it's vibrant
Catch me in a Lamb', I put in mileage

So and so and on and on
If I want you more, you more
I send that pack, you goin' long
Either way you holdin' strong
I'm lookin' back how far we come
Oh, yeah, I did it
Now I'm lookin' back how far we come
Oh, yeah, I did it, yeah
