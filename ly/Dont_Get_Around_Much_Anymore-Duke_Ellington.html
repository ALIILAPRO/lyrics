		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore
