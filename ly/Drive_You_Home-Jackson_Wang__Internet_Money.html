		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fell in love on Geary Boulevard, ayy
With the sun comin' down on the front of my car, ayy
Felt somethin' like, somethin' like an 80's movie, yeah
Felt somethin' like, somethin' like you'd never lose me, yeah

So why we gotta check into the heartbreak hotel?
Oh hell, you know me better than myself
I don't wanna go home, no way without you
Ain't gonna be good for my health
And every roadmap leads straight to your heart
So I can't leave you tonight
No, not tonight

'Cause who's gonna drive you home 
('Cause who's gonna drive you home)
When you've had a crazy day? 
(When you've had a crazy day?)
Who's gonna dry your eyes 
(Who's gonna dry your eyes)
When your tears fall like the rain?
Tears fall like the rain

I think we lived in a homemade video, ayy
But it's like you and I rewind to the lowest low, ayy
I always thought, always thought we could reverse it, yeah
I always thought, always thought we could be perfect, yeah

So why we gotta check into the heartbreak hotel?
Oh hell, you know me better than myself
I don't wanna go home, no way, without you
Ain't gonna be good for my health
And every roadmap leads straight to your heart
So I can't leave you tonight
No, not tonight

'Cause who's gonna drive you home 
('Cause who's gonna drive you home)
When you've had a crazy day? 
(When you've had a crazy day?)
Who's gonna dry your eyes 
(Who's gonna dry your eyes)
When your tears fall like the rain?
Tears fall like the rain

So who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
And I'm eighty miles from goin' insane
I've been missin', missin' those days
So baby, let me love you

We fell in love on Geary Boulevard
We fell in deep, we fell so hard
Maybe one more cruise will make it alright
While you hold my hand from the passenger's side, yeah

'Cause who's gonna drive you home 
(Baby, who's gonna drive you home)
When you've had a crazy day? 
(When you had a crazy day?)
Who's gonna dry your eyes 
(Tell me who's gonna dry your eyes)
When your tears fall like the rain? (Tears fall like the rain)
Tears fall like the rain (tears fall like the rain)

So who's gonna drive you home? 
(Who's gonna drive you home? Who's gonna drive you home?)
Who's gonna drive you home? 
(Who's gonna drive you home? Who's gonna drive you home?)
And I'm eighty miles from goin' insane (I'm eighty miles)
I've been missin', missin' those days (I've been missin' those days)
So baby, let me love you

So who's gonna drive you home?
