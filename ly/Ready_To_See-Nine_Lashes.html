		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't want to be
Standing underneath
Watching as the tower crumbled
I didn't want to be
Left in the debris
Struggling to step and stumble
It was everything to me
A castle and a dream
Cast into a home left hollow
It was everything to me
Wasted and diseased
I had to watch you burn it to the ground
I wanted what was mine
Wanted what was mine
The dust is settled now
But none of it was mine
None of it was mine
I'm letting it go
I know
In the outer cold
I never had control of nothing
I know
I gotta let it go
Running to the dawn that's rising
Now I'm ready to breathe
Your light will soon be found
As I'm ready to see
I'm ready to see
I didn't want to see
The fracture start to stretch out in the stone
I didn't want to see
That it would've crushed me
Crushed me on my throne
I wanted what was mine
Wanted what was mine
The dust is settled now
But none of it was mine
None of it was mine
I'm letting it go
I know
In the outer cold
I never had control of nothing
I know
I gotta let it go
Running to the dawn that's rising
Now I'm ready to breathe
Your light will soon be found
As I'm ready to see
I'm ready to see
I built a kingdom with these hands of mine
But this is the day it all comes down
Now I take the world in through my opened eyes
And there you are
And there you are
Let the light in
Stone after stone
So hollow the home
Now fractured and tossed in the sea
I'm taking a hold
I'll go where you go
I'll follow the light that I see
I know
In the outer cold
I never had control of nothing
I know
I gotta let it go
Running to the dawn that's rising
Now I'm ready to breathe
Your light will soon be found
As I'm ready to see
So burn it to the ground
I'm ready to see
I'm ready to see
