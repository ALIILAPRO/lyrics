		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
She's the greatest cook
And she's fat free

She's been to private school
And she speaks perfect French
She's got the perfect friends
Oh isn't she cool?

She practices Tai Chi
She'd never lose her nerve
She's more than you deserve
She's just far better than me

Hey, hey

So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry

And don't bother
I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

I'm sure she doesn't know
How to touch you like I would
I beat her at that one good
Don't you think so?

She's almost six feet tall
She must think I'm a flea
I'm really a cat, you see
And it's not my last life at all

Hey, hey

So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry

Don't bother
I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

For you, I'd give up all I own
And move to a communist country
If you came with me, of course
And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you
And lose those pounds, and learn about football
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't

So don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I promise you won't ever see me cry

And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
I promise you won't ever see me cry

Don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I promise you won't ever see me cry

And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
Not your type, not your type, not your type
I promise you won't ever see me cry
