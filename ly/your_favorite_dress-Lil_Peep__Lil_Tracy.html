(Ooh, Bi-Bighead on the beat)

I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
(Kiss me with your eyes closed, kiss me with your eyes closed)
(Kiss me with your eyes closed)
I know that's your favorite dress, set fire to it
I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
(Kiss me with your eyes closed, kiss me with your eyes closed)
(Kiss me with your eyes closed)
I know that's your favorite dress, set fire to it

You say you're a good girl, I say you're a liar (I say you're a liar)
How could such a good girl, love a vampire? (Love a vampire)
Kisses aren't enough, I wanna bite through you
I would never lie to you, I would never fool you

I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
(Kiss me with your eyes closed, kiss me with your eyes closed)
(Kiss me with your eyes closed)
I know that's your favorite dress, set fire to it
I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
(Kiss me with your eyes closed, kiss me with your eyes closed)
(Kiss me with your eyes closed)
I know that's your favorite dress, set fire to it

I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
Hate it when you fight me, love it when I die slow
She just wanna bite me, I could see your eyes glow
Kill me in my white tee, baby, let my blood flow
Let my blood flow, let my blood flow
We just havin' fun though
Now my blood froze, I can see the sun, ho
You're the one though, lookin' for my love though
Where my love go, baby, where my gun go?

I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
(Kiss me with your eyes closed, kiss me with your eyes closed)
(Kiss me with your eyes closed)
I know that's your favorite dress, set fire to it
I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
(Kiss me with your eyes closed, kiss me with your eyes closed)
(Kiss me with your eyes closed)
I know that's your favorite dress, set fire to it

(Turn me up, Big E)
