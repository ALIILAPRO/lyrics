		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I earned a pretty penny
I've turned a head or two
I've learnt you've let your guard down
When somebody's good for you
I've seen some miracles
Been flown across the world
To learn firsthand what they say
All that glitters isn't gold

All that glitters isn't gold
All that glitters, glitters, glitters

One time for the money
Two times for the love
Three times for the beauty
These are the things that dreams are made of
One time for my body
Two times for my soul
Three times for my honey
All that glitters isn't gold

We've got to take our chances
Can't always play it safe
Sometimes there's more to losing 
innocence and saving faith
Come be my great exception
Love can't be bought or sold
Don't need no diamond, honey
All that glitters isn't gold

All that glitters isn't gold
All that glitters, glitters, glitters

One time for the money
Two times for the love
Three times for the beauty
These are the things that dreams are made of
One time for my body
Two times for my soul
Three times for my honey
All that glitters isn't gold

Chemistry goes together
Like you and me
Don't cost nothing
But love ain't cheap
Listen, baby, shivers my spine
Oh my, oh my

So I fell to the bottom but I reached the top
I had everything and I lost it all
Life is crazy, love me, baby, with all you got
I swam with the Devil to face my fears
Sailed through an ocean that was filled with tears
Life is crazy, love me, baby, with all you got

One time (one time)
Two times (two times)
Three times (three times)
All that glitters isn't gold

One time for the money
Two times for the love
Three times for the beauty
These are the things that dreams are made of
One time for my body
Two times for my soul
Three times for my honey
All that glitters isn't gold
