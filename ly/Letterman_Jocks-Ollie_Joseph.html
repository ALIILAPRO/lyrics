		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  AMR Beats what we got?
All you G

Yeah, ties close, I whittled 'em down
Stick it to 'em by sticking around
The gang all on Iwo Jima
Got one flag and it stick in the ground
Setting up shop, think I got the message across
Came for the titles, impressive to watch
We play at the levels of letterman jocks

Pins on jacket the merit's abundant
The point of the road where it's barren and rugged
HUSH and I plotting on Paris and London
The products of not being scared of some judgment
Gotta stay in the cut, cut ya off if you ain't making the cut
Couldn't tell you who the hell is the behind us
You start to forget when you stay in the front
If it's up, and it's up for grabs
No remorse for who I'm taking it from
Numbers I give 'em on scoreboard
Is the only form of us staying in touch
That's saying enough
It's time to receive for all the favors I've done
Too late for y'all to switch teams
Everybody getting big leagued

Product flying off the shelf, what's in store for us?
Known to hit a hole in one, look at the crowd and shoulder shrug
Shots are limited, I'm Scaramanga with the golden gun
Posted up, ready for whatever boy you know what's up

Ties close, I whittled 'em down
Stick it to 'em by sticking around
The gang all on Iwo Jima
Got one flag and it stick in the ground
Setting up shop, think I got the message across
Came for the titles, impressive to watch
We play at the levels of letterman jocks

Shout out to Steve, the boy getting love from the harsh critics
Strauss hit me bi-weekly to tell me keep taking it further
You aren't finished and I gotta listen
They need somethin' to believe in
And see that I'm actually breathing and doing it real time
Love to pull an idea out thin air
Act on it and profit in real life
If we not aligned, don't present me a dotted line
Yeah I'm the QB, but I ain't handing out nothing for someone to monetize
And it goes for the birds too
Can't give her the time if a dollar's what caught her eyes
They get X'd out, 'fore the have the potential to be my ex
I know all the plays I'm a seasoned vet

Yeah, always showin' up
Known to hit a hole in one, look at the crowd and shoulder shrug
Shots are limited, I'm Scaramanga with the golden gun
Posted up, ready for whoever boy you know what's up

Ties close, I whittled 'em down
Stick it to 'em by sticking around
The gang all on Iwo Jima
Got one flag and it stick in the ground
Setting up shop, think I got the message across
Came for the titles, impressive to watch
We play at the levels of letterman jocks

Ties close, I whittled 'em down
Stick it to 'em by sticking around
The gang all on Iwo Jima
Got one flag, yeah
