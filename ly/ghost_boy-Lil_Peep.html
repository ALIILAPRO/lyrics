		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leave me alone, just leave alone
I'm growin' so tired of this
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch?
She callin' my phone, she callin' my phone
I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone, girl

I'm all on my own, I'm all on my own
I know you ain't high as this
Puttin' my mind to shit
Give me some time, I'll be flyin' bitch
Breakin' my bones, you breakin' my bones
You want me to line my wrist
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me, 'cause it help me forget
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me, 'cause I'm tryna get rich
I ain't gon' put on no Tommy 
If I don't got Tommy to put on my bitch 
Doin' my thing, now, bitch, I can sing
So don't expect all my flows, I just switch
Step in this bitch, let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain't smokin' on somethin', I'ma dip (skrt)

Leave me alone, just leave alone
I'm growin' so tired of this
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch?
She callin' my phone, she callin' my phone
I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone, girl

When you are on your own
Just know that I need you
I won't pick up the phone
Just know that I need you
