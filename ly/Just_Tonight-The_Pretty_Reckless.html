		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are
And I can't think from all the pills, hey
Start the car and take me home

Here we are
And your too drunk to hear a word I say
Start the car and take me home

Just tonight I will stay and well throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
Its telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then its all because of you
Just tonight

Here I am
And I can't seem to see straight
But I'm too numb to feel right now

And here I am
Watching the clock that's ticking away my time
I'm too numb to feel right now

Just tonight I will stay and well throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
Its telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then its all because of you
Just tonight

Do you understand who I am do you wanna know
Can you really see through me
Now I have got to go

Just tonight
I won't leave
And ill lie and you'll believe
Just tonight
I will see that its all because of me

Just tonight I will stay and well throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
Its telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then its all because of you
Just tonight
Its all because of you
Just tonight
Its all because of you
Just tonight
Its all because of you
Just tonight
