		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  My therapist
Called you learning experience
One-eighty an hour that's all that he mentions
Missing you is getting fucking expensive

It's been ten months now
There really ain't too much I've figured out
There was just something 'bout being wanted
By someone who never knew what they wanted

I've seen some other people who are nothing like you
That's probably why it works and why it never could
I'm holding on to nothing, don't know how to let it go
So even if it's out of my control

I try to
Explain you to myself
But you never seem to sound right
No matter how I try to
Explain you to myself

I'll hold you close
Tell me the memories that you miss the most
I loved you fully but I'm growing up now
I loved you fully but fully means more now

I've seen some other people who are nothing like you
That's probably why it works and why it never could
I'm holding on to nothing, don't know how to let it go
So even if it's out of my control

I try to
Explain you to myself
But you never seem to sound right
No matter how I try to
Explain you to myself
You never seem to sound right
No matter how I try to
Explain you to myself
You never seem to sound right
No matter how I try to
Explain you to myself

You never seem to sound right
You never seem to sound right
You never seem to sound (right)
You never seem to sound right
