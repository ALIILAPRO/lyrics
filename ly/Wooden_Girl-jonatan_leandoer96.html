		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no beginning
There is no end
I chose my line of work
So I could pretend
I know what will happen
Again and again
Some of them are morbid
And some are friends

Take this key and take me to the end
Lugubrious treason, trench coats out of town

I don't wanna share you with the rest of the world
That broken collarbone, you make my bones twirl
I don't wanna share you with the rest of the world
beauty inside evil, you're my wooden girl
I don't wanna share you with the rest of the world
That broken collarbone, you make my bones twirl

Take this key and take me to the end
Lugubrious treason, trench coats out of town

You remind me of the girl I used to know back when
Her eyes were made of cotton candy, she had no friends
But I would always talk to her, and they won't end
I haven't seen her for a while
You remind me of the girl I used to know back when
Her eyes were made of cotton candy, had no friends
But I would always talk to her, and they won't end
I haven't seen her for a while, but that's not where the story ends
That's not where the story ends

(If it)

If it was as easy as A-B-C
I wish you would love me just for me
Yeah, I'd stick my eyes out, make sure you're there
Don't wanna know of tomorrow, but I'm not scared

You answer my questions, don't laugh when I'm near
At the blueberry hotel, wish that you were here
Cut out my eyes, I put them on your wall
Still have the painting you drew that Fall
Cut off my legs then I hold your hand
Together we could make it alright in the end

Yeah, that was tough
