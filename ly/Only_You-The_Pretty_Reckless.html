		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "It was on a dreary night in November
That I beheld the accomplishments of my trials"

Oh boy, have you seen my head?
I've lost my mind so I forget and
Oh boy, have you seen my heart?
It's beating so loud, I'm falling apart and
Only you can bring me back to life
Only you can put me into right
Tell me when I can breathe again

Oh boy, have you seen my hands?
I can't hold on and I don't understand why
Dear boy, have you seen my soul?
It's under the ground
I'm out of control
Only you can bring me back to life
Only you can put me into right
Tell me when I can breathe again

Say you love me, true
Say you love me, true
Say you love me, true
Say you love me, true
Say you love me, true
Say you love me, true
Say you love me, true
True

Only you can bring me back to life
Only you can put me into right
Tell me when I can breathe again
I will rise
