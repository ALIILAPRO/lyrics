		  (Got that big dick energy)
(Got that big dick energy)
Hey, daddy
When you gon' stop playin'?

Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy (uh)
I can tell you got big dick energy (uh-huh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (yeah)
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy (uh)
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody (make 'em sing)
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy (uh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (ayy)
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy (ayy, ayy)

Tell me how you want it? (Huh?)
3, 2, 1, and I'm on it (on it)
Feel good, don't it? (Don't it)
Hood bitch, fuck you in a bonnet (yeah)
I'ma bust it on the pole like Onyx (ooh)
I'm just bein' honest (uh-huh)
Pussy juicy, Minute Maid (uh)
But can't do a minute man (hell no)
Not a side or a main
I'm the only bitch he entertain (yeah)
Spendin' his, mine in the bank (in the bank)
I like what I see (yeah)
A boss like you need a boss like me (uh-huh)
Daddy from the streets, so he move low-key
Tryna rock that mic like karaoke (uh)

On the count of three
Bad bitches get money (get money)
Broke niggas to the left, we don't want it (we don't want it)
I'm the one you bitches hate but they can't get past (uh-huh)
Pretty face, no waist and a big ol' ass (ha)

Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy (uh)
I can tell you got big dick energy (uh-huh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (yeah)
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy (uh)
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody (make 'em sing)
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy (uh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (ayy)
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy (ayy, ayy)

Got that real big energy
Got that big dick energy (big dick energy)
Got that real big energy
Got that big dick energy (big dick energy)

Yeah, tell me how you want it? (Want it)
3, 2, 1, camera rollin' (ooh)
Do it slow motion (uh-huh)
Real bitch, them other hoes phony
All that big talk, Latto put 'em on it (Latto)
I'm just bein' honest (yeah)
Lingerie Dolce
Blindfold, tie me to the bed while we role-play (yeah)
Can't skip foreplay, kill the pussy, cold case (uh-huh)
I'm a boss bitch, but tonight we do it your way

On the count of three
Bad bitches get money (get money)
Broke niggas to the left, we don't want it (hell nah)
If you ever see my broke, I'm probably rockin' a cast
Pretty face, no waist with a big ol' bag (ha)

Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy (uh)
I can tell you got big dick energy (uh-huh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (yeah)
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy (uh)
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody (make 'em sing)
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy (uh)
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me (ayy)
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy (ayy, ayy)

Got that real big energy (uh-huh)
Got that big dick energy (big dick energy, yeah)
Got that real big energy (uh)
Got that big dick energy (big dick energy, ayy)
