		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rocket #9 take off to the planet (to the planet)
Venus
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini (garden panty)
Venus
Let's blast off to a new dimension (in your bedroom)
Venus
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini (get with me)
Venus

I can't help the way I'm feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love

Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your leader (to the planet)
Your leader, your leader (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your Venus (to the planet)
Your Venus, your Venus

When you touch me, I die
Just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love
This could be love
'Cause you're out of this world
Galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love (Venus)

Have an oyster, baby, it's Aphrod-isy
Act sleazy
Venus
Worship to the land a girl from the planet (to the planet)
To the planet

I can't help the way I'm feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love

Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your leader (to the planet)
Your leader, your leader (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your Venus (to the planet)
Your Venus, your Venus

When you touch me, I die
Just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love
This could be love
'Cause you're out of this world
Galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be

Love (wonder if this could be love, this could be love)
Goddess of love (wonder if this could be love)
Venus

Neptune, go
Now serve Pluto
Saturn, Jupiter
Mercury, Venus, uh ha
Uranus
Don't you know my ass is famous?
Mars, now serve for the gods
Earth, serve for the stars

When you touch me, I die
Just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love
This could be love
'Cause you're out of this world
Galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be

Love (wonder if this could be love, this could be love)
Goddess of love (wonder if this could be love)
Venus
