		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (T-t-) tired of all these hoes, baby, I need your love
I just told bro, "It's us", I hit that one, no fuss
I hit that one, then cut, ayy, skrrt, I'm in a rush
Ayy, it's us, ayy, it's us

See me now and they act up, back then, you wouldn't look my way
Blew a little bag today, relax, bae, it's just ten K
The labels know they need me, when I smile, you see the VVs
My bro just got that CC, I just put her in CC
Ayy, it's us, I just put her in Chanel
My haters, I wish you well, bae, I don't kiss and tell
My opps are broke as hell, haha
It's us, it's us

Left hand a brick and my right hand's done up
Woke up in the middle of the night
All my opps still broke? Oh my God, what a bummer
All the pussy niggas gettin' robbed in the summer (kid)
I'm a hummer (kid) on my bitch (Switch)
On a stick (Switch), on your ass
Dog, you want that blood? Mind was made that fast
Pop a G6, then he complete his task

(T-t-) tired of all these hoes, baby, I need your love
I just told bro, "It's us", I hit that one, no fuss
I hit that one, then cut, ayy, skrrt, I'm in a rush
Ayy, it's us, ayy, it's us

It's us, we turn them niggas to dust
I mix the red with the 'Tuss
I wanna fuck, not fuss
None of these niggas scare me
Walkin' around with his chest poked out, must be a Aries, huh
Best don't discriminate, hit that nigga up out his sperries
Best don't discriminate, hit that nigga up out his TNs
Best don't discriminate, hit that bitch up out her heels
Know you gotta see me when you come down off that pill, right?
All that shit you said fiction
Everybody I ride with blissin'
Solid, all my niggas get the vision
I crossed him, it's ironic, 'cause he was Christian
It's us
