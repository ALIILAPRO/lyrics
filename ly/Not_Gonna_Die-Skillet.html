		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Death surrounds
My heartbeat's slowing down
I won't take this world's abuse
I won't give up or refuse

This is how it feels when you're bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity's stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

No, not gonna die tonight
We've gotta stand and fight forever (don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We've gotta fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight

Break their hold
Cause I won't be controlled
They can't keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free

This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

The last thing I heard is you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

No, not gonna die tonight
We've gotta stand and fight forever (don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We've gotta fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight

Don't you give up on me
You're everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back

No, not gonna die tonight
We've gotta stand and fight forever (don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We've gotta fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight

No, we're not gonna die tonight

Not gonna die
(Not gonna die)
Not gonna die
(Not gonna die)
Not gonna die tonight
