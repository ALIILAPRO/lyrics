Put the blame on me
Was it all my fault?
Put the blame on me
Oh
Put the blame on me
No, I can't hold back
Holding on for a minute
Oh
Put the blame on me

We been goin' through it, put the blame on me
Tryna get you tatted, put your name on me
All these other bitches trash, lame to me
And I still fuck with them, well, shame on me
Playin' with your heart was like a game to me
Now you tryna leave, shit insane to me
Takin' pictures in my section, they was framin' me
Why these bitches actin' like they came with me?
Ain't nobody perfect, bitch, why you trippin'?
You knew when we met that I was different
And your friends tried to warn you, but you ain't listen
Everything that shine, it don't glisten
Everything that glitter, no, it ain't gold
You say you never bend and you never fold
I know all your secrets and I never told
Supposed to be with each other 'til we get old

Put the blame on me
Was it all my fault?
Put the blame on me
Oh
Put the blame on me
No, I can't hold back
Holding on for a minute
Oh
Put the blame-

Baby, if you leave, ain't no comin' back
I'ma keep gettin' this money, I'ma count racks
We was supposed to make these plays like a running back
Badass bitch, how I fumbled that?
The way you held it down, I was in love with that
Now you actin' different, I don't fuck with that
Now you actin' different, I can't fuck with you
Locked in, I'm in love and I'm stuck with you
I just want you, don't want no new bitches
I just got two Mercedes, that's two Benzes (skrrt)
And I got a new crib with two kitchens (two kitchens)
And I never imagined it without you in it
I did it, who did it? You did it
Never thought you was gon' leave, but you went through with it
If you wanna try again, then I'm cool with it
If you wanna try again, then I'm-

Put the blame on me
Was it all my fault?
Put the blame on me
Oh
Put the blame on me
No, I can't hold back
Holding on for a minute
Oh

Running through phases
Running through spaces
Different faces
All we know is
Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me
Oh
