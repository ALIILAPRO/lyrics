		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried tellin' you I'm supposed to do that shit, man
Man, "Can't do this", "Can't do that"
Man, fuck y'all, haha

Homie, I get up I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck (give a fuck, homie)
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down (never)
Homie, I get up I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck (give a fuck, homie)
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down

They tryna tell me how I'm supposed to roll
The same people bending over choking, overdosing
You could've learned your lesson 'fore you dove your nose in
All my shit and started acting like you knowing the motion
I came to bring it like it's back in the days
Ahead of my time, though, 'cause I have seen the past of the day
Been moving pronto, even though we passing the blaze
Still on my grind, stacking paper, slowly packing the safe (woo)
I got it covered, man, I'm doing my thang
But still these motherfuckers hate and try to ruin my game
But they been doing me a favour when they using my name
Just like a free labour working as I cruise into fame (we get up)
You ain't gon' see me tryna hop on these frauds
And kill the music for the purpose
Of just topping these charts (hey, no)
Cats ain't writers, they shopping their bars
And must have got it all on sale
'Cause what they dropping ain't hard (we get up)

Homie, I get up I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck (give a fuck, homie)
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down (never)
Homie, I get up I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck (give a fuck, homie)
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down (ayy)

Man, I been back in to flex
I'm on my Russ shit, know just what will happen the next (I know it)
Couple moves from packing the jet (uh-huh)
Been operating from the spirit, call it hacking the flesh (we get up)
I bring the realness to the track, what up?
I heard your music, you been putting on a act, so shut up (so shut up)
You signed, but didn't do the math, butt up
I beat your numbers independent, got your act cut off (act cut off)
Y'all ain't real, y'all ain't true
So tell me what the fuck is the thing that y'all do?
Bragging 'bout a milli', but you're really 'bout to do (what?)
The dumbest thing ever just to get a pair of shoes (pair of shoes?)
And I'ma do what I feel like (uh-huh)
'Cause my dream now be merging with my real life
Got the steam, homie, yeah, for sure, we're still fly
We still fly, motherfuckers know what's up (woo, we get up)

Homie, I get up I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck (give a fuck, homie)
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down (never)
Homie, I get up I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck (give a fuck, homie)
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down

Yeah, shit, shit ain't over, man, I swear
People try and tell me I can't do this shit, man, haha
Y'all are trippin', man
