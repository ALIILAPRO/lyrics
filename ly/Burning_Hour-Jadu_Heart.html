		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you burning in the fire
The best I've ever seen
You're caught up in your dreams
I know you wanna take it right
You're falling like a queen
You're dressed just like a movie
Oh, and I waited for a sign, I waited for a sign
I waited for this only
Oh, but you kept me in the dark
You waited at the park
You know I was your lover

Take another breath, you're out of time
Body in the flame burning in the fire
And I don't need to dance with nobody
You can say you'll make it up to me
Make another bed for another life
Best you ever had, wanna make it right
So I don't need to dance with nobody
Promise me you'll make it up to me

I wanna set myself alight
You're burning through the night
 But nothing ever goes right
I want to take you to the core
And watch you as I fall
Yeah, watch you in the starlight
Oh and I waited for the sign, I waited for the sign
I waited for the right time
Oh, but you kept me in the dark
You waited at the park
You know I was your lover

Take another breath, you're out of time
Body in the flame burning in the fire
And I don't need to dance with nobody
You can say you'll make it up to me
Make another bed for another life
Best you ever had, wanna make it right
So I don't need to dance with nobody
Promise me you'll make it up to me

(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
Promise me you'll make it up to me
(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
Promise me you'll make it up to me

(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
(Up to me, up to me, up to me, up to me)
Promise me you'll make it up to me
