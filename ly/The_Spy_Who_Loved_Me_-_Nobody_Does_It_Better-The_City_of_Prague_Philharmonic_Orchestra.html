		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody does it better makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me 
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
 
And nobody does it better 
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
