		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I woke up today I was so bound
To a memory cut long ago
I could hear all your words echo on down
And then my heart rate dropped to a crawl

Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show

Could I ask of you not to cut into me
Dividing all of my body for me
I was left here to go through all the pieces
Nothing more to spare

I keep looking for reasons to come 'round
To make sense of your internal row
It's a maze and there's nothing to be found
It just leads me away from my end goal

Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show

Like a rogue wave you
Wash right over me
Losing all sense of what my body could feel
I was able to drift away from here
I have lost all control

The cipher walks alone
The cipher lies so long awake
She can't help
One night to lie so long awake
Just thinking
Just thinking
It's too late
