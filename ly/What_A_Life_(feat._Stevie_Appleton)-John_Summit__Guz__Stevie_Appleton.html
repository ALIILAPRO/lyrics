		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, tell me how you do
It's really nice to meet you
I saw you in the line
And we were catching eyes too

What a life, what a time
To be free
What a life, what a time
To be you and me

You hit me in the feels
My villa's in the hills
I know you feel my vibe
You're dancin' by my side

What a life, what a time
To be free
What a life, what a time
To be you and me
What a life, what a time
To be free
What a life, what a time
To be free

What a life

What a life, what a time
To be free
What a life, what a time
To be you and me
And me, and me
And me, and me
What a life, what a time
To be you and me
