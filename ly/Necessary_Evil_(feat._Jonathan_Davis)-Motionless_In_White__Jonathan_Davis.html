		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strip off the weight of morality, and check it at the door
I'll show you the worst in me
What I've become
 
Blow out the candles I need not a wish 
For I am everything 
Now crawl to my boots and lick
Kneel before me

I'ma have my cake and fucking eat you too 

It's my party and i'll die when I want to, die when I want to, die when I want to
The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be clown 
I'll take the blame (and) parade it around
You've made me the villain you can't live without

Reciting violence like poetry 
No you can't sit with us
Too fashionably plain 
Now say my name 
Forget everything you think you knew of who I used to be
I look much better as as the enemy 

I'ma have my fucking cake and eat yours too 

I want you low
I won't let you die
(I'll) keep you alive
Just to remind you of what you are not 

It's my party and I'll die when I want to
You wanna see me fail, but I won't die for you
