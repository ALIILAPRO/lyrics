		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put that shit together for a job
I put that shit together for a job
If I'm not making money then I got me some withdrawals
If I'm not at the top then I won't do it at all

Big tanks, big guns, big trucks, zombies
Yeah, we some big mutts, yeah, big doggies
I put that shit together for a job
I put this shit together like some puzzle pieces (no)

You ain't live what I live (hol' up)
You ain't did what I did (no)
You ain't put this shit together and stand on the shit you did
How you running from some lies you said you already fucking did?
You say you standing on that shit but all we see you do is sit (boy, sit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sit
Like a mutt
Yeah, yeah, sit
You a bitch, you ain't got this fucking money, guess what it is?
It's that king Tonka, king world, billionaire, bitch
You could suck my dick, I don't give no fucks about this shit
I don't give one fuck, not two fuck, not three fucks, not six
Yeah, I'm with the boy in the 6ix
You don't gotta like it but just know I keep them sticks
You don't gotta like us but just know I run this shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sit

I put that shit together for a job (put that shit, whoa)
I put that shit together for a job (put that shit, whoa)
If I'm not making money then I got me some withdrawals
If I'm not at the top, then I won't do it at all (nah)

Big tanks, big guns, big trucks, zombies (zombies)
Yeah, we some big mutts, big doggies (big dogs)
I put that shit together for a job (put that shit, whoa)
I put this shit together like some puzzle pieces (Pluto, no)

Shorty been takin' them Percs, he out his mind, he ready to click (shorty)
Shorty been takin' them pills, he ready to go splurge like a big old trick (shorty)
Shorty been wipin' nostrils, 730, been on ten (shorty)
Shorty been catchin' bodies, done killed his man, he ready to go spin (shorty)
Switch blend in, I'm trill
Smacked his whole friend, I'm trill
I just snatched the doors out the 'Rari
I'll just buy a plane tomorrow
Bought the bitch a bag or somethin', I ain't get to tell her sorry
Seven whole cities goin' up, I just bought a bag of guns
Super, not the average one, splurgin' at the diamond store
Three mil' in diamonds on, look like an island on him
I ain't through stylin' on 'em, still tryna hide the money
Get a nigga cooked for a Perc', real nigga goin' 730 (ayy)
It's been a week since you dissed your opps, you must be foldin' (ayy)
They say it's my fault if you fall out on the codeine (ayy)
I'm just a rich-ass junkie, I might OD (ayy)
I done fucked around and hit that coke, it make my nose bleed (ayy)
I put this shit together like a job (put this shit, whoa)
I put that shit together like a job (put this shit, whoa)
Get a mil' ticket just for me to talk (whoa)
Lil' bad bitch done snorted all the block (whoa)

Big tanks, big guns, big trucks, zombies (zombies)
Yeah, we some big mutts, yeah, big doggies (doggies)
I put that shit together for a job (put that shit, whoa)
I put this shit together like some puzzle pieces (put this shit, yeah)
