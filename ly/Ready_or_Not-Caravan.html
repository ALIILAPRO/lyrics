		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're gonna get you if you make a sound
Better close your eyes and don't turn around
If I catch you peeping boy that's when
I'm gonna come to get you gonna count to ten

I'm gonna find you behind the door
If you're not there I'll keep on looking some more
Time is gonna come when gotta show your face
I'll be waiting for you no escape

Ready or not we're gonna get you

So hard to give up if you got the taste
Don't ever think the time has all gone to waste
It's all about the thrill of not being found
If you can make it last for one time around
Waiting game is over come for you now
Gonna catch you out see and how
No matter where you hide you will be found
Counting up to ten now
Here I come

Ready or not we're gonna get you
