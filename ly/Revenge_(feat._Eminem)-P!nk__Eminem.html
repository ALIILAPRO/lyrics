		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like Leo in The Revenant
Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet isn't it?
Really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fucking coming true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house
Take your shoes, take your heart
Now here comes that singing part

I'm daydreaming
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (get you) or how I'll make you pay (ohh)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (ooh)
That's my plan (that's my plan)
That's my plan
That's my plan

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge (now, now)
Revenge is sweet

Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word we make it sting for him
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye you piece of shhh
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it (wait for it)
Here's that singing part again (yeah)

I'm daydreaming (I'm daydreaming)
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (you pay)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (feel the same)
That's my plan
That's my plan
That's my plan

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (oh, revenge is sweet)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (revenge is sweet)

Well, in the beginning we felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee, but hell with any injury
Eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal, but just know that I will
But fuck trying to make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium, your day begins at eight PM
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz with all your lady friends, whores 
Hit the club and you go out, don't know a sum
'Cause when I calculate the times you cheated 
And I totaled up all the amounts it doesn't add up 
'Cause you say that just giving out your number doesn't count
Get it (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new get mad and flip it look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, slut 
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me while I'm driving to hers
Just remember you cheated on me first (bitch)
You're a whore, you're a whore (I mean)
This is war

Fellas, ladies

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together (ohh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge (uh)
Together, together, together (uh, uh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet 

Fuck, yeah 
Fuck, no
