		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Monday morning phone in my bed
One message unread 
Thought for sure it was you
It's been a week since I sent 
that photo I knew you'd like
from that film with the bike
But it was only my mum
texting me asking me why

(Why)
Why you always looking at your phone, you know you better switch it off
(I)
Because I can't stop thinking' bout 
Can't stop thinkin' bout us
If I'm being honest

I wanna call you
Something doesn't feel right
Always find you
Right place at the wrong time
When your name's on my phone I'm at war with butterflies
I'll let it ring out
STAGEFRIGHT

I don't see you no more
barely half of the time
We used to skate our way home but now I'm scared of the ride
We probably need to talk, cause neither handled it well
Wish I could give you the blame but no, it's my fault as well

(Why)
Why you always looking at your phone you know you better switch it off
(I)
Because I can't stop thinking' bout 
Can't stop thinkin' bout us
Sleep paralysis

I wanna call you
Something doesn't feel right
Always find you
Right place at the wrong time
When your name's on my phone I'm at war with butterflies
I'll let it ring out
STAGEFRIGHT

I'm still falling
I'm not alright 
I need you by my side
If I tried calling, we could turn the tide
Or it could make it worse, what if my call is declined

I wanna call you
Something doesn't feel right
Always find you
Right place at the wrong time
When your name's on my phone I'm at war with butterflies
I'll let it ring out
STAGEFRIGHT
