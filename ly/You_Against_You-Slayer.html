		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had your back, but it's no use
False accusations are on the loose

Know what?
It makes no sense that you tied your own noose
You never felt the shores decay
Your perfect world is ending today

So what?
I wouldn't have it any other way

Is this your paradise?
You think you thought this through?
'Cause when you rolled the dice
That house came down on you

Don't care what you do or say
The suicide begins today
Have fun in paradise
This hell is just for you

You against you
Shitty time to make a stand, all without a master plan, just you
You against you

So how's your paradise
Hindsight just laughs at you
With conflict comes the price
That price weighs heaviest on you

I guess I should say thanks
Dissention in your ranks
Your panic lit the fuel
Now it's you against you

You against you
When you're looking for a fight, when I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand, all without a master plan, just you
You against you

These seeds are what you sow
Never should have lit that fuse
Enjoy your paradise
This hell is just for you

You against you
When you're looking for a fight, when I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand, all without a master plan, just you
You against you
