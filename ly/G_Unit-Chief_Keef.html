		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep the chrome in the truck, we rolling it up
I be rolling stuffed blunts, we call it stuffed crust
Don't dumb your lie
Thinkin' from the tenth parking spot
Well boy, you got me fucked up
I got Yayo and I got sug's named Lloyd
I got the whole G-Unit and I got Young Buck
Got a fifty shot Glock and an automatic pump
And it got bucks, and it's gassed up
Ride through your block like G-Unit, bitch
Yeah, and we masked up
Ride off like fuck a motherfucking case
Wanna know why? Bitch, can't step
I do the G-Unit stomp
Watch me lean with the pump
Beam on the chopper
Ain't no game, ain't no problems, G-Unit, ayy

Nigga get rich without trying, ayy
Nigga get rich without dying, ayy
Lil nigga get shot nine times
Junkies selling like Curtis Jackson, ayy
Riding in an all blue Rarri, 50 right behind me
We the Glo Gang, gorilla unit, ayy
G-unit since I was motherfucking four, ayy
Heard a nigga snitching, got the motherfucking gang right at my door

I keep the chrome in the truck, we rolling it up
I be rolling stuffed blunts, we call it stuffed crust
Don't dumb your lie
Thinkin' from that parking spot 
Well boy, you got me fucked up
I got Yayo and I got sug's named Lloyd
I got the whole G-Unit and I got Young Buck
Got a fifty shot Glock and an automatic pump
And it got bucks, and it's gassed up
Ride through your block like G-Unit, bitch
Yeah, and we masked up
Ride off like fuck a motherfucking case
Wanna know why? Bitch, can't step
I do the G-Unit stomp
Watch me lean with the pump
Beam on the chopper
Ain't no game, ain't no problems, G-Unit, ayy

You can find me in the club
With a snuffled bottle of the bub
Mama, I got what you need, straight dick baby, not no love, ayy
I gave the bitch a mug, the bitch tried to give me a hug, ayy
I got G-Unit and I got Mobb Deep, money my apology
Boy that money ain't yours, that money Monopoly's
That thot named Olivia, but you know I had to drop the bitch
Teflons on, pistols, don't be in front of it

I keep the chrome in the truck, we rolling it up
I be rolling stuffed blunts, we call it stuffed crust
Don't dumb your lie
Thinkin' from that parking spot 
Well boy, you got me fucked up
I got Yayo and I got sug's named Lloyd
I got the whole G-Unit and I got Young Buck
Got a fifty shot Glock and an automatic pump
And it got bucks, and it's gassed up
Ride through your block like G-Unit, bitch
Yeah, and we masked up
Ride off like fuck a motherfucking case
Wanna know why? Bitch, can't step
I do the G-Unit stomp
Watch me lean with the pump
Beam on the chopper
Ain't no game, ain't no problems, G-Unit, ayy
