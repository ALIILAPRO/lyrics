		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't tell me that it's fine
Lose the pride and tell me what is on your mind?
Is on your mind?

You tell me that you're scared
To lose your way
Tears running down your face
How many times
Have I said
To you, girl
I won't let you escape

On a mountain, land, or sea
If the stars burn out
I'll find you in the dark
In the dark

How could I make you believe?
You're the only one where
I don't need a spark to feel
Like I'm at home with you

You might lose your way
Just promise that you'll find your way
Back home to me
Back home to me

It's uncertainty
That keeps you up
At night so you can't sleep
I'm begging you
Trust me, please
I'll chase you for
All eternity

On a mountain, land, or sea
If the stars burn out
I'll find you in the dark

How could I make you believe?
You're the only one where
I don't need a spark to feel
Like I'm at home with you

On a mountain, land, or sea
If the stars burn out
I'll find you in the dark

How can I make you believe?
You're the only one where
I don't need a spark
Spark
