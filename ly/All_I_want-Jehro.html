		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, she is watching me
And her eyes, they flow
With fond and tender pain
I know time laid out a road
We have walked alone
And yet we meet again

Now, I know finally
I've never been alone
I just couldn't see
That like the swirling of the sea
Lies a mystery
That brings me back to you

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Oh, we put round our world
Chains that we denied
Yes we dreamed that we 
Were free
And this was our downfall
With no place to go
We drift eternally

Now, I know finally
I've never been alone
I just couldn't see
That like the swirling of the sea
Lies a mystery
That brings me back to you
It brings me back to you
Brings me back to sea
Brings me back to all the things I've lost along the way

All I want to know (now, I know finally)
All I want to see (I've never been alone)
You've never been alone (I just couldn't see)
'Cause I just couldn't see

Now, I know finally ('cause I want ya)
I've never been alone ('cause I feel you)
I just couldn't see ('cause I feel you)
Oh, baby, I want you

Now, I know finally ('cause now I know)
I've never been alone ('cause I feel you)
I just couldn't see (oh, oh-oh)

Now, I know finally ('cause now I know) 
I've never been alone (finally)
I just couldn't see (finally and I)

Now, I know finally (I know, I know, I know, I know finally)
(I know, I know, I know, I know finally) I've never been alone
I just couldn't see
