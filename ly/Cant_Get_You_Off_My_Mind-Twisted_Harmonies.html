		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off

You break my heart, then you’re sorry
You ruin it all till you want me
So sweet but dark like a zombie
And after he left, you call me
I thought that I never worry
But since the first night you own me
Unconditional

I don’t get the meaning, you go left then you go right
Still got the feeling, I should love the other five
Why you act so obvious?
It’s just so obvious
Guess that I should lose you, but I don’t know how

Try to run away from you
But I can’t escape from you
Thought this bed was made for two
Wish I could be complete
But I’m still so lonely
Can’t get you off

Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind

Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off

You’ve taken souls like a bandit
You seem so good but your savage
It seems like you’re still my magnet
But Girl tonight you won’t get it
On my skin, your name is still branded
Even though I can’t see the ending
It will be alright

I don’t get the meaning, you go left then you go right
Still got the feeling, I should love the other five
Why you act so obvious?
It’s just so obvious
Guess that I should lose you, but I don’t know how

Try to run away from you
But I can’t escape from you
Thought this bed was made for two
Wish I could be complete
But I’m still so lonely
Can’t get you off

Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind

Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you off my mind
Can’t get you

Try to run away from you
But I can’t escape from you
Thought this bed was made for two
Wish I could be complete
But I’m still so lonely

Can’t get you off
