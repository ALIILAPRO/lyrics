		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I an imposter or
Just a good liar for no good reason
Think we got a problem now
Symptom of a bad fallout, glitters fading

I can't believe I became the disease
And the snakes that sing are learning to scream in my dreams
That they dragged through the dirt, now painted in hurt
My lungs are filling with the sea

I tried breathing underwater, to drown out the doubt
I cracked under the pressure and nearly bled out
You said you'd always save me so where are you now?
Feels like I'm failing, I'm dancing while drowning alone
(I'm dancing while drowning alone)

Feeling self-conscious now
Overthinking but out loud, screams in silence
Always overcompensate
In this world I can't relate need some guidance

I open my mouth but the words don't come out
And the deepest blue sinks in me so low
Can't control my self-doubt that I hold it's touch is so cold
These waves are crashing down on me

I tried breathing underwater, to drown out the doubt
I cracked under the pressure and nearly bled out (nearly bled out)
You said you'd always save me so where are you now?
Feels like I'm failing, I'm dancing while drowning alone

I tried breathing underwater, to drown out the doubt
I cracked under the pressure
I tried breathing underwater, to drown out the doubt
I cracked under the pressure and nearly bled out (nearly bled out)
You said you'd always save me so where are you now?
Feels like I'm failing, I'm dancing while drowning alone (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm dancing while drowning alone (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Feels like I'm failing, I'm dancing while drowning alone
