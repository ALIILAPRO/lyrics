		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn off the lights
Let the moonshine through the blinds, I can see fine (turn off, baby, yeah, ayy)
Light a candle
You know that I'm tryna get behind, press on your spine
Girl, you lookin' damn good
I can't even lie I'm mesmerized
It's in you
To me tonight
It's in your eyes, uh
That's that shit I like, yeah
That's that shit I like, uh
That's that shit I like
Baby, put your hair back
That's that shit I like, yeah
That's that shit I like, uh
That's that shit I like
'Cause I wanna see your face
Let the moon shine through the blinds, I can see fine
And, damn, you fine
Don't be nervous
You know that I'm tryna to get behind, press on your spine
Girl, I got you, I got you (I got you)
I can't even lie I'm mesmerized
It's in your eyes

Let me love you slow (slow, ooh, woah)
I'm not in a rush, girl, I'ma love you slow
Take my time tonight
Can I take my time? Plus, girl my love is dro
I'll give you a rush, see, girl my love is dro (is dro)
And I'ma love you slow
Take a hit of me baby, baby, baby

Yeah
Know you had a long day, I can see it in your face
And now you just got off of work
The sun is down, it's gettin' late
And now you say you need a break
Girl, you know exactly what I'm 'bout to say
But I won't say a thing, bae
Know this what you need, bae
Hit an instant replay
Yes, I had to get it twice, breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Now take off them denims
Now take off this linen
I need all that missin'
Baby, when you call, I'm dippin'
Pull up to your, pull up to your, pull up to your spot
I'm gon' get you hot
Listen we gon', start with that massage, workin' down your thighs
Baby, I'ma push up on you, feel the size (show me how you feel)
Show me how you feel inside
If that's mine, then tell me that's mine (tell me, tell me it's mine, yeah)
Somebody must've shown you how to ride 'cause (show you how to ride)
You do it right, you're not too wild with it
I take my time with it, mm-hmm

Baby, you should let me love you slow (yeah)
I'm not in a rush, girl (baby, I'ma love you)
I'ma love you slow
Baby, nice and slow, girl
Can I take my time? Plus, girl my love is dro (it's dro)
I give you a rush, see, girl my love is dro (so I'ma take my time, yeah)
And I'ma love you slow

Yeah
Me and Jack and Static
This a motherfuckin' classic
