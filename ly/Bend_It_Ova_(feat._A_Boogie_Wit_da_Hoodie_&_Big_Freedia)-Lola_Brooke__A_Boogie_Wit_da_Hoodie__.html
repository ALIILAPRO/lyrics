		  When I back that ass up
Back that ass up
Back that ass up, b-b-back that ass up
Lola Brooke
Where you get all that ass from?
A Boogie, back that ass up, b-b-back that ass up
Big Freedia

Hoodie and a mask, yeah, heart black, yeah
You want me to throw this cash, better shake that ass, yeah
I'm a fucked up nigga, yeah, I admit it, yeah
And I got it out the mud, still in the hood, yeah, yeah
Back that ass up, baby, don't you be playin' wit' me
Back that ass up, you're fine, I want to touch it, can you back that ass up?
Make it litty, yeah
Half a ticket on the Richard, yeah, that's half a millie, yeah

Be-be-bend it over, baby, show 'em how that back look
Be-be-bend it over, baby, show 'em how that cat look
Rock-rock-rock the wave, I had to show 'em that I'm that tough
Bust rounds in this mothafucka, nigga, get it back up
I am she that you want for your wifey
She ain't she, that's the reason that you like me
Is it me on that dick? Bitch, it might be
Ussy leave him dead, put a nigga on a white tee
C-c-come here, baby, don't be shy to get attached
Come and smoke this ussy, baby, put it in a pack
Da-da-dump it in me like you lettin' off a MAC
When a nigga hit it right, I don't know how to act
I am she, please do not take that lightly
I'm the baddest, a bitch can't get like me
Throw a bag, all my besties gon' hype me
Go bitch
Now his bitch want to fight me

Hoodie and a mask, yeah, heart black, yeah
You want me to throw this cash, better shake that ass, yeah
I'm a fucked up nigga, yeah, I admit it, yeah
And I got it out the mud, still in the hood, yeah, yeah
Back that ass up, baby, don't you be playin' wit' me
Back that ass up, you're fine, I want to touch it, can you back that ass up?
Make it litty, yeah
Half a ticket on the Richard, yeah, that's half a millie, yeah

Sex in a lamb truck
You know what you doin', girl
Arch that ass up
I fuck you sittin' down, 'cause I don't understand ya
And I ain't gon' lie, girl, you fuck how you dancin'
And everywhere I go gotta keep my ratchet
Why'd you turn your back when I showed you mad love?
I'm the reason why you fuck like that, I showed you mad stuff
I'm the reason why you drinkin' and we both do mad drugs, yeah

Hoodie and a mask, yeah, heart black, yeah
You want me to throw this cash, better shake that ass, yeah
I'm a fucked up nigga, yeah, I admit it, yeah
And I got it out the mud, still in the hood, yeah, yeah
Back that ass up, baby, don't you be playin' wit' me
Back that ass up, you're fine, I want to touch it, can you back that ass up?
Make it litty, yeah
Half a ticket on the Richard, yeah, that's half a millie, yeah

Shake it like a salt shaker, shake it like you ratchet
Baby quit actin' shy, go 'head do it, make it nasty
I don't give a damn if it's real or it's plastic
Girl, you look good and that ass fantastic
Back that ass up, b-b-back that ass up
Hold up, let me ask a question, where you get all that ass from?
Back that ass up, b-b-back that ass up
All that booty, booty, booty, keep 'em throwin' that cash up

Hoodie and a mask, yeah, heart black, yeah
You want me to throw this cash, better shake that ass, yeah
I'm a fucked up nigga, yeah, I admit it, yeah
And I got it out the mud, still in the hood, yeah
Back that ass up, baby, don't you be playin' wit' me
Back that ass up, you're fine, I want to touch it, can you back that ass up?
Make it litty, yeah
Half a ticket on the Richard, yeah, that's half a millie, yeah

Baby quit actin' shy, go 'head do it, make it nasty
I don't give a damn if it's real or it's plastic
Girl, you look good and that ass fantastic
Back that ass up, b-b-back that ass up
Hold up, let me ask a question, where you get all that ass from?
My mama
Back that ass up, b-b-back that ass up
All that booty, booty, booty, keep 'em throwin' that cash up
