		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alrighty
Let's go
Uh, ah

You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can borrow my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man, livin' in a leveled world
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

You can call me cracked, you can call me mad and stifled
You can hold my hand, sail me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out, stressin' out

You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can borrow my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out

Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tails?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke
The jokes that try to find the answer to nope (uh)
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark, then my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

(I'm a mad Pac-Man) Suu
(Livin' in a leveled world)

Yo, I been at the top of the top
Fell from the ceiling before I fail
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, royal with the glow
Uh, walked on the edge, fuck tryna dream in the bed
'Fore I die on these meds, niggas gon' die on the feds
'Fore I make it to jail, prolly put one in the head
Fuck the judge and the prosecutor for hangin' me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I'm closer to live, right?
Closer to live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the red lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the Black Knight
Keep a piece, no Buddhist, got the whole hood boomin'
I'm like a Crip how I stewed it, you on your ass, stuck, stupid
You makin' we look bad, I rock the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cops' lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last
Every full-grown minute, I had to change my image
The brain don't got limits, you think a mill' mean winnin'
Pigs out here skinnin', your soul ain't authentic
You died and still ain't livin'
