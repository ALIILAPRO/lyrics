		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tay Keith, fuck these niggas on
Yeah yeah (woo!)
Yeah (6 God, BlocBoy, 6 God, BlocBoy, woo!)
(6 God, BlocBoy, 6 God, BlocBoy, woo!)
Yeah

901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck 'em dog, we gon' see how hard they ride
I get racks to go outside, and I split it with the guys
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since like July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us, but I lied

Ay, ay, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault, man
I'm not to blame, man
This fucking industry is cutthroat, I'm not the same man
And I could let you check the tag now, I'm rocking name brand
I'm only chasing after bags, now I got a game plan
And I'm out here with the woo!

Seven hundred, three high fives look alive, look alive
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck 'em dog, we gon' see how hard they ride
I get racks to go outside, and I split it with the guys
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since like July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us, but I

Bitch, come through, you, and you
I'ma get the money, D-D-Drizzy get the loot
Pull up with that Draco
Play with Drake and I'ma shoot
My weapon be an instrument, man I'll blow you like a flute
Nigga play so he feelin' it
Pull up broad day with a K, now he shiverin' 
Drop a nigga like he littering
We at the door like we the delivery
He not a plug, he middle man
That-that nigga brown like cinnamon
I got the rounds like Sugar Ray Robinson
Shot to the chest have you gaspin' for oxygen
I'ma spay 'em, just like Febreeze
Came a long way from sittin' in the nosebleeds
Now a nigga on the floor talkin' to the athletes
Now I'm so close to the game I could steal the stat sheet

901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck 'em dog, we gon' see how hard they ride
I get racks to go outside, and I split it with the guys
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since like July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide
'Cause I told them to put that shit behind us, but I lied
