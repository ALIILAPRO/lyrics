		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never knew that I could be the one for you
How can this be true? Too good to be true
It still seems like a dream
You loving me I guess, I never knew
Too good to be true

So many days trying to hide how I feel
Thinking this fantasy can never be real
But now you are here looking right into my eyes 
어머나
Can't believe that you are mine

Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Tell me I'm the one for you
Tell me that you want me too
Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Just can't get enough of your love 
말해줘요

Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Tell me this is not a dream
Tell me that you'll never leave
Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Waited for this moment too long 
말해줘요

Feel my heart beating wild just like a drum 
Whenever you are near, can't believe you're here
Pinch myself everytime you're next to me 
Hoping it's not a dream
Can't believe you're here

So many nights wishing my dream would come true
The dream one day you'll fall in love with me too
But now you are here looking right into my eyes 
어머나
Can't believe that you are mine

Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Tell me I'm the one for you
Tell me that you want me too
Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Just can't get enough of your love 
말해줘요

Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Tell me this is not a dream
Tell me that you'll never leave
Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Waited for this moment too long 
말해줘요

Slay to the moon
Slay to the moon (I know you got thi-thi-this)
Slay to the moon (thi-thi-this)
Slay to the moon (I know you got thi-thi-this)

Tell me, tell me, tell me you
Want me, want me, want me, too
Tell me, tell me, tell me you
Love me too, love me too

Hit me one time baby give it to me
Tell me, tell me
Okay, but I need another one hit me
Tell me, te-tell me
Yeah, you can tell me
Over and over and over again
Please keep bringing it like a postmen
어머나 
Gotta make me believe it now
Can't believe that you are mine
Babe, babe

Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Tell me I'm the one for you
Tell me that you want me too
Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Just can't get enough of your love 
말해줘요

Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Tell me this is not a dream
Tell me that you'll never leave
Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Waited for this moment too long 
말해줘요

Tell me, tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
Te-te-te-te-te-tell me
(Tell me, tell me)
