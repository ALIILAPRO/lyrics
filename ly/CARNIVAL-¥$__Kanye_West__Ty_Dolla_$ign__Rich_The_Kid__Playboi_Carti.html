		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible
Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible
Go
Ha, ha, ha, schyeah

Way too rich to drive a Rove'
Made a milli' off the stove
She like to put it in her nose
Pretty bitch with white toes
I done put on all the bros
I done fucked her in the Rolls
I done pulled up in the Ghost
I done reached all my goals
Yeah, yeah, pull up with Yeezy and Dolla $ign
I'm all about business, I'm mindin' mine
Pull up in the trenches like Columbine
Pull up with the rocket like NumbaNine
I don't want your hoes
Young nigga, reach all the goals
Let her suck the dick, said she was a pro
If she scrape with teeth, I'ma tell her to go

Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She'll ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible
Go, go, go, go (ha, ha)
Head so good, she a honor roll
She'll ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible (Dolla $ign)

She ride it like Six Flags
We turn up to the max
I whop her from the back
I gave that bitch a cramp
They love me out in France
In the hood, I'm good, I'm stamped
Every day I dress all black
For a show, nine hundred racks
Middle East call, double that
On my neck, a bubble bath
On my wrist, new Cadillac
Cut her off, don't want her back
Little bitch, I'm a superstar
These hoes wanna fuck my car
My dawg put a nigga in park
Gotta watch out for the narcs, ayy

This that Game of Thrones, Yeezy, not the clones
Elon, where my rocketship? It's time to go home
They served us the porn since the day we was born
Anybody pissed off, gotta make 'em drink the urine
Now I'm Ye-Kelly, bitch, now, I'm Bill Cosby, bitch
Now, I'm Puff Daddy rich, that's "#MeToo me" rich
Why she say she sucked my dick? Then she say she ain't sucked my dick
She gon' take it up the ass like a ventriloquist
I mean since Taylor Swift, since I had the Rollie on the wrist
I'm the new Jesus, bitch, I turn water to Cris'
This for what they did to Chris, they can't do shit with this
Got my kids in a fake school, we ain't

Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She'll ride the dick like a carnival (Schyeah)
I done did the impossible (Schyeah)
Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She'll ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible

She ride dick like a carnival
Bend her over, havin' flashbacks, she gon' eat me up like a carnivore
It's the way I pop my shit, the hoes not ready, I'm goin' barnacles
Movin', I feel like I'm Jason, can't get arrested, I make 'em stumble
She want a private section, roll off them Xs when I'm on Melrose
She tatted my name on her titties, yeah, you can bust it, but it's a borrow
Hol' up, sittin' back, countin' up dubs, I was raised in the borough
She wanna taste it, checkin' the swag today, ho, come back tomorrow
If you know what I know, hide your ho
Just off the facts that we havin' them hunchos
Runnin' around in the lobby, I know that they tired of me havin' like ten hoes
She need some credentials just to be presidential, hol' up, hol' up
I'm 'bout to buy her some dentures, make that ho eat me for dinner, whoa, whoa
Pain all in my eyes, I can't see, uh
I'm 'bout to jump out my body, I'm ready to leap, uh
I'm 'bout to nut on her body and tell the ho, "Leave," 'kay
Fifty mil' stuffed in the bag, tell the whole gang, "Eat," uh
It's Ye and Barti, tell me who fuckin' with we?
I'm hot like Tha Carter, I'm feelin' that ho in my sleep
Dollar signs all in my dreams, I don't never see Zs, whoa (whoa-whoa)
The swag cover my body like it's a disease, whoa (whoa-whoa)

Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible
Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
