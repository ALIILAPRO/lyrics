		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today (woah)
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket (basket, woah, basket, woah)
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket (casket, woah, casket)

Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout as cute as
An old coupon expired (woah, woah)
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket (basket, woah, basket, woah)
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket (casket, woah, casket, let's go, woah)
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket (basket, woah, basket, woah)
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket (casket, woah, casket, woah)

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
Katy Perry (woah)
They just know what is what
Young Money
But they don't know what is what (what, woah)
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what (woah)
They just strut
Hahaha, yo
What the fuck? (Woah)

Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swiss swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swiss, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you (yeah)
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you, yo, yo
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
The generous queen'll kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my Biggz, yeah that's the guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy

Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket (and another one, and another one) (basket, woah, basket, woah)
Can't touch this (can't touch this)
Another one in the casket (and another one, and another one) (casket, woah, casket, woah)

They know what is what
Do they know?
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what (woah)
But they don't know what is what (woah)
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut (woah)
What the (woah)
