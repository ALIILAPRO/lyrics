		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're on

People come around
People let you down
Anywhere you go, anyone you see
It's real
It's up to you to make it happen
It's up to you to make it real

And you know how it feels
To bleed some, to need some
And you know how it feels
To bleed some, to need some

Tell me what you know
Tell me how you feel
It doesn't matter when you're down
When you look at me with your eyes
That smile on your face, it seems happy
Are you happy?

And you know how it feels
To bleed some, to need some
And you know how it feels
To bleed some, to need some

To bleed some
Bleed some, need some (are you happy?)
Yeah, yeah

And you know how it feels
To bleed some, to need some
And you know how it feels
To bleed some, to need some

Are you happy?
