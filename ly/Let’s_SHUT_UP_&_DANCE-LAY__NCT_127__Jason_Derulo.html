		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Bongo by the way
Bass drop
Uh, uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh
Shut up and dance

Your body give me motivation (move)
Your touch is all that's on my mind (touch)
Sweat on you, precipitatin' (sweat)
You feel me risin' from behind
Give it to me, give it to me
Come let your body show me
Give it to me, give it to me
What your lips wanna say

All my London girls, come and show me somethin' (hey)
All my L.A. girls, come and show me somethin' (hey)
Ethiopian girls, come and show me somethin'
Come and show me somethin', come on, come on
Jamaican girls wanna blow it down (hey)
My Asian girls wanna work it out (hey)
Turn around, don't talk, sh, hush your mouth
Show me somethin', show me somethin'

Shut up and dance, uh
Shut up and dance, babe, uh
Shut up and dance

Roll it and light it for me (light)
Ice my Corona (oh)
No need for conversation
Love your persona
And I'm really doing different routes (skrrt, skrrt)
Late night, eat it like In-N-Out
Turned you, you can bring a friend around
2Pac, bitch, I get around, get around

All my London girls, come and show me somethin' (hey)
All my L.A. girls, come and show me somethin' (hey)
Ethiopian girls, come and show me somethin'
Come and show me somethin', come on, come on (come on, come on, girl)
Jamaican girls wanna blow it down (hey)
My Asian girls wanna work it out (hey)
Turn around, don't talk, sh, hush your mouth
Show me somethin', (huh) show me somethin'

Shut up and dance, uh (show me somethin')
Shut up and dance, babe, uh (show me somethin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shut up and dance

Oh, oh
Shut up and dance

Ayy, ayy
Hey hey hey
Shut up and dance
(Show me somethin')
Ayy
Ayy
Hey hey hey

Your body give me motivation (move)
Your touch is all that's on my mind (touch)
Sweat on you, precipitating (sweat)
You feel me rising from behind
Give it to me, give it to me
Come let your body show me
Give it to me, give it to me
What your lips wanna say

Shut up and dance (show me somethin')
Come on, girl (show me somethin')
Come on (show me somethin')
Come on, girl
Oh, baby (show me somethin')
You ain't gotta say nothing
There's no use, ooh
Shut up and dance (show me somethin', show me somethin')
Shut up and dance (show me somethin', show me somethin')
You ain't gotta say nothing, baby

All my London girls, come and show me somethin' (hey)
All my L.A. girls, come and show me somethin'
Ethiopian girls, come and show me somethin'
Come and show me somethin', come on, come on
Jamaican girls wanna blow it down
My Asian girls wanna work it out
You ain't gotta say nothing (just hush your mouth) baby
