		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the feeling of my life
I want to be with you now
I want to have you with me
Always forever and you
You are the one for me now
And I can see that you
Want (want want want) more(more more more)

You came through the door
You came through it all
One step further and 
I will lose it all
Everything you said
Everything was so right

I was in your eyes
You were in my mind
When you took my hand
And we start to dance
I just can't believe
That it's you and me now

I'm alive
For the first time in my life
I just know that I'm alive
I want to dance the night away
I'm alive
I'll always be there by your side
I just know that I'm alive
This is the feeling of my life
I'm alive

You're reality
You're my fantasy
I just can't believe
This is happening
Crossed my fingers and
I can see that is true

I was in your eyes
You were in my mind
When you took my hand
And we start to dance
I just can't believe
That it's you and me now

I'm alive
For the first time in my life
I just know that I'm alive
I want to dance the night away
I'm alive
I'll always be there by your side
I just know that I'm alive
This is the feeling of my life
I'm alive

(This is the feeling of my life
I want to be with you now
I want to have you with me
Always forever and you)

I'm alive
(You will be one for me now
And I can see that you
Want(want want want) more(more more more))

For the first time in my life
I know that I'm in love
I want to dance the night away
I'm alive

And I want to
Cause I need you
I just got to be beside you
For you really make my dreams come true

I'm alive
For the first time in my life
I just know that I'm alive
I want to dance the night away
I'm alive
I'll always be there by your side
I just know that I'm alive
This is the feeling of my life
I'm alive
