		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I get four hundred dollars
I'm off to see Melinda

If I get four hundred dollars
I'm going to see Melinda

And I just don't care
If you're going with me

Cause I'm getting up in the morning
And I'm off to see Melinda

I'm off

I would give the moon and sun
Just to see Melinda

The earth and all the sky
To be there with Melinda

And I just don't care, what you got to say

Cause I'm getting up in the morning
And I'm going to see Melinda

Yes I'm through with Clay County

You never done a thing for me

Yes I'm through with Clay County

You never done a thing for me

And one dark night I'm gonna
Crawl through a window

Yes I'm getting up this morning
And I'm off to see Melinda

And I'm off

Yes I'm through with Clay County

You never did a thing for me

Yes I'm through with clay county

You never did nothing for me

And I just don't care what you got to say

Because I'm getting up in the morning
And I'm going to see Melinda

And I'm going to see Melinda
