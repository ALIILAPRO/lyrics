		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you know me and you
Must be fireproof with all the hell that we've been through
When all our lovin' lost its charm
Learned to make a shelter out in the storm (hey)
Made it out of the cold
Climbed a mountain and I stepped on burning coals
When all our lovin' fell apart
Someone left the light on out in the dark (hey)

You and I
We've both been
Through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
We'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire
I feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
We'll be fireproof
We'll be fireproof

Did you know you and me
Must be fireproof with all these flames between our sheets
When all our lovin' was almost gone
Made some in the moonlight before the dawn (hey)
Made it out of the heat
Crossed the desert and we sailed the seven seas
When all our lovin' felt so wrong
Found out all the hard times just made us strong (hey)

You and I
We've both been
Through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
We'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire
Feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
We'll be fireproof
Fireproof
We'll be fireproof
Fireproof

You and I
We've both been
Through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
We'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire
Feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
We'll be fireproof
