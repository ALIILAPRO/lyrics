		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're weary feeling small
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Oh, like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out, when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you
I'll take your part when, oh, darkness comes
And pain is all around

Yeah, like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh, like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl sail on by your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right out behind

Yeah, like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
