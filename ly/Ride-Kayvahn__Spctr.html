		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imma let you ride
If you got what it takes to go all night
Bleed, just to feel alive
We're leaving everything we knew behind

Got your lust, don't got your love
And I can never tell what you're thinking of
Used to come around, now you're passing up
Used to bring me down, till I had enough

Please don't swallow your words though
This state of mind is eternal
Tired of the view from the back row
She don't wanna wait so I said let's go

Imma let you ride
If you got what it takes to go all night
Bleed, just to feel alive
We're leaving everything we knew behind

Imma let you ride
If you got what it takes to go all night
Bleed, just to feel alive
We're leaving everything we knew behind  

If you wanna see the way down
Read between the lines on my face now
Got you on a roll we can fade out
If you wanna roll we can fade out 

2020 vision got me seeing clones
She been on my mind when I've been alone 
Got her in my sights you already know
If she hold her own, then she coming home

Please don't swallow your words though
This state of mind is eternal
Tired of the view from the back row
She don't wanna wait so I said let's go

Imma let you ride
If you got what it takes to go all night
Bleed, just to feel alive
We're leaving everything we knew behind
