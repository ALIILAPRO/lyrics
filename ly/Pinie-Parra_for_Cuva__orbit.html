All in the storm
All in the storm
You follow her
You can control
You call on her

You follow her
You can control
You call on her

You call on her
You call on her

You call on her
You call on her

All in the storm
All in the storm
You follow her
You can control
You call on her
All in the storm
You follow her
You can control
You call on her

You call on her
You call on her

All in the storm
You follow her
You can control
You call on her
All in the storm
You follow her
You can control
You call on her

All in the storm
You follow her
You can control
You call on her
