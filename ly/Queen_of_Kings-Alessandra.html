		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She, queen of the kings
Running so fast, beating the wind
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage, threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of the North and Southern seas

Got raven hair
It's dark as night
Icy eyes, out of sight, out of sight
Her heart in spite, is warm and bright
Her smile awakes the Northern light

Looking out, she calls
Lai-lai-da-dai-dai-da
Who will conquer all?
Her name is

She, queen of the kings
Running so fast, beating the wind
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings (hey)
She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage, threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of the North and Southern seas

A firestone forged in flames
The wildest card, run the game, run the game
Can't say the same in this world of change
Don't fear the pain, just break the chain

Looking out, she calls
Lai-lai-da-dai-dai-da
Who will conquer all?
Her name is

She, queen of the kings
Running so fast, beating the wind (hey)
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage, threw out the keys (hey)
She will be the warrior of the North and Southern seas

Lai-la-da-dia
Lai-la-da-dia-dia-dia
Lai-la-da-dia
Lai-li-li-la
Lai-la-da-dia
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Her name is

She, queen of the kings
Running so fast, beating the wind (hey)
Nothing in this world could stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage, threw out the keys (hey)
She will be the warrior of the North and Southern seas (hey)
