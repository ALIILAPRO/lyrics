		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Need a fast car
Windows tinted
I want it all
Wanna get it like they get it
I just wanna be the best that ever did it
Depression’s had me fucked up for a minute

Society feels unfulfilling
Everybody want a black card
No limits
I wonder when the vision shifted
I wonder when the vision shifted

Predestined but I’ll break the system
Like you I want some and then some
Hit the ignition
Cure the condition
Made up my mind
I’ll die with the decision

Wrong way down a one lane
And I’m wondering
What happens if I just let go

Something I’m missing something
Know it’s never nothing
Need something that feels like home

Blaming a problem
And playing myself

Wrong way down a one lane
And I’m wondering
What happens if I just let go

I ain’t fucking with the pressure
I don’t really want it, no
They don’t want us all together
Fill up til we overflow

Like this is what I needed
Oh yeah I needed growth
No need to feel this way
Overwhelming every day

Call out
Hoping that you hear me
Long shot
Logo Lillard with the deep three
Love Lost
Monetize everything
Blocked channels
Try a different frequency

Wrong way down a one lane
And I’m wondering
What happens if I just let go

Something I’m missing something
Know it’s never nothing
Need something that feels like home

Blaming a problem
And playing myself

Wrong way down a one lane
And I’m wondering
What happens if I just let go

I look inside myself
I’m seeing someone else
That I don’t know
What’s better for my health?
Peace of mind or the wealth?
I’m begging for some help
Tryna find myself
In this cold world
Yeah it’s a cold world

I’ve been tryna find myself
Inside of someone else
That I don’t know
I don’t know

Wrong way down a one lane
And I’m wondering
What happens if I just let go

Something I’m missing something
Know it’s never nothing
Need something that feels like home

Blaming a problem
And playing myself

Wrong way down a one lane
And I’m wondering
What happens if I just let go
