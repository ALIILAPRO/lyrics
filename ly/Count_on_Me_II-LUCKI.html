		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm everybody's favorite plug
With no me they out of sockets
Got clients that's on probation
Say the drugs too good to drop it
That's they problem yeah
That's they problem
I keep 'em hooked and hungover
I'm the drug dealing closet
They short with cash and beg for soft passes
Ain't lobbing
They love me they quit and come right back
They Brett Favre-ing
Better stop it they better stop it
Cause if they leave I get a
Better cheesehead like Aaron Rodgers
Check my posture
I'm too straight to get robbed
Or caught by the cops
So all these setting me up
Snitching on me rumors better stop
If pockets wet enough
I come clean the job up with druggie mops
No I'm no goofy, no pushing
Me around, my buggy locked, uh
I probably come off as selfish and OC
But this my show, they buy the ticket
So I give 'em the nosebleeds and shit
Long as they keep copping
And telling their homies
I'm like a desk in math class:
They can count on me uh

So it's real, the streets talking huh?
The whole town on me
As long as they know I don't do handouts
Again, they can count on me
They can count on me they can count on me
As long as they know I don't do handouts
They can count on me

So that one Black bitch?
She beat her addiction, pray for a relapse
Got offended by the first count on
Me and then went to rehab
That's my fault, she say "You tweeking
People shouldn't know what I'm into
I'm your patient anyway
Thought our sessions were confidential"
But fuck that bitch
Know I'm serving if you call
But anyways I'm back to moving
Them packs like U-Haul as matter fact
Think the junkies love me just
As much as packs
It's probably that, druggies keep 'em
Rolling, pray they never crap, uh
And if they nice, 12 for 32 like rulers
That's why I gotta keep my eyes
Open like pervs in Hooters
No tricks up they sleeves, I give 'em vests
Don't let 'em fool you
They gotta learn to count on
Me like grade schoolers
And if they nice, 12 for 32 like rulers
That's why I gotta keep my eyes
Open like pervs in Hooters
No tricks up they sleeves, I give 'em vests
Don't let 'em fool you
The first one didn't get to 'em
So I "Part Two"ed 'em, uh

So it's real, the streets talking huh?
So the whole town on me?
As long as they know I don't do handouts
Again, they can count on me
They can count on me
