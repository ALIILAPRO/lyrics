		  Hey 
Somebody asked me, "Why are your feeds gone?"
But I can't tell anything about you and me

So, hey
Why don't you ask your friend who know me too?
'Cause I'm living dead with all the love gone

Say, why'd you go so soon?
I'm just sinkin' down the hole
Deep inside I wanna ask

Did you have fun? I can't believe
I can't understand that you're gone
Still, I'm lying that we're not through
Can't take off from you

I can't tell this to someone else
Look me in your eyes and grab my hands
Oh, babe, I want to be gone with you
Let's be brand new

Say, why'd you go so soon?
I'm just sinkin' down the hole
Deep inside I wanna ask

Did you have fun? I can't believe
I can't understand that you're gone
Still, I'm lying that we're not through
Can't take off from you

I can't tell this to someone else
Look me in your eyes and grab my hands
Oh, babe, I want to be gone with you
Let's be brand new
