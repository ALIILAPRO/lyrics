		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dance for me
Like one two three
Close your eyes
And you shall see
Feel the beat
Set yourself free
Round and around and around for me

Dance for me
Like one two three
Close your eyes
And you shall see
Feel the beat
Set yourself free
Round and around and around for me

Dance for me
Like one two three
Close your eyes
And you shall see
Feel the beat
Set yourself free
Round and around and around for me

You got me dizzy like
You're wearing that dress I like
You in the flashing lights
Flashing light, mmh

I'm ready
You ready
So won't you show me what you got
Show me what you got
(Don't act like you forgot)

I'm ready
You ready
So won't you show me what you got
Show me what you got
Don't act like you forgot

Dance for me
Like one two three
Close your eyes
And you shall see
Feel the beat
Set yourself free
Round and around and around for me

Dance for me
Like one two three
Close your eyes
And you shall see
Feel the beat
Set yourself free
Round and around and around for me

Dance for me
Like one two three
Close your eyes
And you shall see
Feel the beat
Set yourself free
Round and around and around for me
