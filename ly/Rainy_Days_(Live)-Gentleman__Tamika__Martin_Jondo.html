		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rainy  days  dem  gone
It's  over  now  it`s  over  now
Through  those  raging  storm
We  cover  now  we  cover  now
Rainy  days  dem  gone
It's  over  now,  it`s  over  now
Wicked  man  dem  hafi  calm
Run  for  cover  now  for  cover  now  

Verse  martin  jondo:  

Now  i  am  rising
And  smiling
Leaving
And  jammin`
Breaking
The  shackles  around  my  neck
Now  I  know  how  to  trust  in  the  sweet  love
No  I  got  the  keys  to  the  door  oh  lord
And  jah  jah  sweet  light  is  shining  in  my  heart  

verse  gentleman:  

I  remember  how  we  used  to  sit
Down  worry  ‘bout  life
But  true  we  confident
We  never  ever  give  up  the  fight
The  music  with  the  blessing
And  jah  show  we  the  light
Hafi  mek  dem  seh  we  move  upright
Watch  deh  clear  the  way
And  mek  we  buss  weh  like  tide
Babylon  dem  try  fi  track  we  tek  the  next  flight
A  who  dem  try  fi  diss  me  wonder
Who  dem  try  fi  fight  

chorus  

Verse  tamika:  

I've  got  to  get  myself  together  now
Forgetting  the  past  it's  all  ‘bout  the  here  and  now
now  I  know  I  could  make  it  if  I  try
And  jah  never  let  my  perseverance  die
‘cause  I  want  to  give  my  all  and  all  

verse  gentleman:  

chant  some  redemption  and  give  jah  jah  the  praise
babylon  your  time  is  done  and  not  to  mention  your  days
light  up  the  fire  now  you  can't  stop  the  blaze
revolutionary  mood  dem  can't  tek  ina  the  place
you  can't  pollute  me  and  you  can`t  change  me  ways
think  she  man  a  sleep  a  you  think  man  a  gaze
I  a  sit  down  and  a  study  fi  survive  the  next  phase
She  say  and  he  say  and  we  

chorus
