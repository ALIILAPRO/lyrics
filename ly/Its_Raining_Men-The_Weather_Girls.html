		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, hi we're your weather girls
Ah-huh
And have we got news for you
You better listen
Get ready, all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home
Alright

Humidity is rising (uh rising), barometer's getting low (how low girl?)
According to all sources (what sources now?), the street's the place to go (we better hurry up)
'Cause tonight for the first time (first time)
Just about half-past ten (half past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men (start raining men)

It's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men, amen
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet
It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, every specimen
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel, she rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
Oh, it's raining men, yeah
Humidity is rising (humidity is rising, yeah yeah)
Barometer's getting low (it's getting low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low)
According to all sources (according to all sources)
The street's the place to go
'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining man (start raining men)

It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, amen
It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, amen
It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, amen
It's raining men, hallelujah
Oh oh oh oh
It's raining men
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean
Hallelujah it's raining men, amen
