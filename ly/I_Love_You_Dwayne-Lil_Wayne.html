		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lil Wayne, Mama proud of you
You done came so far, I can't wait for your album to come out
A lot of people ask me when it's coming out
They can't wait for your album to come out
I'm just proud of you
You's my rock
You's always been my rock
Mama love you
I love you
You take care of me and my son
Your little brother, we never wanted for nothing
I thank the Lord everyday for keeping us on this Earth
And he would help 
I just pray things go well for you in life
But I thank the Lord, 'cause I knew you been through a lot
That I don't even know about 
Mama love you
I love you Dwayne, with all my heart
You's my life
I live for you
You make sure if mama is taken care of
I don't care if you don't have it, you gon' make sure I get it anyway
Even though you don't have it to give
And my son does so much, ain't wanted for nothing
Anything somebody call you for, you gon', you gon' make sure he get it
Your children
A true man
Mama love you, I can't wait 'til your album come out
'Cause everybody asking about it and I know it's gonna be a beautiful album
Love you Dwayne
