		  (Drive)

You look like you should be downtown right now
Walkin' out the house dressed up hair down
Know we're supposed to meet up with our friends
If you want, you know we still can

Baby, what ya think about
Maybe staying out the crowd
Take it out where the tall pines sway?
Do it like we used to do
Light it up under the moon
Take a trip down memory lane
And just

Drive down a backwoods byway, every mile you slide closer my way
Way out where nobody knows where we are (where we are)
Slow kiss while we're waitin' on the night train
Lookin' at you lookin' at me tryin' to keep it in the right lane
You and me two high beams in the dark (in the dark)
Baby, let's drive
'Til we find a place to park
('Til we, 'til we find a place to park)

Kill the lights and let the stars get brighter
If you wanna smoke I gotta Swisher in the visor
Lean the seat back, middle of nowhere
I can already see us out there

Baby, what ya think about
Maybe staying out the crowd?
Take it out where the tall pines sway
Do it like we used to do
Light it up under the moon
Take a trip down memory lane
And just

Drive down a backwoods byway, every mile you slide closer my way
Way out where nobody knows where we are (where we are)
Slow kiss while we're waitin' on the night train
Lookin' at you lookin' at me tryin' to keep it in the right lane
You and me two high beams in the dark (in the dark)
Baby, let's drive
'Til we find a place to park

Baby, what ya think about
Maybe staying out the crowd?
Take out it where the tall pines sway (tall pines sway)
Do it like we used to do
Light it up under the moon
Take a trip down memory lane
And just

Drive down a backwoods byway, every mile you slide closer my way
Way out where nobody knows where we are 
Where we at, yeah yeah yeah
Slow kiss while we're waitin' on the night train
Lookin' at you lookin' at me tryin' to keep it in the right lane
You and me two high beams in the dark (in the dark)
Baby, let's drive
Let's drive
'Til we find a place to park (drive)
