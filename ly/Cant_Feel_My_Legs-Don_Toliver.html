		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had to sit you down, to talk about it
It shows me a lot from your silence
You told all your friends that I'm violent
But you can quit the cap, know you lyin'
I had to beat it up, to stay inside
Your tears are happiness, they way you cry
I keep a couple Xans up in my ride
I know you want it all, but it's all mine

Oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my

Let me tell you 'bout a story, bought a couple of Xans
I was fucking 'round in Houston, with a couple of fans
But excuse me, they was groupies, they was not in the plan
Either way we popped pills and we all held hands

I had to sit you down, to talk about it
It shows me a lot from your silence
You told all your friends that I'm violent
But you can quit the cap, know you lyin'
I had to beat it up, to stay inside
Your tears are happiness, the way you cry
I keep a couple Xans up in my ride
I know you want it all, but it's all mine

Oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my

I'm way too drunk (uh-huh)
I'm way too numb (yeah, yeah)
I'm gettin' that head (oh, oh)
This bitch goin' dumb (oh my)
Call your friends (brrt, brrt)
They can all get in (they can all get in)
Take a ride in my Benz
Take a ride through the ends

I had to sit you down, to talk about it
It shows me a lot from your silence
You told all your friends that I'm violent
But you can quit the cap, know you lyin'
I had to beat it up, to stay inside
Your tears are happiness, the way you cry
I keep a couple Xans up in my ride
I know you want it all, but it's all mine

Oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my legs (legs)
I can't feel my
