		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well the road is wide
And waters run on either side
And my shadow went with fading light
Stretching out towards the night

'Cause the sun is low
And I yet have still so far to go
My lonely heart is beating so
Tired of the wonder

There's a sign ahead
Though I think it's the same one again
But I'm thinking 'bout my only friend
And so I find my way home

'Cause when I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

Oh, well the air is cold
And yonder lies my sleeping soul
By the branches broke like bones
Well, this weakened tree no longer holds

Well, the night is still
And I have not yet lost my will
Oh and I will keep on moving 'till
'Till I find my way home

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

So lead me on, and leave me strong
Like the road I walk on

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
