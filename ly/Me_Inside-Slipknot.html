		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Inside! Inside!
Inside! Inside!
Inside! Inside!
Inside! Inside!

Giving in to what has got me
Feeling claustrophobic, scarred
Severed me from all emotion
Life is just too fucking hard
Snap! Your face was all it took
Coz this need ain't doin' me no good
Fall on my face, but can't you see?
This fucking life is killing me!

Tearing me, inside
Tearing me, inside
Tearing me, inside
Tearing me, inside

Too far gone, I'm catatonic
Leaving you to criticize
Empty shell and running naked
All alone, lobotomized
Back and forth between my hang-ups
It isn't easy to be hated
Where do ya go? Whaddaya do?
Simpleton, impromptu, crazy eight
I never cared, not once
Gotta get away!

Tearing me, inside
Tearing me, inside
Tearing me, inside
Tearing me, inside

I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone

Gone

Somos feos apestamos why pero reinamos oto muthafucka

I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone

Gone
Gone
Gone
