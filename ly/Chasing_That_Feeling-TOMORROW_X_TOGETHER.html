		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  천국을 등진 난
Fall from the sky
Maybe I'll miss it for good
달콤했던 환각
고통이 살갗에
I prepared to die
더 속력을 높여서
Down to earth like a meteorite

내 숙명아 come and kiss me
I just keep on chasing that feeling
망가진 나여도 leave me
I just keep on chasing
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
It's all I know, it's all I know

길을 잃었던 나의 시간
I was lost like a child
비로소 진실을 봤어 yeah
Feel so alive
내 몸의 growing pains
Feels like I'm on fire
조금은 아파도 burn and fall like a shooting star

내 숙명아 come and kiss me
I just keep on chasing that feeling
망가진 나여도 leave me
I just keep on chasing
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
It's all I know, it's all I know

I'm chasing, chasing
I'm chasing

천국을 등진 난
Fall from the sky
And everything's gonna be alright (alright, alright)

내 숙명아 come and kiss me
I just keep on chasing that feeling
망가진 나여도 leave me
I just keep on chasing
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
It's all I know, it's all I know

I keep chasing, chasing
I'm chasing, chasing
Chasing that feeling
