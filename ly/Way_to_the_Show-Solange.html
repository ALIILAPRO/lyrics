		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me, even on the way to the show
Way to the show, candy paint down to the floor
Call me, give it all away to the show
Way to the show, candy paint down open doors
Wait 'til you know, then when time come lick the floors

Uh-huh, uh-huh, you can get it
Uh-huh, uh-huh, you can get it
Uh-huh, uh-huh, you can get it
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Call me when you're on the way to the coast
Way to the show, candy paint down to the floor
Way to the show, candy paint down to the floor
Way to the show, candy paint-paint, make it talk
Wait, you don't know
Know the midway like a guard

Uh-huh, uh-huh, you can get it
Uh-huh, uh-huh, you can get it
Uh-huh, uh-huh you can get it (Aw, yeah)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh you can get it (Aw, yeah)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Oh, you can get it
Oh, you can get it

Call me, give it all away to the car
Way to the show, candy paint down to the floor
Wait 'til you know, when the thing bang I'ma ball
End of the malls, drop it down low to the floor
Take all your calls, when the thing bang I'ma ball

Take another night
Given on the way that you hold
And I know the ways that you fold
And I know the way that you call
I'ma come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it in a minute
Come and get it
