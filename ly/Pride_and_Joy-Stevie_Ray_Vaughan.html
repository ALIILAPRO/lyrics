		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine
She's my sweet little thang, she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my baby, heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thang, she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my lady, she's long and lean
You mess with her, you'll see a man get mean
She's my sweet little thang, she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy

Well I love my baby, like the finest wine
Stick with her until the end of time
She's my sweet little thang, she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my baby, my heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thang, she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy
