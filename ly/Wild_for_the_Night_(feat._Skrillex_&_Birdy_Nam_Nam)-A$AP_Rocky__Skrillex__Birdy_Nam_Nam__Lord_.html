		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh 
Wake up feeling blessed up
Pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testarossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup 'til I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you probably own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my pay stubs
My niggas getting right, smoking weed with dirty Sprite
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going)

Uh, finna wild out for the weekend
Me, myself, and I my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finnna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP, we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a B boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feeling like Pac boy
Party all night, shit don't stop boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
Wildin' for the night, fuck being polite boy

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

It's the weekend and I'm creepin' with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, calling women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends's
Meet us in the cut and we give you the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it and your girl just said they with it
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting?
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kidss
Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clapping it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a fuck nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap
Benjamin 3 Stack, it's a fact, she lives in my lap
On my Out-Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' 'til the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we going

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

I'm going wild for the night
