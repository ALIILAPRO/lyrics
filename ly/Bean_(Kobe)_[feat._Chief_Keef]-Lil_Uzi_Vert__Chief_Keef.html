		  (Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre)

In my triple cup, that's two times two (ah)
Man, this shit darker than a wonton soup (ah, ah)
Yeah, my eyes red but I'm no Damu (ah)
If you gon' run it up, that's all on you (ah)

You know I'm ballin', usual like Kobe (twenty-four, ooh)
Ooh, worried 'bout a hater that don't know me
He say that he tough, then that boy gotta show me
Pull up Bentley truck, extra poles, and we four deep (skrrt, deep, bow)
Say my name three times like I'm Tony (Tony, Toni, Toné)
Diamond VVS, I put baguettes all on my Rollie
I ain't never believe nothing that you told me
These niggas keep sneak dissing, they turned me to my old me
Before I had these mils, I was oh so lonely
Runnin' 'round in Philadelphia only with my .40
I never been a phony (no way)
You be gettin' bands? Hardly (yeah)
I just fucked your bitch, sorry (I'm sorry)
Man, I put that on my shawty (oh)
Fight me, we're not scared, sorry (I'm sorry)
No, I'm not here for no games, Atari (no)
Diamonds, they hittin' like water, ooh, starbeam (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, rockstar life be callin', callin' (oh, yeah)
Don't want that girl, she stallin', she stallin' (oh, oh)
Big ol' foreign whip, ooh, I can't park it (ooh)
I'm from outer space, ooh, in a starship, ayy (whoa)
Thick ol' foreign bitch, ooh, that's my target (oh)
Ten bands, what you say? Ooh (ooh)
Ten bands for my Chanel carpet
Rockstar life like watch this
Y'all niggas slick like margarine
Lost your bitch in Starlet's, jeez 

AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie 
(Bang-bang)
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie (that's two times two)
AP, Muller, my Rollie 

I just pulled up with me (huh?), doin' one-sixty
The bitch staring at me got real big titties (Sosa, baby)
What's in my jeans? Them real big fifties
Flight after flight
Hittin' real big cities (nyoom, nyoom)
From the sandbox, yeah, my brothers is with me
If they give me a bond, I'm comin' to get me (okay)
And in the club, we snuck the semi (bang)
Cup darker than Rémy, I can feel the envy (oh)
In my triple cup, that's two times two
Man, this shit darker than a wonton soup (ah, ah)
Yeah, my eyes red but I'm no Damu
If you gon' run it up, that's all on you
Disrespect the gang, and we stall on you
Send them Trackhawk shots, don't get called on you (bang, bang)
Bring my belt, better have that coat on you (gang, gang)
Ayy, marry the guap, you know I do

AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
(Bang-bang)
AP, Muller, my Rollie 
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie
AP, Muller, my Rollie (ayy, Pi'erre)
AP, Muller, my Rollie (that's two times two)

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, nyoom
