		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine

Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture, we're all used to me causing a ruck
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just a man who murdered many in sake of himself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf

Slow dancing with the devil and in a burnin' room
Two steppin' ahead, until they lock me in a tomb
Been doomed since they pulled us out the womb
Satan preyin' on me, she be throwin' souls inside the wombs
Life shoulda eat you up, spit you out, beat you up
But bitch, the third eye stay open, don't think I blink enough
Baby, I see too much, baby, I can't call it
I need my soul in these bars like a alcoholic
I can't trust nobody, I put that on my mind, soul, and my whole body
I see demons and there's nothin' they don't know 'bout me
No matter how much I try to hide, they gon' find me
So now I never run from it, 'cause I come from it
I never lied, I resides in the Beast's stomach
I look the Devil in the eyes, I could see she bluffin'
I pull her red dress to the side, tell her keep cummin', keep cummin'

I just found out family and enemies could be different
I was steppin' over syringes that's in my kitchen
After mama died, I couldn't go to the bathroom
Without gettin' some second-hand heroin high while I'm pissin'
This is just me paintin' a picture of what I live with
What you know about comin' home to your shit missin'?
And findin' out the niggas that helped you look for it had did it?
This is just me paintin' addiction
These niggas took methamphetamine, ketamine, edibles, and a bean
Niggas stole my denim jeans, Den of Thieves DVDs, literally anything
Food I bought anything from the vending machine
Credit card crack any door, like janitor keys
Niggas even took credit for the man I would be
And if I let him, he would probably take twenty percent, managing fee
I'm so scared of my genes, I considered celibacy
Afraid I would ruin my seeds, like Adam and Eve
I got blood on the fuckin' leaves of my family tree
Just give me one damn minute, this shit is hard for me
I lost my whole damn mama, I lost a part of me
She lost her whole damn life from systems of poverty
Grew up with Crown fried chicken cloggin' my arteries
Increase in robberies, police and bullets that I bob and weave
It was nonstop for me, no one is stoppin' me
Either fulfill myself or be a self-fulfilling' prophecy
This just how I introduce myself poroperly
Kemba
