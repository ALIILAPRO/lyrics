		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
"It's gonna be better tomorrow"
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me down, down
Into the ground

Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
It's lost and can't be found
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
Throw it down

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me down, down
Into the ground

Twisting me
They won't go away
So I pray
Go away

Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
Fuck

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me down, down
Into the ground

(Falling away from me) Beating me down 
Beating me, beating me down, down (falling away from me)
Into the ground
(Falling away from me) Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me down, down (falling away from me)
Into the ground
