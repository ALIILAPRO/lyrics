		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who could say what would follow
Big holes in the dark
I couldn't say where you'd gone to
But every night I would ask

When hope went away
I still held on
To the love that you gave
Oh, it's all I've got of you now

I would never know you
Don't get to understand
No answers to questions
It's too late for that
But I was in your arms
I was in your arms
I was in your arms
Your arms once
Just for a moment

I'll remember you my way
It's not perfect or fair
But I'll paint you with colors
That world over there

Feels harder these days
After so long
'Cause my memory fades
And it's all I've got of you now

I would never know you
Don't get to understand
No answers to questions
It's too late for that
But I was in your arms
I was in your arms
I was in your arms
Your arms once

And these are tears because you're gone
For all the years that we lost
All those times I missed that laugh
Had it just for a moment

I would never know you
Don't get to understand
No answers to questions
No, it's too late for that
But I was in your arms
I was in your arms
I was in your arms
Your arms once
Just for a moment
