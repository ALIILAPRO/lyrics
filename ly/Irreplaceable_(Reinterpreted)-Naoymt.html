		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was empty
She filled me up
Her smile at me
Lights my life up

She is all I need
She is all I need
She is all I need
She's irreplaceable

She brings color
To my world
The leaves fluttering
In the autumn wind

She is all I need
She is all I need
She is all I need
She's irreplaceable

She makes me complete
She makes me complete
She makes me complete
She makes me complete

She is all I need
She is all I need
She is all I need
She's irreplaceable

She's the only one I need

You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me

You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me

You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me
You mean so much to me

You mean so much to me
