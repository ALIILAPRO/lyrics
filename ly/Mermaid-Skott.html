		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be your mermaid 
Caught on your rock
Coming for your aid 
Isn't it odd?
Isn't it silly
Now that you know?
Someone this slippery 
Can't let you go

It's true 
You know that I would jump too
You know that I would jump too
Ooh, into the blue
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la

You should have left me 
Cut off the rope
I'm too much sugar 
I am your dope
I'm just as scared as you
Alone in the rain
I'll jump if you jump too

Believe me, it is true
You know that I would jump too
You know that I would jump too
Ooh, into the blue, into the blue
It's proof 
'Cause we got nothing to lose
And there ain't nothing to prove
You know I'd jump with you
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la, la

Like the ocean's dancing with a storm 
I will dance with you
While my waves enclose you 'til you're warm
Like the water's glue
Hold your breath and let me count to three 
When you really know it's right
Take my hand, we'll dive into the sea
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la

(Haven't you heard me?)

(Haven't you heard me?)

It's true 
You know that I would jump too
You know that I would jump too
Ooh, into the blue, into the blue
It's proof 
'Cause we got nothing to lose
And there ain't nothing to prove
You know I'd jump with you
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la

I'll be your mermaid
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la
I'll be your mermaid
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la
I'll be your mermaid
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la
I'll be your mermaid
La-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la
