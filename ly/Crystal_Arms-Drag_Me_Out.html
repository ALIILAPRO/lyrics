		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve licked up all your sugarcoating
I’ve spilled my blood on all your dirt
I hear the dead talking ‘bout the purpose
That we could change the whole white world

I’ll cut you out
Without regret
I’ll write it on your face
Cuz all good things
Come to an end

Don’t tell me you knew it better
I won’t be pretending it’s OK
The liar is already on his deathbed

Oh I can see just what you’re made of
I know you’re living by your own mistakes

Strip me down of all the feelings
All what’s left is a wounded demon

I always feel like I want to have you back
I spent so much time thinking about you,
It’s so fucking silly...
But I’m all about real magic though
If only you could see what I can see
All of that makes me feel like...

Don’t you say I didn’t warn you
Cuz all I really needed was your shoulder
The toxin in my blood though, it’s never enough
It was never enough for the broken
