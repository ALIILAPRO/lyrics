		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right before I come recordin', put a slit up on your neck
I just need to drill the buttons, feel them, wash it down again
Hit rewind, ain't the time
Press then stop, I don't define
Got the pressure in my head, now I got to kill again

Grab the tape recorder, can you see?
Just to hear the screams
Got my rusty blade, all the same
Just to make you bleed
I'm a cop killer, big thriller, I was made by Frank Miller
Black and white, you see the scene
Now I'm spillin' red, you see

Glock, strapper's up, lock won't stop me from the block
Hit the rock, can not stop, takin' suckers like it's dark
Can you feel me breathe?
I am not alive, I can not even see
Pray for me that I get a way to get my-
Got-, got my Handycam, click record
Just with when I black out, I spazzed out
Now I gotta clean up, got my ShamWow
Damn, I'm the man, I just got away again
I ain't run, I'm a slow bitch, but try to come and catch this

My way in life is dark and deep
Never keep the peace, you b'
My fuckin' sucker's fucking mothers
I am always down to rumble
You be famous on the news
Hangin' from a fuckin' noose with a note signed by me
"F-R-E," double "D, I-E"
Blessings from the Gods, I just think I really got it
I'm invincible, people really try, but they can't stop it
I just block it, log it
Open up and bodies droppin'
"Who is knockin'?" It's the Devil, and we fuckin' poppin'
