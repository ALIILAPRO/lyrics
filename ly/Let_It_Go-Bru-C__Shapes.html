		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah-ah
Yeah, yeah-ah-ah
Na-na-na-na
Yeah, yeah-ah
Yeah, yeah-ah-ah
Na-na-na-na
(Yo, Shapesy, I like that drum)

Yo, the ending is approaching, whoa
I'm feeling so emotional
Could be the last time to lose control, oh
The system is so frightening though
Temptations are inviting, whoa
This is the one place to feed my soul (Bru-C)
I need to let it go

Yo, life's getting worse
Real music will guide me from Earth (let it go)
They get stronger, we get weaker
Turn up the sound through the speaker (let it go)
I've been scrolling for ages
Global control by the matrix (let it go)
I write rhymes for a reason
Bru-C, I'm fighting for freedom (let it go)

Yo, sick of the lies, sick of the bickering people on different sides
The division is why we're seeing no different times, finish the cries
They're wicked inside, they can't diminish my pride, I'm bringing the vibes
Young people lost, ain't no one giving them guidance, listen to I
There's so much pressure to achieve
But I'm looking at success and what the definition be
People looking up to fake stars flexing with their P's
Make perfection on a screen, but content is what they're never gonna be
Newest car or the truest heart
Real happiness is finding happiness in who you are
Make your movie, don't be looking up to rappers and the movie stars
I'm shining light, I see the future's dark
I look around the people, there's no interaction
Eyes glued, likes, views, its a big distraction
One voice ain't gonna strike
But if millions came to unite, we could (let it go)

Yo, life's getting worse
Real music will guide me from Earth (let it go)
They get stronger, we get weaker
Turn up the sound through the speaker (let it go)
I've been scrolling for ages
Global control by the matrix (let it go)
I write rhymes for a reason
Bru-C, I'm fighting for freedom (let it go)

We just suffer and suffer
Big up my people that come from the gutter
Now is the time to look past the distractions
Ah, yeah-ah
They get richer and richer
Leaving the people more bitter and bitter
I don't know what to do but let music flow
We need to let it go

Let it go
Na-na-na-na
Let it go
Na-na-na-na
Let it go
Let it go
