		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm 

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable 

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm 

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm 

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Enjoy the silence
