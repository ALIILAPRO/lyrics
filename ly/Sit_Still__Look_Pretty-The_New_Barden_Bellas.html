		  Huh!

Could dress up, to get love
But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world (ooh)
Could wake up in makeup and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things and diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing
This queen don't need a king

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice, for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo (ooh)
That Snow White, she did right in her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for, no

The only thing a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity (no)
And I might love me some vanilla, but I'm not that sugar sweet
Call me HBIC

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Sure, I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still
I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world (still, still)
Sure, I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world (no, I don't wanna sit still no)
But they say pretty hurts (I don't wanna sit still no)
And I don't wanna sit still (I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world)
Sit still, look pretty

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
