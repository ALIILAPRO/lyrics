		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down
Yeah, come down
Before you met me, yeah, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February
Yeah, you'll be my Valentine
Valentine

So let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
Yeah, we can dance until we die
You and I will be young forever

'Cause you make me
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Ever look back, oh
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Ever look back, oh

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

And I'ma get your heart racing in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Oh, 'cause you make me
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Ever look back, oh
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Ever look back, oh
