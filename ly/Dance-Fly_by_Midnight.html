		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Electric lady
She keeps me
Bitter baby
I can't figure out
No i can't figure out
Why she

Wants to play me
Feel like a ukulele
I get the runaround
I swear she got me got me running round

Everywhere, I try to take her everywhere
No I can't win she's solitaire
there's nothing left to do
I hate to lose

She likes to dance
Dance around her feelings
Damn I can't believe it's like that
I've got no chance
Dancing with the a devil
Takes my heart to hell and right back

I'm like
Oooo
Oooo
Caught up in a sad romance

She takes my hand
No I can't stand
When all she wants to do is dance

Cut the music
She keeps it moving
Got all this energy
But it ain't taking taking me
Anywhere

I leave her daisies by the stairs
I shine my shoes and comb my hair
there's nothing left to do
I hate to lose

She likes to dance
Dance around her feelings
Damn I can't believe it's like that
I've got no chance
Dancing with the a devil
Takes my heart to hell and right back

I'm like
Oooo
Oooo
Caught up in a sad romance

She takes my hand
No I can't stand
When all she wants to do is dance

Knock me out
And make this easy
Or come sit down
Just please don't leave me

I said
Knock me out
Make this easy
Just take it easy on me babe

She likes to dance
Dance around her feelings
Damn I can't believe it's like that
I've got no chance
Dancing with the a devil
Takes my heart to hell and right back

I'm like
Oooo
Oooo
Caught up in a sad romance

She takes my hand
No I can't stand
When all she wants to do is dance
