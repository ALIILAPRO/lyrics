		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Couldn't beat her smile, it stirred up all the media
Secret side, I wanna know it, so mysterious
Even that elusive side, part of her controlled area
Complete and perfect, all you say is a bunch of lies
Dear miss genius idol, unmatched

Oh, my savior, you're my saving grace

What did you eat today?
What book do you love?
Whenever you go out for fun, tell me, where do you go?
Haven't eaten anything
It's a secret, unknown
Any questions you're facing, always acting so vaguely

So unconcerned, although you brightly glow
Any seemingly unveiled secrets are as sweet as honey
Confusing, why, why, why?
Essential lie, lie, lie
So, what is your type of guy?
Any partner? So now, answer this

"I don't have any idea how I could love anyone"
"I don't seem to know what it signifies"
Cannot find out if it's true or it's a lie
Once again, there's somebody who's fallen for the words and cues
Made him lose his head over you

That emotion melts all hearts, all eyes on you
'Cause you are perfect, the most ultimate idol
Unrivaled, will not appear again
It's the brightest star reborn, yes, indeed
Ah, using that smiling face
That "I love you" again
Now, everybody is lured and captivated by you
The pupil that you got, the words you vocalize
Even when untrue, it's your perfected Ai

Right, right, we all know she's very special, yes
We had lost the fight before it started, so impressed
Miss, I'm such a star, we're serving as support to her grace
Cannot tell me everything was because of her, no, it's not right

Out of line, how can we not feel jealous while being around?
It's not a joke, you know, right? So I cannot forgive you for that
Completely deny, imperfect you that I sight
Myself, no pardon allowed
I won't allow anyone if it's not you, strongest of all

That emotion seized all hearts worshiping you
Yes, indeed, so strong, it's you, unrivaled idol
There cannot be weaknesses to find
The brightest star is residing in you
The gaps and shortcomings, don't show'em, dammit, dammit
Parts nobody wants to know should remain hidden
One and only, if it's different, no way, no way
Such a true love, it's the realest Ai

Showing this smile, my own weapon, boiling media
Keeping everything about my secret deep inside
"I'm in love with you," my career is built on such a lie
It's the way I know to show my love, without a doubt
Running down, my sweat is flowing, cleanest Aqua, right?
Ruby hidden under my eyelids where it resides
I sing and dance around, look at me, I'm Maria
So lying surely is the greatest kind of love

I recall no one that loved me whole before
And I've not been in love with anybody before
Now, the lies I'm making up
I'm hoping that a day comes when they all become true and I
(Keep wishing they do)

One day, I will hold everything that I pursue
Yes, I am so greedy, true voracious idol
So sincerely, what I'm wishing for is
To love each of you with all my heart
And so today, I lie again
The words I vocalize inside of me
I'm wishing that one day they come true
Up to this day, I've not been able to let you
And you hear me saying those meaningful words

Ah, I said it at last
I know it's not a lie as I'm voicing these words "I love you"

(Hai, hai, hai, hai)
(Hai, hai, hai, hai)
(Hai, hai, hai, hai)
(Hai, hai, hai, hai)
Oh, my savior, my true savior
My saving grace
