		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're my bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals, baby
It's the people who lie to themselves

I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're my bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals baby
It's the people who lie

I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

Our hearts
(I want real love, baby)
Are free
(Ooh, don't leave me waiting)
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
(I've got real love maybe, wait until you taste me)
I'm a flower, you're my bee
(I want real love, baby, there's a world inside me)
It's much older than you and me
(Got the preacher's music, just if for a minute)
I'm in love, I'm alive
(I want real love, baby, ooh don't leave me waiting)
I belong to the stars and sky
