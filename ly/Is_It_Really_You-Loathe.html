		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Face away
Deal with the pain
Your own way
How could they
Deal with the pain?

I knew
It was mine too
And you?
Is it really you?

Let's search the sky for a while
You and I collide like two stars for a while
You and I

Crushed by silent snow
Not the first I know
Caught in ebb and flow
I'm bleeding out, oh you know

Let's search the sky for a while
You and I collide like two stars for a while
You and I
