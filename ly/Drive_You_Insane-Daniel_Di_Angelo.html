		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pain
That shit never leaves you the same
It knows how to play with your brain
But I know how to drive you insane
Put my girl on the back
And I'm riding tonight
But when I get my chance
Swear I'll fuck you right
And if you drink my pain
You can swallow my pride
And if you curse my name
Baby fuck your life
And I know you want it, baby
You know I want you
Don't underestimate the things that I could do
I know you wish us apart
Don't want it her way
Well I just fucked her all night
She'll have a good day
Yeah, you
Yeah you know what you did
Yeah you know that you fucked up my love life
Now you wanna get lit
What, girl
What the fuck did you say
I won't put you on the front of the book
And you won't even get a page babe
Play your games and you won't even get a taste
Yeah you won't even get hit up when I'm drunk
You won't even get laid
You won't even get paid
You won't even get play
Cause I know how to get my way
I just put my girl on the back
And I'm riding tonight
But when I get my chance
Swear I'll fuck you right
And if you drink my pain
You can swallow my pride
And if you curse my name
Baby fuck your life
And I know you want it, baby
You know I want you
Don't underestimate the things that I could do
I know you wish us apart
Don't want it her way
Well I just fucked her all night
She'll have a good day
Yeah you text me all night
To see if I'm alright
To get to my dark side
You've fucked with the wrong type
Baby, I'm the wrong guy
I thought you were for life
I thought you were all mine
So I put my girl on the back
Riding right past your house
And when you see her face
You'll know what I'm about
Cause I know just how to drive you insane
Baby, I know just how to play your games
I know you want it, baby
You know I want you
Don't underestimate the things that I could do
Girl, you gave me a reason to treat you this way
I should've never even loved you in the first place
You've fucked with the wrong type
Baby, I'm the wrong guy
I thought you were for life
I thought you were all mine
