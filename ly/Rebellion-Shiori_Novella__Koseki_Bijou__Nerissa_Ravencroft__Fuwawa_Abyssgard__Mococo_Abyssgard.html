		  A-d-v-e-n-t
A-d-v-e-n-t

Time to get this party started!
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire
Chasing all that we aspire
Spreading out like wildfire
Never ever, have I ever
Been a sinner, been a dreamer
Take the chance and with my lighter
Start the fire

Come pull me out
I'm out of sheep to count
This overkill of sad old story is wearing me down
Snap out of the system
Break out give it everything
This is our time, we're yours to discover

Hello, brand new world, would you welcome the light?
And free us from the night
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire
Ignite our beating hearts

Dance into the flame of life (dance, dance, dance)
新しい世界へ
Dance until the end of time (dance, dance, dance)
異次元の向こう側 連れてってあげる
Rebellion

Time to get this party started!
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire
Chasing all that we aspire
One step to the left
Two steps to the right
Then back to where we started, and then over again
Step out of the circle
Break out we've got everything
This is our time, we're yours to discover

Blue sky, take us home
To where we belong
And free us from the night
Take us to paradise
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire
Ignite our beating hearts

Dance into the flame of life (dance, dance, dance)
それぞれの聖地へ
Dance until the end of time (dance, dance, dance)
奇跡の向こう側 連れてってあげる
Rebellion

I know that I can still be
The future of this story
I know that I can be free
The one and the only
They tell me that I'm crazy
I'll never let them stop me
With this, our advent begins!

Time to get this party started!
Never ever, have I ever
Been a sinner, been a dreamer
Fire, fire, light the fire
Fire, fire, light the fire
Ignite these beating hearts

Jump into the stream of life (jump, jump jump)
新しい世界へ
Jump until the end of time (jump, jump jump)
異次元の向こう側 連れてってあげる

Dance into the flame of life (dance, dance, dance)
それぞれの聖地へ
Dance until the end of time (dance, dance, dance)
奇跡の向こう側 連れてってあげる
Rebellion (whoa)

Time to get this party started!
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire
Time to get this party started!
