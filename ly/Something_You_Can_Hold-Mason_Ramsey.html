		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rest easy, what's on your mind
Nothing's gonna bother us tonight
When the sky is gray and it won't change
Save all your heartaches for another day
Save all your heartaches for another day

When there's too much hanging on your worried mind
I'll be there, right beside you
When the nights are long, and you're feeling cold
I can be something, yeah, that you can hold
I can be something, yeah, that you can hold

Slow down, slow down the time
Make the world stop spinning around outside
We all fall down, but we get back up
'Cause doing it together makes life less tough
Doing it together makes life less tough

When there's too much hanging on your worried mind
I'll be there, right beside you
When the nights are long, and you're feeling cold
I can be something, yeah, that you can hold
I can be something, yeah, that you can hold

When there's too much hanging on your worried mind
I'll be there, right beside you
When the nights are long, and you're feeling cold
I can be something, yeah, that you can hold
I can be something, yeah, that you can hold

I can be something
I can be something
I can be something that you can hold
