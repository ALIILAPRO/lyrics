		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath, truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong, I will be faithful 'cause I'm counting on 

A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

Well, I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to heaven, then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of

The highest powers
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

Well, I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh, can you see it, baby?
You don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come
Ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah

I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath, truly, madly, deeply do
Mmm-mmm

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Well, I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
Well, I want to live like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah-yeah
Oh, oh
La-la-la-la-do-yeah-oh-yeah
La-la-la-la-do-yeah-do-yeah
