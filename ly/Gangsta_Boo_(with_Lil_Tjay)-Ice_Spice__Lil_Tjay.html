		  (Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)

A baddie gon' get what she like (grrah)
So what's your sign 'cause I like you? (Like)
Got a place we can stay for the night but I'm too shy to invite you (grrah)
You got a gangsta vibe (vibe)
And I want a gangsta boo (boo)
One of a dangerous kind (grrah)
I'm tryna see how a gangsta move

He never worries 'bout no exes
All on my body, I'm the bestest
Diamonds keep dancin' on my necklace
Bitches stay mad just like the rest is (grrah)
On Fordham my drip was a scene (facts)
Hit up Benny when I need a chain (like)
Made it out soon as I got fame (grrah)
Walkin' past and they yellin' my name, damn (damn)
Like they goin' ku' (goin' ku')
I'm a fan but I'm keepin' my cool (keepin' my cool)
And I like it when you call me boo (like boo)
Bae, I just wanna do what you do (like)
Fuck your thots, I'm takin' they spot (they spot)
Bitches know that I am what they not
I'ma help you get back at the opps (grrah)
They cannot come when we spinnin' they block (grrah)
And I swear that you be on my mind (my mind)
Yeah, I'm lit, but for you, I make time (make time)
Niggas waitin', you skippin' the line (like)
I was debatin' on making you mine (grrah)
And you fly I could tell by your belt
And you make with the cards you was dealt (you was dealt)
By my side, then you takin' no L
He all like, "Damn, Ice you makin' me melt" (grrah)
Got a man but I hope he don't care (care)
When I'm with him, I wish you was there
Takin' that risk but you know I'm not scared (like)
When he thinkin' he know shit isn't fair
Flexin' together, I know we go better (grrah)
We stay high, it don't matter the weather (grrah)
His bitches mad that he gettin' me wetter (grrah)
Damn, I ain't felt this way in forever (grrah)

A baddie gon' get what she like (grrah)
So what's your sign 'cause I like you? (Like)
Got a place we can stay for the night but I'm too shy to invite you (grrah)
You got a gangsta vibe (vibe)
And I want a gangsta boo (boo)
One of a dangerous kind (grrah)
I'm tryna see how a gangsta move

I don't think you should play with me (why?)
'Cause you gon' end up like the last opp
I'm a thug off some drugs in my home
And say, long before rap, I was playin' the back box
I don't know if I'm high or just too bopped
But your shit look like you got ass shots
Treat that bitch like the opps
When them boys try to slide and they see me, I'm givin' her back shots
I'm like, "Isis, your shit lookin' fat" (fat)
I'm a gangsta, I keep it legit (legit)
Not gon' hold you, I told her some secrets (what?)
So she know I be on that shit
Told her not too much, know what you know (know)
That's when she told me, "Daddy, I'm zipped" (what?)
If the boys ever try to come press me (huh?)
I'ma tell 'em, "No hablo ingles" (I don't know shit)
And together, we somethin' like brish, they can't do it like you and they wish
Fuck the opps, so you're ready for beep so you know what to do with the (ugh)
See a opp, I don't fold, I go quick, like, "Who next tryna go on my list?"
If he throw up a four, we gon' (blitz 'em)
How many of them finna go in my spliff?
My lil' shawty, I treat her like gang and she don't treat me like no rap nigga
I'm the youngest to do it, you had a shot, blew it, of course she gon' leave you, my sack bigger
That lil' nigga ain't nothin' like me (me) 
And I'm definitely nothin' like that nigga (what?)
Word around is your nigga could fight (huh?) 
So you better tell him I clap niggas (boom)

A baddie gon' get what she like (grrah)
So what's your sign 'cause I like you? (Like)
Got a place we can stay for the night but I'm too shy to invite you (grrah)
You got a gangsta vibe (vibe)
And I want a gangsta boo (boo)
One of a dangerous kind (grrah)
I'm tryna see how a gangsta move
