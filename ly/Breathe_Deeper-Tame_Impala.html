		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If ain't so awful and we're all together, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think I couldn't roll with you, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If ideally we should feel like this forever, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can

(It just so) seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper, should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
(It just so) now you're having fun
So do this and get through this, and come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to tell you that you're special, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to carry on, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think no one is feeling what you're feeling, I am
Believe me, I am, believe me, I am

And the groove is slow

(It just so) seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper, should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this, and come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

'Til the mornin'

'Til the mornin'
Oh
And the groove is slow

'Til the mornin'
And the groove is slow

Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper, should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this, and until we see the sun
You're my number one

'Til the mornin'
(It just so)
And the groove is slow
'Til the mornin'
And the groove is slow

We're both adults but we behave like children
Long as we got enough to keep on livin'

'Til the mornin'
'Til the mornin'
