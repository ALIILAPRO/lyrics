		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well that's alright
If that's alright
Two thousand miles were still
That's alright
And that's alright
If that's alright
I'll see you in the morning
If that's alright

And what would you do if I wrote you a song
Would you give me some lovin' when I get home
Or would you be mad at me if I had a hard time
Gettin' a hold of you
I try all the time

And I'll bet that
You don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wonderin' where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes

What would you do if I sang you this song
The connection is bad but that's only the phone
'Cause when my words kiss your ear
I'll be right there
The message is long
'Cause baby this is your song

I'll bet that
You don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wonderin' where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow morning

I'll bet that
You don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wonderin' where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow morning

And that's alright
'Cause I'll be home when tomorrow morning
And that's alright
'Cause I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes
