		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you go away
On this summer day 
Then you might as well 
Take the sun away 

All the birds that flew 
In the summer sky 
When our love was new 

And our hearts were high 
And the day was young 
And the night was long 
And the moon stood still 
For the night bird's song

If you go away
If you go away 
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay 
I'll make you a day 
Like no day has been 
Or will be again 

We'll sail the sun 
We'll ride on the rain 
Will talk to the trees 
And worship the wind 

Then if you go 
I'll understand 
Leave me just enough love 
To fill up my hand 

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away 

As I know you must
There'll be nothing left 
In the world to trust 
Just an empty room 

Full of empty space 
Like the empty look 
I see on your face 
And I'd have been the shadow of your dawn

If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
Please don't go, away
