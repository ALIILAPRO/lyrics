		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma care for you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you

You make it look like it's magic (oh yeah)
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused, hey, hey
And I'm so used to bein' used

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah

You know our love would be tragic (oh yeah)
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies, hey, hey
And you're my favorite kind of night

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause girl, you're perfect (girl, you're perfect)
You're always worth it (always worth it)
And you deserve it (and you deserve it)
The way you work it (the way you work it)
'Cause girl, you earned it, (earned it) yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah

On that lonely night (lonely night)
We said it wouldn't be love, but we felt the rush (fell in love)
It made us believe it was only us (was only us)
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah
Inside, yeah

'Cause girl, you're perfect (girl, you're perfect)
You're always worth it (you're always worth it)
And you deserve it (and you deserve it)
The way you work it (the way you work it)
'Cause girl, you earned it (girl, you earned it), yeah
Girl, you earned it (earned it), yeah

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
The way you work it
You deserve it
Girl, you deserve it
Girl, you earned it, yeah, yeah
