		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch

Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been scheming up, if you wanna (like, oh)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been scheming up

You got my heartbeat racing
My body blazing

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
(It's so good, it's so good)
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
(It's so good, it's so good)

So good when we slow gravity, so good
(It's so good, it's so good)
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
(It's so good, it's so good)

Pass your boy the heatwave, recreate the sun
Take me to the feeling, boy, you know the one
Kiss it when you're done, man, this shit is so much fun
Pocket rocket run (run, run)

You got my heartbeat (heartbeat) racing (racing)
My body blazing

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
(It's so good, it's so good)
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
(It's so good, it's so good)

So good when we slow gravity, so good
(It's so good, it's so good)
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
(It's so good, it's so good)

It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
