		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whew, what? Bop-bop, bop-bop-bop (Okay)
Uh, what? What? Ayy, bow, bow
(Man, what the fuck goin' on, Maajins?)

Eliantte for my watch
Had to Mason the Rollie (Woah)
Catch that boy out with his friends
Then we makin' him lonely (Yeah)
That's your ho? I took your bitch
Now we makin' a movie (What?)
This ho flew me to LA
And he payin' for coochie (Let's get it)
Brodie pull up where you stay
And he sprayin' the Uzi (Brrat)
Fucked her, Kicked her out the crib now
She sayin' I'm ruthless (What?)
This ho tryna set me up
Guess she thinkin' I'm stupid (What?)
These boys tryna ride our wave, yeah
We makin' a movement (Lеt's go)

He want smoke, then bitch, I'm rеady
I just bought a presi' (Yeah)
That's your ho
Then why she text me? 'Cause I got the fetti
(Yeah) we got sticks up in Chanelly
We tote automatics (Yeah)
Yeah, we send that boy to Heaven, yeah
We caught 'em lackin' (Buh)
Watch me count my rackies up
I love to stack it up (I let it, what?)
Your lil' ho gon' tap me up
Eat me like caviar (Like what?)
Smokin' strong, that Kelly, yeah
Up in the telly, Yeah
(Up in what?)
He ain't never run it up, that boy a failure
(Ain't no way)
Said he tryna run up, I'ma let him (What?)
Who that boy? I'm feelin' paranoid
I ain't feelin' 'em (Ain't no way)
Big and bad, think he a scary boy
Brodie killin' 'em (Yeah! Yeah)
What's that on your wrist? Ain't real ice
It ain't chill enough (No)
