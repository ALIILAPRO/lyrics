		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't miss you anymore but sometimes
I wonder if you think of me
I am prone to being forgotten
I have learned that I am
Relatively easy to leave

And I don't care that you lied
It was nice to need you like a drug
And I don't want to turn back time anymore
But I do miss when I thought that I was loved
I do miss the thought of being in love
Love, love, oh-love

I don't miss you anymore but sometimes
I wonder if it’s you I'll keep
I am prone to being forgotten
I have learned that love is
Always out of reach

And I don't carе that you hide
It was nice to have somеthing to find
And I don't want to change your mind anymore
But I do miss when you took up all my time
I do miss the love I could leave behind, love
Love, love, oh-love
