		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just, I just live
I live day by day, fightin' demons

I smoked away my brain, I think I'm goin' dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they're goin' numb
I'm havin' stomach pains, now I'm throwin' up
'Cause I'm a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King with a dream
That one day that my team, we can make it with this rappin'
Now we swaggin', makin' money in Manhattan, trick, what's happenin'?
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel 'til my death, it's in my flesh, it's in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I'm finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I'm disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick spit
Clip spit quick split shit hit kids women
Oh, that's your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It's A$AP nigga, live with it, swag

Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they startin' to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they startin' to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts

Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah
Hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel

Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they startin' to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they startin' to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
