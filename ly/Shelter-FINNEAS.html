		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no one else, could ever hold me, like you do
There's nowhere else, that I'd rather be than with you
They call us lucky, but I think we might be cursed
'Cause the way you love me
I could drink the river dry, and still die of thirst

Give me, give me shelter, from the storm
Give me, give me shelter, keep me warm
Come kiss me by the delta, with a river storm
But I'll be whole
As long as I'm yours
Yours

There's no way out, the city sinks into the sea
But if we go down, at least I'm in good company
They call us hasty, and I think they might be right
But I know that I'd be crazy
Not to wanna be the one to keep you up all night

Give me, give me shelter, from the storm
Give me, give me shelter, keep me warm
Come kiss me by the delta, with a river storm
But I'll be whole
As long as I'm yours
As long as I'm yours, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna think about a life without you
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna go to war, but I'm about to

Give me, give me shelter, from the storm
Give me, give me shelter, keep me warm
Come kiss me by the delta, with a river storm
But I'll be whole
As long as I'm yours
(As long as I'm yours)
Give me, give me shelter, from the storm (as long as I'm yours)
Give me, give me shelter, keep me warm (as long as I'm yours)
Come kiss me by the delta, with a river storm (oh, no, no, no)
But I'll be whole (oh)
As long as I'm yours
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna think about a life without you
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna go to war, but I'm about to
