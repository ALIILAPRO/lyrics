		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's a blue world)
(Without you)
(It's a blue world)
(Alone)

Yeah
Well, it's a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do 180
I ain't politicking, I ain't kissing no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Hey, yeah
I let it go but I never go with it
Uh, yeah, okay

Cool as Fall weather
Fuck the bullshit, I'm here to make it all better
With a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you it's the color blue, ooh
Don't trip, I was in the city, they was talking that shit
Had the homies with me, all of a sudden they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughing, that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke, don't fix

Hey, one of these days we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall

Think I lost my mind
Reality's so hard to find
When the devil tryna call your line
But shit, I always shine
Even when the light dim
No, I ain't God but I'm feeling just like him
Ooh, don't trip
See I was in the whip riding, me and my bitch
We was listening to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my hand got bit

Yeah
Well, it's a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do 180
I ain't politicking, I ain't kissing no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Hey, yeah
I let it go but I never go with it
Uh

Don't trip
Don't trip
Don't trip

Well, if you could see me now
Love me then hold me down
My mind, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes

Well, it's a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do 180
I ain't politicking, I ain't kissing no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Hey, yeah
I let it go but I never go with it
Uh

Hey, one of these days we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall in line
