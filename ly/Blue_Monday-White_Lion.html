		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you feeling down
Are you all alone
Have your dreams been shattered
Have you lost all hope
All you need is music
It's your destiny, it sets you free

Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh

You can raise your hands
You can stomp your feet
Get down and turn around
You can do it all cause there ain't no rules
When you feel the music
Just move your feet, to that heavy beat

Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh

Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
