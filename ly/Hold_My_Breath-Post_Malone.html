		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk too much
Dream too much
Please don't leave
'Cause you're holdin' onto somethin' special to me
It's essential to me

Hold my breath
'Til I turn green
Please don't leave
'Cause you're holdin' onto somethin' special to me
It's essential to me

My love
Say that you, say that you love me
Don't waste my time

Shut me up
Snuff me out
Please don't leave
'Cause you're holdin' onto somethin' special to me
It's essential to me

My love
Say that you, say that you love me
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time
