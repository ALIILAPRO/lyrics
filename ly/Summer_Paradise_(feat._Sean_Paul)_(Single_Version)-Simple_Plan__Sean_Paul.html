		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta find my way back
Back to summer paradise
Sean Paul, Simple Plan

My heart is sinking as I'm lifting 
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh, I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do

But someday, I will find my way back to where 
Your name is written in the sand (stay in my brain)

'Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye (yeah)
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time girl) oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh 
(Tell 'em)

My soul is broken, streets are frozen
I can't stop these feelings melting through
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you (baby girl)
Well, real life can wait (it can wait)
We're crashing like waves (yeah)
We're playing in the sand (me and you, girl)
Holding your hand (make some noise)

'Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time, girl) oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time, girl) oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Because mi sit down inna di tour, but I freeze
Thinking about the sunshine and di trees
Summertime on the beach
So fine, oh you know say that mi have mi main squeeze
Baby girl, you really got what mi need
It's three o'clock, and we deh deh anytime that you need
In a heartbeat, girl, sex on the beach
Just say the word, SP a go reach
Loving increase, put it upon repeat

Someday, I will find my way back
To where your name is written in the sand 
(Bring it back, bring it back, rewind, rewind)

'Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye (no way)
Singing la-da-da-da-da

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
(Yeah, and I'll be there in a heartbeat)
And I remember where we first kissed (I remember)

And how I didn't wanna leave your lips
And how I've never ever felt so high (so high)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
So tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time, girl) oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time, girl) oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh (summer paradise, baby)
I'll be there in a heart (yeah)
