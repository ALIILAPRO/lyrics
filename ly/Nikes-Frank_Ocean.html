		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely 
Said she need a ring like Carmelo 
Must be on that white like Othello 
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you
Just like me

I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP
RIP Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my lil cousin, he got a lil trade
His girl keep the scales, a lil mermaid
We out by the pool, some lil mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me
But he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speakin' of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls stickin' in my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean somethin' to you
I'll mean somethin' too
I'll mean somethin' too
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fuckin' him too
