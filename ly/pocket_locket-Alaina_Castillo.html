		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day we'll be fine

I'm your type, I'm the vibe
Fantasize, stay the night
Every night
I can keep all your secrets in my pocket locket
And then I keep ya held down when I lock and drop it
Yeah, you be sly, that's alright
I don't mind, you be cruel
I'll survive
Playing that hard to get love showing no affection
I know it's hard to keep up with my good intentions

You must think I'm mad to need ya
They must think I'll never leave ya
I don't see my love as weakness
I know in the end you'll be the one
One
One

Right now I bet you think you've got me
In the palm of your hand
Give me no love, you get that good love
Hope that you don't regret
Taking so long to see that I'm the best
Thing you'll ever have
Come get that love, boy, get that good love
Baby, while you still can

I'm the shit, I'm a trip
Take a sip, watch it drip
From your lip
Know that I can keep you lock down
With my little finger
And I would do it all day just to let you linger
You know that I would take the time
To let you ride, let you try to do me right
Hoping that you're learning real quick
Asking all the questions
'Cause if you push me too far
You gone learn your lesson

You must think I'm mad to need ya
They must think I'll never leave ya
I don't see my love as weakness
I know in the end you'll be the one
One
One

Right now I bet you think you've got me
In the palm of your hand
Give me no love, you get that good love
Hope that you don't regret
Taking so long to see that I'm the best
Thing you'll ever have
Come get that love, boy, get that good love
Baby, while you still can

Oh baby, while you still can
That love, boy, get that good love
While you still can, oh, yeah
Come get that love, boy, get that good love
While you still can
