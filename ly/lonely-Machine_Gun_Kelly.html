		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got in trouble 
The first time my dad saw me dance with the devil
How are we so opposite?
I lived with your sister
My first home since mom had left
And I wrote my first song with him in the basement

And then he said goodbye way too soon
And this don't feel right without you

Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I'd trade it, trade it, I would trade it all for you
Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely without you

I got in trouble 
The first time the cops saw me dance with the devil
I ended up in handcuffs and then you called your sister
She cried when she picked me up
Goddamn, how I miss her
'Cause she didn't give a fuck

And then she said goodbye way too soon
And this don't feel right without you

Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I'd trade it, trade it, I would trade it all for you
Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely without you

The last time I saw you (fuck)
I cried, I wished you had more time left
The last time I heard you
They held the phone, you took your last breath
The last time I saw you (saw you)
I cried, I wished you had more time left
The last time I heard you (heard you)
They held the phone, you took your last breath

Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I'd trade it, trade it, I would trade it all for you
Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I'd trade it, trade it, I'd trade it all for you
Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I'd trade it, train it, I'd trade it all for you
Lonely, lonely even when the room is full
I hate this, I'm jaded, and I trade it all for you

"Boy, it was just a dangerous birth
His umbilical cord was stuck around his neck
And so I ended up, undoing the umbilical cord and uh
Well he was bigger than a normal child
I don't know what it was but he had uh, uh
He had a heart problem, and they didn't think he would live"
