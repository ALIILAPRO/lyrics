		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm young and living fun, huh
Sure look down and call it dumb, huh
I can still see the sun, huh
Do you remember 21, huh?
Can I stay the way, huh?
Grow up today, huh
Can you really blame, huh
Shit you can leave or stay, huh

When the world feels like its closin' in
And you don't know what you know
And you think about what's holdin' you
It's relatives and clothes
Just leave it all behind
You got to get away
You got to get away
Everybody

See the look in my eye, huh
I got to get it out, huh
I don't care if they stare, huh
I learn life's not fair, huh
I'm gonna play while I'm here, huh
I gotta get it out, huh
Just watch me run away now, huh
You know sometimes you just gotta

Hey
Run away from
Home
Run away from (Young, fresh n' new)
Home
Run away from
Home
Run away from

(Got to get)
I've got to get away (away)
Hey, hey hey hey...
(I've got)
I've got to get away (away)

Hey
Run away from
Home
Run away from (young, fresh n' new)
Home
Run away from
Home
Run away from

When the world feels like its closin' in
And you don't know what you know
And you think about what's holdin' you
It's relatives and clothes
Just leave it all behind
You got to get away
You got to get away
Everybody

(Got to get)
I've got to get away (away)
Hey hey hey hey...
(I've got)
Oh I've got to get away (away)
But I've got to be
Young, fresh n' new

Hey
Run away from
Home
Run away from (young, fresh n' new)
Home
Run away from
Home
Run away from
Hey
