		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you the vibe
You gave me to nature and you took that with my life
I got prided strangers sayin' I fucked you all the time
I forgot your feeling, feel I'm runnin' out of time
You're running on my mind, baby try me all night
I'm on the east side yea, I think I'll be fine yea
Drinking my eastside, rolling up peace signs
With mona lisas yea
And you know I'll get excited when I see you
Had me diving in that pussy when I eat you
You and I were never single never needed feature, wait until I see you
I just wanna hear you say you love me
But you don't gotta mean it, girl don't worry
I know my mentality is kind of ugly
But I fucking hate it when you do anything for me
Nobody's perfect and yeah I know
Honestly, I'm better off alone
I know you're probably never coming home
But fuck it I just gotta let it go
I still wonder why
Are you happy when I leave?
I still wonder why
Is your life better without me?
For you, I'd bleed
If you can only see
Why love is evil
Why love is evil
Why love is evil
Why love is evil
She don't
Wanna
Fuck with nobody else no more
She just wanna come back to me
Baby come and have sex on the balcony
Imma treat you good to sushi in Miami
Maybe it just took some time for you to miss me
I knew that it would come naturally
Baby you can't hide it that you love me
I hate that I lost you but you lost me
Why
Are you happy when I leave?
I still wonder why
Is your life better without me?
For you, I'd bleed
If you can only see
Why love is evil
Why love is evil
Why love is evil
Why love is evil
