		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll paint my mood in shades of blue 
Paint my soul to be with you 
I'll sketch your lips in shaded tones 
Draw your mouth to my own 

I'll draw your arms around my waist 
Then all doubt I shall erase 
I'll paint the rain that softly lands on your wind blown hair 

I'll trace a hand to wipe your tears 
A look to calm your fears 
A silhouette of dark and light 
While we hold each other, oh, so tight 

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart 
Swearing that we'll never part 
That's the color of my love 

I'll paint the truth 
Show how I feel 
Try to make you completely real 
I'll use a brush so light and fine 
To draw you close and make you mine 

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart 
Swearing that we'll never ever part 
That's the color of my love 

I'll draw the years all passing by 
So much to learn, so much to try 

And with this ring our lives will start 
Swearing that we'll never part 
I offer what you cannot buy 
Devoted love until we die, ooh, ooh
