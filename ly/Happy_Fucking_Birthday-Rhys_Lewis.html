		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Snap out of it, stop thinking 'bout yourself
Go to bed, get your head out of tomorrow
You'll be fine, you don't have to be
All the things you thought you'd be by twenty-nine
Get over it, are you really losing sleep
Over things that you miss
That you've never even had?
Oh, what a way to waste a night
What a way to waste a life

It's like losing the lottery and feeling sad
It's like craving the champagne that you drank too fast
It's like blowing the candles out and wishing
Your life was somewhere different
That you were still seventeen
Oh, happy, happy fucking birthday to me

Snap out of it, stop living in your head
Your regrets, they're only memories
They don't have to bring you down
So leave the house
Throw your mind out of the window for a while

Stop losing the lottery and feeling sad
And craving the champagne that you drank too fast
Stop blowing the candles out and wishing
Your life was somewhere different
That you were still seventeen
Oh, happy, happy fucking birthday to me

(Happy fucking birthday) Happy fucking birthday to me
(Happy fucking birthday)

(Happy fucking birthday) Snap out of it, get over it
You don't have to be
All the things you thought you'd be by twenty-nine
(Happy fucking birthday) Snap out of it, get over it
You don't have to be
All the things you thought you'd be by twenty-nine
(Happy fucking birthday) Snap out of it, get over it
You don't have to be
All the things you thought you'd be by twenty-nine
(Happy fucking birthday) Snap out of it, get over it
You don't have to be
All the things you thought you'd be by twenty-nine

(Happy fucking birthday) By twenty-nine
(Happy fucking birthday) Snap out of it, get over it, oh
Happy fucking birthday to me
