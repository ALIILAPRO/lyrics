		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you don't love me like that
I am stuck here standing in the rain
You said I don't need you like that
But I do, but I do

I'm telling that sun to come back
You feel me fading in the grave
Blue skies don't tease me like that
Like you do, like you do
I'm feeling like the world's about to change
When humming birds are singing in the rain
Dreaming, that I'm standing in the light
Do you love me?

Can you feel the sunshine? (you make it brighter, brighter)
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me
When that sun comes shining on me

Feels like the storm's holding back
Soon I'll be swimming in the dream
I walk, but I fall off the track
To the blue, to the blue
But I don't wanna look the other way
And I don't wanna wake up in the paining
Dreaming of that rainy summer day
Do you love me?

Can you feel the sunshine? (you make it brighter, brighter)
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me
When that sun comes shining on me

I said, can you feel the sunshine? (you make it brighter, brighter)
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me 
When that sun comes shining on me (you make it brighter, brighter)

Can you feel the sunshine? (you make it brighter, brighter)
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me 
When that sun comes shining on me (you make it brighter, brighter)

I said, can you feel the sunshine? (you make it brighter, brighter)
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me 
When that sun comes shining on me (you make it brighter, brighter)

Can you feel the sunshine? (you make it brighter, brighter)
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me 
When that sun comes shining on me (you make it brighter, brighter)

I said, can you feel the sunshine? (you make it brighter, brighter)
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me 
When that sun comes shining on me (you make it brighter, brighter)

I said, can you feel the sunshine? 
Make it brighter, make it brighter for me 
When that sun comes shining on me
