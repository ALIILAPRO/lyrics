		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living life, don't you cry
My life, pain is God
Many nights, painful thoughts occur
Yell at me, again I'm wong

In denial, I tried to be your friend
I tried to be a good boy
All I see, a hate deep inside
Startle me, someone save me

Now, these memories
Fill my heart
They bury me

All I wanna do (you are not my real mother)
Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her)
All I wanna do (you are not my real mother)
Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her)

All I wanna do (you are not my real mother)
Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her)
All I wanna do (you are not my real mother)
Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her)

Looking back, I was never ever right
You were my step-mom, who always wanted me out of your sight
I would come walking in, and I'd say "Hello"
But you'd slap me and you'd make some fucked up comment about my clothes

Then I tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head
Were with you with a knife up your ass 
Laying dead, so I pop some more 
Caps in your ass, now your son is not so fun
Motherfucking bitch, never try to play me

You made my life
Not so

All I wanna do
Is kill you
All I wanna do
Is kill you

All I wanna do (you are not my real mother)
Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her)
All I wanna do (you are not my real mother)
Is kill you (should I beat and stab and fuck her)

Wish 
You 
Were dead
Now

How
I know
How can I
Cry over
Someone I never loved?
So how can I
Cry over someone 
I never loved?
Never loved
Never loved

You ready you fucking middle guide?
Use the force, dude
I'm gonna use the force, here we go

Twist, twist
Twist, twist

Twist, twist
Twist, twist
