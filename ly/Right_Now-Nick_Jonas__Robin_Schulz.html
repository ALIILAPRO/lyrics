		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ey, yeah, yeah, yeah

You are my water, my sun, my movie stars
Your heart is all I need
It start when you come
I want to be where you are
Where you are (na, na)

Every time you go away, you're always tryna fight
How bad I want you (bad I want you), bad I want you
I could try to fill the space with someone else tonight
But I don't want to (I don't want to), I don't want to

Right now, you know I miss your body
So I won't kiss nobody until you come back home
And I swear, the next time that I hold you
I won't let you go nowhere
You'll never be alone, I'll never let you go

You lead, I follow, no sleep
That's what you said (that's what you said)
That's what you said (that's what you said)
And you should know
You leave, I'm hollow
I need you in my bed (I need you in my)
You in my bed (I need you in my)

Every time you go away, you're always tryna fight
How bad I want you (hey), bad I want you (bad I want you)
I could try to fill the space with someone else tonight
But I don't want to (but I don't want to), I don't want to (oh)

Right now, you know I miss your body
So I won't kiss nobody (won't kiss nobody, baby)
Until you come back home (oh)
And I swear, the next time that I hold you
I won't let you go nowhere (let go)
You'll never be alone (never be alone), I'll never let you go

Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, no
I will never let you go, no, no
Yeah, oh, no

Right now, you know I miss your body
So I won't kiss nobody until you come back home
I swear, the next time that I hold you
I won't let you go nowhere
You'll never be alone, oh!
Right now, you know I miss your body (I miss your body, baby)
So I won't kiss nobody (nobody), until you come back home (oh)
And I swear, the next time that I hold you (ooh)
I won't let you go nowhere (I won't let you go)
You'll never be alone (oh), I'll never let you go

Oh, never be alone, ooh, yeah
I'll be there, I'll never let you go
