		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I'm too busy
And that I'm never sober
Cuz I'm in the city
And I've been here too long
All my promises are empty
You ride just for the night
Girl we so toxic, it's what you like
Nobody else gon' do it right
How do you want it? Don't be shy
In the club checking the time
Move closer, get higher
Popping these bottles like 4th of July, okay
I feel like you might win a Grammy tonight I'm making you sing and you hitting them highs
I'll never change but for you, imma try again
For you imma slide again
Telling you I'll never lie again
I was too full of the pride, but
I never wanted our time to end
Let's go back how it was before
One more night in the 604
One more night in the 604
You say I'm too busy
And that I'm never sober
Cuz I'm in the city
And I've been here too long
All my promises are empty
If I come back what'll I find?
You moved on to the next guy
Baby I'm still on your mind
Baby I'm still on your mind
But we can't go back in time
