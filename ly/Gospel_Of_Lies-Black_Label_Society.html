		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in a world
Through eyes gone insane
Visions of truth get blurred
Without words to explain

A time that I once knew
So simple and so pure
Drawn and deceived
Becoming no more

Gospel of lies
Manipulation that never dies
Feed the starving mass
Digging a grave for the past

A time that I once knew
So simple and so pure
Drawn and deceived
Becoming no more

War that breeds
Conceived by death
Embrace the world
Through every breath
The dread of man
That cannot die
The fires of hate
Fall from the sky

Seasons that change
Destroy what's been forged and rearrange
Dawn of the insane
Keepers of the past
Blood of the slain

A time that I once knew
So simple and so pure
Drawn and deceived
Becoming no more
