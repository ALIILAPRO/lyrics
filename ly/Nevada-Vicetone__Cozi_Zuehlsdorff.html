		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been painting every fence I know
Every color bleeds into the same
'Cause before you go and walk away
Yeah, you better know where you're going

Hey yeah, hey yeah
You're a wanderer just like me
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Yeah, you better know where you're going

Yeah, you better know where you're going

I've been painting every fence I know

Yeah, you better know where you're going

Hey yeah, hey yeah
You're a wanderer just like me
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Yeah, you better know where you're going
(You're a wanderer just like me)
(Yeah, you better know where you're going)
