Bad things happen to good people
It's not fair, but with good comes evil
Look to God as I climb these steeples
And He says all men were created equal
Equal, equal-al-al we're all created equal
Bad things happen to good people
I know it's not fair
But with good comes evil
I look to God as I climb these steeples
And He says all men were created equal

Nobody's beatin' Father Time (Father Time)
Evil walks among thе people
It's not hard to find (Find)
We play thе game of life
And search for terms, when all the while
The only guarantee is that nobody
Makes it out alive
Faith in hand, we overlook (Overlook)
'Cause human nature's bad is good
(Bad is good) we try walk straight as we
Tightrope with the Holy Book
Readin' passages while judgin' others
Givin' dirty looks
We teeter-totter on the line
Of sinner and misunderstood (Misunderstood)
No one's perfect, we're exposed
We try to hide, but God knows
And water seeds we didn't plant
Then wonder why they don't grow
(Don't grow) fake friends, good foes
A world together, all alone an oxymoron
Seven billion people lost with one home

Bad things happen to good people
(Good people)
It's not fair, but with good comes evil
(Comes evil)
Look to God as I climb these steeples
(These steeples)
And He says all men were created equal
(Equal)
Equal, uh (Equal) , equal-al-al (Equal)
We're all created equal
(We're all created equal)
Bad things happen to good people
I know it's not fair
But with good comes evil
(With good comes evil)
I look to God as I climb these steeples
And He says all men were created equal
(He says all men were created equal)

Young girls gettin' trafficked (yeah)
People like the way you innocent
While these little kids gettin' cancer
(yeah) god, tell me, what's the benefit?
He reminded me that He's still good
Got a perfect plan when it's all bad
Even if you never really understand
We can still hit our knees and ask Dad
Whole world full of evil (Evil)
Should we take it out? Should we put it down?
But He's patient with His lil' people
(yeah) while the dark powers keep
On runnin' 'round
Come a time when He bring peace
When He bring rest, when He bring love
(Bring love) gotta hope in the meantime
That He mean well and He need somethin'
When the good people die young
(When the good people die young)
And the bad happens to the good folks
That the Kingdom is still comin'
In Christ, that's where I gotta put hope
You ain't gotta see it 'same as I see it
But you gotta see it for yourself (yeah)
If it ain't of God, can it be of good?
I don't know at all, tryna help, yeah (Woo)

Bad things happen to good people
(Good people)
It's not fair, but with good comes evil
(Comes evil)
Look to God as I climb these steeples
(These steeples)
And He says all men were created equal
(Equal)
Equal, uh (Equal) , equal-al-al (Equal)
We're all created equal
(We're all created equal)
Bad things happen to good people
I know it's not fair
But with good comes evil
(With good comes evil)
I look to God as I climb these steeples
And He says all men were created equal
