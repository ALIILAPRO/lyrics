		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I've been lookin' real hard 
And I'm tryin' to find a job 
But it just keeps gettin' tougher every day 
But I got to do my part 'cause I know in my heart 
I got to please my sweet baby, yeah 

Well, I ain't superstitious 
And I don't get suspicious 
But my woman is a friend of mine 
And I know that it's true that all the things that I do 
Will come back to me in my sweet time 

So keep on rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 

I went from Phoenix, Arizona 
All the way to Tacoma 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, LA
Northern California where the girls are warm 
So I could be with my sweet baby, yeah 

Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Baby, baby, baby 
Keep on rock'n 
Rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n 
Rock'n me, baby 

Woo-ooh-ooh, yeah

Don't get suspicious 
Now don't be suspicious 
Babe, you know you are a friend of mine 
And you know that it's true 
That all the things that I do 
Are gonna come back to you in your sweet time 

I went from Phoenix, Arizona 
All the way to Tacoma 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, LA
Northern California where the girls are warm 
So I could hear my sweet baby say 

Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me, rock'n me, rock'n 
Baby, baby, baby 
Keep on a rock'n me' baby 
Keep on a rock'n me' baby 
Keep on a rock'n me' baby
