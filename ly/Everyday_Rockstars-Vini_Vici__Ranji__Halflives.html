		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out in the night, for too long
I don't even feel the cold, I'm better off alone
Let me rewind
Just one song
And cover up your bullshit with the scent of my cologne

Inside my soul there's a riot
Inside my soul there's a riot
Inside my soul there's a riot
Inside my soul there's a riot
Outside the city's so quiet
Outside the city's so quiet
Outside the city's so quiet
Outside the city's so quiet
Inside my soul there's a riot
Poisoning my veins
I wish I could be someone else and take a break
Outside the city's so quiet
But I'm a hurricane
Tonight as I'm dancing
I wish, I wish

I wish I was a rockstar
Living in L.A.
Driving in my fast car, far away (far away)
Monday in a dive bar
Tuesday with my bae
I wish I was a rockstar
Right away

I wish I
I wish I was a rockstar
Living in L.A.
Driving in my fast car, far away
Monday in a dive bar
Tuesday with my bae
I wish I was a rockstar
Right away
Everyday

I wish I was a rockstar
I wish I was a rockstar
I wish I was a rockstar
I wish I was a rockstar
I wish I was a rockstar
Everyday

Out in the night, for too long
I don't even feel the cold, I'm better off alone
Let me rewind
Just one song
And cover up your bullshit with the scent of my cologne

Inside my soul there's a riot
Poisoning my veins
I wish I could be someone else and take a break
Outside the city's so quiet
But I'm a hurricane
Tonight as I'm dancing
I wish, I wish

I wish I was a rockstar
Living in L.A.
Driving in my fast car, far away
Monday in a dive bar
Tuesday with my bae
I wish I was a rockstar
Right away
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday

I wish I was a rockstar

I wish I was a rockstar

I wish I was a rockstar

I wish I was a rockstar
I wish I was a rockstar
I wish I was a rockstar
Everyday
