		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleep deprivation's got me at my heels
This year taught me how it feels to be
Lost and ambitious
I've been on a mission
I won't stop till I'm done
I toss and turn almost every night
I pray to God I'm doing right
By all my family's wishes
Lord knows I miss them
Their love outshines the sun
So when I break down I list off the reasons
I'm here and I'm still breathing oh
I'm hanging on
Try to break ground, make way for tomorrow
I'll find a way through the sorrow ah
One day at a time
I see the world outside my door
Constant reminder there's so much more
Than what I'm seeing
That thought is freeing
But shakes me to the core
Self doubt, settle down, get back
It's bad when it hits me in my heart like that
I know I'm exactly where I need to be
Zoom out for some clarity
So when I break down I list off the reasons
I'm here and I'm still breathing oh
I'm hanging on
Try to break ground, make way for tomorrow
I'll find a way through the sorrow ah
One day at a time
One day at a time
One day at a time
