		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless, you survive
They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones, they'll ride into smoke when the fire is fierce
No, pick yourself up, 'cause

Legends never die
When the world is calling you (world is calling you)
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
The scars collected all their lives (lives)
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat (oh-oh)
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream (oh)
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause

Legends never die
When the world is calling you (world is calling you)
Can you hear them screamin' out your name? 
(Can you hear them screamin' out your name?) legends never die
They become a part of you (become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die

When the world is callin' out your name (name)
Beggin' you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up, 'cause

Legends never die
When the world is calling you (world is calling you)
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
(Can you hear them screamin' out your name?) legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
