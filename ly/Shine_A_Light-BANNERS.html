		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Light will lead the way, will set you free
'Cause I'm only looking for a little peace
And when the night falls
Oh, call on me
Just don't forget to show me some mercy
Ooh, say you're mine
Ooh, take me higher

(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
'Cause I was lost at sea
While the waves were dragging me underneath
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me

Searching for some grace I'll tell you now
If I could hear your voice
How sweet the sound
Ooh, say you're mine
Ooh, take me higher

(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
'Cause I was lost at sea
While the waves were dragging me underneath
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me

(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
'Cause I was lost at sea
While the waves were dragging me underneath
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
