		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try again
I study the pattern
I see the triggers
But I can't shake 'em loose

And all of my anger
You take on the chin
And I get you down
I get you down
I get you down

I never fought back
Just stood there humiliated
From the schoolyard to home
On the streets that we roam
And now I get you down

I catch myself in the mirror
See a pathetic little boy
Who's come to get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Oh

I watch you sleep
With eyes of contempt
Those eyes were meant for myself
But tonight, tonight I'm gonna get you down

I catch myself in the mirror
See a pathetic little boy
Who's come to get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Get you down
Oh
Oh
Oh
