		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is real, real love
Yeah-yeah

You're the light
Hold me tight
I never felt so right
My desire
I need you every night

And everytime you touch me, I get this feeling
You know that you're the one that keeps me breathing
Nothing's gonna take me away from you
Take me away from you

This is real, real love
Just the way I'm feeling
Real, real love
Don't you ever leave me
Real, real love
You're the one I need
Real, real love
Yeah-yeah

This is real, real love
Just the way I'm feeling
Real, real love
Don't you ever leave me
Real, real love
You're the one I need
Real, real love
Yeah-yeah

I never wanna lose you
I'll do anything you want me to
I will always be there for you
For you

And everytime you touch me, I get this feeling
You know that you're the one that keeps me breathing
Nothing's gonna take me away from you
Take me away from you

This is real, real love
Just the way I'm feeling
Real, real love
Don't you ever leave me
Real, real love
You're the one I need
Real, real love
Yeah-yeah

This is real, real love
Just the way I'm feeling
Real, real love
Don't you ever leave me
Real, real love
You're the one I need
Real, real love
Yeah-yeah
This is real, real love
