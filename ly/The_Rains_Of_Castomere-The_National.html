		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "And who are you?" The proud Lord said
"That I must bow so low"
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
A lion still has claws
Mine are long and sharp, my lord
As long and sharp as yours

And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear

"And who are you?" The proud Lord said
"That I must bow so low"
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know

And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear

And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear

(And so he spoke) and so he spoke
(That Lord of Castamere) Lord of Castamere
(But now the rains) weep o'er his hall
(And not a soul to hear)
And not a soul to hear
