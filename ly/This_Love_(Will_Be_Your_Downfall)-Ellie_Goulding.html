		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who are we to be emotional
Who are we to play with hearts
And throw away it all
Who are we to turn each others heads
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds
I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
I don't think you know me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
I'm feeling down about this love

Who are you to make me feel so good
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood
Oh who am I to say I'm always yours
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores
Oh I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark
Oh I don't think you warned me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

This love is not what you want
This heart will never be yours
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
