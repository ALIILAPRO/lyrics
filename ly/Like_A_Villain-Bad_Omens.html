		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look into my face, then look again
We are not the same, we're different
To tell your tales and fables 
You couldn't wait

You need a new clean slate without the dents
A place to put your pain, your consequence
When you look into the mirror
Are you even there?

I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
It's hard enough being alone with myself
I don't know how long I'll be holding on
I know you tried your hardest I know that you meant well
But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
I don't know how long I'll be holding on

So write a brand new page, then write again
I know your act is staged, yet you pretend
All while you're turning tables
With missing legs

I think you've overstayed your welcome in
So go the fuck away, don't come again
I'll see your face in the fire 
And burn it out

I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
It's hard enough being alone with myself
I don't know how long I'll be holding on
I know you tried your hardest I know that you meant well
But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
I don't know how long I'll be holding on

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Like a villain, I couldn't be (ohh)
I didn't need it, it needed me (ohh)
Like a villain, I couldn't be (ohh)
I didn't need it, it needed me (ohh)

I didn't need it, it needed me

I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
It's hard enough being alone with myself
I don't know how long I'll be holding on
I know you tried your hardest I know that you meant well
But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
I don't know how long I'll be holding on

I didn't need it, it needed me
