		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate making changes
Can't anticipate ‘em
Take the map I know 
Etch it down in stone 
‘Cause not knowing makes me anxious

I tend to let my apprehension get the best of me
I get attached, can't help but latch on to what I thought it'd be 

I don't have a blueprint 
When my walls are falling down 
I am only human
Making the best of breaking ground
Got a solid foundation
With no expectation 
I don't have a blueprint
But I'm gonna do it, do it

I put up my fences
But they leave me defenseless
Can't throw my hands up
‘Cause I care too much
But no plans can prevent this

I tend to let my apprehension get the best of me
I get attached, can't help but latch on to what I thought it'd be 

I don't have a blueprint 
When my walls are falling down 
I am only human
Making the best of breaking ground
Got a solid foundation
With no expectation 
I don't have a blueprint
But I'm gonna do it, do it

Don't need, don't need, don't need a blueprint
Imma do it
Don't need, don't need, don't need a blueprint
Imma do it
Don't need, don't need, don't need a blueprint
Imma do it
Don't need, don't need, don't need a blueprint
Imma do it

I don't have a blueprint 
When my walls are falling down 
I am only human
Making the best of breaking ground
Got a solid foundation
With no expectation 
I don't have a blueprint
But I'm gonna do it, do it
