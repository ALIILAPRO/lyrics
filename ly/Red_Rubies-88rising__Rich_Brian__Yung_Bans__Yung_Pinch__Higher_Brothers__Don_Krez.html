		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya, aye, aye
Red rubies and they bleed
Ah, pop some percs, I might OD
Aye, yuh, aye

Ya, aye, red rubies and they bleed
Ya, aye, huh, Perkies make me sleep
Aye, ya, pop ten Percs, I might OD
Tryna fight away the demons

I'm tryna fight em' away
I mix the Sprite with the lean
That nigga ride with it
That nigga ride with the thing
That nigga ride with the cling
That nigga ride with that .30
Choppa it doin' so dirty
Freaky lil' bitch, she a squirter
Fuck the lil' hoe and I work her
They give me head like a turtle
Dive in the pussy, it's surfing
All of the Addies and Perkies
I sip the lean with no mercy
I am so high I'm on Mercury
Slim in the cut and he lurkin'

Ya, aye, red rubies and they bleed
Ya, aye, huh, Perkies make me sleep
Aye, ya, pop ten Percs, I might OD
Tryna fight away the demons

Rubies dancin' to help me take yo' bitch
But you still hit me up but I'd rather choose to ignore you
What's the need for college at this point, if we gon' be honest
Fuckin' all night to stay up, she can't afford coffee
(Aye) Pussy rain, I could see the future change (yea)
I'm alone, she can see I'm not the same (nah)
She want me to wait for her, then I said, "No thanks"
We really in the jungle 'cause I'm only seein' snakes (nah, yea)
Don't know who to trust, I need a break (need a break)
I can feel my soul runnin' away (run away, yeah)
Hope the rubies gon' brighten my day (aye)
Pray to God that I won't ever fade

Ya, aye, red rubies and they bleed
Ya, aye, huh, Perkies make me sleep
Aye, ya, pop ten Percs, I might OD
Tryna fight away the demons

Red ruby Jell-O on my strawberry
I eat a lot, make me stomach ache
She wit me oh, and she on my dick
I'm feeling lust to suck my dick 
Red like a block
Haters suck
Her pussy so wet, she want me to stay
'Cause she know what's up
She kinda cute
She dreamin' Chanel
I'm making her drip
Y'all haters be drooling, you look like a joke
Be who you wanna be
Working, never sleep
She don't even speak Chinese
But she can still look at me

Ya, aye, red rubies and they bleed
Ya, aye, huh, Perkies make me sleep
Aye, ya, pop ten Percs, I might OD
Tryna fight away the demons

Is this real or am I dreamin'?
I need to know now, you cut me deep
I can't stop bleedin'
I've been on the deep end
Fighting all these demons
Don't think you can help me
But that's just what they tell me
Look, I've been on my own
Ever since a youngin'
Supposed to be nobody's son
Just living like, "Fuck it"
Count up all these hundreds
Stack bands in my pocket
Took off like a rocket
No way that you can stop it
Look, they don't want to see us win
They think that shit's obnoxious
(Yeah, they think that shit's obnoxious)
But I ain't got no option
(But, I ain't got no option)
But I ain't got no option
(I ain't got no option)
We ain't go no option, yeah

Yeah they bad, yeah
I just want to go to sleep, yeah yeah
Oh no not me, yeah yeah
