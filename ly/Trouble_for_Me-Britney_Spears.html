		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black jack, whiskey straight
Every day changes your life
You got the look that you know
You're real bad, yeah, baby, you're right

Everybody loves you
Baby, you're the king of the night
And I'm the only one making sure to stay
Out of your sight

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you, burnin' disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me

Aw aw aw aw
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Aw aw aw aw
Trouble for me

Sweet talk, here we go
Tell me something incredible
You drive me crazy every time
That I smell your cigarettes and cologne

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you, burnin' disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me

Aw aw aw aw
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Aw aw aw aw
Trouble for me

Kiss, kiss, tip your glass
I'll do whatever you ask for
But if you want my love
You can only find it on the dance floor

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you, burnin' disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me

Aw aw aw aw
Aw aw aw aw, yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me, aw aw aw aw
Aw aw aw aw, yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me, aw aw aw aw
Aw aw aw aw, yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me, aw aw aw aw

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it
