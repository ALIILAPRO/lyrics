		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They laugh at me, these fellows, just because I am small
They laugh at me because I'm not a hundred feet tall
I tell 'em there's a lot to learn down here on the ground
The world is big but lil' people turn it around
A worm can roll a stone
A bee can sting a bear
A fly can fly around Versailles 'cos flies don't care
A sparrow in a hut, can make a happy home
A flea can bite the bottom of the pope in Rome

Goliath was a bruiser who was as tall as the sky
But David threw a rock, and gave him one in the eye
I never read the Bible but I know that it's true
It only goes to show what little people can do

A worm can roll a stone
A bee can sting a bear
A fly can fly around Versailles 'cause flies don't care
A sparrow in a hut, can make a happy home
A flea can bite the bottom of the pope in Rome

So listen here, professor with your head in the cloud
It's often kinda useful to get lost in a crowd
So keep your universities I don't give a damn
For better or for worse it is the way that I am
Be careful as you go
'Cause little people grow
And little people know
When little people fight
We may look easy pickings but we got some bite!
So never kick a dog
Because it's just a pup
You'd better run for cover when the pup grows up
And we'll fight like twenty armies and we won't give up

A worm can roll a stone
A bee can sting a bear
A fly can fly around Versailles 'cause flies don't care
A sparrow in a hut, can make a happy home
A flea can bite the bottom of the pope in Rome
A flea can bite the bottom of the pope in Rome
