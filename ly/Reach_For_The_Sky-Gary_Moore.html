		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it seems
That you've had more than enough.
As your life is going nowhere,
And you feel like giving up.
Sometimes you know
That you can't take anymore.
When things are getting harder
Than they've ever been before.

Don't lose your heart when things go wrong.
You know what to do now.
Just turn your back and carry on, come on.

Reach for the sky.
Come out with your hands up.
Reach for the sky.
Come out with your hands up.

Sometimes it seems
Like you've really lost your way.
When you're mind is full of doubt,
You've got nothing left to say.
You're going 'round in circles
Like a man who's running blind.
But the world must keep on turning,
And it's leaving you behind.

Don't lose your heart when things go wrong.
You know what to do now.
You've got the strength to carry on, come on.

Reach for the sky.
Come out with your hands up.
Reach for the sky.
Come out with your hands up.

Reach for the sky.
Reach for the sky.
Reach for the it.

Don't lose your heart when things go wrong.
You know what to do now.
You've got the strength to carry on, come on.

Reach for the sky.
Come out with your hands up.
Reach for the sky.
Come out with your hands up.

Reach for the sky.
Come out with your hands up.
Reach for the sky.
Come out with your
Hands up, hands up, hands up.

Reach for the sky.
Reach for the sky.
Reach for the sky.
Reach for the sky.
