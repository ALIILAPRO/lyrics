		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh
Yo, turn my voice up
Right here?

Why I treat my brother like he ain't my only brother?
Why I gotta treat my manager like I'm above her?
Why I gotta get so intimate with all my lovers?
Why I gotta cheat and make her question if I love her?
Why am I so flawed?
Why am I so skeptical of God?
Why do I pretend like I didn't see it when I saw it?
Why am I so bold to double back when I've been caught?
Why am I not the superhero I thought
Or as perfect as these diamonds I bought?
When did I start texting so dry?
When did I become this type of a guy?
When did the texts you send me stop getting replies?
What if things don't turn out how I planned 'em?
I wanna be more than just a random
What if all these people in my life go Danny Phantom?
I'm sick of down to earth I wanna throw tantrums
I'm sick of these lil' raps, I wanna make anthems
You feel me?
It's either you or it's my schedule, y'all both can't be demanding
I keep you under wraps, you told your mom it's for my branding
I hope she's understanding
What if I don't meet the expectations?
What if I don't reach my destination?
What if I don't live up to the hype despite all my dedication?
Why you think I'm scared to take vacations?
What am I supposed to do?
Assume her accusations aren't true because I'm close to you?
Who should I believe?
Is it her? Just 'cause it happens so commonly?
The masses never heard your boy rapping so honestly
What makes you think that I'd rather have backpackers applauding me?
Why do I feel I need approval from all my skeptics
When I fill arenas up with a passionate following
When that's actually all I need?
But what if they stop caring 'bout me?
What if they stop swearing by me?
What if they stop riding for me
How they used to do before I was in front of everybody
What if they went and found some new kid that got a air about him
How many people in this town follow my whereabouts and
What would I say with a barrel aimed at me staring down it?
I rep the state but do they care bout me in Barren County?
