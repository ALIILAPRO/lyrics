		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye
Pull up, pull up on me
Aye
Might just recline the seat when I want it
Give you a set of keys 'cause you own it

Pull up, pull up on me
Aye
No second-guessing, checking the rearview
Ain't looking back unless it's right at you

Make me wanna stay through the night
I will never leave from by your side
Don't you know you got a ride or die?
Mm-mm-mm

Even when I miss you on the road
You should know I'm always in control
'Cause the one thing I already know
No, I don't feel the need to test drive nothing

Test drive nothing
Baby, I'm sold on you
So I don't ever gotta test drive nothing (oh, oh, oh)
Test drive nothing (my baby)
It's in the way you do it, I don't ever gotta, baby

I drop the top on that body
That's candy paint on my body
I'm thinking 'bout the way I feel on you

If you want, say, "I do" (I do)
I'll floor it (I'll floor it)
Just say the word, you know I'm yours (I'm yours)
Just drop a pin and don't reverse (oh)

Make me wanna stay through the night (ooh)
I will never leave from by your side (leave from by your side)
Don't you know you got a ride or die?
Mm-mm-mm

Even when I miss you on the road
You should know I'm always in control
'Cause the one thing I already know

No, I don't feel the need to test drive nothing (no, babe)
Test drive nothing
Baby, I'm sold on you
So I don't ever gotta test drive nothing
Test drive nothing
It's in the way you do it, I don't ever gotta
