		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I am
Torn into a thousand shapes and folds
Torn into a thousand ways, I know (I know)
Fornicate inside your broken arms
Before I throw a smile your way, no more

I can't tell
If all my answers correlate at all
I'm telling you a thousand things, I know

I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
Make it out alive

I'm on trial
I'm not so good at hiding loathsome truths
You see it on my face when I turn blue
So punish me, I'm hanging on your noose
So pull me up so I can breathe with you

I know
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
Make it out alive

Ah, ah, ah, ah
