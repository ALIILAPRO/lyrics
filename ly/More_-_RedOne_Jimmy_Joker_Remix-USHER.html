		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Watch me as I dance in up the spotlight
Listen to all the people screaming I'm all more, more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
That's when under pressure with seconds left I show up

If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Get out both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
But I'm in the area, if you more (and) more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop then just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quittin' don't believe in that

Know y'all bin patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that luster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
That's when under pressure with seconds left I show up

If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you, I, I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you, I, I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more
