		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing 
Now a new sun is rising 
I count my blessings 
That I'm safe when I'm resting 
Furniture in my nesting 
But by force I'm suggesting 
Ya count your blessings 

I've got love and assurance 
I've got new health insurance 
And I've got strength and endurance 
So I count my blessings 

And give thanks to the master 
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after 
Better count your blessings 

'Cause yo this year, can't wait 'til it gets here 
7-21-09 my first son will shine 
And it's amazing I'm about to be raisin' 
Another main man and like his dad they'll praise him 
And some will hate him, just cause we buildin' a nation 
Like Bob did with Damian 
The world will embrace him, girls'll chase him 
Foresee, they will not break him 
And when I'm not around, you look for God and thank him 

And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for 
And so I'll always put my best forth 
And count my blessings 

And they'll be no need for tissues 
'Cause there will be no further issues 
If you got someone who miss you
Man, count your blessings

I've got love and assurance 
And I've got new health insurance 
And I've got strength and endurance 
So I count my blessings 

And give thanks to the master 
That through all the disaster 
We're still here together after 
Better count your blessings 

You wishin' you were sittin' in the top position 
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it 
Without the Hermes, you'd have a hurtin' 
You knew that you was destined for greatness, for certain 
You see the over-zealous, they be thirstin', caught up in emotion 
You keepin' your composure like Gershwin 
Songs by Earth Wind keep you in the zone, writing verses 
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose 

We've got preschool and daycare 
We've got pension and welfare 
And though not all will play the game fair 
Still I count my blessings 

I've joy in abundance 
I've got life full of substance 
I've got meetings and functions 
So I count my blessings 

I've got something to live for 
I've got surplus to give more 
And we're all welcome through His door 
So I count my blessings 

And give thanks to the master 
That through all the disaster 
We're still here together after 
So I count my blessings 

I think you lookin' too hard for it
With the double R under your garage door 
Appreciate the things you work hard for 
Hey, count your blessings 
Count your blessings 
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all 
You got the means to reach the level I'm on 
You should know there's only one Nas y'all 
But count your blessings, count your blessings 

And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing 
Now a new sun is rising 
I count my blessings 
That I'm safe when I'm resting 
Furniture in my nesting 
Not by force I'm suggesting 
Ya count your blessings 

I've got love and assurance 
I've got new health insurance 
And I've got strength and endurance 
So I count my blessings 

And give thanks to the master 
That through all the disaster 
We're still here together after 
Better count your blessings
