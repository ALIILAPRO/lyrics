		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up in my boots this mornin'
Fell asleep in my boots last night
Had a feeling that I'd run out of warnings
Girl, I couldn't have been more right

My only suitcase
It's by the front door
That look on your face
Says you don't want me no more
There's no use in talkin'
This time you mean it
You're sendin' me walkin'
Well, what a convenience

'Cause, I woke up in my boots this mornin'
Fell asleep in my boots last night
Had a feeling that I'd run out of warnings
Girl, I couldn't have been more right

And I knew I wouldn't have to take the time
Puttin' 'em back on when I'm sober
Yeah, I knew you'd be pissed off over me
And I'd just be hungover
Girl, I knew I'd open my eyes
In a house fit for a dog
Knew I'd need 'em come the daylight
So I didn't even take 'em off, naw

I woke up in my boots this mornin'

Yeah, we were past the point of fightin'
There'd be a curb you'd kick me to
I made it easy on me girl
But I made it easier on you
Can't hide the truth yeah
We both knew that it was comin'
So, I woke up in my boots this mornin'

I woke up in my boots this mornin'

I woke up in my boots this mornin'
'Cause I went out and got drunk last night
Had a feeling that I'd run out of warnings
So I said, "What the hell," and kissed us goodbye

And I knew I wouldn't have to take the time
Puttin' 'em back on when I'm sober
Yeah, I knew you'd be pissed off over me
And I'd just be hungover
Girl, I knew I'd open my eyes
In a house fit for a dog
Knew I'd need 'em come the daylight
So I didn't even take 'em off, no
No, I didn't even take 'em off, yeah

I woke up in my boots this mornin'
Yeah
I woke up in my boots this mornin'
