		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am sleepless for a weekend
So I start to say goodbye
Say goodbye to all that we had
Say goodbye to what we lost

Oh, if we don't talk
We're not enough
And the storm slowly arise
When the light turns
And the cold times arise

And we were running out, through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down, and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

Cold times arise
And the cold times arise

It is hard to let it all go
Let the past just disappear
Try to untie from an old life
But it always drags me down

Oh, if we don't talk
We're not enough
And the storm slowly arise
When the light turns
And the cold times arise

And we were running out, through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down, and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

And we were running out, through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down, and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

And we were running out, through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down, and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

Cold times arise
And the cold times arise
