		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm thinking too much again
I can't sleep it's 4am
I got to be in somewhere tomorrow
I don't wanna go out tomorrow

I'm thinking too much again
How my life will end?
I have to live tomorrow
I don't wanna live tomorrow

I'm thinking too much again
I can't sleep it's 4am
I got to be in somewhere tomorrow
I don't wanna go out tomorrow

Fuck my thoughts
I think too much
I think too much

Fuck my thoughts
I think too much
I think too much
