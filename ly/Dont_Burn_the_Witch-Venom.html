		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The witches brew a pot of hate
With lizard, bat and man
With a smile they laugh their spells
And stir with wretched hand
Calling demons Baphomet and Mephistopheles
The tattered figures cackle
As their mortal victims bleed

Don't burn the witch
The ways of Hell aren't wrong
Don't burn the witch
Let them brew their song

The witches of the blackened arts
Are cunning, cruel and mean
Persecuted by religion god the man unseen
Bestial malevolence
Is chartered in their bones
Leave the unreal house of God
Burn in hell at home

Don't burn the witch
The ways of Hell aren't wrong
Don't burn the witch
Let them brew their song

Eye of lizard, wing of bat testicle of man
Tongue of eagle, brain of rat
Jesus Christ's left hand

The witches make the voodoo doll
A toy taboo in heaven
They dance around the pentagram
In search of rape by Satan
Leave the hearts and blood of men
In cauldrons laced in sin
Add the arsenic hemlock pus
Triumph takes the wings

Don't burn the witch
The ways of Hell aren't wrong
Don't burn the witch
Let them brew their song
