		  Watch out, here I come
Is there any way you can help me out?
I'm talking right here, watch me jump
I get a little closer when I've had enough
I'm falling

Something else
I'll tell you
Something else
I'd help you
Something more than that
But it's still not anything
So here we go again

Watch out, here I come
Is there any way you can help me out?
I'm talking right here, watch me jump
I get a little closer when I've had enough
I'm falling

Something else
I'll tell you
Something else
I'd help you
Something more than that
But it's still not anything

So here we go again

Watch out, here I come
Is there any way you can help me out?
I'm talking right here, watch me jump
I get a little closer when I've had enough
I'm falling

Something else
I'll tell you
Something else
I'd help you
Something more than that
But it's still not anything
So here we go again

Watch out, here I come
Is there any way you can help me out?
I'm talking right here, watch me jump
I get a little closer when I've had enough
I'm falling
