		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  2am I'm in bed touching myself to sleep
Smoke a roll, comatose
Why am I such a creep?

Thinking of youI can't breathe
Come back, won't you
Put me at ease

I got your on touch the back of my mind
No don't stop now, want it one more time

The way you put me out
I'm going under
Can you keep up with mein overdrive
The way you do it to me, motherfucker
I am only in it for the crash dive

Heavy dose, to the bone
Got me screamin inside
In my head, keep me fed
You could be my demise

Waiting for you
I won't learn
Only like it
When it hurts

I got your on touch the back of my mind
No don't stop now, want it one more time

3am you're in bed touching yourself to sleep
All alone, and I know
That you're thinking of me

Waiting for youI can't learn
Come back, won't you
Make it hurt
