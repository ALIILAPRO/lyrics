		  Sent a text last night
But you still haven't replied
Best to forget 'cause you 
Don't invest the time

Get out of my mind
Get out

You're messing with my head
'Cause I wait for you
Maybe I've misread all the things you do
Looking for a reason to stay
Why can't I walk away
Walk away, away from you?

Try to decide, could you 
Say where this is going? I notice
Every time I make up my mind
You find a way to get back into my life

Get out of my life (get out of my life)
Get out

You're messing with my head
'Cause I wait for you
Maybe I've misread all the things you do
Looking for a reason to stay
Why can't I walk away?
Walk away, away from you?

Ahh, ahh
Ahh (away from you)
Ahh
Why can't I walk away
Walk away, away from you?

It's something I want
But if you don't feel the same way then tell me
'Cause it's nothing I want
If I'm alone in this

You're messing with my head
'Cause I wait for you
Maybe I've misread all the things you do
Looking for a reason to stay
Why can't I walk away?
Walk away, away from you?

Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ah (away from you)
Ahh (ohh, oh)
Why can't I walk away
Walk away, away from you?
