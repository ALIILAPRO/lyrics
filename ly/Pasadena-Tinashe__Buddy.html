		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two
One, two, three, hey

Feelin' right, feelin' right, feelin' right
Livin' life, it's the life (hey, hey, hey)
Feelin' free, feelin' free, feelin' right
It's a vibe, feelin' right (hey, hey, hey)

The summer's comin' 'round the corner
And now I'm feelin' like I don't even know ya
I'm never leaving California
Now more than ever life is all what you make it
I got a vision of a perfect night
But every day I end up goin' through the motions
I wasn't build for the simple life
In Pasadena singin', "doo, doo-doo-doo-doo"

Feelin' right, feelin' right, feelin' right
Livin' life, it's the life (hey, hey, hey)
Feelin' free, feelin' free, feelin' right
It's a vibe, feelin' right (hey, hey, hey)

Up in the penthouse you see to the ocean
How did we get here? We don't even know (feelin' so free)
Hands in the wind, racin' out to the coast (feelin' so high)
Feelin' free, don't get better than this (ay, ay)

Closin' the curtain on the poolside cabana (smokin' on weed)
Mind my surroundin', get a room if you like (gettin' so high)
We got faded, then I flew to Miami (Miami)
I think I lost my Visa
Never been the type that wanna be right, I wanna live life (life, ooh)
Some say I'm psycho but this shit here go in cycles (cycles)
Tell all my rivals, "Save that drama for your momma" (ooh)
Smokin' ganja with my partners
Seen a bad one in the lobby, had to stop
She want sex so good it make a tear fall (tear fall, ooh-ooh)
prancin' around in that lil' leotard (in that lil' leotard)
When you're not around I go through withdrawals (withdrawals)
Withdrawals without drugs, don't matter, darling, I take it all, shit

Lately, I've been feelin' restless (restless)
I try my best just to ignore all the nonsense
If only I can manifest it (manifest)
My momma told me, "Life is yours for the takin'"
We've been workin' way too hard, gotta live a little more
Gotta put my family on, daddy don't need no more jobs
Oh, it's been a real good ride
In Pasadena talking shit since 'bout '02

Feelin' right, feelin' right, feelin' right
Livin' life, it's the life (hey, hey, hey)
Feelin' free, feelin' free, feelin' right
It's a vibe, feelin' right (hey, hey, hey)

Up in the penthouse you see to the ocean
How did we get here? We don't even know (feelin' so free)
Hands in the wind, racin' out to the coast (feelin' so high)
Feelin' free, don't get better than this (ay, ay)

Feelin' so free
Feelin' so high

Up in the penthouse you see to the ocean
How did we get here? We don't even know (feelin' so free)
Hands in the wind, racin' out to the coast (feelin' so high)
Feelin' free, don't get better than this
