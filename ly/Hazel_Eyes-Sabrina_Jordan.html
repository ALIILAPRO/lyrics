		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue as the wings of a heron in the night
Like the rising of the tides on the shores of Isle Skye
They gleam evergreen, winds 'a whistling in the pines
Like a castle-crawling vine, like the grassy Glen of Lyon
And rich as the mud after rain upon the ground
They're a whisky hue of brown, braided river running wild
I fell astray, but in you, I have found
That I am ever bound to your hazel eyes
Deep as the sea where the ocean meets the shore
Where I met them once before, on the emerald Cliffs of Moher
Bright as the light setting fire to the north
Rising high beyond the morn, laying shadows on the floor
Long is the day when the moon obscures the sun
'Tis the darkness they become, till the dawn upon the fjord
I fell astray, but I am bone & blood
And I am bound by love to your hazel eyes
I fell astray, but in you, I have found
That I am ever bound to your hazel eyes
