		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went to die in a seaside hotel
Lanes of memory paved by sweet frozen moments

Deathbed memories of home
Never let me go

Every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me

You are the moon pulling my black waters
You are the land in my dark closet
Stay by my side until it goes dark forever
When silent the silence comes closer

Deathbed memories of home
Never let me go

Within every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me

Every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
(Resting in a dream) calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe

Every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
(Resting in a dream) calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me oh, yeah

Resting in a dream
Within every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe

Within every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me

Within every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe

Within every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me

Within every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe

Within every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me
