		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did we both fall in love
Before we were ready?
Or did we both give up before we were steady?
I don't know, I don't know, all I know
Is that now I'm alone
Were we both too scared
Or were we well-prepared?
For the future and all the
Mistakes that it bears
I don't know, I don't know, all I know
Is that now I'm alone

Yeah, these are questions in my head
Answers I won't get thoughts I nevеr said
That I kinda wish I did

I guess sometimes you find thе one
But the timing's off, the place is wrong
Maybe we would be closer
If we were a couple years older
I guess sometimes you fall in love
Then one day feels like you wake up
And everything's over without any closure

Did we both think that this was
The best that we found?
Or were we too afraid to have no one around?
I don't know, I don't know, all I know
Is that now I'm alone
Did we hope on a star a bit too far?
Was the distance between too
Great for our hearts?
I don't know, I don't know, all I know
Is that now I'm alone

Yeah, these are questions in my head
Answers I won't get thoughts I never said
That I kinda wish I did

I guess sometimes you find the one
But the timing's off, the place is wrong
Maybe we would be closer
If we were a couple years older
I guess sometimes you fall in love
Then one day feels like you wake up
And everything's over without any closure
