		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you broke my heart in two
You know exactly what you did to me
I've have it up to here with you
No, I don't wanna be a seat at your pity party

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' your mouth 
Just like a track star
Telling all of your friends that it's been so hard
When you're the one who said we were done
Said, you fell out of love
Boy, you must think that I'm dumb, oh

You can call me a psycho
You can call me a liar
You can call me an arsonist
I should set you on fire
You can call me a mess
And say what you like
You can call me whatever you want
But don't call me tonight
No, don't call me tonight

1-800-boy-just-stop (just stop)
Baby, that's the number you should really be dialing
'Cause you know I won't pick up (pick up)
And listen to you tell me that you miss me while you're crying

'Cause you've been runnin' 'round, runnin' your mouth 
Just like a track star
Telling all of your friends that it was my fault
When you're the one who said you were done
Said, you fell out of love
Guess you're fresh out of luck

You can call me a psycho
You can call me a liar
You can call me an arsonist
I should set you on fire
You can call me a mess
And say what you like
You can call me whatever you want
But don't call me tonight

You can call me a psycho
You can call me a liar
You can call me an arsonist
I should set you on fire
You can call me a mess
And say what you like
You can call me whatever you want
But don't call me tonight

Don't call me with that sad boy bullshit
Don't call me acting like you're sorry
Don't wanna hear your sad boy bullshit
Don't wanna hear the same sob sorry
Same sob story

You can call me a psycho
You can call me a liar
You can call me an arsonist
I should set you on fire
You can call me a mess
And say what you like
You can call me whatever you want
But don't call me tonight
No, don't call me tonight

Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
Don't call me tonight (don't call me tonight)
Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
Don't call me tonight
