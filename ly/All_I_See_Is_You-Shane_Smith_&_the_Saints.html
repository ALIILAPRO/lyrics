		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A storm's runnin' through the Midwest
Like a bandit out on the loose
And all the clouds are black as night fall
But all I see is you
Rain's pourin' through the window panes
And the cracks of this roof
Tea's boilin' from the spout of the pot but
All I see is you (yeah)

It's like the nights in Salt Lake City
Where the snow fell down too soon
People laughed and howled from their beers
But all I could see was you

And I remember our first night abroad
As the sun traded ships with the moon
It was a lot to take it in for some eyes from east Texas
But all I could see was you
'Cause all I ever see is you

I'll make my way to the doctor one day
When my eyes don't work like they should
just read the letters from large down to small
But all I will see is you
Then when I'm old and weathered
From the winds of a life that consumed
I pray to God the day I'll find my death bed
All I'll see you
'Cause all I wanna see is you

Every day
And oh, oh, oh, I will wait
A few more nights
But until that time
All I see is you

A storm's runnin' through the Midwest
Like a bandit out on the loose
And all the clouds are black as night fall
But all I see is you
Rain's pourin' through the window panes
And the cracks of this roof
Tea's boilin' from the spout of the pot but
All I see is you
'Cause all I ever see is you
