		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're nothing but gasoline
Starting fires since seventeen
Silver spoon in daddy's jeans
You go four, three, two, one, count it, count it down
Mister in a stolen dress
You're so dark but you're painted red
Soaking wet in your golden bed
You go four, three, two, one, count it, count it down

How are you sleeping at night?
How do you close both your eyes?
Living with all of those lives on your hands?
Standing alone on that hill
Using your fuel to kill
We won't take it standing still
Watch us dance
How are you sleeping at night?
How do you close both your eyes?
Living with all of those lives on your hands?
Standing alone on that hill
Using your fuel to kill
We won't take it standing still
Watch us dance

We're gonna dance on gasoline
We're gonna dance on gasoline
We're gonna dance on gasoline

Your ego is dangerous
Your own blood is losing trust
With neighbors left in the dust
We go four, three, two, one, count it, count it down
Seated on a stolen throne
Playing God with your heart of stone
The whole world is waiting for you to go
Down, down, down, down
Down

How are you sleeping at night?
How do you close both your eyes?
Living with all of those lives on your hands?
Standing alone on that hill
Using your fuel to kill
We won't take it standing still
Watch us dance
How are you sleeping at night?
How do you close both your eyes?
Living with all of those lives on your hands?
Standing alone on that hill
Using your fuel to kill
We won't take it standing still
Watch us dance

We're gonna dance on gasoline
We're gonna dance on gasoline
We're gonna dance on gasoline
