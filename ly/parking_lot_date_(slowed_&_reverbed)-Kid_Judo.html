		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right here (Yuh, oh, yuh, woah, yeah woah)
Okay, yuh (woah, woah, woah)
Okay, okay, okay, yuh
Judo what is this?
Okay, yuh, uh (okay, yuh, yuh, yuh)
Slide through we could set up a date
I want you to come chill in the back my wraith
We met by chance but I believe in faith
And I don't even like sweets but I want that cake
So what it do
I could deck you out with jimmy choo's
That Prada bag or those Balenci shoes
I'm picking up when you droppin' clues
I just want you to fly me to the moon
Worry about no one else girl it's me and you
Take you out to eat and we could get some food
Tell me what you like and I'ma set the mood
Want you to take me to the moon and the stars
Watch the sunset from my car
Buy a drink, cruise the bar, down the boulevard
You could hold my hand and you could hold it hard
Can you feel the connection 'cause I feel it in my heart
And you're so pretty baby I can't even fake it
Giving you the opportunity so baby take it
Spending all my time with you 'cause I could never waste it
Don't run after anybody but for you I chase it
So what's the plan darling I wanna make all the moves
I'm down for anything as long as I do it with you
We're in sync yeah I can feel us in tune
We could chill or hit the town but I'ma let you chose
Slide through we could set up a date
I want you to come chill in the back my wraith
We met by chance but I believe in faith
And I don't even like sweets but I want that cake
So what it do
I could deck you out with jimmy choo's
That Prada bag or those Balenci shoes
I'm picking up when you droppin' clues
I just want you to fly me to the moon
Slide through we could set up a date
I want you to come chill in the back my wraith
We met by chance but I believe in faith
And I don't even like sweets but I want that cake
So what it do
