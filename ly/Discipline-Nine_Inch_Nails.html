		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I, am I still tough enough?
Feels like I'm wearing down, down, down, down, down
Is my viciousness losing ground, ground, ground, ground, ground
Am I taking too much?
Did I cross the line, line, line?
I need my role in this
Very clearly defined

I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself

And now it's starting up
Feels like I'm losing touch
Nothing matters to me
Nothing matters as much
I see you left a mark
Up and down my skin, skin, skin
I don't know where I end
And where you begin

I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself

Ooh, ooh, ooh oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(I cannot stop myself)
(Once I start I cannot stop myself)
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself

I need your discipline (and you know)
I need your help (once I start I cannot stop myself)
I need your discipline (and you know)
Because once I start I cannot stop myself

I need your discipline (and you know)
I need your help (once I start I cannot stop myself)
I need your discipline (and you know)
Because once I start I cannot stop myself

And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
I need your discipline (and you know)
(Once I start I cannot stop myself)
