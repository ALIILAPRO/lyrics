		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I used to be such a little bitch about everything

But now I'm on the brave shit, look at me I made it
Used to be a downer, now I'm sorry I can't relate shit
Made it, take it, break shit
Chew it up, I ate it
Catch me on the cover of your playlist, yeah, yeah

Hot shit, I'm coming with the heat, yeah
Pulled up, oh, now you wanna eat, yeah
Take that, I'm still the one that beat, yeah
Still, the one to beat, yeah

I'm a bad bitch, a very bad bitch
B-A-D, that's me, that bitch
Cinematic, a bona fide hit
Been so sweet, I make me sick
I'm a bad bitch with the yellow hair
I'm a good witch, baby, I don't care
So dramatic, a double dog dare
I'm a bad bitch, baby, I don't care

Hundred million streams, wrote it in a day
Said I couldn't do it, did it anyway (did it anyway)
And now you're tryna sign me, labels wanna dime me
Keep your money, Satan, get behind me, yeah, yeah

Hot shit, I'm playing on the weekends
Pulled up, oh, now you tryna be friends
Take that, you're swimming in the deep end
Swimming in the deep end

I'm a bad bitch, a very bad bitch
B-A-D, that's me, that bitch
Cinematic, a bona fide hit
Been so sweet, I make me sick
I'm a bad bitch with the yellow hair (yeah, ooh)
I'm a good witch, baby, I don't care (yeah)
So dramatic, a double dog dare
I'm a bad bitch, baby, I don't care

Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's me, TV, yeah, blowing up your screen
That's BBE, yeah, show me what you mean
That's me, TV, yeah, blowing up your screen
That's BBE, yeah, show me what you mean

I'm a bad bitch, a very bad bitch
B-A-D, that's me, that bitch
Cinematic, a bona fide hit
Been so sweet, I make me sick
I'm a bad bitch with the yellow hair (yeah, ooh)
I'm a good witch, baby, I don't care (yeah)
So dramatic, a double dog dare
I'm a bad bitch, baby, I don't care
