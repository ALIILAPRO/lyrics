		<p>
		  To Bass be the glory
Ok, am I smoking out?
Ayy, ayy, huh

I'm so gassed up, uh, I'm so gassed up, uh
I'm so gassed up, uh, so gassed up
I'm so gassed up, uh, so gassed up
I'm so gassed up, uh, okay, gassed up (gassed up)

One take Timmy (One take)
I hit with no jimmy (I hit with no jimmy)
They don't feel me
Whipped my dick out, she like, "Gimme" (She like, "Gimme")
Burnt rubber (urr), fat motherfucker
Niggas hating, boy, you lame
Pillow talking, undercover (undercover)
If you could take my bitch, then I can't love her (oh no)
Peanut butter, chocolate cover, I can't trust her (I can't trust her)
Google me, I'm something, came from nothing, okay (ayy, gling gling gling)
I'm so gassed up, told my lil' bih call when she comin' (gling gling)

She so gassed up
She give top with mask off
Foam on my dick like bath salt
She at my show, that's your fault
Six shows at the back of the tour bus
We at the top of the food chain
Kickin' shit you can call me Liu Kang (wah!)
VVS, white gold, my new chain
Runnin' up to the bed like Usain
She just wanna know 'bout the group name
All about the bad for the damn fame
You broke, that's a fact, that's a damn shame
I'm so gassed up, I can't do nothin' about it
If you passed up, don't hit my phone or talk about it, okay

I'm so gassed up, uh, I'm so gassed up, uh
I'm so gassed up, uh, so gassed up
I'm so gassed up, uh, so gassed up
I'm so gassed up, uh, okay, gassed up (gassed up)

Yeah, I'm so gassed up, gassed up, gassed up (gas)
Please don't hit me up if you ain't tryna match, bruh (what?)
Ed and Eddy kush, smokin' on a jawbreakers, yeah (oh)
Fuck the police, bitch, I'm a lawbreaker, yeah
Always smokin' five like I'm always shootin' nines (oh)
Money on my mind, so I can't waste time (what?)
Hit the door, foamin' out my mouth, I ate some soap, ooh
Lose it ho, fuck it, I'ma blow me down a O

I can't hit your shit, ain't no grabber in your paper, uh-uh
I need me a spliff, bitch, I ain't smokin' no vapor, uh-uh
If it ain't 'bout bands, keep your two sets (keep your two sets)
Drop top the coupe, make the roof split (make the roof split)
Ayy, I'm your noisy neighbor, yuh (yuh)
My dog got off papers, yuh
I just got 'em faded, yuh
Off different flavors, bitch
Baby mama's blazin' ya (huh)
Put your bitch in labor, yuh (yuh)
KiD TRUNKS, that's my Asian, yuh (wait)
Don't fuck around with Chad
I just bust a pack and hit the Backwood
I might blackout on a bitch, woah
Jealousy could eat you up alive
Just focus on the lane you in, woah
Blunt it up and count it up
I lose my mind but always seem to win, woah
I'm so fuckin' gassed up
Know the kush will fade away again, bitch

I'm so gassed up, uh, I'm so gassed up, uh
I'm so gassed up, uh, so gassed up
I'm so gassed up, uh, so gassed up
I'm so gassed up, uh, okay, gassed up (gassed up)

Gassed up, hey, I'm so gassed up, hey
Smoking blows onto my face, I'm so damn stuffed, ayy
Gassed up, hey, I'm so gassed up, hey
Smoking blows onto my face, I'm so damn stuffed, ayy
