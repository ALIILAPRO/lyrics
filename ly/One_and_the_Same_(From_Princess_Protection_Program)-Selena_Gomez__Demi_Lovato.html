		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey, hey
La, la, la, la, la
Hey, hey, hey
La, la, la, la, la

You come from here
I come from there

You rock out in your room
I rock a world premiere

We're more alike than
Anybody could ever tell
(Ever tell)

Friday, we're cool
Monday, we're freaks

Sometimes we rule
Sometimes we can't even speak

But we can kick it up and
Let loose and l-o-l (l-o-l)

It may seem cliche
For me to wanna say
That you're not alone

And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact
I got your back
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause we're one and the same
We're something more than ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
We're one and the same
Hey, hey, hey
La,la,la,la,la

I'm kind of like you
You're kind of like me

We write the same song
In a different key

It's got a rhythm
You and me
Can get along
(Get along)

And it may seem cliche
For me to wanna say
That you're not alone

And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact
I still got your back

'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one and the same

'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
We're something more than momentary

'Cause we're one
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause we're one
I think we're almost legendary
We're anything but ordinary
You and me the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
Oh, you and me the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one and the same

Hey, hey, hey
La, la, la, la, la
Hey, hey, hey
