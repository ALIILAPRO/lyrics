		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
The streets we travel on
Will undergo our same lost past

I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile
Holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come
But I don't want to leave you

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over

Newborn life replacing all of us
Changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight
Follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?

I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over

Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real

So, what if I never hold you, yeah
Or kiss your lips again? Whoa
So I never want to leave you
And the memories of us to see, I beg don't leave me

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over

Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real

Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day 
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day (I stand here alone)
Silence you lost me (falling away from you)
No chance for one more day (no chance to get back home)
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day (I stand here alone)
Silence you lost me (falling away from you)
No chance for one more day (no chance to get back home)
