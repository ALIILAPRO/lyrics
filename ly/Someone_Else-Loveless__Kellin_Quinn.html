		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Left a mark on my soul
I could feel it when you let me go
See your face lost in the crowd
Stop myself from reaching out
This just seems outta control
Told myself I wouldn’t let you close
And now you’re always in my dreams
I cant live in make believe

Time will tell
Who am I say that the memory won’t fade
Trapped in hell
Could I see someone else
(Someone else)
Time will tell
Who am I say that the memory won’t fade
Trapped in hell
Could I see someone else

I made you a place in my world
You promised you would do the same with yours
But all you ever did was compromise yourself in mine
Now you’re begging me to take you back
Put me through hell and once we been through that
I lost myself and there’s no turning back
So walk away cause I’m not looking back, yeah

Time will tell
Who am I say that the memory won’t fade
Trapped in hell
Could I see someone else
(Someone else)
Time will tell
Who am I say that the memory won’t fade
Trapped in hell
Could I see someone else

Kinda feels like your punishing me
Oh, I’m tongue-tied and I wish I could breathe
No, I didn’t think it would be my story to write
Kinda feels like your punishing me
Oh, I’m tongue-tied and I wish I could breathe
No, I didn’t think it would be my story to write
Be my story to write

Time will tell
Who am I say that the memory won’t fade
Trapped in hell
Could I see someone else
(Someone else)
Time will tell
Who am I say that the memory won’t fade
Trapped in hell
Could I see someone else
