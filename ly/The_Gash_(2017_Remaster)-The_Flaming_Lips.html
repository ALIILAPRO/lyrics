		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is that gash in your leg
Really why you have stopped?
'Cause I've noticed all the others
Though they're gashed, they're still going
'Cause I feel like the real reason
That you're quitting
And admitting that you've lost
All the will to battle on

Will the fight for our sanity
Be the fight of our lives?
Now that we've lost all the reasons
That we thought that we had

Still the battle that we're in
Rages on till the end
With explosions, wounds are open
Sights and smells, eyes and noses
But the thought that went unspoken
Was understanding
That you're broken, still the last
Volunteer battles on

Battles on
Battles on
Battles on
