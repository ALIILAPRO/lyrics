		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got a little crazy in her
Sharp eyes with the mind of a sinner
cll those dark thoughts, yet still a beginner...
But you can tell that she's got a little demon in her...
Cuz she could make a man obsessed
She could make a man confess
She could make a man cut checks
Cuz she looks better when she's undressed
Just a couple secret sinners
Yeah she's just what he eats for dinner...

She's easy to love
Oh and easy to hate
She tastes like a drug and she feels just the same
Bitter to the tongue, but a thrill for your brain
c little bit crazy, but it's worth all the pain... 

She's a dark little artist with ink in her veins
She's been through the hardest, but prospered from pain
She appears to be heartless, surrounded by flames
But through all the darkness a lover is chained

She's nerdy and sweet 
But she's dirty underneath
If those flirty eyes could speak
Lustful thoughts would release

Cuz she hates that she loves so hard
Like a disease
It's left her with all these scars 
No one can see...but me... 

Her mind is a beautiful thing...
You never quite know what she thinks... 
But if you're lucky she just might let you see
What hides behind nightmares and dreams...

She's easy to love
Oh and easy to hate
She tastes like a drug and she feels just the same
Bitter to the tongue, but a thrill for your brain
c little bit crazy, but it's worth all the pain... 

She's a dark little artist with ink in her veins
She's been through the hardest, but prospered from pain
She appears to be heartless, surrounded by flames
But through all the darkness a lover is chained

Her mind is a beautiful thing...
You never quite know what she thinks... 
But if you're lucky she just might let you see
What hides behind nightmares and dreams...
