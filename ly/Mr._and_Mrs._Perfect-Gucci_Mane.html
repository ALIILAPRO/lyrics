		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like I finally got chance to just breath, you know I'm sayin'
All this hard work done paid off

My life perfect, my wife perfect, my ice perfect
I'm Mr. Perfect
My prices high as a kite but I'm worth it
My bitch is perfect, she Mrs. Perfect (Murda on the beat so it's not nice)

Every day I wake I'm tryna triple up the money (trip')
Jit gone off them shrooms he been tripin' since Sunday (damn)
I'm not even bummed out they said I can't go to London 
'Cause I was sellin' weed when Dr. Dre had made The Cronic (wow)
Now I'm on an extra high, wake up and went to runnin' (go)
This shit shouldn't even be legal it's like I'm robbin' folks for money (it's like I'm robbin' or some')
Talkin' Monday to Sunday, you call me, Gucci comin' (okay)
I told 'em stop givin' me cash ain't have nowhere to fit the hundreds (stop)
That's a breath of fresh air for the ones tryna get money (ah)
I used to get it now I got it, look what I've accomplished (look what I've accomplished)
I started from nothin', I made somethin' out of nothin'
I'm a good example for the ones who still strugglin' (ones who still strugglin')
Never stop, never stop, never stop hustlin' (never stop hustlin')
Never stop, never stop, never stop hustlin' (never stop hustlin')
This one for the ones, knee deep, still smugglin' (still smugglin')
One foot in, one out, still jugglin' (true)

My life perfect, my wife perfect (perfect), my ice perfect (burr)
I'm Mr. Perfect (I'm Mr. Perfect)
My prices high as a kite but I'm worth it (but I'm worth it)
My bitch is perfect, she Mrs. Perfect (she miss me, mwah)

My spliffs are perfect, my gift is perfect (my gift is perfect)
My bitch is perfect (my bitch is perfect), she thick and curvy (she thick and what?)
My life is nice, my ice is gorgeous (my is ice ooh)
We built the house from the ground no mortgage (wow)
Gucci the luggage (Gucci), Louis the buggy (Louis)
My daughter worth some M's still in Huggies (well, damn)
These niggas muggin', my shoulders shruggin' (huh)
I'm stiff, no handshakes, no huggin' (no)
My diamonds dancin', doin' the Dougie
My exes mad at me they still holdin' grudges (huh)
Still fuck the law, and fuck the judges (fuck 'em)
Still fuck the system, we still buggin' (Wop)

My life perfect, my wife perfect (perfect), my ice perfect (burr)
I'm Mr. Perfect (I'm Mr. Perfect)
My prices high as a kite but I'm worth it (but I'm worth it)
My bitch is perfect, she Mrs. Perfect (she miss me, mwah)
My life perfect, my wife perfect (perfect), my ice perfect (burr)
I'm Mr. Perfect (I'm Mr. Perfect)
My prices high as a kite but I'm worth it (but I'm worth it)
My bitch is perfect, she Mrs. Perfect (she miss me, mwah)
