		  DEATHTOUCH

I hate you all
I hate you all
I hate you all

Deathtouch, fuck you

You want me to be like this
Now you get it

You would not even listen if you fucking wanted to
This anger always wanted me to split your fucking head into
Two pieces that I get to
Keep under my bed until hell sits beside me and tells me to cry

My hatred for this prison has reached its place
Death now longs for one final embrace

This is how we all die

The black raven sits on top of me while I am hanging in the dark noose, begging to break loose

The flock of demons that chase me won't escape my bleeding

My sanity is losing its grip on the place where I feel like I'll never stop kneeling

The same room has taken my feeling, from the beginning of my shallow breathing
The path of my mind, which is always defined, always leaving me up on the ceiling

The end is near, oh god I never had this feeling

My hatred has reached its fucking boiling point
I've finally got you at gunpoint
Finger on the fucking trigger
Let me make that hole bigger
Tears run down your eyes

The end is right fucking here

My outlet is your face
I want to leave this place
You make me a disgrace
My outlet is your face
I'm gonna be your final deathtouch

I am a deathtouch
I am your deathtouch
Bitch
