		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got our secrets hidden inside our bones
Starlight that bleeds when all of the lights come on

It's a beautiful miracle
How you lift me up when I feel low
Beautiful everglow
Now we're shining like a sea of gold, yeah

We're on fire tonight
Like a million diamonds in the sky
And we're lost in all the lights
Here together
We're on fire tonight

We're on fire, whoa-oh, oh-oh
We're on fire, whoa-oh, oh-oh (oh)

Living in memories, guiding me through the dark, mm-mm
You're the notes to my melody, healing all of my scars

It's a beautiful miracle
How you lift me up when I feel low
Beautiful everglow
Now we're shining like a sea of gold, yeah

We're on fire tonight
Like a million diamonds in the sky
And we're lost in all the lights
Here together
We're on fire tonight

We're on fire, whoa-oh, oh-oh (oh)
We're on fire, whoa-oh, oh-oh (whoa-oh-oh)
And we're lost in all the lights
Here together
We're on fire tonight

We're on fire
