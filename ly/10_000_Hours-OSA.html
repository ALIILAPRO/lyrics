		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know why I tried
When we were nothing real to you
All the energy came from one side
You had one assignment
On all those drunken nights
The liquor showed the sober you
And now you wanna change your tune
You've been a felon for a long long time
And you hide your crimes
And get to pretend that love is your only motive
You say your hearts open
But know mine closed and
It remains frozen
But still you wanna spend
Ten thousand hours
Wasted
You still want flowers
Can't blame you
For tryna lockdown
On what you've found
What a shame you
Can't find the same - ou - ou - ou
And what we won't do
Is bring back all the things we'd do
Cuz there tainted in this fog of truth
We got further than I thought we should
Lost still I found
A different route
I had my doubts
Still wonder bout'
All the shame you've lost
It's scary
If I was famous
You'd try claim me
Now
But still you wanna spend
Ten thousand hours
Wasted
You still want flowers
Can't blame you
For tryna lockdown
On what you've found
What a shame you
Can't find the same - ou - ou - ou
And what we won't do
Is bring back all the things we'd do
Cuz there tainted in this fog of truth
We got further than I thought we should
