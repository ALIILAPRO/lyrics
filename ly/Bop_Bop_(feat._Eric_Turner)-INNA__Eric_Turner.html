		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Woke up Mexico
Tan lines, here we go
Gin fizz in my glass
Shake, shake, shaky, shake the shack 
We meet all the cats 
New scene fade to black
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Milkshakes on the rack
They're dancing in the street
Hands up holler back
And come on dance with me

Hot hands on your hips
And work it baby please
One kiss on the lips
It's summer by the sea
By the sea, by the sea, by the sea
Mr. Frisky

Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Wake up, it's time to blend
Everything throw the juices in
Mix it up till it's bubblin'
Now your trippin' of the good 

Get you rockin' like an animal
Always ready baby, locked and loaded 
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Milkshakes on the rack
They're dancing in the street
Hands up holler back
And come on dance with me

Hot hands on your hips
And work it baby please
One kiss on the lips
It's summer by the sea
By the sea, by the sea, by the sea
Mr. Frisky

Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Hands against the wall
Mr. Officer, I don't know nothing
That is the truth
Ah eh, ah eh. eh, ah eh, ah eh, ah eh
(So how you gonna move?) Like 1950
(That's cool if that's true) Like 1950
Ah eh, ah eh, eh, ah eh, ah eh, ah eh
(So how you gonna move?) Like 1950
(That's cool if that's true) Like 1950

Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Bop bop, close the shop
Big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
