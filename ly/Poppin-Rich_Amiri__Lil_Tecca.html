		  Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah (bop-bop-bop)
Uh-huh, yeah (bop, bop-bop-bop)
Uh-huh, yeah (phew, phew)

Bitch, I'm off a flat, feelin' nauseous (yeah, phew)
She gon' hit my crib and give me neck, that no talkin' (No, no)
I just went and paid an arm and leg for Givenchy (yeah, yeah)
Then I went and bought a new Corvette for my mommy
Swear I love this shit, I love to flex, often (okay) 
I don't do no talkin' (no)
I just get to sparkin' 
We caught that boy and robbed him (yeah, let's go)
Rocky, he gon' box, spent a band right on these Robins (uh-huh)
I ain't really popular, but I'm kinda poppin' (uh-huh)

I don't really talk too much, I just do my thing, yeah (yeah, let's go)
Got tired of Boston, I went to Bombay, uh (uh-huh, yeah)
Put 'em in a coffin, I let that chop' spray (bop, bop)
She said, "Bae, you toxic, you never call me" (oh, what?)
If I broke your lil' heart, I'm sorry (yeah)
If you need me, you can call me
Don't see you like that but you too attached, ayy (too attached)
I been countin' cash, pockets stupid fat, yeah
Yeah, I did her bad, but she came back
If you want some smoke, I'll arrange that (yeah)
Want some love? I can't even entertain that (no)
If them boys bust, we gon' bang back (whew)

Bitch, I'm off a flat, feelin' nauseous (yeah)
She gon' hit my crib and give me neck, that no talkin' (no, no)
I just went and paid an arm and leg for Givenchy (yeah, yeah)
Then I went and bought a new Corvette for my mommy
Swear I love this shit, I love to flex, often (okay) 
I don't do no talkin' (no)
I just get to sparkin' 
We caught that boy and robbed him (yeah, let's go)
Rocky, he gon' box, spent a band right on these Robins (Romani, Romani, Romani)
I ain't really popular, but I'm kinda poppin'

I ain't tryna flex but you know this
That ho stay on me, she be like, "Tec', you so important"
Half these niggas, they just gassed up, bitch, they bloated
Everyday, I get my gas up, bitch, I'm rollin' (yeah)
Half these niggas tryna catch up, yeah
Oh, you don't agree? I know you thought that talk was cheap
I beef about that green like that shit a BLT
I know I'm her strange addiction, put that shit on TLC
Tired of fuckin' with them lames, that's why she just fuck with me
No talkin', I can't do no talkin'
Pull up in that big body, I can't do no walkin'
I just blocked her number, yeah, that ho do too much stalkin'
Man, these bitches crazy, don't forgot that I gotta be cautious

Bitch, I'm off a flat, feelin' nauseous (yeah)
She gon' hit my crib and give me neck, that no talkin' (no, no)
I just went and paid an arm and leg for Givenchy (yeah, yeah)
Then I went and bought a new Corvette for my mommy
Swear I love this shit, I love to flex, often (okay), I don't do no talkin' (no)
I just get to sparkin', we caught that boy and robbed him (yeah, let's go)
Rocky, he gon' box, spent a band right on these Robins (uh-huh)
I ain't really popular, but I'm kinda poppin'

Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
