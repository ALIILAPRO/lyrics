		  (So yesterday)
(So yesterday, so yesterday)

You can change your life (if you wanna)
You can change your clothes (if you wanna)
If you change your mind
Well, that's the way it goes
But I'm gonna keep your jeans
And your old black hat ('cause I wanna)
They look good on me
You're never gonna get them back
At least not today
Not today, not today, 'cause

If it's over, let it go, and
Come tomorrow, it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up, it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?

Ha, okay

You can say you're bored (if you wanna)
You can act real tough (if you wanna)
You can say you're torn
But I've heard enough
Thank you, you made my mind up for me
When you started to ignore me
Do you see a single tear?
It isn't gonna happen here
At least not today
Not today, not today, 'cause

If it's over, let it go, and
Come tomorrow it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up, it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?

If you're over me, I'm already over you
If it's all been done, what is left to do?
How can you hang up if the line is dead?
If you wanna walk, I'm a step ahead
If you're moving on, I'm already gone
If the light is off then it isn't on
At least not today
Not today, not today, 'cause

If it's over let it go, and
Come tomorrow, it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up, it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard (you're so yesterday)

If it's over, let it go, and
Come tomorrow, it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up, it will seem 
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?
