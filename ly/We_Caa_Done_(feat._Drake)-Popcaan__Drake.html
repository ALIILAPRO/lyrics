Why pree? Why pree? Why pree?
Disrespect we and shots a go beat (yeah)

We cyaan' done (weh), we cannot done, we cannot done (no)
We cyaan' done, we cannot done, we cannot done (ooh)
We cyaan' done (weh), we cannot done

Woii, me cyaan' done bwoy will dead, me don't need my gun
Choppa loud up di place like one new stadium
Thick gyal a give me head inna the big Phantom
Dem know me a di god like one a Jesus son
Yeah, short but me heavy (whoa)
Chain 'round me neck can buy a couple Chevy, hmm
Jiggle up yuh body fi me, baby

Badman she like, champagne and candlelight
Gi' you somethin' make you ride it like a motorbike (yes)
Me a di original, me a di prototype
Dem think we done, we just a kick it inna overdrive
Money cyaan' done (no)
Anywhere we pull up is a pandemonium (yes)
Millions a discuss inna di forum
Diss di 6 God and haffi run up and down
Trouble foot, feet

Try fi rush me off (weh), try fi brush me off, I see (no, no, no)
Badman like Skull and me from Unruly, girl, why pree?
Why pree? Why pree? Why pree?
Disrespect we and shots a go beat
They tryna say we done, pussy, we cyaan' done

We cyaan' done, we cannot done, we cannot done
We cyaan' done, we cannot done, we cannot done
We cyaan' done, we cannot done, we cannot done
We cyaan' done, we cannot done, no

A everywhere di gyal dem love we
Inna every state, every country
Cute pretty gyal wan' make a movie
She a tell me she bad and she unruly
Man just a start, get richer every day and just a laugh
Legendary, full Burberry
Have a pretty Askelli, anything kick off (yeah)
'Member man a god inna di earth, so me fuck some Earth angel
Mi great granny from Heaven said fi gwan raise hell (yes)
Man a fight to the end from dem ring that bell
And as you make it inna life dem say a soul you a sell
Amount a pain me feel, some a mi flow can tell
Wuleap a friend switch up, me still wish dem well
Wuleap a record break, wuleap a show get shell
From you say we name a great it spell (weh, trouble)

Try fi rush me off, try fi brush me off, I see
Badman like Skull and me from Unruly, girl, why pree?
Why pree? Why pree? Why pree?
Disrespect we and shots a go beat
They tryna say we done, pussy, we cyaan' done

We cyaan' done, we cannot done, we cannot done
We cyaan' done, we cannot done, we cannot done
We cyaan' done, we cannot done, we cannot done
We cyaan' done, we cannot done, no
