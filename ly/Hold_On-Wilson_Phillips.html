		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know there's pain
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains?
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside? 
Oh

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

You could sustain
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (no, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (ooh)
Lettin' your worries pass you by (lettin' your worries pass you by)
Baby, don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind? Ooh, no

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way (things'll go your way)
Hold on for one more day

I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and
Break free the chains
Yeah, I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and you
Break free, break from the chains

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
If you hold on

Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
If you hold on
Can you hold on
Hold on baby
Won't you tell me now
Hold on for one more day 'cause
It's gonna go your way

Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
Can't you change it this time

Make up your mind
Hold on
Hold on
Baby hold on
