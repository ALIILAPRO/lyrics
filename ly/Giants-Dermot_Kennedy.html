		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to be giants
When did we stop?
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot

The hope and the hurt
Has lived inside of me
But there's gold in the dirt
I never took the time to see
But I knew of its worth
When you walked beside of me
And my hand fit in yours
Like a bird would find the breeze

We used to be giants
When did we stop?
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot
We were the song in the silence
But time catches up
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot

I knew from the start
You'd be the one to set me free
That day in the park
When the hurt would hide from me
Those eyes used to know me, it's been way too long
You are the moon and the stars, and all they gaze upon
Time won't ever move slowly, what you waiting on?
What you waiting on?

We used to be giants
When did we stop?
Say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot
We were the song in the silence
But time catches up
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot

Darling
Just say you will
Will you remember those times?
That I have held until
Tonight
If you say you will
I'll leave it all behind
Don't you remember those times?

We used to be giants
So when did we stop?
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot
We were the song in the silence
But time catches up
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot

We used to be giants
Giants
Oh, I still love you though
I still love you though
