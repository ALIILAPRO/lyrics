		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They try to hold me back to hide the fact that I'm a threat
My mind's the truth behind the lies and I define what they regret
And fact the matter is it isn't yet a promise till it's kept
And honestly, we'll see the past repeat itself until the end

They try to hold me back to hide the fact that I'm a threat
My mind's the truth behind the lies and I define what they regret
And fact the matter is it isn't yet a promise till it's kept
And honestly, we'll see the past repeat itself until the end

I'm meant to be the one to fix the cycle, spinning till I'm dead
I'll run into the sun until it's coming back behind my head
I never knew the reason that I was alive until I bled
I know I won't be here for very long, I'm hanging by a thread
