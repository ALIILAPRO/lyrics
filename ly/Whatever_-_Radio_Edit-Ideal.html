		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, Ideal
Y2 Kay Gee and R.L. collabo
Uh-oh make 'em, make 'em
Make 'em dance to this
Uh yeah Ideal come on
Make 'em, make 'em
Make 'em dance to this
Let's go

Whatever you wanna do, uh-huh
Whether it's at the crib or club
It's all up to you, what? What?
Whatever you wanna do
So you wanna groove, uh-huh
Show me how you move, uh-huh
What'cha gonna do? What? What?
Cause I wanna rock with you
Whatever you wanna do

Tonight you're with me
I'm talking VIP
Cristal, Moet, Don P tonight, oh
Nice suite at the Double Tree
You and me in between the sheets
It's whatever you like baby, tell me

I like when you move up close to me
Sexy grinding holding me
Real close cause you're supposed to be, baby
Ideal-
I like it when you put that thing on me
Pushin' it up against the jeans
Makin' it harder in between, baby

Whatever you wanna do, uh-huh
Whether it's at the crib or club
It's all up to you, what? What?
Whatever you wanna do
So you wanna groove, uh-huh
Show me how you move, uh-huh
What'cha gonna do? What? What?
Cause I wanna rock with you
Whatever you wanna do

Tonight I just got paid
Let's hop in the Escalade
Go out on an escapade
Tonight, alright
What sip you choose?
I'll grab your hips and move
And do whatever you like, tell me, tell me

I like when you move up close to me
Sexy grinding holding me
Real close cause you're supposed to be, baby
Ideal-
I like it when you put that thing on me
Pushin' it up against the jeans
Makin' it harder in between, baby

Whatever you wanna do, uh-huh
Whether it's at the crib or club
It's all up to you, what? What?
Whatever you wanna do
So you wanna groove, uh-huh
Show me how you move, uh-huh
What'cha gonna do? What? What?
Cause I wanna rock with you
Whatever you wanna do

You can choose the place we go
Or stay home with the stereo
You choose the scenario
Tonight your situation
Here's your invitation
Come with me
Whatever you wanna do

Make 'em, make 'em
Make 'em dance to this
Uh yeah Ideal come on
Make 'em, make 'em
Make 'em dance to this
Uh yeah uh-oh
Make 'em, make 'em
Make 'em dance to this
Uh yeah Ideal come on
Make 'em, make 'em
Make 'em dance to this
(Come and go with me oh)

Whatever you wanna do, uh-huh
Whether it's at the crib or club
It's all up to you, what? What?
Whatever you wanna do
So you wanna groove, uh-huh
Show me how you move, uh-huh
What'cha gonna do? What? What?
Cause I wanna rock with you
Whatever you wanna do

Come on show me how you move
Baby let me see you groove
We can do what you want to
Tonight
You can move across to me

You can say come on mami
You can say come on papi
Tonight, whatever you wanna do

Whatever you wanna do, uh-huh
Whether it's at the crib or club
It's all up to you, what? What?
Whatever you wanna do
So you wanna groove, uh-huh
Show me how you move, uh-huh
What'cha gonna do? What? What?
Cause I wanna rock with you
Whatever you wanna do
