		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't taking call, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nu'n' to me, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough

Ay, here's a story, 'bout the time that I smoked
Everything in my inventory, for the glory
And the fact my post is glory, the boy met world like Cory
Real life, hit like Beckham, shit storm looked like Maury
The boy lost like Dory, only one way that I'm performin'
Pour it up, pour it up
Keep it coming, not anymore, though
Pour it up, pour it up
Keep it coming 'til I'm throwing up
I don't even go in public without feeling like I should be on a substance
I made my whole room like a recluse
Look what the fuck you people made me do

I ain't taking call, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nu'n' to me, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough

Okay, okay, wait, feel like Kevin Gates
Kick that ass right in the face
Kick that shit like Johnny Cage
Stick this stick in your ribcage
Cleaner with the fuckin' Wraith
Spit that shit that make you rage
I think that's it, everyday
I ain't never been the same
Who the fuck, who the fuck stupid enough to think they could do som'n' to us
Tell me, Who the fuck, who the fuck crazy enough
To they think they could light the stadiums up like
I just wanna know why every time I drop another they be sleeping and I'm wakin' them up like
Who the fuck, who the fuck owe respect?
They better be paying it up

I ain't taking call, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nu'n' to me, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough
I ain't taking call, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I don't speak at all, I be going through shit
Don't say nu'n' to me, I be going through shit (going through shit)
I've been through so much that what I took is not enough

Going through shit
Going through shit
