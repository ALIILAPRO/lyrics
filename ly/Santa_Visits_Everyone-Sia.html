		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen now, oh, listen dear
Can you hear the Christmas bells?
Listen close and listen here
Can you hear the magic? Oh
Open your eyes, open your ears
Can you hear the Christmas bells
Now close your eyes 'cause Santa's near
And Santa is the best of all, all, all

Ho ho, ho, ho, ho
Lay down your head on your pillow
Ho ho, ho, ho
He's coming, you know
Ho ho, ho, ho
Flying through the snow

Pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Pitter-patter, ho ho ho
Dream about the things you love
Dream about the stars above
'Cause Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone

Dasher, Dancer, Rudolph too
Jingle bells jingle by you
Comet, Prancer, Vixen, woo
Jingle bells, they're coming soon, oh-oh

Ho ho, ho, ho, ho
Lay down your head on your pillow
Ho ho, ho, ho
He's coming, you know
Ho ho, ho, ho
Flying through the snow

Pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Pitter-patter, ho ho ho
Dream about the things you love
Dream about the stars above
'Cause Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone
Santa visits everyone

And Santa visits everyone
And Santa visits everyone
And Santa visits everyone
And Santa visits everyone
