		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is for them people
I haven't seen in a long while
I still got love for you
And this is for the ones
That always rode for me, but we lost touch
I still got love for you
Still got love for you

I reminisce
Sipping on something strong
I think about my younger days
We just took it day by day
We never thought about the future
Cus' that was so far off we thought

Memories
Of them summer days
When life was just so much simpler
All of them people who treated me like I was family
I'ma ride for the ones who rode for me
This is for them people
I haven't seen in a long while
I still got love for you
And this is for the ones
That always rode for me, but we lost touch
I still got love for you
Still got love for you

All them people that fought for me
All the ones that risked their lives with me
In some crazy situations
I'm probably still alive cus' of those ones
I was so young
And so reckless, and so dumb
I never had no siblings
But they gave me brotherhood and its all love

Memories
Of those crazy nights
When we were so reckless
Playing with our lives
All of them people who treated me like I was family
I'ma ride for the ones who rode for me
I'll never forget
This is for them people
I haven't seen in a long while
I still got love for you
And this is for the ones
That always rode for me, but we lost touch
I still got love for you
Still got love for you
