		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the mighty sons of the spheres beyond
distributed the elements of earth
they laid down the foundation-stone
of highest spiritual birth
which ever existed since thousands of years
but is lost now in the future and past
light years away from our daily tears
those unperceived moments which always last

Poseidon became lord of earthquake and seas
master of oceans and all their wealth
god of an island, there lived a family
with a daughter of beauty and health

Atlantis was the island's name
greatest treasury of all times
human eyes didn't ever see the same
silver and gold, fertile hills, woodlands and plains
it was situated in front of the strait
they call "The Columns of Herakles"

Kleito was the daughter's name
a princely virgin of clearness and love
so Poseidon fell in love with her
and built a shrine on the mountains above
surrounded by a golden wall
and inside he placed his holy law

Son of god and daughter of earth
they created ten sons, human creatures
who've been of supreme beings at birth
of pure essence and perfect features
what a divine possibility to overcome evil
so listen what man did!
