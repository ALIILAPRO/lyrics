		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And hey, would you
Like to look outside sometimes? (No)
I'm just with my friends online
And there's things we'd like to change (yeah)
Next thing you'll find you're reading 'bout yourself
On a plane, fame, what a shame, oh
Well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking, oh

And love me (yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (yeah)
And love me (yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (yeah)

You've been reading 'bout yourself
On a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion
Karcrashian panache and a bag of bash for passion
You got a beautiful face but got nothing to say, oh
You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we like, meaning
We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, no

And love me, yeah, oh
If that's what you wanna do, oh (yeah)
And love me (love me) yeah
If that's what you wanna do, oh (yeah)

Oh, so sack off your calendar, give it to the people
Be the man that gets 'em up on their feet
Say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

And love me, yeah (oh)
And love me, yeah
If that's what you wanna do, oh (yeah)
