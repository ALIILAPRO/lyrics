		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Computer voice:

"Webs of concrete
Giving off waste dust that marks the search
Of an age of a thousand vast
Empires, sweeping away legends untold
To human ears
While shafts of steel clutch the
Stars, natural supplies once
Numerous now lapse
Into eerie silence recycled energy
Becomes the only form of life, as it was
And now new forms are moulded from patterns
Already used in a struggle to survive!"

You had me thinking that I'd
Lost my mind but no it was you
Thought you'd make it to a
Better time 'til now but it's through

Your castles made of sand
Hold out your helpless hands
Going down down down down down down down

They take it all, then take much more today
No man could ever realize his mistakes

They'll help you one step down
Sit back, and watch you drown
Going down down down
Going down down down down down down
