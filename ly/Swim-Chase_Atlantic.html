		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet you feel it now, baby
Especially since we've only known each other one day
But, I've gotta work shit out, baby
I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now

Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out

Yeah
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim

Pop a couple pills in the daytime
Heard you got a friend, what's her head like?
Probably should've fucked on the first night
Now I gotta wait for the green light
I don't wanna wait for no green light
Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright
Luckily I float at insane heights
Luckily, luckily, luckily, yeah

Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out

Yeah
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim

Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip
Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip, no
I know I said I'd call, I never did, no
(Swim) swim, swim now
I can take you, even though I've never been there
The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again now
I've been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in, girl

The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim
