		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is where we crash and burn
This is where we start to learn
Ground zero this fear of your
Presence of mind
Where the mind plans to perfect
We'll emerge and we reset
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind

How could I ever reconcile
Feel it was all worthwhile
Let's cut trough, then set to uncover
There's no point in denying it
Let's all be real about this
As we sin we begin to suffer

This is where we crash and burn
This is where we start to learn
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind
Where the mind plans to perfect
We'll emerge and we reset
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind

On the edge of the world we stand
You and me in command
Let's address this recess and cut through
To the next phase our design
Where we will redefine
Overcome or succumb it's our choice

This is where we crash and burn
This is where we start to learn
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind
Where the mind plans to perfect
We'll emerge and we reset
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind

As we carelessly propel forward we leave
Behind a trail of destruction in our wake
Subconsciously this fact accelerates
Our trajectory forward
In order to escape the
Undesirable realization of responsibility
Inevitability we crash in to a wall of
Realization with the smallest
Hurdle to overcome cause and effect
Act and consequence
As we sin we begin to suffer
The higher we fly the further we must fall
As we crash and burn we have the
Choice to rise and to learn
In the end all is within
The grasp of out mind
Overcome or succumb rise or fall further


This is where we crash and burn
This is where we start to learn
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind
Where the mind plans to perfect
We'll emerge and we reset
Ground zero this fear of your presence of

This is where we, we crash and burn
This is where we, we start to learn
Ground zero (ground zero) this fear of
Your presence of mind

This is where we crash and burn
This is where we start to learn
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind
Where the mind plans to perfect
We'll emerge and we reset
Ground zero this fear of
Your presence of mind

Presence of mind oh yeah!
