		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't find no comfort
Can't find no comfort here
Can't find no comfort in my shell
I hate myself with everybody else all alone

Can't find no comfort in my shell
I hate myself with everybody else
All alone inside this hell
Within my head, I can't get out
Time and time I cannot fail
I'm paranoid, somebody help
Break my heart and wish me well
I'm sick and tired of this living hell
Loaded nine tucked in my waist
Nothing to lose and nothing to gain
Live to die it's all to take
With one foot out the other in my grave
Feed me your lies and tell me it's okay
Suicide

Come and take me away come and take me away
Come and take me away come and take me away
Come and take me
