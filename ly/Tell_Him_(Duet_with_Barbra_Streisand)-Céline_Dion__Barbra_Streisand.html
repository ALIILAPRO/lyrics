		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm scared 
So afraid to show I care 
Will he think me weak 
If I tremble when I speak?

Ooh, what if
There's another one he's thinking of?
Maybe he's in love 
I'd feel like a fool 
Life can be so cruel 
I don't know what to do 

I've been there 
With my heart out in my hand 
But what you must understand 
You can't let the chance 
To love him pass you by 

Tell him 
Tell him that the sun and moon 
Rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 
And whisper 
Tender words so soft and sweet 
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself 

Touch him (ooh) 
With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it) 
Your love can't be denied 
The truth will set you free 
You'll have what's meant to be 
All in time you'll see 
Ooh, I love him (then show him) 
Of that much I can be sure (hold him close to you) 
I don't think I could endure 
If I let him walk away 
When I have so much to say 

Tell him 
Tell him that the sun and moon 
Rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 
And whisper 
Tender words so soft and sweet 
Hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself 

Love is light that surely glows 
In the hearts of those who know 
It's a steady flame that grows 
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show 
Tonight love will assume its place 
This memory, time cannot erase 
Your faith will lead love where it has to go 

Tell him 
Tell him that the sun and moon 
Rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 
And whisper 
Whisper words so soft and sweet 
Hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself, ooh 

Never let him go
