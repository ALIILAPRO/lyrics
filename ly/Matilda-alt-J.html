		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is from
This is from
This is from Matilda

Just like Johnny Flynn said, "The breath I've taken and the one I must" to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand, so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top to toe with her success

Oh, this is from
This is from
This is from Matilda

And she needs you
This is for Matilda
And she needs you
This is for Matilda

Just like Johnny Flynn said, "The breath I've taken and the one I must" to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand, so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top to toe with her success

Oh, this is from
This is from
This is from Matilda

And she needs you
This is for Matilda
And she needs you
This is for Matilda
And she needs you
This is for Matilda
Elle a besoin de toi
Cela vient de Matilda

And she needs you
This is for Matilda
And she needs you
This is for Matilda
And she needs you
This is for Matilda
And she needs you
This is for Matilda

This is for Matilda
This is from Matilda
Matilda
Matilda
Matilda
