		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pure emotion
Let it burn
Like fire
Do you yearn for a change?
And I hope that you learn
To never make the same mistake

Do you think about me
When you're all alone?
When the tide comes in, tell me where will you go?
Do you think about us
When you're feeling low?
Do you think about us?

How does it feel now that I'm gone?
How does it, how does it feel to get low?
How does it feel now you're alone?
How does it, how does it feel to feel low?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

You regret now
Does it hurt?
In the confusion
That things have stayed the same
And I know
Now I've learned
To never make the same mistake, hmm

Do you think about me
When you're all alone?
When the tide comes in, tell me where will you go?
Do you think about us
When the sky is low?
Do you think about us?

How does it feel now that I'm gone?
How does it, how does it feel to get low?
How does it feel now you're alone?
How does it, how does it feel to feel low?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

(How does it feel?) Call me tonight
Will you call me tonight?
(How does it feel?) Got a feeling you might
Things will never be the same

Pure emotion
Let it burn
I'll never make the same mistake

How does it feel now that I'm gone?
How does it, how does it feel to get low?
How does it feel now you're alone?
How does it, how does it feel to feel low?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
