		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're gonna say that I'm on a high horse
I think that my horse is regular-sized
Did you ever think maybe
You're on a pony
Going in circles on a carousel ride?
You're gonna say I asked for the moon
I think that it's you with your head in the sky
All that I wanted was somebody honest
Living for more than their next good time

You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets
You can call me if there's anything you need
Anything, anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

Go ahead and hate me as long as you need to
Go ahead and break me a piece of your mind
Say I always had one foot out
Well, baby, I got two now
Good thing I've never been afraid of goodbye

You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets
You can call me if there's anything you need
Anything, anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

And sure, it's not all so black and white
Sure, I'm gonna cry
For the love we couldn't keep
But I would rather lose you
Than who I'm meant to be
So you can have anything but

Me, yeah (me)
Can have anything but (me)
Me, yeah (me)
You can have anything but 
Me, yeah (me)
Can have Anything but (me)
Me, me yeah (me)
