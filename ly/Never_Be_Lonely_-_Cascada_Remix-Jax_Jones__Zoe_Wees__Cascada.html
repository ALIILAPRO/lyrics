		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (What you, what you gon' do?)

Tell me how it feels to know you'll never be lonely again
You spend the rest of your life knowing you, you
Will never be lonely again and again and again
So tell me how it feels to know that I'll never leave you alone
To know that you've got the freedom to choose
You will never be lonely again and again and again
So tell me how it feels

So tell me how it feels
So tell me how it feels
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never-)

Who'd have thought we'd make it?
Look at where we are
Is this what dreams are made of?
Here and now, I'm crossing my heart

With my hands in the air, I'll make enough
To always stay by your side
I will be there on your darkest nights
I'm here 'til the day that I die

So tell me how it feels to know you'll never be lonely again
You spend the rest of your life knowing you, you
Will never be lonely again and again and again
(Oh) So tell me how it feels

(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)
So tell me how it feels
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)
(And again and again, never lonely again)

With my hands in the air, I'll make enough
To always stay by your side (oh-oh)
I will be there on your darkest night
I'm here 'til the day that I die
So tell me how it feels
