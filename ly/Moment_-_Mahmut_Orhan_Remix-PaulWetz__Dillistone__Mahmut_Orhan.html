		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Disguised as a friend but you don't know me 
For you I'm no more than a throwaway 
You steal my time and you're smoking it 
The words you're using are violent 
I sell my charm just to pay my rent 
How far will I go I am wondering 
Till I'm out of touch with reality 
cnd wish for someone else in this life to be 

Lost in a 
Just for a 
Lost in a 
Just for a moment 

Lost in the Moment 
Skies in violet 
Just for a moment 
No more violence 
Just for a moment 
Just for a moment 

Lost in the Moment 
Skies in violet 
Just for a moment 
No more violence 
Just for a moment 
Just for a moment 

Maybe someday I'll be home again 
Getting far away from the turbulence 
Slowly disappear in a quiet place 
Get my final rest with my mind at peace 

Lost in a 
Just for a 
Lost in a 
Just for a moment 

Lost in a 
Just for a 
Lost in a 
Just for a moment 

Lost in the Moment 
Skies in violet 
Just for a moment 
No more violence 
Just for a moment 
Just for a moment 

Lost in the Moment 
Skies in violet 
Just for a moment 
No more violence 
Just for a moment 
Just for a moment 
Lost in a 
Just for a 
Lost in a 
Just for a moment
