		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Looky looky yonder)
(Looky looky yonder)
(Looky looky yonder)
(Looky looky yonder)
(Where the sun done gone)

He was searching
Blindly night and day
This life, there must be more

Breaking beauty
Just to stay awake
His heart was like a stone

Ooh, ooh his heart was like a stone

And on the last day
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

And on the last day
When all his work was done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

All this rapture
Right here all along
In scraps he tore away

All this color
In his final breath
Exhaled the dark and gray
Ooh, ooh
Exhaled the dark and gray

And on the last day
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

And on the last day
When all his work was done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

(Looky looky yonder)
(Looky looky yonder)
(Looky looky yonder)
(Looky looky yonder)
(Where the sun done gone)
