		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Badda-da-dah, badda-da-bah-bah
Comin' out your mouth with your blah, blah, blah
Zip your lips like a padlock
And meet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around, boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

Music's up (up)
Listen hot stuff (stuff)
I'm in love (love)
With this song
So just hush (hush)
Baby, shut up (up)
Heard enough
Stop ta-ta-talkin' that

Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be gettin' this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ar-ar
If you keep talkin' that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Boy, come and get my rocks off
Come put a little love in my glovebox (yeah)
Wanna dance with no pants on? (Holla)
Meet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox
So cut to the chase, kid
'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked and you're wasted

Music's up (up)
Listen hot stuff (stuff)
I'm in love (love)
With this song
So just hush (hush)
Baby, shut up (up)
Heard enough
Stop ta-ta-talkin' that

Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be gettin' this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ar-ar
If you keep talkin' that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

You be delayin' you always sayin' some shit
You say I'm playin', I'm never layin' the dick
Sayin' blah, blah, blah, 'cause I don't care who you are
In this bar it only matters who I is

Stop ta-ta-talkin' that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be gettin' this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ar-ar
If you keep talkin' that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be gettin' this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ar-ar
If you keep talkin' that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (oh)

Blah, blah, blah
Stop talkin'
Stop ta-ta-talkin' that
