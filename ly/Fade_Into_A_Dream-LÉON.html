		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summer's gone and I can't breathe
Turn around to me before you leave, hm
Teary-eyed but try to smile
Hate you for the way you make me feel, hm

And it's the kind of feeling
That could bring me to my knees
Words I didn't dare to say
What's left for you and me?

And I know
And I know
And I know
You'll fade into a dream, mm

Ooh

Late nights in a parking lot
Tell me all the secrets that you'll keep
Underneath the overpass
And I'm afraid I'm falling in too deep, hm

And it's the kind of feeling
That could bring me to my knees
Words that are too soon to say
What's left for you and me?

And I know
And I know
And I know
You'll fade into a dream, mm

Oh, some things are never meant to last
Oh, feelings fade, they tend to pass
But oh, I might think of you from time to time

I know
And I know
And I know
Ooh, I know
And I know
Yeah, I know
Ooh, I know
And I know
Yeah, I know
You'll fade into a dream

Summer's gone and I can't breathe
Turn around to me before you leave, hm
