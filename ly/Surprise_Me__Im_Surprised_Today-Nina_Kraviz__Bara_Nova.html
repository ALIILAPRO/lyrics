		  I'm surprised today

I'm surprised today

I'm surprised today
I'm surprised today

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What to see
It's not her
I'm surprised today
I'm surprised today

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What to see
It's not her
(I'm surprised today)
I'm surprised today
I'm surprised today

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What to see
It's not her
I'm surprised today
I'm surprised today

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What to see
It's not her
I'm surprised to hear that
I'm surprised to hear that

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What to see
Was not her
I'm surprised to hear that
I'm surprised to hear that

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What I see
It's not her
I'm surprised to hear that
I'm surprised to hear that

What to see
It's not her

It's not her
I'm surprised to hear that
I'm surprised to hear that

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What I see
It's not her
I'm surprised to hear that
I'm surprised to hear that

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What I see
It's not her
I'm surprised to hear that
I'm surprised to hear that

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
What I see
It's not her
I'm surprised to hear that
I'm surprised to hear that

What to see
It's not her
Does it hurt?
