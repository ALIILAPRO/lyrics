		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lady sing the blues
She's got them bad
She feels so sad

And wants the world to know
Just what her blues are all about

Lady sings the blues
She tells her side
Nothing to hide

Now the world will know
Just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart
When you get a bad start
When you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry
I know I won't die
'Cause I love him

Lady sings the blues
I'm tellin' you, she's got 'em bad
But now the world will know
She's never gonna sing them no more

The blues ain't nothin' but a pain in your heart
When you get a bad start
When you and your man have to part

Ain't gonna just sit around and cry
I know I won't die
'Cause I love him

Lady sings the blues
I'm tellin' you, she's got them bad
But now the world will know
She's never gonna sing them no more, no more
