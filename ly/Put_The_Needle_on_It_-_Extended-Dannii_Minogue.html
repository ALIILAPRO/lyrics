		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Put the needle on it, I put the needle on it)

Take the bait, bite the line, I got the place, you got the time, 
I'm lickin' my lips, did I make you blush?
I let you in, the sweat you're in, the temperature is risin',
So hot, I may want to take my clothes off.
Come inside, you're drippin' desire, let the music make you rise up,
Dirty hands is what I demand, let the music make you rise up.

Put the needle on it, I'll tell you where I want it,
Come on and spin me on it, all my freaks say.
Put the needle on it, I could tell you where I want it,
Come on and spin me on it, all my freaks say.

I dare you now to be bad, do you want the best you've ever had?
You look so tame boy, let me wild you up.
Keep the lights dark and low, I'll keep you up all night,
Until you feel it vibrating through your bones.
Come inside, you're trapped inside, let the music make you rise up,
Dirty hands is what I demand, let the music make you rise up.

Dirty hands, I demand. All my freaks say.

Put the needle on it.
