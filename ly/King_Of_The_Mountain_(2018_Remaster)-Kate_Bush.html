		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you see the aisles of women?
Could you see them screaming and weeping?
Could you see the storm rising?
Could you see the guy who was driving?
Could you climb higher and higher?
Could you climb right over the top?
Why does a multi-millionaire
Fill up his home with priceless junk?

The wind is whistling,
The wind is whistling
Through the house.

Elvis, are you out there somewhere
Looking like a happy man?
In the snow with Rosebud
And king of the mountain.

Another Hollywood waitress
Is telling us she's having your baby.
And there's a rumor that you're on ice
And you will rise again someday,
And that there's a photograph
Where you're dancing on your grave.

The wind is whistling,
The wind is whistling
Through the house.

Elvis, are you out there somewhere
Looking like a happy man?
In the snow with Rosebud
And king of the mountain.

The wind, it blows,
The wind, it blows the door closed.
