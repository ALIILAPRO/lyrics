		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
It's way too complicated
You're like a puzzle but I'm missing a piece
The candy apple getting stuck in my teeth
It's too late
With Venus retrograded
You were always gonna tear me to bits
In the elevator biting your lip

Secret codes in rabbit holes
You're digging in my head

And I know
In the way I'm tripping over my lace
Little omens all over the place
But maybe it's a good sign
Yeh I know
I saw your doppelgänger wearing a skirt
And now it's got me on red alert
But maybe it's a good sign
But maybe it's a good sign
Maybe it's a good sign

Hey
I'm kinda freaking out about it
I wanna leave but there's a lock on the door
And now the fear has got me loving you more
And the future looks bright
I've been doing alright
Without you dressed in white
But I like the way it looks on you

And I know
In the way I'm tripping over my lace
Little omens all over the place
But maybe it's a good sign
Yeh I know
I saw your doppelgänger wearing a skirt
And now it's got me on red alert
But maybe it's a good sign
But maybe it's a good sign
Maybe it's a good sign

And I know
In the way I'm tripping over my lace
Little omens all over the place
But maybe it's a good sign
Yeh I know
I saw your doppelgänger wearing a skirt
And now it's got me on red alert
But maybe it's a good sign
But maybe it's a good sign
Maybe it's a good sign
