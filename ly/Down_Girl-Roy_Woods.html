		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell that she wants me but I don't want her, don't want her, don't want her
Bare gyal a pree something for me they're all whining, they're all whining, they're all whining
I was with her up late night 'til she cabbed in the morning, in the morning, in the morning
Bad bitches in here, but what do they all want me for?

All that I see in the jawn
Is the girl that every other nigga wants
Clique turnt up, all burnt up
After this girl, I'mma take you where they won't
All that I see in the jawn
Is the girl that every other nigga wants
Clique turnt up, all burnt over, burnt up
After this girl, I'mma take you where they won't

I need a girl that I can freak on a weekday
I need a girl that's always down to come see me
I need a girl to roll the blunt, to smoke with me
I need a girl to make all this shit easy

What do you have? All that I need
You the type of girl to rock gold in your teeth
Don't care about a rich nigga or a broke nigga
Always keep it real with me, I'm your nigga
Good girl with the bad fat ass
Got me feeling like a nerd with an Asthma attack
Rolling through Sauga from the town that we stay at
Pushed me on the bed, shawty told me, till it back, woah

All that I see in the jawn
Is the girl that every other nigga wants
Clique turnt up, all burnt up
After this girl, I'mma take you where they won't
All that I see in the jawn
Is the girl that every other nigga wants
Clique turnt up, all burnt over, burnt up
After this girl, I'mma take you where they won't

I need a girl that I can freak on a weekday
I need a girl that's always down to come see me
I need a girl to roll the blunt, to smoke with me
I need a girl to make all this shit easy

Woah-oh
Few here are innocent, then all these girls guilty
Fuck me over dirty, I'll do you filthy
Just cause you roll with me, don't mean you're with me
Oh, you ain't the girl that deserve nigga's neither

I need a girl that I can freak on a weekday
I need a girl that's always down to come see me
I need a girl to roll the blunt, to smoke with me (all these girls guilty)
(Fuck me over dirty, I'll do you filthy) I need a girl to make all this shit easy
