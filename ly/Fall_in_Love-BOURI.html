		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we fall in love I will lose you
If I've learned anything from before
If we fall in love I will lose you
When you get to know me
You won't want me anymore

Am I loveless?
Or just fearful?
Do I want this?
Or should I carry on?
How do you carry on?

If we fall in love I will lose you
You will think this is all just make believe
If we fall in love I will lose you
I can't stand to ever see you leave

Am I loveless?
Or just fearful?
Do I want this?
Or should I carry on?
How do you carry on?

Don't want anything but you
Fix my betrayed heart
Don't want anything but you
Fix my betrayed heart

If we fall in love
If we fall in love
If we fall in love
If we fall in love I will lose you

Am I loveless?
Or just fearful?
Do I want this?
Can I trust myself?
Is it hopeless?
Will you change my mind?
Do I want this?
Or should I carry on?
How do you carry on?
