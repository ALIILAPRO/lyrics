		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh the night is my world
City life, painted girls
In the day nothing matters
It's the nighttime that flatters

In the night no control
Through the wall something breakin'
Wearin' white as you're walkin'
Down the streets of my soul

You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control

Another night another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You're makin' me forget to play my role
You take my self you take my self control

I I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow
So I guess I'll just believe it that tomorrow never comes again

Night I'm livin' in a moment of a dream
I know that life is not as it would seem
I must believe in something
So I make myself believe it that this night will never go

Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 

Oh the night is my world
City life, painted girls
In the day nothing matters
It's the nighttime that flatters

Oh the night is my world (you take my self, you take my self control)
City lights, painted girls (you got me livin' only for the night)
In the day nothing matters (before the morning comes the story's told)
It's the nighttime that flatters (you take my self, you take my self control)

I said I I live among the creatures of the night (you take my self, you take my self control)
I haven't got the will to try and fight (you take my self, you take my self control)
Against a new tomorrow (you take my self, you take my self control)
So I guess I just believe it that tomorrow never knows (you take my self, you take my self control)

Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my self control)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my self control)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my self control)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my self control)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my self control)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my self control)
Oh oh oh (you take my self, you take my self control)
