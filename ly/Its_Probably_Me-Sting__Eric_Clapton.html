		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you'd hug yourself on the cold, cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
But no one would you see
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me?
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
You're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
But no one would you see
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me?
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
Well, if there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
And there's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
One friendly face is all you need to see
And if there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

I hate to say it (I hate to say it)
I hate to say it (I hate to say it)
But it's probably me (it's probably me)
(It's probably me)
I hate to say it (I hate to say it)
I hate to say it (I hate to say it)
But it's probably me (it's probably me)
(It's probably me)
I hate to say it (it's probably me)
I hate to say it (it's probably me)
But it's probably me (it's probably me))
(It's probably me)
I hate to say it (it's probably me)
I hate to say it (it's probably me)
