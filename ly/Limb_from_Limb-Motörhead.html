		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I've never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life
Well, I've never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life
Come around any time you like, honey
There ain't no shame in my bed at night

Long-legged lover
I'm gonna rip you limb From limb
Long-legged lover
I'm gonna tear you limb From limb
Get you smashed as a rat in some bar
Sink my claws into your velvet skin

Oh!

Harsh, cruel words, babe
They're gonna cut me like a knife
Harsh, cruel words, babe
They're gonna cut me like a knife
I don't care what the hell you call me
But are ya still coming round tonight?

That's what I wanna know, hey!

I've never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life, my life, my life, my life
I've never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life, my life, my life, my life
Come around any time you like, honey
There ain't no shame in my bed at night, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
