		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On your knees please, oh yeah
Come get it, baby

You got ambition
Some motivation
I can see that I might be your new obsession
You got ambition
Need stimulation?
It ain't that easy, gotta work for my attention

You can try take your mind off the high
But it's all you'll ever think about again
You'll depend, try to pretend

That you ain't got a one track mind
On me all the time
You know you can't deny
You got a one track mind
I see all the signs
You can't leave me behind
You got a one track mind

You got ambition
Some motivation
I can see that I might be your new obsession
You got ambition
Need stimulation?
It ain't easy, gotta work for my attention

You can try take your mind off the high
But it's all you'll ever think about again
You'll pretend, try to pretend

That you ain't got a one track mind
On me all the time
You know you can't deny
You got a one track mind
I see all the signs
You can't leave me behind
You got a one track mind

Oh, honey
I see you looking at me
You wanna get a little piece
But, baby, you gotta work a bit harder
'Cause mama is not that easy to please

But it's all you'll ever think about again
You'll depend, try to pretend

That you ain't got a one track mind
On me all the time
You know you can't deny
You got a one track mind
I see all the signs
You can't leave me behind
You got a one track mind
