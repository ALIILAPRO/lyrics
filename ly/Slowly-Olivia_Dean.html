		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down in Margate had a sip of you
And it went straight to my head
I could've opened up, cried and almost been myself
But I took the piss instead

I find it hard, hard to be soft
Stop saying I'm perfect
'Cause clearly I'm not
Just need to catch
Catch my breath

Go slowly, slowly
I know you're not supposed to know me
But I only see it when you show me slowly
I'll have to teach you how to hold me
So go on, hold me

Remember when you called us both a cab
And forgot you had your bike
And the whole way home, I thought
"How's he keeping up with me?
He must be really into me"
As I fight the urge to fly

I find it hard, hard to be soft
Stop saying I'm perfect
Clearly I'm not
Just need to catch
Catch my breath

Go slowly, slowly
I know you're not supposed to know me
I only see it when you show me slowly
I'll have to teach you how to hold me
So go on, hold me

Go slowly, slowly
I know you're not supposed to know me
I only see it when you show me slowly
I'll have to teach you how to hold me
So go on, hold me

And maybe I'll be fine this time
And I'll let you see me in the light
Yeah, maybe I'll be fine
