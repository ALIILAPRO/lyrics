		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was on the street with no love
I know you would put some change in my cup
If I was down on my luck
Uh, you would pick me up
If ever I would breathe my last breath
I know you would put your hands on my chest
Sing to me and say, "God bless"
You would lift me up

Oh, oh
When I feel like I'm dying
Oh, oh

You come around with that good love, good love, good love
Make me feel like it's alright
Make me believe in this good life
Yeah, you pick me up
Good love, good love, good love
When I feel like I'm dying
You give me strength, help me find it
Yeah, that good, good love

Never have to doubt your faith
When I'm on my knees, you pray
When I'm broke, you don't break
You say, "You can make it"
You sure know how to save me baby

Oh, oh
Oh, when I feel like I'm drowning
Oh, oh

You come around with that good love, good love, good love
Make me feel like it's alright
Make me believe in this good life
Yeah, you pick me up
Good love, good love, good love
When I feel like I'm dying
You give me strength, help me find it
Yeah, that good, good love

And I can't thank you enough
For bringing me back to life
Yeah
And you make me feel like it's alright
Yeah, that good, good love
Good love, good love, good love
When I feel like I'm dying
You give me strength, help me find it
Whoa, yeah, that good, good love
Good, good love, whoa, yeah
