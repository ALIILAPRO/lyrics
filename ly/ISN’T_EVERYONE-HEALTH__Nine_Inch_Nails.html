		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna watch you drown
I will light the match that burns it all down
You got addicted, deep in 
Cast your spells
All the little piggies cannot help themselves
No, no, no, no, no

Just stop pretending you feel the same
If nothing matters, we're all to blame
We've all surrendered to those we serve
We get the world we all deserve

You faked eternity again
You think we'll turn away
I wanna know your bitterness, death it's real
You think we're turning into you
You think you got away
We wanna know your bitterness
Where do we go?
You faked eternity again
You think we'll turn away
We wanna hold you bitterness, death is real
You think we're turning into you
You think we'll turn away
We wanna hold your bitterness now

Just stop pretending you feel the same
If nothing matters, we're all to blame
We've all surrendered to those we serve
We get the world we all deserve

(Are you alone?) Just stop pretending
(Are you alone?) You feel the same
(Isn't everyone?) Nothing matters
(Isn't everyone?) We're all to blame
(Are you alone?) We all surrender
(Are you alone?) To those we serve
(Isn't everyone?) We get the world
(Isn't everyone?) We all deserve

Are you alone?
Are you alone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?

Are you alone?
Are you alone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?

Are you alone?
Are you alone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?

Are you alone?
Are you alone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
