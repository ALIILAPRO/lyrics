		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I'm always where the sun don't shine
The tears don't show
Won't hurt me now 'cause heart's been broke
I hate myself but it won't show
I constantly lose all my remorse
And it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd and it's
One for the sheep who
Led by a leopard, often
Gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a
Bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer, now I'm
Trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace
Where is this going? Hey
Heartless is recklessness, it is
Word of a pacifist to
Word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, my Lord I
Spoke to a baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I
Gave him one thing he needed
What is this thing I pleaded?
Boy, it's the key to Eden
Yeah

And as I spoke my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"
Anima vestra
Anima
Anima vestra
Anima
