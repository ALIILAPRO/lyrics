		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pain
Dig my feet into solid ground
Follow me into confrontation
Broken strains led to the life I've found
Challenge me til my sight is fading

Breaking skin just to test my sheathing
Tingling til I check on my breathing
Eyes turn black, no sight of leaving
Masochist led by life's mistreating

Take a breath until you choke

Three white lights that can take your life
For the will of the stone
To our brothers we must show
Why we carry this pride
While saying fuck your life
Strain until we die
Strain until we die
Strain until we die
Until you die
Strain until we die

Three white lights that can end your life
Three white lights that can end your life
We don't walk the same path of madness
Fuck you

Nothings gonna pay your last due

Don't try to pace your breathing
Strain til your heart stops beating

You're blind from the pressure cutting into your vision
Driving down your skull
This was your decision

Your
Pain
Bleed
Place more time
Don't fear
Tear pieces whole
Price
Bring pain
I swear
I find the price won

Let me
Strain
Strain
Strain
Strain
Let me bleed
Strain
Strain
Strain
Strain
Strain
