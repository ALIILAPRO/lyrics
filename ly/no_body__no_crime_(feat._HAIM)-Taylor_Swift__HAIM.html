		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He did it
He did it

Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losing sleep
Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my merlot on his mouth"
"That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says

"I think he did it but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Este wasn't there
Tuesday night at Olive Garden, at her job, or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out
'Cause

I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

They think she did it but they just can't prove it
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he died
