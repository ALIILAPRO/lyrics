		<p>
		  Ha! Uh! Ja
Yo Ninja, where the fuck you been bra?
Ons soek jou stem naaier, maak vol
Come on

Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Yeah muddafukka
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Yeah muddafukka
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Fuck 'em up

Hit me with that real rap, where your fuckin skillz at?
Every time I touch the mic they say, "You fuckin killed that!"
I fuck 'em up lights out, put the fuckin' mic down right now
Too cold too hold baby iced out
I had no help when I was flat broke
Hit the fuckin' lotto and I'm never looking back yo
Mad dough, rap shows generate the cash flow
"Damm bro! You went from a Jetta to a Lambo!"
Is it real, is it fake? Is it ill, is it lame, is it comedy?
Its easy to fake it to make it takes an anomaly
Its easy to not give a fuck when you're living in luxury
My people are starving it's fucked to be living in poverty
We raising our youth yo we open their brains with this poetry
We training the troops to shoot open the gates to the overseas
We changing the future, we fucked if we don't save the planet
I'm vegan as fuck, if they're not fully woke then I bang on 'em

Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Yeah muddafukka
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Yeah muddafukka
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Yeah muddafukka
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Yeah muddafukka
Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Bang on 'em! Fuck 'em up
