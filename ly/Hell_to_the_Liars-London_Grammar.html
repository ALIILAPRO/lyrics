		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hell to the liars
Here's to you and me
Hell to the best of us
Here's to you and me

Hell to the righteous ones
Here's to them

The grey-suited walkers
Prestigious men

Here's to the things you love
Here's to those you find in love
Hell to the rest of us
Here's to the things you love
Here's to the things you love

Those who are born with love
Here's to you trying

And I'm no better than those I judge
With all my suffering

Hell to the liars
Here's to you and me
I look way above us
Seeing no one free

Here's to the things you love
Here's to those you find in love
Hell to the rest of us
Here's to the things you love
Here's to the things you love

Here's to the things you love
Here's to those you find in love
Hell to the rest of us
Here's to the things you love
Here's to the things you love, uh uh
