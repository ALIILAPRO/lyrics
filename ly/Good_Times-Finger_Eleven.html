		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something has stuck in underneath my skin
Eyes all looking in for something within
Somewhere in here

Now everything I say gives this all away
Senses deadened again
Nothing lives today
Not in here

Here in your head

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?

Felt that I belonged 
And now I feel that gone
Where it all went wrong
I traced it all along
Back here again

There was something calling me to negativity
Dark covering me
Shrouding every scene I'm cast in

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?

Careful when you're feeling out of you're mind,
You should try to remember 
The strong lines in the spot light
Till you're feeling all right

Please answer
I'm calling just to find out
If you could be here for me when I crack
The answer came
I found it buried in the trash there
I saw it stare
I saw it stare
I saw it stare
I saw it stare

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?

Careful when you're feeling out of you're mind,
You should try to remember 
The strong lines in the spot light
Till you're feeling all right

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?
