		  I just been pullin' up shittin' on them all day, I stink (oh)
Yeah, I rock Chane'-ne', Double C, with that bitch on tint (oh)
Couldn't decide if I wanna get wet, I wanna get splished (oh)
I rock a big Rollie face on me, you can get splished (oh) 
Yeah

I just been pullin' up shittin' on them all day, I stink 
Yeah, I rock Chane'-ne', Double C, with that bitch on tint (yeah)
Couldn't decide if I wanna get wet, I wanna get splished
I rock a big Rollie face on me, you can get splished, uh (oh)
You can get ran, uh, uh, you can get splished, uh, uh
Couldn't decide if I put on the jacket or I put on the Ricks (yeah)
Couldn't decide if I bought me the jet or I bought me the flip (yeah)
I don't even know nobody at all, nobody exists (uh-huh)
I'm in the Hellcat burnin' up, she gon' bite her lip (uh-huh)
And she gon' bite on me, I think she gon' bite my tip (uh-huh), yeah
You could meet every one of my diamonds, they all chill (uh-huh)

I just pulled off in a GLE 
Bitch, I'ma park this shit up right on the curb, yeah
I can't even fuck with no penny-pinching bitch, it get on my nerve
Pulled up inside of the Lamb', made that bitch turn, made that bitch swerve
I just been clutchin' my Glock, get nervous
Who was the first ones rockin' that turb'?
Who was the first one to do this shit first?
If you keep bitin' my shit, then be worried
I'm finna shag that bitch, I'm finna scurry
I'm finna bust me a nut in a hurry
All of my diamonds, they mixin', McFlurry
Pull up, pull up, creepin', yeah, we lurk, yeah
Spilled him over, make him lurch
Every time I'm in the store, I purchase
I can't ever get off fuckin' Percs
Every day, I leave the fuckin' Earth (huh)
Least I'm bein' fuckin' real with you
Sometimes the truth hurt, yeah
Told my dawg I'll split a meal with you
All my twizzies come first, yeah
Told you that I keep it real with you
How the hell you made it worse? Yeah
How the hell you turn your back on us?
How the hell you stealin' Percs, dawg?

I just been pullin' up shittin' on them all day, I stink (oh)
Yeah, I rock Chane'-ne', Double C, with that bitch on tint (oh)
Couldn't decide if I wanna get wet, I wanna get splished (oh)
I rock a big Rollie face on me, you can get splished (oh) 
Yeah
