		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
Then put your hands up (Put your hands up)
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
Then put your hands up (Put your hands up)
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe (Sean Don! Okay, this, this)

This for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom walked out looking like a model
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo
On the moon, Who needs genies in a bottle girl
If they already got you

Boy you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy, to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
You know what I need (Eh!)
I know what you like (Eh!)
Put it all together baby we could be alright (Hey)
How could this be wrong
When it feels so right
Yeah, I really love you I really love you

And I'll never let you go
You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen
And you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

You got it, you got it babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
You got it, you got it babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)

And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you're on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time
You know what I need (Eh!)
I know what you like (Eh!)
Put it all together baby we could be alright (Hey)
How could this be wrong
When it feels so right
I really need you
I really love you whoa

And I'll never let you go
You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
Cause you listen
And you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there (What, Okay, What)
I'll always be right there

Now if all fell through it
Would you catch me before the pavement
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book, and numbers thicker than the dictionary
And bible I got to recycle
I love and I like you
Five course meals even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you

And I'll never let you go (I got you)
You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)
Right there
Cause you listen
And you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
You got it, I'll always be right there
Always be right there, you got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
