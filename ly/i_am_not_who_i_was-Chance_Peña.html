		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been living on the road
Made a buck off my soul
I've been singing stories to the crowd
It's been a while since I've been home
I think about you every night
Wonder what it would've been like
If I stuck around and settled down
Maybe in another life

So if I fly too far
Will I still have a place inside your heart?
And when you see what I've become
Will you love me for who I am, not who I was?

You keep me steady on the ground
When my head's lost in the clouds
That spotlight, though it shines bright
Could never drown you out
I know it's hard when I'm away
I'll just hope you don't lose faith
'Cause I told the truth when I said to you
That I'll be back someday

So if I fly too far
Will I still have a place inside your heart?
And when you've seen what I've become
Will you love me for who I am, not who I was?

Will you love me for who I am, not who I was?
