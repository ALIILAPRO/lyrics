		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You want it straight
But I've got too much on my plate

Cut by the strings
Let's see what good this love brings

We can talk about it
Yeah we can talk about it
But we only ever talk about it
We only ever talk about it

We might pretend
We might dream ways this could end

We seem so sure
But I don't know what we're dreaming for

We can talk about it
Yeah we can talk about it
But we only ever talk about it
We only ever talk about it
