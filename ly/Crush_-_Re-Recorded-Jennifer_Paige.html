		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, crush, ah

I see ya blowin' me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on, baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not over analyze
Don't go too deep with it, baby (baby)

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do
I'll play loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la

It's raising my adrenaline
You're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it, baby (baby)
You say the word "forevermore"
That's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is "maybe" (maybe)

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me (crazy over you and me)
Here's what I'll do
I'll pay loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la

Vanilla skies (vanilla skies)
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do
Depends on you
