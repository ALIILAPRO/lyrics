		  (Wake up, F1lthy)
Phew, phew, phew (woo), yeah (yeah)
I feel the crank comin' on, lil bitch, it's burnin' (ooh, woo)
My wifey say she love me, I bought her a Birkin (woo)
It's simple to get like this, you just don't deserve it (uh-uh)
I fucked the whole game up, bitch, I start the service (phew)
They asked why I crashed the Benz, I don't give no purpose (skrrt, woo)
I been takin' the Perc' for anxiety, but I don't get nervous (ha, ha)
They be high talkin' crazy, they don't really got courage (phew, ooh)
At the top of the basement broke as hell, I was eatin' on porridge (woo, yeah)
I done poured a deuce of that Wock' and a line of flourish (ooh)
You could tell they don't really got money, you could tell they malnourished (woo, yeah)
I don't even flex a lot, but when I do, got peoples embarrassed (yeah, woo)
Tapped in with the fashion, pulled up on Virgil outside in Paris (ooh, woo)
I'm knowin' this album 'bout to go platinum, put it on my parents (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
I don't got time to be shit talkin', you could speak to the carats (no way)
They watchin' everything I do, and repeat it like parrots (phew, brrt)
And to be honest, they can't even do it like me so I could care less (uh)

Half a Perc' mixed with a bean, bitch, I could feel this
I told the dealership I'm a star, put it in the ceilings
I just went up, up (ack)
I just went up, up and it's stuck
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve
Yeah, I been high as the birds, birds, birds, birds, birds
I got a twin on the way and he lurk, lurk, lurk, lurk, lurk
I just pulled up on the side and I swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (skrr)
I really went to the crank and it hurt, it burn 
I learn, I did it again, bitch, it's my turn (uh-huh)
We see you sittin' 'round the place, we lurking 
Yeah, we hit you up, we left your ass nourished
I just be taking the X with the Perc' 
And they know that for sure that I'm leavin' the earth
I just keep doin' what I'm doing 
No, I don't listen to shit, lil' bitch, I don't learn
