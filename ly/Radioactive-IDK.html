		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Glocks up, switches on
Cock it when you hear this song
Glocks up, switches on
Cock it when you hear this, hear this
Ready, radioactive shit
Ready, radioactive shit
We ready, radioactive shit
Ready, radioactive shit

Confetti, one of my opps is dead
Machete, chopper gon' chop that head
Alright, who the fuck want it now?
We gon' get 'em in the day
We don't ever gotta wait 'til the sun go down
Shots, shots, one more round
Throw another party, make 'em go down
If we got a problem, make 'em go away 
(One, two, three) hooray
We don't play, same block all day
And my opps eat, we don't block no play
Just pull up on your block and spray (hey)

Hop in a freak, go infinity (ooh)
Up on a shirt where you finna be (ooh)
Heard that you said you gon' finish me (ooh)
Why he be movin' so finicky? Hey
Nigga be talkin' that talk now
Ride but you said that you walked down
Where all the guns that you bought now? 
(Like Marvin) let's get it on now

Ready, radioactive shit
Ready, radioactive shit
We ready (ooh), radioactive shit (ooh)
Ready (ooh), radioactive shit (ooh)

Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this song (active)
Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this, hear this (active)
Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this song (active)
Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this, hear this

Daylight, city lights
Dark out, but it's still bright
Still got the steel, make 'em still-still
I just need a motive and a earth pill
Moonlight, daylight
Never leave 'em mad, I gotta' stay tight
Tied a nigga up, make 'em take flight
It's on tonight (ohh)
Tried to spin back, make 'em stop, delay(ohh)
Fuck the police like I'm dr. Dre
Tryna off me, nigga, not today (oh)
Hit a nigga up then go out the way
Hit a nigga with the slide, no time to talk (ohh)
Had to realize I was right or wrong
Ain't no back and forth, ping pong
Now we at your door, ding-dong

Hop in a freak, go infinity (ooh)
Up on a shirt where you finna be (ooh)
Heard that you said you gon' finish me (ooh)
Why he be movin' so finicky? Hey
Nigga be talkin' that talk now
Ride but you said that you walked down
Where all the guns that you bought now? 
(Like Marvin) let's get it on now

Ready, radioactive shit (oh, oh, ohh, let's get it on now)
Ready, radioactive shit (oh, ohh, let's get it on now)
We ready, radioactive shit (oh, oh, ohh, let's get it on now)
Ready, radioactive shit (oh, oh, ohh, let's get it on now)

Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this song (let's get it on now, active)
Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this, hear this (let's get it on now, active)
Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this song (let's get it on now, active)
Glocks up, switches on (tryna get active)
Cock it when you hear this, hear this (let's get it on now)

Let's get it on now
Let's get it on now
Let's get it on now
Let's get it on now
