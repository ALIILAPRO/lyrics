		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a look around yourself
And see what I see
Persecuted eyes, look down on me
I can't take no more of what I took before
Help me please I'm falling down
Desolation valley now

Take a look around yourself
And see what I see
Imagination merged with reality
You won't see no more like you did before
Watch yourself you're falling down
Desolation valley now

Wind of change tide of time
Is it real or is it just my mind
Turn the key open your door
Don't make believe you've seen this before
