		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bravi, bravi, bravissimi!

Where in the world
Have you been hiding?
Really - you were perfect
I only wish
I knew your secret
Who is this new
Tutor?

Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here

Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside, hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius

Christine, Christine you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you

Angel of music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory

Who is this angel?
This

Angel of music, hide no longer
Secret and strange angel

He's with me even now

Your hands are cold

All around me

Your face, Christine, it's white

It frightens me

Don't be frightened
