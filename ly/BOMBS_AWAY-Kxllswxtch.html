		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, bombs away (bombs away)
So much on my mind, think my head's exploding
Voices in my head, it's kinda hard to feel lonely
Wanna let it bang inside my brain (inside my brain)
The thought of my life is getting hard for me to stomach
So I'ma look away from all my problems, keep running 
And running, and running

Day after day, livin' life in a fade
Everything that brings me joy brings pain
All the things I hated once, I became
All I do is hurt people, I don't wanna
Go outside and see everybody's faces, it
Bothers me just to watch everyone fakin' it
Close my eyes and imagine the world vacant, dead
Or alive, either way, it's all the same in the

End
Tomorrow begins
With or without you there

Hey, bombs away (bombs away)
So much on my mind, think my head's exploding
Voices in my head, it's kinda hard to feel lonely
Wanna let it bang inside my brain (inside my brain)
The thought of my life is getting hard for me to stomach
So I'ma look away from all my problems, keep running 
And running, and running
