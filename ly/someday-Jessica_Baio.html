		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never met your dad
You lost him when you were just 10

I know you wish he was here
So you could leave him a call or a message
But there’s no cell reception in heaven

But if he were here, he would tell you you’re strong
And thank you for taking good care of your mom
I could say he’s been there all along
But that can’t come from anyone else

Someday he’ll tell you himself
Someday he’ll tell you himself

If I could just change the past
I’d want to give you the chance

For you tell him goodbye
It all happened too fast
Forced to face the cruel fact

That you couldn’t just say what you wanted to say
Before life was so ruthless and ripped him away
Cause it’s never been fair that you lived through that pain
But you did

And if he were here, he would tell you you’re strong
And thank you for taking good care of your mom
And say more than I can put in a song
Cuz that can’t come from anyone else

Someday he’ll tell you himself
Someday he’ll tell you himself

I never met your dad
But I feel like I know him through you
