		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was walking down a one way street
Just a-lookin' for someone to meet
One woman, who was looking for a man
Now I'm hopin' (hopin') that the feeling is right
And I'm wonderin' (wonderin') if you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming (I don't wanna be lonely, baby, please tell me)
I wanna love you all over

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe it's true?
Do you believe in love?
Oh, you're making me believe it too

Now the feeling is beginning to grow
And the meaning is something you only know
If you believe it, take my hand and I'll take your heart
Come on
Now I wonder (wonder) where does true love begin?
I'm going under (under), so I'm lettin' you in
My woman (I don't wanna be lonely, baby, please tell me)
I wanna love you all over

(Do you believe in love?)
Do you believe in love?
(Do you believe it's true?)
You believe that it's true?
(Do you believe in love?)
Oh, you're making me believe it too
Yeah

(I used to have you in a photograph)
I'm so glad it's changed
(But now I've got you and it's gonna last)
Do you believe in love?

(Do you believe in love?)
(Do you believe it's true?)
I'm so glad, I'm so glad
(Do you believe in love?)
Oh, you're making me believe it too, yeah

(Wee-ooh, ooh-oh, ooh-ooh)
Do you believe in love?
(Wee-ooh, ooh-oh, wee-ooh)
Do you believe it's true?
(Wee-ooh, ooh-oh, ooh-ooh)
Do you believe in the love?
(Wee-ooh, ooh-oh, wee-ooh)
I believe in love too
(Wee-ooh, ooh-oh, ooh-ooh)
