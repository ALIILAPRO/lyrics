		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck

I just spent too many minutes 
Watching little videos of shitty wannabe rappers dissing me
I just spent the winter living 
After someone tryna send a kill shot, missing me
Young blonde don and the double-X mob got a gang out in Sicily
Why you think they call me "The Gunner"? 
I'm popping off on anybody if they trigger me

Black and yellow jacket on like I'm Kill Bill
Grew up scrapping and I still will
We can take it back to 2012
I was trapping on the tour bus with Meek Mill
Take it back to Cleveland, 
When they gave chase, 17 years, no plea deal
2014, when the people try to rob me in the lobby
I bet they can feel the feet still
Point out my enemies soon as they mention me
Call an assembly, pick up a pen and put you out your misery
Written in history, it was gonna happen eventually
I just can't wait until the day I run into you physically
For everything that I went through mentally
When it felt like everybody in the world was against me
When all the critics and every article trying to offend me
My daughter slapped a kid for talking 'bout me in elementary

We ain't playing, it's deeper than the thing
People getting checked for disrespecting the Philly name
Two chopsticks, no lo mein
Hollow tips, got no name
Bust them shit's with no aim
Like it's Bird Box but the blindfold is a black flag
This time it come from a face
The dashcam just saw me kill on everybody

I got off on floor 13, no in between
I roll my weed with fronto leaf
I chop my coke on hotel keys
I chop this face like Constantine
Constantly get deja vu
I see me when I look at you
I never die, I multiply
So don't cry at my funeral

I just spent too many minutes 
Watching little videos of shitty wannabe rappers dissing me
I just spent the winter living 
After someone tryna send a kill shot, missing me
Young blonde don and the double-X mob got a gang out in Sicily
Why you think they call me "The Gunner"? 
I'm popping off on anybody if they trigger me

What would this generation of hip-hop be
Without me here to piss y'all off
I see the blogs, I read the comments
I'm confused, I need to pause
Look at y'all waiting on me to fall off
While I'm looking at y'all from a suite in the Waldorf
I sold 40 million records, I ain't even 30
Give me twenty seconds, I'll list ten movies that I been in
One legend that tried to fuck with me and got the venom
One publication that said that I will never be in it
One agent that told me without it, my career was be finished
And I couldn't give a single fuck inside my cerebellum
Y'all award shows suck, go tell 'em
We ain't sucking no dick in the 21-6
Bro, I always should've landed like Beckham
On the thirteenth floor with a weapon

I heard that they call me, yeah, let 'em in
I got something for 'em, yeah
Please forgive my sins
Blood on my Ralph Lauren, yeah
I can't wash this shit
Wake up, say, "Good morning," yeah
Like I forgot

I got off on floor 13, no in between
I roll my weed with fronto leaf
I chop my coke on hotel keys
I chop this face like Constantine
Constantly get deja vu
I see me when I look at you
I never die, I multiply
So don't cry at my funeral

Hotel Diablo
