		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'm taking it all for us
I'm taking it all
Taking it all for us
Oh, I'm doing it all for love
I'm doing it all
Doing it all for love

Taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah

Too much in my system (famine, famine)
Money MIA (pockets hella empty)
Mama making ends meet (making ends meet)
Working like a slave (Mississippi, ay, ay)
Daddy ain't at home, no (father, father)
Gotta be a man (Michael Corleone)
Do it for my homegrowns (sisters, brothers)
Do it for the fam (yeah, so tell 'em, Labby)

Ay (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just for your love, yeah, I'll (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Give you the world (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Mona Lisa's smile (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hey (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hell, I'll do twenty-five to life (oh, oh, oh, oh)
If it makes me a king (oh, oh, oh, oh)
A star in your eyes (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Guilty or innocent
My love is infinite, I'm giving it
No need for prisoners
Bitch, please, hands up
This is a stickup, 'cause I'm

Hey, yeah
I'm taking it
Yeah-eah
I'm taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah

Guess you figured my two times two 
Always equates to one
Dreamers are selfish
When it all comes down to it
I hope one of you come back 
To remind me of who I was
When I go disappear
Into that good night
(Good night, good night, good night, good night)

I'm taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah
