		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the time I was a little boy
All my senses were in bloom
The forests were adventure
There dwelt the legends of my mind

I was the keeper of the golden key
I made all the rules i only had to dream
To create the scene

Magic is a child imagination is alive
Magic is imagination a child is alive

How the trees were so high
The cheese in the sky
Were part of my imagination
I was goblins and elves
With small mushroom shelves
As brothers Grimm would tell their stories

Opening my eyes in the morning I would see
Patterns in the trees making shapes that
Were a face to me

In those tireless times
And those carefree lines
That we draw ourselves
But they're never kept

I know magic is a child imagination is alive
Magic is imagination a child is alive

Magic is a child imagination is alive
Magic is a child
Alive as a child's imagination
