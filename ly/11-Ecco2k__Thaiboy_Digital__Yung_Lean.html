		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loss and gain, is the same

I can't lose more sleep over you now
Just this last time
Kiss goodbye, I look for a way out
Make a wish on D-9
Pass my time, go slide on the green line
I don't play, fast forward and rewind
Press pause and I freeze time
(And I throw up the peace sign)

I don't want a one last time
I swear to you, I don't mind
Yeah, I swear I'm fine
Vodka tonic with ice and lime
(Ooh, you're one of a kind)
Ooh, swear it's a waste of time
Ever since I came into your life, I've been losing mine

I don't press stop, I don't rewind
Sad money mafia and D-9
Stockholm on ice, and I see signs
And I got stripes like Adidas
They wanna look like us and be us
ThaiBoy goon, GTB
We sailing for the stars only
Stars only
We sailing for the stars only

We sailing for the stars only
We sailing for the stars
We sailing for the stars only (stars only)
You know me
We sailing for the stars only
Stars only
ThaiBoy goon, GTB
We sailing for the stars only
(You already know, you already know)
We sailing for the stars only
(If you love me then show me)
(We sailing for the stars only)

I can't lose more sleep over you now
But just this last time
Kiss goodbye, I look for a way out
Make a wish on D-9
Pass my time, go slide on the green line
I don't play, fast forward and rewind
Press pause and I freeze time
(And I throw up the peace sign)

I don't want a one last time
I swear to you, I don't mind
Yeah, I swear I'm fine
Vodka tonic with ice and lime
(Ooh, you're one of a kind)
Ooh, swear it's a waste of time
Ever since I came into your life, I've been losing mine

(Ooh, you're one of a kind)
(Ooh ooh ooh, swear it's a waste of time)
You remind me of no one, you're the only one
(Someday I know I'll cross paths with you)
You're the only one (who can see right through me)
You're the only one (you're the only one)
