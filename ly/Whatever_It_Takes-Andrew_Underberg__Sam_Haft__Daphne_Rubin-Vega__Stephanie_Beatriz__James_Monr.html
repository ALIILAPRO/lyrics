		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What weighs on your soul, old friend?
I implore you to share the load
If it was thou who slew the angel
Why not let your strength be known?

I always thought that I would keep blood off my face
But when that thing attacked, I had to act
To cross that line and keep them safe
But if anyone knew, then all of Hell would rise to war
And who's to say who'd survive the fray?
I might lose the ones that I was killing for
So I, I'll be your keeper
Do whatever it takes, I'll make the mistakes
I'll keep you safe and keep this secret

When I saw your face
You made me feel like a stranger in a brand new place
And it felt so good to be understood
But there's so much I wished that I could say
So I, I'll be your armor
Do whatever it takes, I'll make the mistakes
I'll spend my life being your partner

And I don't know what we might face
But I know I can't replace you
So I'll do anything to save you

And I will try to make your dreams come true

Whatever we go through
I know I, I'll be your keeper
I'll be your armor
Whatever it takes, I'll make the mistakes
I'll make the mistakes
Whatever it takes
