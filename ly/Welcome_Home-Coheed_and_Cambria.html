		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could have been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the surest of favors

But if you really loved me
You would've endured my will
Well if you're just as I presumed
A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
And if so here we stop
Then never again will you see this in your life

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest, is our love ever low
With truth on the shores of confession
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played letter
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep

But if you could just write me out
To neverless wonder, happy will I become?
Be true that this is no option
So with sin, I condemn you
Demon pray, demon out

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever low
With truth on the shores of confession
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

One last kiss for you
One more wish 'til you
Please make up your mind, girl
I'll do anything for you

One last kiss for you
One more wish 'til you
Please make up your mind, girl
Before I hope you die
