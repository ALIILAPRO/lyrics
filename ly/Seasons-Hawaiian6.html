		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The path
I just walked and walked
but I could not see anything
When I realized I was all alone,
no one was around
Dream I just tried to catch
but I could not reach anywhere
It's all because of the time
I spited to the ground
and walked away
Drenched by the freezing rain
Blown away by the sultry wind
Lost it is way on the way down
Just wondering all alone
in nowhere
Sank in the city toxin
And left by the changing seasons
And the seed could not sprout
Was rotted with
it's shell around
Seasons change
Summer brings the joy
Autumn brings the sorrow
Winter brings the end
Spring brings the dawn
Over again
Seasons show us all
How hard to live through
your own life
Must know who you are

If you just listen the voices
of the nature calling us
The winds are singing
with the rain dance
Seasons shine
Don't just keep ask for it
And stand strong on the ground
with your foot
Grow a root so you won't fall
from where you are
Seasons change
Summer brings the joy
Autumn brings the sorrow
Winter brings the end
Spring brings the dawn
Over again
Seasons show us all
How hard to live through
your own life
Bud will show
it's face Between the
thick white snow
Then it will shine
a light of the life
Then it will shine
a brand new light of life
Even the seed of hope won't
shoot if you just hold
Then it will shine
a light of the life
Then it will shine
a brand new light of life
You will know
when seasons change
