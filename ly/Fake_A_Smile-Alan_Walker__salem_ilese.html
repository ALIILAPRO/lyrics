		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I, up all night
Nothing's wrong, nothing's right
I swear these walls are upside down
Swear the roof is on the ground
Demons don't sleep at night
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I try to turn off my mind
Say I'm doing just fine
But I'm screaming inside like (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Say these words on repeat
While I'm trying to breathe
Now you're counting on me

So I fake a smile
But I know you know me too well
But it's alright
You're like heaven when I'm in hell

You were their heavy heart
Tasted light but fed the dark
I'm waiting for them all to see
I don't deserve your company
To love myself is way too hard
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I try to turn off my mind
Say I'm doing just fine
But I'm screaming inside like (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Say these words on repeat
While I'm trying to breathe
Now you're counting on me

So I fake a smile
But I know you know me too well
But it's alright
You're like heaven when I'm in hell

(No sleep)
(It's alright)
(No sleep)

So I fake a smile
But I know you know me too well (oh-oh, know you know me too well)
But it's alright
You're like heaven when I'm in hell

Yeah, so I fake a smile
But I know you know me too well (oh-oh, know you know me too well)
But it's alright
You're like heaven when I'm in hell

So I fake a smile
But I know you know me too well
But it's alright
You're like heaven when I'm in hell
