		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heavy metal love of mine
I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway
'Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

Motorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway
We should have left Las Vegas
And then began again
Took your bike to Detroit
Back to the promised land

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
See you walking on that blue Pacific
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turning tan and you look terrific
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses
He loved guns and roses (oh)
Guns and roses (oh)
He loved guns and roses (oh)
He loved guns (oh)
And roses (roses), roses (roses), roses (roses)

Roses, roses, roses
