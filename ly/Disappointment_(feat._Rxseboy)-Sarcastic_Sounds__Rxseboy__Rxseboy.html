		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a disappointment
I stay up, take drugs and miss appointments
Then complain about the outcome of my choices
It feels pointless when I try to avoid all of the thoughts in my head

Lately I just wait on
One good reason I should even try to wake up
'Cause that shit feels like a motherfucking day job
With no days off, I hope I get laid off to lay in my bed, my bed
(You made your bed now you lie in it)

And my eyes went red 'cause I'm cryin' again
Looking for love, all I find is a mess
So I break my heart for the sake of my art
Hope it makes me a star 'cause I'm lost in the dark
I'm lost in the dark
And it's so hard to see when all damn day you're sound asleep

I'm a disappointment
I stay up, take drugs and miss appointments
Then complain about the outcome of my choices
It feels pointless when I try to avoid all of the thoughts in my head

Lately I just wait on
One good reason I should even try to wake up
'Cause that shit feels like a motherfucking day job
With no days off, I hope I get laid off to lay in my bed, my bed
("What time is it? Oh my gosh I'm late for work again")

Yo', I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
In my mama crib, kinda feeling like I'm twelve
I would throw my whole allowance in the fountain, empty out my bank account
But with my luck it probably wouldn't even help

Dawg, I got no job, no mic, with a girl I don't like
Nothing ever goes right, I'm tight (for real)
I told myself I'm gonna be fine almost a million times
I know that I can do whatever it takes (i got it)
But when it all crumbles and crashes I'll be back on my ass
And I already know what I'm gonna say

I'm a disappointment
I stay up, take drugs and miss appointments
Then complain about the outcome of my choices
It feels pointless when I try to avoid all of the thoughts in my head

Lately I just wait on
One good reason I should even try to wake up
'Cause that shit feels like a motherfucking day job
With no days off, I hope I get laid off to lay in my bed, my bed
