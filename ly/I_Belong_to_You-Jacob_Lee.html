		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could be honest
Here in this moment
I've been so nervous
To stand here with you
They're all here for us
And I feel their aura
But just for a moment
I'll pretend it's just you

Yes they can hear us
But they don't understand
I have said all of my vows behind the curtains
I know they see us
But they don't stand a chance
I have kissed those lips a thousand times before this

Tomorrow I'll open my eyes 
And I will whisper to my wife
I belong to you
And I will wait to hear you say
As a tear rolls down your face
I belong to you

If I could be honest
Here at the altar
I refuse to grow older
Unless it's with you
I fell in love
And made you a promise
Though I'd never noticed
How much it meant to you

Yes they can hear us 
But they misunderstand
There are more behind these words that we have spoken
Yes they can see us
But only at a glance
Only you know the man that I am beyond the surface

Tomorrow I'll open my eyes
And I will whisper to my wife
I belong to you
And I will wait to hear you say
As a tear rolls down your face
I belong to you

I belong with you
When they let us choose
I will say I do
I belong with you
When they let us choose
I will say I do

Tomorrow I'll open my eyes
And I will whisper to my wife
I belong to you
And I will wait to hear you say
As a tear rolls down your face
I belong to you
