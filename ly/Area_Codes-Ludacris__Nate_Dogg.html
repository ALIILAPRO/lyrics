		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got hoes
I've got hoes
In different area codes (area)
Area codes (codes)
Hoes, hoes, hoes
In different area codes (area)
Area codes (codes)

Now you thought I was just (hoes) 7-7-0 and 4-0-4?
I'm worldwide, bitch, act like y'all don't know
It's the abominable ho man
Globe-trot international postman
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8's, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2, 3-1-3 (oh), 2-1-5, 8-0-tree's (oh)
Read your horoscope and eat some hors d'oeuvres
Ten on pump one, these hoes is self serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0's, my cell phone just overloads

I've got hoes
I've got hoes
In different area codes (area)
Area codes (codes)
Hoes, hoes, hoes
In different area codes (area)
Area codes (codes, I've got hoes)

Now every day is a ho-liday
So stop the violence and put the .44 away, skeet, shoot a ho today
5-0-4, 9-7-2
7-1-tree, what you gon' do?
You checking out the scene, I'm checking a ho tonight
With perpendicular vehicular homicide
3-1-4, 2-0-1 (hey)
Too much green, too much fun (hey)
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the Thrilla in Manilla
Schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop, Magic, Don Juan
Man, after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfucking phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slangin' this dick like a New Jack, biatch

Is it 'cause they like my gangsta walk? (Gangsta walk)
Is it 'cause they like my gangsta talk? (Gangsta talk)
Is it 'cause they like my handsome face? (Handsome face)
Is it 'cause they like my gangsta ways? (Gangsta ways, ooh)
Whatever it is, they love it
And they just won't let me be (won't let me be)
I handle my biz, don't rush me (area)
Just relax and let me be free (codes)
Whenever I call (I call), come running
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball (I ball), stop fronting (area)
Or I'll call my substitute freak (codes)

I've got hoes
I've got hoes
In different area codes (area)
Area codes (codes)
Hoes, hoes, hoes
In different area codes (area)
Area codes (codes)
I've got (uh) hoes

9-1-6, 4-1-5, 7-0-4
Shout out to the 2-0-6
Everybody in the 8-0-8
Ha, ah, 2-1-6, 7-0-2, 4-1-4
3-1-7, 2-1-4's and the 2-8-1's
3-3-4, 2-0-5, I see y'all
Uh, uh, 3-1-8 and the 6-0-1's, 2-0-tree
8-0-4, 4-0-2, 3-0-1
9-0-4, 4-0-7, 8-5-0
7-0-8, 5-0-2
Hoes in different area codes, know that
Southern Hoes-pitality, Norther Exhoes-ure
Haha, ho ridin' on the West Coast
Ya understand what I'm saying?
Uh, uh, hocus pocus, you the dopest
Uh, hoes to the right, hoes to the left
Five hoes this time (woo)
Ho no, haha
The Hip-Hop ho-llercoaster, that's what we we on right now
Haha, no need to get all ho-stile, yeah, woo
Def Jam South, baby, Disturbing Tha Peace
Jazze Pheezy, Uncle Face
Ludacris, uh, hoes
I'm sweatin' like a motherfucker
