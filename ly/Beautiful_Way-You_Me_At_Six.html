		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is a drug but it never comes with a warning
When the comedown comes you know you're gonna be in mourning
A push-and-pull courtship, yeah, it betrayed us
And now I need something else to fill the space up

Oh, I read between the lines
Holding onto better times
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I wanna take back what was mine
But only you can change your mind
I won't let it go, I won't let it go

So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way

(Hey
Hey
Hey)

We're fucked up in a beautiful way

Love is a drug but it never comes with a warning
And if you cut me out, you'll never hear my side of the story

Oh, I read between the lines
Holding onto better times
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I wanna take back what was mine
But only you can change your mind
I won't let it go, I won't let it go

So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way

(Hey
Hey
Hey)

Oh love, love
I won't let it go, I won't let it go
Oh love, love
I won't let it go, I won't let it go

So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way

(Hey)
Oh no, yeah
(Hey)
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
