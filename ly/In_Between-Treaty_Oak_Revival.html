		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a problem
Since I've hit rock bottom
I'm hoping we can make things right
My mind Is wandering
You're looking hotter than
West Texas summertime
Back in the day
We had our day in the shade
But now things ain't lookin up
It's plain to see
That we were meant to be
But now I don't give a fuck
I wish you'd bring a little more to the table
I wish you'd tell me something good
I'm willing to waste my time
And walk that line way longer than I probably should
Go on and tell me what you're wanting
Go on and tell me what you need
Cause I put up a hell of a fight
Just to get caught right
In the middle of the in between
I wish you'd tell me something good
That empty bottle looks kinda how you left me
'Cause there ain't no good left inside
I stopped the loving you
Way before you asked me to
I was just along for the ride
And you ain't opposed
To digging up bones
Bringing up the things from your past
But either way
I think it's safe to say
That this thing ain't gonna last
I wish you'd bring a little more to the table
I wish you'd tell me something good
I'm willing to waste my time
And walk that line way longer than I probably should
Go on and tell me what you're wanting
Go on and tell me what you need
'Cause I put up a hell of a fight
Just to get caught right
In the middle of the in between
Why don't you tell me something
I wish you'd bring a little more to the table
I wish you'd tell me something good
I'm willing to waste my time
And walk that line way longer than I probably should
Go on and tell me what you're wanting
Go on and tell me what you need
'Cause I put up a hell of a fight
Just to get caught right
In the middle of the in between
I wish you'd bring a little more to the table
I wish you'd tell me something good
I'm willing to waste my time
And walk that line way longer than I probably should
Go on and tell me what you're wanting
Go on and tell me what you need
'Cause I put up a hell of a fight
Just to get caught right
In the middle of the in between
I wish you'd tell me something
I wish you'd tell me something good
