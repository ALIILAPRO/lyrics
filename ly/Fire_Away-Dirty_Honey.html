		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're harder than stone
We lead from your throne
We stand on the fault of the battle lines

With a hand on your chest
We die with the rest
We end with the wool still over your eyes

When you start all over
When you start all over
No ones feels the way we used to feel

When you start all over
Yeah you start all over
Coming down from where we used to be

So Fire Away
Whatever you say-yeah
Will only lead, lead me from the masquerade

Fire Away
Whatever you say-yeah
Will only lead, lead me from the masquerade

The hands that you shake
Can never create
The wings that you need when you want to fly

That you wanted to see
Has left you deceived
As you stand on the edge, to take your flight

When you start all over
You start all over
And no ones feels the way we used to feel

I say you start all over
You start all over
Coming down from where we used to be

So Fire Away
Whatever you say-yeah
Will only lead, lead me from the masquerade

Fire Away
Whatever you say-yeah
Will only lead, lead me from the masquerade

And when its over
And when its something down will you be saved?
Cause no ones left to save the ones
who played, to save the ones who played

You start all over
You start all over
And no ones feels the way we used to feel

You start all over
You start all over
Coming down from where we used to be

So Fire Away
Whatever you say-yeah
Will only lead, lead me from the masquerade

Fire Away
Whatever you say-yeah
Will only lead, lead me from the masquerade

Lead me from the masquerade
Lead me from the masquerade
Lead me from the masquerade
