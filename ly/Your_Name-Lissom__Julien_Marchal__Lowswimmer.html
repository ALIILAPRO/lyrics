		<p>
		  Come get your name reanimate, I lose
Come set your frame assassinate, I lose

It was in the morning you came a calling
I won't be there with you

Come stake your claim recalculate, I lose
Congratulations you emigrated, I lose you

It was in the morning i came a calling
I won't be there with you

Come, get me out
I don't wanna be without or with you
Be there with you something about you
Is making me lock up, guess I lose
Be there with you

Be there with you be there with you
Be there with you
