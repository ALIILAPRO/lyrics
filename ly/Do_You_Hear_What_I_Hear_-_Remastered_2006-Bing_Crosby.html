		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you hear what I hear? (Hear what I hear)
Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see? (Do you see what I see?)
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see? (Do you see what I see?)
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? (Do you hear what I hear?)
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? (Do you hear what I hear?)
A song, a song high above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty King
Do you know what I (do you know) Know? (what I know, know what I know)
In your palace warm, mighty King
Do you know what I (do you know) Know? (what I know, know what I know)
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I (listen) say (to what I say)
Pray for peace, people, everywhere
Listen to what I (listen) say (to what I say)
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
