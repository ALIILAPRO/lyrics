		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the revenant came down
We couldn't imagine what it was
In the spirit of three stars
The alien thing that took its form

Then to Lebanon, oh, God
The flashing at night, the sirens grow and grow
(Oh history involved itself)
Mysterious shade that took its form (or what it was)
Incarnation, three stars
Delivering signs and dusting from their eyes
