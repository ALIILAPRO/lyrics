		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want to find myself homogenized
Don't want to become the very thing that I despised
Don't need my mommy feeding me culture with a spoon
Don't want to end up with as much edge as a balloon
Don't want my ideas polluted by mediocrity
Don't want my sentiments diluted
This is important to me

I tried to give my best to you
But you plugged up your ears
And now I just can't take no more
I've had it up to here

Don't want to be the another boy next door
Don't want to pander to the masses anymore
Don't need the whole wide world to love me
Don't want to win the human race
Don't want my music to be less well-known than my face
Don't want to compromise my art for universal appeal
Don't want to be mass consumed
I'm not a happy meal

I tried to give my best to you
But you plugged up your ears
And now I just can't take no more
I've had it up to here

I moved out from the sticks
Nobody believed in me
Had to climb my way up
Overcome all kinds of adversity

Oh, if you think I need approval from the faceless throng
That's where you're wrong
So wrong

I tried to give my best to you
But you plugged up your ears
And now I just can't take no more
I've had it up to here

I've had it
I've had it
I've had it up to here
