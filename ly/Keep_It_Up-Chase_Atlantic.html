		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She leaves her phone in the middle of every dark room now
She fills her nose up a little right on the bathroom floor
Oh, slow down, I think this shit is killing your brain
She said, "It's hard to explain but babe, I think we feel the same kind of way"

Well, give it up or, baby, just give it away
She don't ever wanna stop, never wanna stop doing her thing
Well, keep it up, keep it up, keep riding the wave
Well, baby, keep it up, baby, keep it up riding the wave

Over obsessive with every second I waste her time
She gets aggressive the very second she takes that line
Well, calm down, I hate to see that look on your face
She said it's hard to escape but girl, I think you've gotta give it a break

Well, give it up or, baby, just give it away
She don't ever wanna stop, never wanna stop doing her thing
Well, keep it up, keep it up, keep riding the wave
Well, baby, keep it up, baby, keep it up riding the wave

Move slow, I don't wanna get in your way
Well the words in your mouth sound cool but I'd rather be kissing your waist
She said, "Clean blow, I don't think I'm feeling my face
Don't go, please don't make me beg you to stay"

Well, give it up or, baby, just give it away
She don't ever wanna stop, never wanna stop doing her thing
Well, keep it up, keep it up, keep riding the wave
Well, baby, keep it up, baby, keep it up riding the wave
