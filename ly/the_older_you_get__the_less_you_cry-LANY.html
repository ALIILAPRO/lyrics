		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in love at seventeen
Had to make a choice, either her or my dreams
And I fell in love on the road
But that was a long time ago
I fell for the wrong girl
The type to start a fire and leave you there to burn
And I found a way to stay alive
But something in me that day died

How does anyone make it out better?
Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?
I barely made it through yesterday

I wish I could love like I used to love
I wish I could hurt like when I was young
It's getting easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
And I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's getting harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry

I don't know what I gotta change
No matter what I do, it always ends the same
And I'm not giving up yet
But I don't got a whole lot left

How does anyone make it out better?
Someone tell me the words I should say
How does anyone keep it forever?
I barely made it through yesterday

I wish I could love like I used to love
I wish I could hurt like when I was young
It's getting easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
And I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's getting harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry

Ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry
Ooh, ah-ah, the less I cry

I wish I could love like I used to love
I wish I could hurt like when I was young
It's getting easier to say goodbye
The older you get, the less you cry
I wish I didn't give all of me away
And I'd take back the things that I wish I didn't say
It's getting harder as the days go by
The older you get, the less you cry

The older I get, the less that I'll cry (ooh, ah-ah)
The less that I'll feel, I'm not gonna cry (the less I cry)
The older I get, the less that I cry (ooh, ah-ah)
The less that I feel, I'm not gonna cry (the less I cry)

I wish I could love like I used to love (ooh, ah-ah)
I wish I could hurt like when I was young (the less I cry)
It's getting easier to say goodbye (ooh, ah-ah)
The older you get, the less you cry
