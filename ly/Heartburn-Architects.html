		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Place yourself out, stop living, stop living.
To get our backs, there's only one you blame

I never paid much attention to them.

Every time they pushed us aside, we jump back up again,
Yeah we made it through the rain just to live another day
Without them.

Paint yourself better, and learn to live,
So pulling, so pulling time.
Paint yourself better and learn to live,
The grass is greener on the other side
So don't you put a bullet.
Never back down, don't ask for yourself,
You need anyone to get you where you deserve.

I never paid much attention to them.

Every time they pushed us aside,
We jump back up again, yeah we made it through the rain
Just to live another day without them.

Every time they pushed us aside,
We jump back up again, yeah we made it through the rain
Just to live another day without them.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

Here again

We made it through the rain just to live another day
We made it through the rain just to live another day
We made it through the rain just to live another day
