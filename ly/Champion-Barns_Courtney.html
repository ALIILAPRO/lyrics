		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been on a long road
With the devil right beside me
Rising with the morning sun
It's a hunger that drives me

Woah Lord, set my soul
Take my pain and turn it into gold
'Cause all I know, all I know, all I know is

Champion
I can take a beating, I'll rise again
Burning through the jungle until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up I'm
Champion
I can take a beating, I'll rise again
Burning through the jungle until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up I'm

Every time I'm knocked down
It's the struggle that reminds me
So heaven don't fail me now
Put the wings upon my feet

Woah Lord, set my soul
Take my pain and turn it into gold
'Cause all I know, all I know, all I know is

Champion
I can take a beating, I'll rise again
Burning through the jungle until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up I'm
Champion
I can take a beating, I'll rise again
Burning through the jungle until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up I'm

Rise up, rise up
Hmm
Rise up, rise up
Hmm
Rise up, rise up
Hmm
Rise up, rise up
Hmm
Rise up, rise up
Hmm

Champion
I can take a beating, I'll rise again
Burning through the jungle until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up I'm
Champion
I can take a beating, I'll rise again
Burning through the jungle until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up I'm

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
