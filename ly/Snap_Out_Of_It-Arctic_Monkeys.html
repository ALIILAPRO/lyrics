		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's been happenin' in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth, yeah

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently
For you to snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
But it don't sound much like you, girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently
For you to snap out of it

(Under a spell you're hypnotized, ooh)
(Darlin', how could you be so blind?)
(Snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized (ooh)
Darlin', how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently
For you to snap out of it
