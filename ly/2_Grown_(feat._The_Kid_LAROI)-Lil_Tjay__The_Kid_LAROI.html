		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not here for all your small talk or your morning coffee
I'd rather catch a body than catch feelings for somebody
I barely know
If you're looking for the one, you shouldn't get too close
But if you like falling for strangers (strangers)
If you like dancing with danger
If you like crossing lines, wasting time
You're temporarily just my type
If you like falling for strangers

I used to wanna see the world with you
All great then it wasn't, things changed
I guess that's just how life goes
We gettin' too grown for the childish games
And I don't know why I'd even try again and again, no, oh

Lot of shit you said when we argued
Was just so petty, not gon' lie, it still stick
You tryna say it is what it ain't, all love, hate, I can't
Bro said fuck these hoes, we tryna get rich
You got me in that mood, I be so low
Don't wanna eat my food, I be home solo
I wanted to be toxic
Shut you up, it's hostile
Been gettin' to your head, shoulda kept you my ho
And I don't know why I'd even try again and again
And I don't know why I'd even try again and again

I used to wanna see the world with you
All great then it wasn't, things changed
I guess that's just how life goes
We gettin' too grown for the childish games
And I don't know why I'd even try again and again, no, oh

If you like falling for strangers (strangers)
If you like dancing with danger
If you like crossing lines, wasting time
You're temporarily just my type
If you like falling for strangers, if you like

I'm still trippin' off the shit that you done said to me
I'm still trippin' on the lies that you had fed to me
I'm still trippin' but I shouldn't 'cause it's done now
I'm still missin' what I thought in you I once found
I took you 'round the world, seven nights in Paris
I gave you everything and now you act like it don't matter
I defended you to friends, now you got embarrassed
I even took you home and introduced you to my parents
And it's time money can't buy back with you
And it's hard to admit that I still want you, yeah
It's hard to admit but it still the truth
Are you still? Are you still down?

I used to wanna see the world with you
All great then it wasn't, things changed
I guess that's just how life goes
We gettin' too grown for the childish games
And I don't know why I'd even try again and again, no, oh

I'm not here for your small talk or your morning coffee
I'd rather catch a body than catch feelings for somebody
I barely know
If you're looking for the one, you shouldn't get too close
But if you like falling for strangers (strangers)
If you like dancing with danger
If you like crossing lines, wasting time
You're temporarily just my type
If you like falling for strangers
If you like
