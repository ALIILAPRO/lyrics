		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, a casual affair
That could go anywhere
And only for tonight
Take any moment, any time
A lover on the left
A sinner on the right

Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair (hush little baby, don't say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair

Break involuntary ties
A secret so the spies
Could never find us out
Stay for as long as you have time
So the mess that we'll become
Leaves something to talk about

Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair (hush little baby, don't say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair

(I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it
(I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it again)
(I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it
(I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it again)

Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair (hush little baby, don't say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
