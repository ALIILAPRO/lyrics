		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's feeding you fear for guidance
Who gets you to buy the lies
Make you cease your defiance
The night has a million eyes
Slowly they're getting closer
Breathing down our necks
And with every crack in the cornerstones
The stronger and bolder they get

Once upon a time there was light and darkness
Now we don't see when hell is upon us
Or the devil's grin

We don't know what we're up against
Who to fight on the other side
We don't know the consequence
When doom has come for everyone
We defy the call of duty
We deny the rise of cruelty
Time and time and time again
We don't know what we're up against

The path of least resistance
Leads to a golden cage
A long way off in the distance
Your choices are fading away
The apathy that surrounds us
Is breaking us all apart
Strapping ourself in a fortress
In a prison cell with no bars

Once upon a time there was light and darkness
Now we don't see when hell is upon us
Or the devil's grin

We don't know what we're up against
Who to fight on the other side
We don't know the consequence
When doom has come for everyone
We defy the call of duty
We deny the rise of cruelty
Time and time and time again
We don't know what we're up against

We don't know what we're up against
Who's on the other side
Up against or who to fight

We don't know what we're up against
Who to fight on the other side
We don't know the consequence
When doom has come for everyone
We defy the call of duty
We deny the rise of cruelty
Time and time and time again
We don't know what we're up against

Oh, yea-yeah
We don't know what we're up against
