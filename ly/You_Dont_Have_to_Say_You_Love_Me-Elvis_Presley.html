		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I said, I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away

But don't you know that now you're gone
And I'm left here on my own
Now I have to follow you
And beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me
Believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down

Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness 
There's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand 
Believe me
Oh believe me
Oh you don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me
Believe me
Believe me
