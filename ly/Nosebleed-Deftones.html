		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No means no lie now find out what you get - you?re no good
You'll sit around and throw a fuckin' fit
We are here onto you
You're so far - you're fuckin' gone

You won't get to me till you cover me
I don't need this shit till you cover me

We are here - mother - in your fear with you
We could be perfect in your world I know
But I will come, I will come, and I will come go!

I will come, I will come, and I will come
I will come, I will come, I will come, I will come
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

You won?t get to me till you cover me
I don?t need this shit fuckin' liar
