		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The hard days are nearly over
And we've been hanging on
It feels like we're getting closer to dawn

We took the long way up to heaven
And got blinded by the lights
But as long as we're together
I know it will be alright

I see a better day
I see a better day for you, for you and me, a-ayy
I see a better day
Yeah, everything is gonna change for you and me

I knew we were gonna make it
I never had a doubt
Soon we'll be feeling weightless like clouds

We took the long way up to heaven
And got blinded by the lights
But as long as we're together
I know it will be alright

I see a better day
I see a better day for you, for you and me, a-ayy
I see a better day
Yeah, everything is gonna change for you and me

(A better day)
