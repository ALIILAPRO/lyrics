		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was gettin' into it with my girlfriend, at the time
And we just kept gettin' into it
And all the niggas on the Death Row Records was like
"Man, fuck that bitch, nigga, you Snoop Dogg, nigga
You can have any bitch you want with you, some hoes, nigga"
And that nigga Tupac came to me and said
"Man, fuck what they talkin' 'bout
That girl love you, you need to marry her"
And I listened to what he said and I married my wife
And like twenty somethin' years later, we still married
Wow
