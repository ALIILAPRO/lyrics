		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I looked in your eyes
And I didn't see the same you
It wasn't goodbye
But it was the moment I knew
You were just going through the motions
You didn't care at all

You watch me fade away
And left me with your ghost
You just faded away
And left us in the smoke
Why'd you fade away?
Why'd you fade away?

I tried to defend you
But all of my friends just shut me up
They say, "He don't deserve you"
But maybe I was never enough
You were just going through the motions
You didn't care at all

You watch me fade away
And left me with your ghost
You just faded away
And left us in the smoke
Why'd you fade away?
Oh, why'd you fade away?

Watch me take back
All the love you don't deserve
You lost me baby
And I know you'll start to hurt
Oh, and I won't be there
When you need somebody like I needed you
I needed you

When you faded away
And left me with your ghost
You just faded away
You put on a good show

Then you fade away
And left me with your ghost
You just faded away
And left us in the smoke
Why'd you fade away?
Oh, why'd you fade away?
