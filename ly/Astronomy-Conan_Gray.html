		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We drive through the woods
Rich neighborhoods to watch
We joked as we looked
That they were too good for us

'Cause socially speaking we were the same
With runaway fathers and mothers who drank
A tale old as time
Young love don't last for life

And now I know
Now I know
It's time to go
It's time to go

We've traveled the seas
We've ridden the stars
We've seen everything
From Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems
Like you own my heart
It's astronomy
We're two worlds apart
(It's astronomy)
We're two worlds apart
(It's astronomy)
We're two worlds apart

From far away
I wish I'd stayed with you
But here face to face
A stranger that I once knew

I thought if I wandered
I'd fall back in love
You said distance brings fondness
But guess not with us

The only mistake
That we didn't make
Was run
Now look what we've done

We've traveled the seas
We've ridden the stars
We've seen everything
From Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems
Like you own my heart
It's astronomy
We're two worlds apart
(It's astronomy)
We're two worlds apart

Stop tryna keep us alive
You're pointing at stars in the sky
That already died
Stop tryna keep us alive
You can't force the stars to align
When they've already died
Oh, we've died
Ooh

Oh, we've traveled the seas
We've ridden the stars
We've seen everything
From Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems
Like you own my heart
It's astronomy
We're two worlds apart
