		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I cook, you do the dishes
And when I'm workin' late, you record the game so I don't miss it
And we're good at takin' on each other's issues
But we're bleedin' through the Band-Aids and we're cryin' through the tissues

And it's kind of romantic
How overdramatic we are
And it's got us this far

But I think you're the one for someone else
And that shit's hard to say, it's okay
You feel the same, and I can tell
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last

And I don't wanna keep you waiting
It's not as simple as a yes or no, it's kinda complicated
But I would leave a five-star review, ten out of ten
Recommend you to a friend if I could

'Cause I think you're the one for someone else
And that shit's hard to say, it's okay
You feel the same, and I can tell
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, not made to last

'Cause we put too much pressure on ourselves
Keepin' up appearances to please everybody else
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, just not meant to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last
