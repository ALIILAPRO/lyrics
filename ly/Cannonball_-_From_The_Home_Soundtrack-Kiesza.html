		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

I wish I could take your heart
Keep it in a cardboard box
So when it gets hard, you'll never be far
And your love won't be lost
As the bridges fall apart
I still find a way to cross
And even if you are lost among the stars
Your love won't go off

For me me me me it's endless
And I need need need more of this
Can't turn away, feel it push me

And I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Like a cannonball

I can feel you take my love
And dangle it above the ground
And if the strings are cut
Nothing holds me up, nothing takes me down

For me me me me it's endless
And I need need need more of this
Can't turn away, feel it push me

And I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Like a cannonball

When I try to run from you, can't lie
I get lost in your maybe maybe
I'm just falling
When I try to hide from your love I can't deny it, oh baby maybe
It's just my calling

But I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
I keep falling
I keep falling for you
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball

Ooh, ooh
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
Ooh, ooh
Like the rain fall
Like a cannonball
