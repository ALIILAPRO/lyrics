		  Hey baby
What's crackin'? Who you mackin'?
What ya doin'? Who ya screwin'?
What ya drinkin'? What ya thinkin'?
Hey baby
Scream my name, play your game
Wanna do me? Wanna screw me?
I'm your pet, make me wet
Hey baby
Don't you stare, I don't care
Want some fun? Make me cum
Keep it going, 'cause it's snowin'
Hey baby
Tie me up, pin me down
Flip me over, upside down
Make me make that fucking sound

Hey baby
What's crackin'? Who you mackin'?
