		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
I just upgraded you expire
Mai mehnat’an ni kitiyan in silence (Oye)
We be pulling up on stage like sirens (Oye)
I’m a original warrior no ISIS (ISIS)
And i know i was made to inspire (Ay-ay-ayy)
Ambition makaveli i'm a rider (I'm a rider)
You ain't had the fire or desire (Ayy)
Do you love it how we building this empire (Okay)
I'm takin it to a new level (Ayy)
Look at the team i assemble (Ayy)
Established since 2007 (Ayy)
Kade jawanga waaps na еver (Ayy)
What do you know about the struggle (Ayy)
Evеrything that i touch turns double (Ayy)
Sadda only ae vision ae tunnel (Ayy)
We focused ain’t worried by trouble

[Chorus]
And they don’t really like it (Like it)
That’s we are still breathing
They don’t like it, the way we are proceeding (Ayy)
They don’t like it, that we are existing (Ayy)
And they don’t like it, the way we keep winning

[Verse 2]
I-i- i've been making money while you sleeping
Kari spotify te gaana sadda stream ae (Ayy)
Top speed te ve AMG-Mercedes chy (Ayy)
Sahnu nagative vibes di na need ae
I don’t need it
I carry tiny diamond look i'm skiing (Ayy)
Deposit yah ve cash we believe-in (Ayy)
Never gonna stop never leaving (Ayy)
Tainu nazar na aave what we seeing (Okay)
They can not handle that pressure (Ayy)
Hum socha ne ae depression (Ayy)
Mainu pata tainu obsession (Ayy)
Sahnu vekh ke kar de ne dressing (Ayy)
Sadde naal ve tu kari na ve messin' (Ayy)
Sadda sabar da kari na tu testin' (Ayy)
Don’t act fake be real (Be real)
We keepin it west side thuggin

[Chorus]
And they don’t really like it (Like it)
That’s we are still breathing (Ooo)
They don’t like it, the way we are proceeding (Ayy)
They don’t like it, that we are existing (Ayy)
And they don’t like it, the way we keep winning (Oo)

[Bridge]
We catch no feelings
Stay quite no screaming (Oo)
Waterpoof no leakage (Oo)
They keep dreaming (Oo)
Chalava high speed chy (Oo)
Till i cannot see them (Oo)
Kar sakay na reach ae (Oo)
Fuck the police man

[Chorus]
And they don’t really like it (Like it)
That’s we are still breathing
They don’t like it, the way we are proceeding (Ayy)
They don’t like it, that we are existing (Ayy)
And they don’t like it, the way we keep winning (Ayy)
