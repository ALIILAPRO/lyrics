		  Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No. He's to and from, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

Know I need my dollars
Know a nigga need my commas
She was down when I dropped out of college
Down, she was down when I rode Impalas
Played with her pussy in the jeep
Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin'
Jumped in the car when she hit my digits
Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects
Easy to me my nigga
Build it with a seam, youngin always seen with a killer
Hand stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela?
She even got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swirved off
It ain't been a minute seen they seen a weird nigga
From the corner put it on for the south
On my momma, know a nigga be coasting
Go nigga grab my bottles, go nigga grab my Chronic
Keep ya head up in the air my nigga
Niggas know gon be billionaires my nigga
Fuck how much time that shit might take
Niggas ain't playin' with em!

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

Bitch don't you play me, don't you try me
I need the exact amount
Look at my face ho, eye to eye me
I'm a boss Make sure you and your homies dress up, tie attire
When you see me ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it
I mean, god damn nigga!
You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these bitches is bitches and they ain't nuns
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow they act like they been down since day one
Where there's fucking tank guns
Nigga's never join the Army, like it ain't one
If I ain't got it then I'm huntin', I'm either countin' or I'm cummin'
Swear I just done bought that mansion, treat that shit like it's a dungeon
Up at 5AM still workin', but I treat it like it's 1
I'm never actin' like I got it
Bitch I'm actin' like I want it on these niggas!

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with these niggas
