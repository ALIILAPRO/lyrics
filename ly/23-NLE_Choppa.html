		  (Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Tay Keith you did this shit again
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, man, this new year
Don't come to me with that old shit
Leave that in 2022
Ayy, ayy

I just want my nut, after that, bitch, get up off me (bitch, bye)
Presidential chop', pussy nigga, ain't no offin' me (no, we ain't gon' die)
You a pussy with some discharge, we call 'em cottage cheese
Sent a hit off of Discord, it's 2023 (2023)
New year, new me, it's 2023 (new me, '23)
Glock 23 (brrt), I dumped a twenty piece (brrt-brrt)
That old shit ain't goin' forward, this a newer me (this a newer me)
Probably knew me last year, but you don't know me (ayy, you don't know me)

One light, two litre bullshit, no deal
Onsight, for real
Crack shit, life seals
Beat a nigga, MikeWill
I say how I feel
Give a fuck how you feel
Shooters still in the gym
Steppers still in the field
All he need is a pill
And he'll still kill without one (brrt, brrt)
Ain't got a gun? Better buy one (buy one)
Can't afford it? Better take some (better take one)
All lives matter, I take one (I take some)
Call me, "Booty," I shake some (I make it clap)
No homo, none taken (none taken)
Fuck all the opps, no latex (no rubber)
Make the K bust, that's great sex (no brothers)
Face shot, give him a taste test (brrt)
Yeah, Motorollas servin' fiends, yeah (fiends, yeah)
Since a stroller seen fiends, yeah (fiends, yeah)
I'm bipolar, I'll tweak, yeah (tweak, yeah)
Headshot make him sneeze there (sneeze there)
He got played to the left, that's a right way
Cottonwood baby, all night way (night way)
Right around the corner from Sheffield
Caught buddy loafin' in broad day (broad day)

I just want my nut, after that, bitch, get up off me (ho, bye)
Presidential chop', pussy nigga, ain't no offin' me (no, we ain't gon' die)
You a pussy with some discharge, we call 'em cottage cheese (call 'em cottage cheese)
Sent a hit off of Discord, it's 2023 (this 2023)
New year, new me, it's 2023 (new me, '23)
Glock 23 (23), I dumped a twenty piece (dumped a twenty piece)
That old shit ain't goin' forward, this a newer me (this a newer me)
Probably knew me last year, but you don't know me (ayy, you don't know me)

Two-four in the clip, eight got hit, Kobe (Bryant)
Couple killers in the seat
Free Lou and free Toby (Slime)
Goon say he wanna put an another nigga down, I say, "Focus"
Draco, I call him Michael Draco 'cause he know how to work it (my brother)
Bad-ass bitch, nothin' basic, slide right in, I'm skatin' (ski)
Me and her shop in Fifths, we don't know nothin' 'bout Macy's, nah (shit)
The way she take this dick, that lil' ho got bravy (nah, for real)
Blood bitch tryna make a flip Crip, she be like that, she brazy (slime)
Birds of a feather, gotta flock together
Box him up and tell him, "Get one off"
Through any weather, we gon' get umbrellas
Nothin' stop this cheddar, nigga, fuck you thought? (What you thought?)
Bacon cheddar cheese, mozzerella, please
Gettin' head when I wake in the loft (the loft)
Came from the streets, now I scream, "World peace"
I'm rich as hell, might play golf
Where you at twin? I know you ain't laid up with no ho

I just want my nut, after that, bitch, get up off me (off me)
Presidential chop', pussy nigga, ain't no offin' me (offin' me)
You a pussy with some discharge, we call 'em cottage cheese (cottage cheese)
Sent a hit off of Discord, it's 2023 (2023)
New year, new me, it's 2023 (me, 3)
Glock 23 (3), I dumped a twenty piece (piece)
That old shit ain't goin' forward, this a newer me (newer me)
Probably knew me last year, but you don't know me (you don't know me)

Ayy, man, lot of shit changed, but
It's only one thing I'm keepin' the same, man
We still tote 7.62s over .223s even though we in 2023
Yeah, I might go cop a AR though (brrt)

Lives matter, I take one
Call me, "Booty," I shake some
Call me, "Booty," I shake some
Call me, "Booty," I, call me, "Booty," ayy
Call me, "Booty," I shake some
No homo, none taken 
Fuck all the opps, no latex, nigga
Yeah, 2023, 2023
