		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Momentary pain
Can be pleasure lain
Millisecond change
Magic lantern strange
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian?
Is this how it is?
Girl, your life will turn
Just like a strobe
'Cause you're daddy's pain
And your mother won't
And your heart engages into heartless throes
Are we obsidian?
Is this how it goes?

When you're drivin' night is dreamin'
(Livin' the strobe light)
And you will find the life you needed
(Livin' the strobe light)

Slide the light off you
You may find some peace
All will come to you
If you come with me
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian?
Is this how it ends?
(Yeah!)

When you're drivin' night is dreamin'
(Livin' the strobe light)
And you will find the life you needed
(Livin' the strobe light)

And when you're drivin' night is dreamin'
(Livin' the strobe light)
And you will find the life you needed
(Livin' the strobe light)

And when you're drivin' night is dreamin'
(Livin' the strobe light)
And you will find the life you needed
(Livin' the strobe light)

And when you got it
And think you're dreaming
You hit the light
You've got to find it, we all need it
We hit the light

And when you got it
And think you're dreaming
You hit the light
You've got to find it, we all need it
We hit the light
