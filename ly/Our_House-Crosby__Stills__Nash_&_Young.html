		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll light the fire
You place the flowers
In the vase
That you bought today
Staring at the fire
For hours and hours
While I listen to you
Play your love songs
All night long

For me
Only for me

Come to me now (come to me now)
And rest your head for just five minutes
Everything is done
Such a cozy room (such a cozy room)
The windows are illuminated by the evening
Sunshine through them
Fiery gems

For you
Only for you

Our house
Is a very, very, very fine house
With two cats in the yard
Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy
'Cause of you
And our

La-la, la-la-la, la
La, la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la, la
La, la-la, la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la, la
La, la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la, la

Our house
Is a very, very, very fine house (very, very fine house)
With two cats in the yard
Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy
'Cause of you
And our

I'll light the fire
While you place the flowers
In the vase
That you bought today
