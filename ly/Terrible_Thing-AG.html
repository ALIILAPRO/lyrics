		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you're doing here
Made your intentions clear

Oh you, 
you terrible thing, you terrible thing, 
you terrible thing, you beautiful thing

Honey you're so cold, you left me unpatrolled,
Lose my self control with you, (when I'm with you),
Do things I don't want to do, ooh, 

Oh for you,
You terrible thing, you terrible thing,
you terrible thing, you beautiful thing

A wreck, a wreck, you make
You leave, you leave, me in your wake,
Oh honey let me go,
Aha, aha, don't you let me go,
A wreck, a wreck, you make
You leave, you leave, me in your wake,
Oh honey let me go,
Don't you ever let me go...

Oh honey you're so cold,
I lose my self control.
Oh you,
You terrible thing, you terrible thing,
you terrible thing, you beautiful thing
you beautiful thing, you beautiful thing
you beautiful thing, you beautiful thing
You terrible thing, you terrible thing,
You terrible thing, you terrible thing,
You beautiful thing...
Oh you beautiful thing
You terrible thing.
