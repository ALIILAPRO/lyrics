		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what love is
If I can't have you here
I don't know what love is
I think that it's just fear

I don't know the tempo
Of my heart's concerto
It all seems like a dream
It's not, I know
There's something real out there for me

I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue
Every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you

If I had the courage
I'd know just what to do
Sometimes I have to crawl
And everyday I fall
Tryin' just to stand by you

I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue
Every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you
