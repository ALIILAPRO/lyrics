		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I don't die tomorrow
I'll come and see you, baby
Through all the pain and sorrow
Only one who can save me
Out of my mind
Like every night
Like every night
And when the night goes down I'll be right there
Love how your body moves when I'm inside it
I know the alcohol got you excited
Let me take control
Let me take control
When the night goes down I'll be right there
Love how your body moves when I'm inside it
I know the alcohol got you excited
Let me take control
Let me take control
Let me
I promise you won't find another like me
Lately don't even know what to believe
You do it all for me
You kill em all for me
You break the law for me
Go against god for me
Take this shot for me
And take it off for me
You kill em all for me
You break the law for me
Yeah
If I don't die tomorrow
I'll come and see you, baby
Twelve shots of reposado
Need you to come and save me
Out of my mind
Like every night
Like every night
And when the night goes down I'll be right there
Love how your body moves when I'm inside it
I know the alcohol got you excited
Let me take control
Let me take control
When the night goes down I'll be right there
Love how your body moves when I'm inside it
I know the alcohol got you excited
Let me take control
