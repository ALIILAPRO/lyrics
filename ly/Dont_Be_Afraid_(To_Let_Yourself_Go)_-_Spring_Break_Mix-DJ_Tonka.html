		  Dj speaking

Girl singin':
Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't, don't be afraid

DJ speaking

Girl singin':
Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't, don't be afraid
Do it!

Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't, don't be afraid
Do it!

DJ speaking
What would you like to hear again?

Girl singin':
Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to let your self go
Don't be afraid, don't, don't be afraid
Do it!
