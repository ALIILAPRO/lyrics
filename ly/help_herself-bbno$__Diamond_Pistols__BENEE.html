		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down on myself, hope you're doing well
I've been honestly going through hell
Feeling troubled, no one to tell
Dodged a bullet, saved by the bell
If we had a make up, last the weekend
Save the break up just to be friends
I would not call in the past tense
I would've not, not fallen for you

I thought we took it slow, anymore
I might just break without you
Can't stop thinking about you
(Can't stop thinking ab-)

She can't help herself at all
She's falling deep in love
Can't give you what you want
My bad, I messed this up
Can barely help myself
I'm falling out of love
Can't give you what you want
My bad, I messed this up

Stole my heart, she broke it to pieces
She said I'm average, I picked up the pieces
She left the third time, she had her reasons
I took her back, I had my reasons, oh, no
I can make time, hope you're doing fine
Hurt me when you lied, can't you take signs?
I can fix that, I won't hurt you
This ain't an act, yeah, I do this all for you

I thought we took it slow, anymore
I might just break without you
Can't stop thinking about you
(Can't stop thinking ab-)

She can't help herself at all
She's falling deep in love
Can't give you what you want
My bad, I messed this up
Can barely help myself
I'm falling out of love
Can't give you what you want
My bad, I messed this up
She can't help herself at all (no, no, no, no, no, no)
She's falling deep in love
Can't give you what you want
My bad, I messed this up
Can barely help myself (no, no, no, no, no, no)
I'm falling out of love
Can't give you what you want
My bad, I messed this up

My bad, I messed this up
My bad, I messed this up
