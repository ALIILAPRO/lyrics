		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gon' make you sweat, gon' make you groove

Ah-ah, child, way ya shake that thing
Gon' make you burn, gon' make you sting

Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away

Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah

I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill

With eyes that shine, burnin' red
Dreams of you all through my head

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

Hey, baby, whoa, baby, my pretty baby
Darlin,' make 'em do it now

Hey baby, oh, my baby, my pretty baby
Move the way you're doin' now

Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out

Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friends she gon' be a star

I don't know, but I been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah

All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gon' come my way

Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
