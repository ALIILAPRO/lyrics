		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sixteen candles burnin' bright
One swift exhale and we fade to night
Waking up to an empty room
And the world's your oyster

Fast forward to the here and now
You remember walkin but you don't remember how
A dozen fires in the dark
Have you made the world brighter?

We're like fools in our dreams
Jumpin' all around and in between
Take a breath there's nothing to prove
My friend, just trust in the blue

When we've all turned to ash
There's no You to hold you back
When we've all become the flame
Tell me, who remembers?

We're like eagles in our dreams
Flying all around and in between
Know you're held no matter what you do
My friend, just trust in the blue

We're just people in our dreams
Walking all around and in between
You're the only one who knows your truth
My friend, just trust in the blue
My friend, just trust in the blue
My friend, just trust in the blue
