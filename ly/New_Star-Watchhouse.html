		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We settled in for the winter
The cast in our lives, found a new star
And all of our remaining hours
Were bundled up tight and placed in our arms

Someday we'll be older
Our eyes may cry 
Look what's become of me and my former
Steal away, steal away, remember
At least we're all here together

Finding our way as a teacher
Stumbling along a little unrested
If only one lesson could reach her
She'll know our love could never be tested

Someday she'll be older
Our eyes may cry 
Look what's become of me and my former
Steal away, steal away, remember
At least we're all here together

At least we're all here together

We settled in for the winter
The cast in our lives, found a new star
