		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewellery dripping
Drink and I get all fired up (Hey, hey, hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momama always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(A woman)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (A woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

And baby, just be mine for the weekend
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, ayy, ayy
You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it
Love it when you turn me on
'Yonc√© with a little bit of
"Love Drunk" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momama always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(A woman)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (a woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

Boss chick, lookin' like lick, tell them girls to split
I'm the one to set it off I ain't who she messing with
Might stop for a couple pics but don't put me in the mix
Real spit, it's Ms Banks and Little Mix
Got my hips from my momma and my attitude from my daddy
If you can't hack it baby I can show you the door gladly
Call me a goodie but really a baddie small lil waist and I got me a fatty
Ms Banks breaking the bank
Boy, if you want me, you gotta get at me

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

I've made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly (Woman like me, like a woman like me)
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve (La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me)
My Mama always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and (La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me)
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me (La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me)
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak (La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me)
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet (La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me)
Spending every night under covers and (La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me)
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me (For a woman like me)

Woman like me, like a woman like me (Na, na, na, na, na, a woman like me, like me)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (oh, woman like me)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (uh, na, na, na, na, na)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (I said)
(A woman like me)
