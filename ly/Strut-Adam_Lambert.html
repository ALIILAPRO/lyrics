		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna start a revolution
A type of personal solution
We all have got our own pollution
It's all about the execution

You've got something to say,
Your hands are tied
Open your mouth, open it wide
Let the freedom begin
Get on the floor, just let it drop
Don't it feel good, don't it feel hot
Feel the fire within

I wanna see you strut strut strut
Come on walk for me
Strut strut strut
How you want to be
Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo
Don't want to be solo, solo, solo
Don't want to be solo

We're a complicated nation
And now we're in a situation
Let's take a make-believe vacation
And get yourself some validation

You've got something to say,
Your hands are tied
Open your mouth, open it wide
Let the freedom begin
Get on the floor, just let it drop
Don't it feel good, don't it feel hot
Feel the fire within
I wanna see you strut strut strut
Come on walk for me
Strut strut strut
How you want to be

Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo
Don't want to be solo, solo, solo
Don't want to be solo

I'll be your mirror
Darling let you hair down
Show me what you're working with and let me see you
Strut strut
Strut strut
How you want to be
Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo
Don't want to be solo, solo, solo
Don't want to be solo
Strut on me and show me what you're working with
Strut on me and show me what you're working with
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
