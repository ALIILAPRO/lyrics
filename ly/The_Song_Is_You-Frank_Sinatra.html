		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear music when I look at you
A beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it play
I can feel it start, then melts away

I hear music when I touch your hand
A beautiful melody from some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
"Is this the day?"

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?
Why can't I let it go? Why can't I let you know?

Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
That beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, the words are true
The song is you

Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
That beautiful rhapsody of love, and youth and spring
The music is sweet, the words are true
The song is you
