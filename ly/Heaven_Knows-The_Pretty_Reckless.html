		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jimmy's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close
You can hear him cry

Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Sing it
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below

Judy's in the front seat picking up trash
Living on the dough
Gotta make that cash
Won't be pretty
Won't be sweet
She's just sittin' there on her feet

Sing it
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Go
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Sing
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Oh, Lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've had better days, man
I've seen better days
I've had better ways, man
I know better ways

One, two, three and four
The devil's knocking at your door
Caught in the eye of a dead man's lie
Show you life with your head held high
Now you're on your knees
With your head hung low
Big man tells you where to go
Tell 'em it's good
Tell 'em okay
Don't do a goddamn thing they say

Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've seen better ways, man
I know better ways
I've seen better days, man
I've had better days

Jeanna's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close
You can hear the crying

Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below

Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below
