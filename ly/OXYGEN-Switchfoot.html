		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were there at the door
You said "I don't know how to say this
But I want more
I don't know how you're gonna take this."
And my mind went sore
And my body went weightless
I couldn't find the floor
I couldn't find the floor
And you walked away
And I saw fireworks imploding
Frame by frame
Like watching a movie in slow motion
From miles away
Up like a rocket ship ascends
Drifting up into space
And I'm running out of oxygen
Can't go back to the first
Losing stories like leap year
Fake smiles and worse
Just a ghost left to be near
I'm not sure how this works
What do you want me to say, dear?
All I know is it hurts
All I know is it hurts
I'm drifting out of the hemisphere
So far away
All of the memories disappear
And start to fade away
