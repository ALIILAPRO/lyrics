		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No no, I don't make a difference
Say what you want about me, así, así
I don't need no permission
I run the night from Belize to Italy

I got a Coca-Cola but I don't want no chaser
Drinks on me, you know how that works
Everybody wanna see what I'm about to do first
Watch me and do not disturb

Ooh, I get by myself, can't describe how good I feel
Ooh, I do me so well, you know I don't need no help
When I get by myself, can't describe how good I feel
Yeah, I do me so well, you know I don't need no help

(No, I don't need no help)

While you're all on my body
Sé que quieres de mí, de mí, de mí
Baby, Imma be honest
Estoy pensando en tí, en tí, en tí

I got a Coca-Cola but I don't want no chaser
Drinks on me, you know how that works
Everybody wanna see what I'm about to do first
Watch me and do not disturb

Ooh, I get by myself, can't describe how good I feel
Ooh, I do me so well, you know I don't need no help
When I get by myself, can't describe how good I feel
Yeah, I do me so well, you know I don't need no help

(No, I don't need no help)
(No, I don't need no help)

Eyes on my body, you want it, you want it
But this is the night that I'm gonna be on my own
Hands off my body, my body, don't hurry up
'Cause this is the night that I'm gonna be on my own

No I don't make a difference
Ooh, I get by myself, can't describe how good I feel
Ooh, I do me so well, you know I don't need no help
When I get by myself, can't describe how good I feel
Yeah, I do me so well, you know I don't need no help

(No, I don't need no help)
(No, I don't need no help)
