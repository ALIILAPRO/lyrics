		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where blood splatters with every cut.

Candles light the sigils in this carnal dungeon.

Crucifixes inverted in sacrilege and sin.

Explore the realms of your darkest fantasies.

Execute yourselves through the ways of the flesh.

Nothing in this room is forbidden.

We all shall die in ecstasy.

Bloodshed and debauchery - Intercourse entwined with sadism.

Domination and submission - Paraphilic vampirism.

No safe words will be had in this dungeon painted with red liquid.

Compulsive ingestion for the ones who may have become addicted.

Motivated by the sight, we brandish our razor sharp steel. 

Slicing through our arteries, consensual drainage of life.

Indulgence and pleasure take control over the pain.

Blood erupts in fountains surging from our butchered veins.

Copious amounts producing timeless works of art.

Projecting through the air to the pulse of our still beating hearts.

Gruesome patterns paint the ceiling - High blood pressure, so appealing.

Nonstop bleeding.

Rapid heart beating.

Life receding.

Thou shalt perish in ritual.

Drain the blood. Sanctify my sickness. (X7)

Drain the blood. Self-induced exsanguination.

Drenched and writhing in pools of crimson fluid.

Ecstasy and death coalesce as one.

Lives relinquished with bliss upon our faces.

Eternal darkness willfully obtained.
