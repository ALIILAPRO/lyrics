		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost my source
In a world that constantly spinning
And falling apart
Drowning in the depth of emotions
No wave comes to me
No breath left to be
I can't find my connections
My thoughts are in a bind
I struggle to find a way out of this grind
My mind is a glitch
Nobody searches for the unknown

Silence reigns and seals my lips
I'm dragged out and disconnect
I'm drained, no one remembers my name
Plugged out of this universe

A stranger living under my skin
Taken over and shut me in
Feeling adrift, like I don't even exist
Lost in the darkness, can't find my peace
Strayed from the path for far too long
Now I'm too numb to feel
I've been looking for a spark to ignite the fire
To warm my cold heart

Silence reigns and seals my lips
I'm dragged out and disconnect
I'm drained, no one remembers my name
Plugged out of this universe

This is a warning
My connection fails
I'm disconnected
I'm dragged out and disconnect
Plugged out of this universe
My connection fails and disconnect
