		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This young girl, she's so cute
Every time I see her, wear a fresh pair of shoes
'Cause this young girl, she's such a killer
Can't wait till I have it, I'm a spend half a milla

I can see us together on top
We livin' like we hit the jackpot
Cha-ching, like money in the bank
You should be with me

You're like my favorite song
On the radio, radio, radio, radio
I could listen to you all day
You're like a music video, video vi-vi-video
I could look at you all day
You make me do my two-step all day
You keep me lookin' fly for ya all day
So you should be my girlfriend all day
Well, like a hit on the radio, radio

You, you, you, you, you, you got this young boy, racking his brains
Trying to make you mine, but I don't got a ring
You got this young boy, going insane
Tell me that you're single and you're waiting for me

I can see us together on top
We livin' like we hit the jackpot
Cha-ching, like money in the bank
You should be with me

You're like my favorite song
On the radio, radio, radio, radio
I could listen to you all day
You're like a music video, video vi-vi-video
I could look at you all day
You make do my two-step all day
You keep me lookin' proud for you all day
So you should be my girlfriend all day
Well, like a hit on my radio, radio

Tell me baby why you making me wait all day, all day
