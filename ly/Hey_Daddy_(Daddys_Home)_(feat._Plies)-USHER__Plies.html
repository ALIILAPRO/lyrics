		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna get your attention (ayy girl, ayy girl)
I really wanna be all up in your head (turn the lights on) yeah
'Cause when I got, you gon' wanna get some, yeah
But girl, that's only if you ain't scared (baby)

And I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just poke that bottom up in the air
I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear

Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this lovin' all day
You know your daddy's home (daddy's home)
And it's time to play (so it's time to play) yeah
So you ain't got to give my lovin' away
So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey daddy
Hey, hey, hey daddy
So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey daddy
Hey, hey, hey daddy (ayy, South side)

I ain't gotta do a lot of flexin' (uh-uh)
Shawty you already know what it is
And girl tonight we gonna do a lot of sexin', yeah
Can't nobody do your body like this, oh

I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just poke that bottom up in the air (yeah)
Said I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in all that I wanna hear (oh)

Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this lovin' all day
You know your daddy's home (daddy's home)
It's time to play (so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my loving away, yeah
So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey daddy (daddy know what you like)
Hey, hey, hey daddy (oh, daddy know what you like)
So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey daddy
Hey, hey, hey daddy

Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'ma fall back while you work that chair
Do that damn thing let the neighbors hear (hey, hey, hey daddy) yeah

Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'ma fall back let you work that chair
Do that damn thing all I wanna hear

Is you say, "Daddy's home, oh, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this lovin' all day
Your daddy's home (daddy's home)
It's time to play (so it's time to play)
Now baby, you ain't got to give my lovin' away

Daddy's home, home for me
And I know you've been waiting for this lovin' all day
You know your daddy's home (daddy's home)
And it's time to play (so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my lovin' away

So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey daddy (hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey daddy (callin' me daddy, babe)
So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey daddy (daddy know what you like)
