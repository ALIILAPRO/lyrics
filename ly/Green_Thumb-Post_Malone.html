		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Da-da, dum-dum

Drove by your house and noticed it was overgrown
Your flowers are all dead and I thought you should know
What happened to your green thumb that you were so proud of?
Their bodies were scattered and starving for love
Starving for love

One, one, one was on his deathbed
He told me you left long ago
Oh, no, he said with his last breath
"Wake up, she's not comin' home"

Da-da, dum-dum

He must be so cool and own a motorcycle
Buy you new flowers to replace what you left
My new love pours herself out more than I'd like
Her name is Brandy, we'll be married tonight
Married tonight

When I, I, I, I'm on my deathbed
I'll remember you left long ago
Oh, no, I hear the nurse say
"Goodnight, she's never comin' home"
