		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nuh worry yourself, dry yuh face, wah do tears?
Buckle yuh belt, tie yuh lace, wah do fears?
History we making out
History we making out here
Nuh worry yourself, dry yuh face, wah do tears?
Buckle yuh belt, tie yuh lace, wah do fears?
Mummy, man stepping out
(History we making out here)

Ah just a new beginning
Never change mi circle true me winning
Did haffi change mi company, ah Louis living
And tuck di 'matic 'pon mi belly
Man nuh new to killing (tuck)
And man nuh fool to money
Nah go form nuh fool fi shilling
Ask mi madda from mi ah fifteen
Ah di food mi bring in (bring)
Nuh care how small it is
We happy, that's di mood we giving
Now a movie living, fuck wid it, a tomb we digging
Nuh move mi riddim

Mi ting dem different from di start
Me put mi heart in every tune me singing
Di yute dem powerful like Kadapa
Couldn't drop mi guard, and fi shoot, me willing
Ah Jah Jah shine di light deh right through, nuh dimming

Nuh worry yourself, dry yuh face, wah do tears?
Buckle yuh belt, tie yuh lace, wah do fears? (History)
History we making out (history)
History we making out here
Nuh worry yourself, dry yuh face, wah do tears?
Buckle yuh belt, tie yuh lace, wah do fears?
From a likkle juvie, man stepping out (history)
Mummy know a history we making out here

First CD weh mi burn, yeah
First real G weh mi earn, yeah
From these streets wah me learn seh
Dog kill dog, dem will hurt me
Nah gi' nobody mercy, di clip ah carry thirty
Me ah tell you seh me have it, yuh nuh haffi search we
Everybody brain corrupt, every heart dirty
So mi nah 'itch fi blood, yo, unnuh cyaan' first me

Nuh worry yourself, dry yuh face, wah do tears?
Buckle yuh belt, tie yuh lace, wah do fears? (History)
History we making out (history)
History we making out here
Yeah, and we never forget
You hear that? (History we making out)
(History we making out) we never forget dem days deh

Ayy, Portmore
We used to tek di bus, long before me get bus
Fire pon mi belly, me cyaan' drop, me haffi mek it first
Prayer when me ready, nuh people, ah God ah get mi trust
Wul ah we mek fi dust, we soon gone, so mek we just
Shine like a diamond 'cause I man nuh mek fi rust
Genesis, nuh Exodus, me firm, me never fret, me tough
Journey start, me get mi stuff, me light mi weed and tek mi puff
Ah step me step, nuh mek nuh bluff
Mi mother never get nuh cruff (yeah)

Nuh worry yourself, dry yuh face, wah do tears?
Buckle yuh belt, tie yuh lace, wah do fears? (History)
History we making out (history)
History we making out here
Nuh worry yourself, dry yuh face, wah do tears?
Buckle yuh belt, tie yuh lace, wah do fears?
From a likkle juvie, man stepping out (history)
Mummy know a history we making out here

History we making out here
1 Syde forever, yuh hear that?
History we making out
History we making out
History we making out here
