		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ton' (and if the beat live you know Lil' Ju made it)
Yeah

Bitch, who? Maybach truck and the coupe
Only time I'm going back and forth is for the juice
Feds still got me in court, shit crazy
Only time I let a bitch record is when I'm writin'
And I'm famous, but can't shit change me, nigga

A million dollars worth of game, these niggas
I sold green, sold white, sold lyrics
Courtside, watching the Hawks play the Pistons

Okay, money on my nightstand, jewellery on my nightstand
Aftermarket extendo, I pray it don't jam
They say it's on sight, then I guess it's on sight then
First couple of shows, the F&N was my hype man (baow)
Way before the PJ, I had a flight plan (plan)
The GOAT with me, shake his hand, that's my right hand
A ho will fuck your homeboy outta spite, man
We had so much lean, the store ran out of Sprite, and
Y'all don't get it (get it), A on my fitted (fitted)
Pussy niggas sayin' a bunch of shit, they ain't livin'
Back on my pivot, kitchen water whippin'
All these turkey breasts, they thought it was thanksgiving
Don't make me pull out a million cash, I ain't trippin'
Long ass nose on sticks, gotta pick it
Let me see you shake it one cheek at a time
Double shot with the lime, yeah, your body dips

Benzo Maybach truck in the coop
Only time I'm going back and forth is for the juice
Feds still got me in court, shit crazy
Only time I let a bitch record is when I'm runnin'
I'm famous, but can't shit change me nigga

A million dollars worth of game, these niggas
I sold green, sold white, sold lyrics
Courtside, watching the Hawks play the Pistons

Still remember Chief, he was three doors down, I mean how
How you only last a year? Look at me now
The reason why that bag in town, I got bricks
No topside, everybody wand Fent
Forever outside, they don't let a nigga in
Nigga, all my bitches got a Benz, nigga
Five cats fuck on text
You ain't gotta like it, but respect it

That FN still my weapon
Ayy, James, step back, bitch, before I shoot
Walk a nigga down without tyin' my shit
Let him play crazy, he'll die in this bitch
4s over 5s and 6s still over 9s
RIP Rob, now I'm trippin' for the gas
Rolls for the winner, and I'll prolly give it back
Still can't believe a nigga made it off of rap

Bitch, who? Maybach truck and the coupe
Only time I'm going back and forth is for the juice
Feds still got me in court, shit crazy
Only time I let a bitch record is when I'm writin'
And I'm famous, but can't shit change me, nigga

A million dollars worth of game, these niggas
I sold green, sold white, sold lyrics
Courtside, watching the Hawks play the Pistons
