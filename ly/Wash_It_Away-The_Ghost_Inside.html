		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lay awake trapped in the same routine
Repeating over and over
I look ahead and I start to feel the dread
Of growing older and older
So what's it gonna take to finally make a change
I'm shaking like an earthquake

It's been building up and become too much
Like the pouring rain, we can wash it away
When you've had enough and it starts to flood
We can break like a tidal wave and wash it away

I hear the wind, a storm is moving in
It's getting closer and closer
For all these days I've been my own barricade
I'm not afraid anymore
So watch me break at the shore

It's been building up and become too much
Like the pouring rain, we can wash it away
When you've had enough and it starts to flood
We can break like a tidal wave and wash it away

So let it wash away
So sick and tired of waiting
Won't stop 'til I'm bleeding
Break at the shore

You gotta wash it away
So sick and tired of waiting
Won't stop 'til I'm bleeding

It's been building up and become too much
Like the pouring rain, we can wash it away
When you've had enough and it starts to flood
We can break like a tidal wave and wash it away
(We wash it away)

We can break like a tidal wave and wash it away
