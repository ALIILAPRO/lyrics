		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh it's you I know, you're the one I dream of
Look into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dream, tell me is it really love

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

Oh wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love

How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

If you love me
If you love me now
If you love me
If you love me now
