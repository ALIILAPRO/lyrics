		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's not make this
Complicated
I know you
Last night I had the
Strangest dream
That you knew me, too

But you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents house
I've become, a visitor

In the night you say
That you go underwater
You won't take me, no
You won't drown with your lover

You told me that I wasn't available
I guess I wasn't, I wasn't capable
I want to do better this time
But I guess you're better in the back of my mind

Oh you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents house
I've become, a visitor

My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed

My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed

(This time your door is open)

My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed

(This time your door is open)

My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed

(This time your door is open)

My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed

(This time your door is open)

My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
