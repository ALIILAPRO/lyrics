		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

All I ever tried to do was help you understand and grow
Light the way for truths that if not for me simply wouldn't show
'Less you get somebody else who's on my level, but you know
That there's no one on my level, you gon' realize if you don't
I wish you would own up to your flaws
And just say that you're wrong when you're wrong
Instead of actin' like you're right, then it turns into a fight
Now you're stormin' out my house in the middle of the night
I'm tryna

Breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
You're in my head like, breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
You're in my head like

Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da (yeah, yeah)

How come when I love somebody, part of me don't wanna stay?
Every time I get too close, I just start pushing them away
I know, I know
Maybe I just wanna leave before they try to leave me first
Maybe I don't wanna need 'em 'til they say they need me first
I know, I know (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Drank Tequila, I can't drive home
Hard to play cool, heart belongs to you
I know that if I show that
I keep my walls up, if you want me then you better start to climb
Women who love me aren't rare
Women who mean it hard to find
Somethin' tells me that I'm right about you
Please, don't prove me wrong
They say love's a song for fools
We're wise enough to sing along (yeah)

But now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
And now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a thing we make
We're skin on skin, I need this spell to break, oh
But I don't wanna go, and I know that you know
You're in my head like

Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Da-da-da

(And now it's hard to breathe, you're in to me, I'm into you)
Are you gon' use me?
Against myself and twist my head and now she use
(And now it's hard to breathe, you're in to me, I'm into you)
I keep my walls up, baby, want me? Then you better start to climb
Women who love me aren't rare
Women who mean it hard to find
(And now it's hard to breathe)
