		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We passed upon the stair 
We spoke of was and when 
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend 
Which came as some surprise 
I spoke into his eyes "I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago"

Oh no, not me 
I never lost control 
You're face to face 
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand 
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare 
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long, long time ago 

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control 
You're face to face 
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face 
With the man who sold the world
