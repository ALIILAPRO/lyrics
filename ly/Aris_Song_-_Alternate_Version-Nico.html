		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sail away, sail away, my little boy
Let the wind fill your heart
With light and joy sail away, my little boy

Let the rain wash away your cloudy days
Sail away into a dream
Let the wind sing you a fantasy
Of the ancient silver sea

Now you see that only dreams
Can send you where you want to be
Now you find those faces
Are not holding places
Where you thought they'd be
And later as you go again you will agree
That it was all a dream

Sail away, sail away, my little boy
Let the wind fill your heart
With light and joy sail away, my little boy
