		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, and it's alright and it's coming along
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where started from
A ha

Do you remember that day (that sunny day)
When you first came my way
I said no one could take your place
And if you get hurt (if you get hurt)
By the little things I say
I can put that smile back on your face

Ooh, and it's alright and it's coming along
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where started from
A ha

A love like ours (a love like ours)
Can never fade away
You know it's only just begun
You give me your lo-hove (give me your love)
I just can't stay away (no, no)
You know you are the oh oh only one

Ooh, and it's alright and it's coming along
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where started from
A ha

You give me your love (give me your love)
I just can't stay away (no, no)
You know you are the oh oh only one

Ooh, and it's alright and it's coming along
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where started from
A ha
