		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I begin?
How do I cope?
Some people sin
Some people don't
What we had was thin
So we couldn't survive
Bad times can win
While good things can die

I was the hero, but you get the glory
Now I'm the villain inside of your story
I was the saint, you used to adore me
Now I'm the villain inside of your story

You're walking through Heaven
I'm walking through flames
This can't be mended
It won't be the same
Thank you for nothing (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Thanks for the pain (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
This is what love brings (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Maybe I'll wait (ooh-ooh, ooh)

I was the hero, but you get the glory
Now I'm the villain inside of your story
I was the saint, you used to adore me
Now I'm the villain inside of your story

Oh-oh-oh, ooh
I bled, I bled for free
Oh-oh-oh, ooh
Your wretched victory
Oh-oh-oh, ooh
I bled, I bled for free
Oh-oh-oh, ooh
Gave every part of me

I was the hero, but you get the glory
Now I'm the villain inside of your story
I was the saint, you used to adore me
Now I'm the villain inside of your story

I was the hero, but you get the glory
Now I'm the villain inside of your story
I was the saint, you used to adore me
Now I'm the villain inside of your story
