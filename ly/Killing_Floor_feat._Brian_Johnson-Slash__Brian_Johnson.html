		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should've quit you a long time ago
I shoulda quit you, baby, a long time ago
I shoulda quit you, pretty woman, and went on down to Mexico

If I had followed my first mind
If I had followed my first mind
I'd been gone, gone, gone, yeah, since my second time

I shoulda went on when my friend come from Mexico at me
I shoulda went on when my friend come from Mexico at me
But I'm not foolin' with ya, baby
I let ya put me on the killing floor

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

God knows, shoulda been gone
Ooh, God knows, yeah, I shoulda been gone
And I wouldn't have been here down on the killing floor

And I wouldn't have been here down on the killing floor
And I would not be here down on the killing floor
Hey, now
