		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I please just pause all this
For a minute
I don't want to grow up
Too quickly
I act like I have it all together
All together
But I just want to hug my father
Hug my father

These are the good old days
We'll always miss
These are the people who
Will be lifelong friends
Sorry if I'm sentimental
I don't mean to bring you down
But I don't want these
Good old days to end

It seems like yesterday
We would play pretend
Now the hours waste away
With coffee breath
When did the rocket ships
Become traffic cars
I miss my imagination
Stay up watching stars

These are the good old days
We'll always miss
These are the people who
Will be lifelong friends
Sorry if I'm sentimental
I don't mean to bring you down
But I don't want these
Good old days to end
These are the good old days
We'll always miss
These are the good old days
We'll always miss
