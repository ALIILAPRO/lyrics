		  I think it was the fourth of that july[00:04.38]I remember looking in each other's eyes[00:09.15]Watching as the spark was fading[00:13.40]But neither one could say it[00:17.71]Ironically we laughed until we cried[00:22.06]The sun came up and then it got so quiet[00:26.50]I knew the end was getting closer[00:30.93]I thought we would grow old, ya[00:34.76]But you[00:37.41]Will always have my heart, it's nothing new[00:41.79]Whenever i'm alone i try to look through our old photographs[00:46.17]Remember when we used to laugh[00:48.38]But i don't recognize us anymore[00:51.43]My momma told me[00:54.79]If you love someone you've got to set them free[00:59.08]But i guess that you're not coming back[01:01.51]I thought that we could beat the odds[01:03.74]And try to fix all of our flaws[01:06.02]When you said you loved me, oh you must have had your fingers crossed[01:12.38]The time goes by the scars no longer show[01:16.85]But underneath it all there's still this hole[01:21.22]Filled up with my second guesses[01:25.25]But i guess i've learned a lesson[01:29.80]That people in your life will come and go[01:33.52]But from the ashes something beautiful will grow[01:38.02]Cause i'm happier than ever lately[01:42.87]I'm thankful for all you gave me[01:46.73]Ah you[01:49.41]Will always have my heart, it's nothing new[01:53.78]Whenever i'm alone i try to look through our old photographs[01:58.14]Remember when used to laugh[02:00.37]But i don't recognize us anymore[02:03.40]My momma told me[02:06.74]If you love someone you've got to set them free[02:11.11]But i guess that you're not coming back[02:13.46]I thought that we could beat the odds[02:15.78]And try to fix all of our flaws[02:17.82]When you said you loved me, oh you must have had your fingers crossed[02:23.44]Ah ou, ah ou, ah ou[02:29.91]Must have had your[02:32.07]Ah ou, ou ah[02:35.32]When you said you loved me, oh you must have had your fingers crossed
