		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girls, you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing (my men and my women)
That thing (don't forget about the deen)
That thing (the Sirat al-Mustaqim)
That thing (yo)
That thing (it's about a thing)
That thing (uh, yo)
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air (yo, what? What? What?)
And lick two shots in the atmosphere (uh, yeah, yeah)
(Uh, uh, uh, put 'em up, put 'em up) yeah, a-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, a-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah) (put 'em up)
Yeah, a-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again (uh)
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins? (Uh-huh, yeah)
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend (pretend)
Like you wasn't down and you called him again? (Again)
Plus, when (when) you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him (him)
If you did it then, then you'd probably- again (again)
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinkin' it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl (girl), respect is just a minimum (minimum)
N- and you still defending 'em (defending 'em)
Now, Lauryn is only human (human)
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament (I been in)
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans come again

Yo, a-win, win, come again (yeah, yeah)
Uh, bredrin come again (yeah, yeah)
My friend come again (yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yo)
Yeah, yeah

Guys you know you'd better watch out (yeah, uh)
'Cause girls, some girls are only about (some guys, some guys are only)
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing (one thing, one thing)
(Yo, yo)

The second verse is dedicated to the men (men)
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids (man)
And they facin' court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
And the sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
And quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men (be men)
How you gon' win, when you ain't right within? (How you gonna win?)
How you gon' win, when you ain't right within? (Bredrin)
How you gon' win, when you ain't right within? (Be men)
Uh, uh, come again, uh (uh, uh)

(Come again)
Yo, yo, come again (yeah, yeah)
Yo, bredrin come again (yeah, yeah)
And sistren come again (yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) yeah, yeah

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Wa-watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Wa-watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls you know you'd better watch out (uh, huh)
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys you know you'd better watch out
'Cause girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you'd better watch out (some guys, some guys are really not ready)
Some guys, some guys are only about (yeah, some girls, some girls are only, uh)
That thing, that thing, that thing (we taking it back, yo, way back, yo)
That thing, that thing, that thing
