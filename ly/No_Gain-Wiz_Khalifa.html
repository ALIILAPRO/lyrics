		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We started?
I've got so much, so much shit to do, don't even know where to start
Be here forever
I think that's the plan, ya know?
Start here, end up there
Soon as you think something's goin' on you start back over
It's never gonna be the same
I ain't complainin' though
I really wouldn't have it, any other way
Nigga!

Every day you wake up your destiny depends on what you do
Sometimes I roll up when I'm stressed out and sometimes I roll two
Here people sayin' shit about the way I am but I know that ain't true
At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too
I made some phone calls and checked emails cause I'm always grindin'
Ain't no rush, I do things slow cause it's all about timing
Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it
I've seen so many settle for less, that's when talent get wasted
I ain't there, but if I can I'mma try to be perfect
And for those that's ridin' with me, I'mma try to make it worth it
I drink too much, I pray for weed, cause it's better for the stress
I just woke up, I don't get sleep, boy my schedule's a mess

Man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain, no pain)
Man I work hard

Just left another one
Just wrote another one
Just got another check
'Bout to thumb through another one
Fallin' asleep on the plane, no pet the flight come with one
Young nigga holdin' it down, don't care if it make you uncomfortable
Hardly spend nights at the crib, homie that's just how I live
Don't even go hard for myself, I got a wife and a kid
I don't ever question the biz, nigga it is what it is
You niggas ain't killin shit, no you niggas ain't killin shit
What they doin'? They say, "Nothin'!"
Where they goin'? They say, "Nothin'!"
Call my phone, it ain't nothin'
I smoke a lot but don't judge me
Probably wake up earlier than all of you niggas
Mafuckas always hated the squad,
But all the hatin' mafuckas always hatin' and I get paid

Man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no game (No pain no gain) (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain, no pain)
Man I work hard
