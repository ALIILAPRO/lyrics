		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mother told me
Someday I would buy
Galleys with good oars
Sail to distant shores
Stand up on the prow
Noble barque I steer
Steady course to the haven
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men

My mother told me
Someday I would buy
Galleys with good oars
Sail to distant shores
Stand up on the prow
Noble barque I steer
Steady course to the haven
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men
My mother told me
Someday I would buy (I would buy)
Galleys with good oars
Sail to distant shores
Stand up on the prow
Noble barque I steer (I steer)
Steady course to the haven
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men

My mother told me
Someday I would buy (I would buy)
Galleys with good oars
Sail to distant shores
Stand up on the prow
Noble barque I steer (I steer)
Steady course to the haven
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men
