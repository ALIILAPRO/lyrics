		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I waste my time
Tryna find out where my hurting lies
Feels like I can search forever and ever
In time
There's no way that I can get it right
Time after time

Let it go, just move on, be a good kid
Never feel, never cry 'cause it's stupid
You-uh-uh-uh
You-uh-uh-uh
Burry all
In your mind
Go to sleep

You're tryna break through my walls
But I'd rather
Keep everything inside
Like I learned from my father
It's easier to hide
It's easier to hide

It feels so fine
Visiting my soul from time to time
Feels like I can stay forever and ever
Inside
But I run 'cause there's no place to hide
Run every time

Let it go, just move on, be a good kid
Never feel, never cry 'cause it's stupid
You-uh-uh-uh
You-uh-uh-uh
Burry all
In your mind
Go to sleep

You're tryna break through my walls
But I'd rather
Keep everything inside
Like I learned from my father
It's easier to hide
