		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was never looking for her
Till I found her
Now I find her everywhere
She's always there
See her in my morning coffee
Glaring at me
Through glassy surface there
The way she stares
She's the ghost of Chicago
She got lost somehow
She gets married tomorrow
Oh and I'm goin' down
There she is again
Beside the fountain lookin' out
Upon the people here
It's awfully clear
She's haunting me and honestly
I'm honored to be haunted
By the likes of she
Lucky me
She's the ghost of Chicago
She got lost somehow
She gets married tomorrow
Oh and I'm goin' down
(Chicago)
Saw her on the water and I called to her, my Clementine
(Chicago)
All in all I think I'm fallin' into love with afterlife
(Chicago)
Saw her on the water and I called to her, my Clementine
(Chicago)
All in all I think I'm fallin' into love with afterlife
She's the ghost of Chicago
She got lost somehow
She gets married tomorrow
Oh and I'm goin' down
