		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a secret place I like to go 
Everyone is there but their face don't show 
If you get inside you can't get out 
There's no coming back, I hear them shout 
Welcome to my hide away, my secret place 
How I arrived I can't explain 
You're welcome to, if you want to stay 
But everyone just runs away 
Let me in, get me out 
Can't do more than twist and shout 
Lost my soul without a trace 
Found it again in my secret place 
In disgrace 
I hide from those that try to find me 
Scary things that's right behind me 
I lost myself, I must confess 
I can't explain how I got this mess
