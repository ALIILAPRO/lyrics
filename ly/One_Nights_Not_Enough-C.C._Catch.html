		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every little thing's been said about you
Babe, you know you light up my day
Everybody hates to live without it
And I hope you don't go away

A bitter start with tears
I can forget my fears
One night's nog enough, can't you see
To set all my love away from me

One night's not enough, can't you see
Breaking up
Breaks my heart
One night's not enough, can't see you

Baby, if you will ever set me free
Then our love will break my heart forever and ever
The way you laugh is very special to me
Maybe my dreams will come true

And I know, if you should ever leave me
I would never feel so bad blue
Maybe behind your eyes
There will be back surprise

Love lost it's meaning
It will never stop bleeding
And my heart is begging
If I my tears will waking

'Cause I feel so lonely, you are my only
