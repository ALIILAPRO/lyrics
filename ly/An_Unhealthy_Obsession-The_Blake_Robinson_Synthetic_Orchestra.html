		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They call it creeping, I say loving, it's the only way for me 
Filling out papers, signing waivers but I stay outside his reach 
I name your mother and your father and the first pet that you keep 
I know your favourite place to dine at when your cheque comes in each week 
I know you do your wash on Sundays and you separate your whites 
And that your car needs a new tire 'cos last week I laid those spikes 
I've got a million polaroids with all the dates penned in red ink 
I sneak a walkie-talky in your room to listen to you sleep

You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same 
One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything 
We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part 
Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart 

Some call it stalking, I say walking just extremely close behind 
I'm sure if I sat down and asked you, well you really wouldn't mind
You've got those eyes that drive me crazy, and I've got eyes to watch you sleep 
I brought a pack lunch and some coffee for my stakeout in your tree... outside your house
Gotta be as quiet as a mouse, or else you'll call the police 
And I'll get done for somethin' stupid like disturbance of the peace 
And piece by piece I am collecting all the things you leave behind 
And when you don't I rummage through your bins to see what I can find

You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same 
One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything 
We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part 
Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart
