		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my place, my house, my rules
This is my place, my house, my rules

I think that in the silence
We are climbing to the sky to sit with the stars
We might be apart
And in my deepest self-reflection
Build a city, stay forever young, forever young

This is my place, my house, my rules
This is my place, my house, my rules
Do you see me, feel me?
Don't think you do
'Cause this is my place, my house, my rules

I paint a picture so that we
Are climbing all the way up to sit with the stars
And that's where we are
I cannot be invisible
You make yourself invincible to make it up
Don't make it up

'Cause this is my place, my house, my rules
This is my place, my house, my rules
Do you see me, feel me?
Don't think you do
'Cause this is my place, my house, my rules

You're so welcome in this house that I have built
Where imagination feeds the things you feel
And you're so welcome in this place that I am still
Where imagination feeds the things you feel

And this is my place, my house, my rules
This is my place, my house, my rules
This is my place, my house, my rules
This is my place, my house, my rules
My rules, it's my rules
