		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Finesse, two of 'em
(XO think he all that)

It's cool when they do it (it's cool, huh?) 
It's a problem when I do it
Fuck 'em (fuck 'em)
Birds of a feather (what?)
They flock together, that make you a sucker (a sucker)
I don't fuck with nobody (none of 'em) 
If you ain't mob ties
Then it's fuck you (fuck you)
I don't want nothin' but some money (some money)
But if they get with this shit, I'ma flush 'em
I'm in South Carolina (what you doin'?) 
I'm lookin' for Renny
She know I'm some' pimpin' though (yeah, she know that)
She gotta be thick as hell, big player
Can't do nothin' with no skinny ho (oh, nah)
Bought a Glock .47, that bitch look like a DE
I hit it with both hands

I sign my own check (I'm CEO), better stay in your lane
Your lil' bitty broke ass (you broke)
They hate that they left me (they hate it) 
They regret what they said (they see)
But I don't accept it (I don't)
They claimin' he bought it (huh?) 
The whole time it was somebody else's (that's crazy)
Finesse bringin' real back (the real) 
He be speakin' his mind, that boy with the shit (he lit)
These rap niggas pitiful (I'm so sick of 'em) 
They be ready to kill you over a bitch, hold up

I come around, niggas go put they ho up (go put they ho up)
Quit askin' questions, bitch, shut up and roll up (roll up)
She eat the dick 'til she throw up, ugh
He tried to diss me to blow up (boom)
I'm VVS to the floor up, ooh
Pinky ring look like a doughnut
I do this shit for them niggas who solid 
And free all them real ones who jailin' in Beaumont
Damn, they can't do nothin' with 'em
Beefin' with who? It ain't nothin' with 'em (none)
I'm hearin' the slick shit (slick shit) 
Tote nothin' but big shit, you can get slumped with 'em (slumped with 'em)
The Draco is under me (yeah) 
That bitch in my lap now, come and get 'em (lap now, come and get 'em)
You think I ain't on point (you stupid) 
Run up if you want, shoot this bitch through the window (bah, bah, bah)

They like, "Ooh, he violent" (shh) 
They ain't droppin' nothin', ooh, they silent (shh)
They makin' up rumors, don't nobody believe 'em, that shit don't surprise me (it don't)
My side bitch main homie (on God) 
She play her position, ain't doin' no snitchin' (shh)
Remember I was broke (remember) 
Now they be like, "Hell nah, look at Ricky" (Lil' Deebo)
Don't act like you know a nigga
All them years I did, you ain't wrote a nigga
Don't be speakin' on me if you owe a nigga
I'll catch him in traffic and ho the nigga (ho the nigga)
I put that on my grandmammy (I put that on my grandmammy)
I was gone, but I'm back at it (now I'm back at it)
I ain't cool, I just act happy (cool, I just act happy)
Mini Drac', I can backpack it (bitch, I can tote it)

Say they got a bounty on who? (On who?)
They say they got prices on who head? (On who head?)
Thirty-two shots in this Glock .17, and bitch, it'll be thirty-two dead, on me
I hit that bitch with my foot in her neck (foot in her neck)
Sleepin' on me, now a crook in your neck (crook in your neck)
30K for a twenty minute set
Put some baguettes in the Cartier specs, I'm back in (I'm back)
They ain't fuck with me back then (they was sleepin')
Now they hollerin' 'bout, "Tap in" (hollerin' 'bout, "Tap in")
I pulled up with a MAC-10 (pulled up with a-, rrrt)
If she give you some pussy and you tell the business
That mean you a rat then (then you'll tell somethin')
I don't want your bottles, I don't want your weed, just give me my backends
I'm goin' back in (I'm goin' back in)
