		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what's your currency
I'll tell you where I'm currently
Tell me does it bother you
That nothing ever bothers me yeah
Spending all this money feeling stupid
But they'll never teach you how to use it
Spending all this money got me slowed down
Need another drink I need to slow down
Hop up on a jet
Where the fuck we going next
Spending money like I got American Express yeah
Falling down a slope I can't cope
Said too many things I don't know
Roll the window down I can't see
Tell me tell me who you wanna be
Is you free is you locked up
Either you stay down or you rise up
Better get your money I'ma count mine up
Better get your money I'ma count mine yeah
Yeah I'ma count mine up
Ain't no telling what the fuck my mind does
I've been thinking of a brand new way to
Get this money but I don't wanna face you
Wake up and I'm on another plane
A lot of people tell me it's insane
Wake up and I got another view
So tell me what the hell I'm supposed to do
Yeah I'm counting on you what the hell I'm supposed to do
Yeah I'm counting on you what the hell I'm supposed to do yeah
Falling down a slope I can't cope
Said too many things I don't know
Roll the window down I can't see
Tell me tell me who you wanna be
Is you free is you locked up
Either you stay down or you rise up
Better get your money I'ma count mine up
Better get your money I'ma count mine yeah
