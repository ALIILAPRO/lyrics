		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you cut for? You needed the rope
What you done for? You needed the hope
Once you see things the treaty is torn
Once you see things the treaty is torn
Peace of mind died and then it was born
A piece of mine died and then it was born
I never heard of that one before
I never heard of that one before
You stabbed me in my back
And took the same knife out and put it in my chest
Uncomfortable, outmatched
An unplanned disaster, lost in my mess
I can't feel anything but I look down and all I see is red
I thought of a million things but when I speak
All I taste is blood
I never heard of that one before
I never heard of that one before
I never heard of that one before
I never heard of that one before
To strike a match
And burn the book
To disattach
Right off the hook
I've met my match
With just one look
You know I can't
I just broke the rules
You stabbed me in my back
And took the same knife out and put it in my chest
Uncomfortable, outmatched
An unplanned disaster, lost in my mess
I can't feel anything but I look down and all I see is red
I thought of a million things but when I speak
All I taste is blood
I never heard of that one before
I never heard of that one before
I never heard of that one before
I never heard of that one before
