Passionate
This is the first time I'm so passionate
All these good times weren't by accident
Girl, you're my focus, where my passion is
And I can't pass on this for anything
Not all

'Cause you are everything
You are everything
You are everything I want, oh
You are everything
You are everything
You got everything I

Walkin' around seein' everything that you do
I recognize is real, we get together
Feel the love, feel the love
I feel like my days don't pass without you
What happened without your smile? I can't forget her
Feel the love, feel the love

Ooh, ooh
La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

I try to ration it
You're just so different from the past I lived
All these good times weren't by accident
Girl, you're my focus, where my passion is
And I can't pass on this for anything
Not all

'Cause you are everything
You are everything
You are everything I want, oh
You are everything
You are everything
You got everything I

Walkin' around seein' everything that you do
I recognize is real, we get together
Feel the love, feel the love
I feel like my days don't pass without you
What happened without your smile? I can't forget her
Feel the love, feel the love

La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da
