		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
I've been sippin' styrofoam all alone
She never gon' call when she need to
Now I got a new bitch on my phone
The other one, she be actin' brand new
I've been sippin' styrofoam all alone
She never gon' call when she need to
Now I got a new bitch on my phone
The other one, she be actin' brand new

[Interlude]
Brand new, the other one, she be actin' brand new

[Verse]
I can feel it right up in my bones
Everytime you say that you hate me
I been out here moving like a Rollin' Stone
My baby girl tellin' me Iâ€™m crazy
I been contemplatin', tryna right my wrongs
Wonder why she never call lately
Sippin' on this styrofoam, I think I'm gone
I don't wanna die, my lil' baby

[Bridge]
Shit, I don't wanna die, my lil' baby
And everytime you come, you say you hate me
Use me, break me


[Chorus]
I've been sippin' styrofoam all alone
She never gon' call when she need to
Now I got a new bitch on my phone
The other one, she be actin' brand new
I've been sippin' styrofoam all alone
She never gon' call when she need to
Now I got a new bitch on my phone
The other one, she be actin' brand new
