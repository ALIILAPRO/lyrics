		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're tickin' like a time bomb fit to blow up everything
Sooner or later, babe, you're gonna come for me
Once upon a time was the only thing to ease your pain
Somewhere along the way you got over me

And I saw you change into a lioness
A beast in the wild, unbridled
I could see it in your eyes
You could've eaten me alive
Just to show me you could

A hunter on the prowl, my feral queen, my everything
Sooner or later, babe, you'll have your way with me
And then I shake and feel the nerves
Guess that I'll get what I deserve
'Cause I couldn't let it go, yeah
I know better now, yeah

'Cause I saw you change to a lioness
A beast in the wild, unbridled
I could see it in your eyes
You could've eaten me alive, yeah
I saw you change to a goddess
Holy, divine in your power
I could hear it in your cry
You could've cut me down to size
Just to show me you could
Show me you could
Show me you could

And I won't forget the way that you looked at me
I won't forget the way that you shook, straight rattled my bones
Won't forget how you showed me your mercy (your mercy)
And I won't forget the way that you looked at me (and I shake and feel the nerves)
I won't forget the way that you shook, straight rattled my bones (guess that I'll get what I deserve)
Won't forget how you showed me your mercy (guess that I'll get what I deserve)
('Cause I couldn't let it go)

'Cause I saw you change into a lioness
A beast in the wild, unbridled
I could see it in your eyes
You could've eaten me alive
