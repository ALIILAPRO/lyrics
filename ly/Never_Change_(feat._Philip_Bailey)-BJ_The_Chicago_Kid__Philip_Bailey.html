		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dig, man
So many things in the world is changing
And will continue to change
Some of the things we love
Some of the things we dislike
It's inevitable
But, baby
I just wrote this song so

You know how I feel about you
But knowing we don't say it every day
No, I won't, I won't, I won't
I'll never change, babe 'cause

Seasons change
Nothing remains the same
The only exemption is love
It just keeps growing insane

Baby, you know, you know, you know, you know
You know my heart, baby
And stay on my mind
Yes, you do all the time

But, baby, my soul
Oh, my soul
Can't help but respond
To the love you give to me, baby
Every step, every breath is for you

And none of this will never change 'cause

Seasons change
But nothing (nothing remains the same)
The only the only exemption is love)
It just keeps growing (insane)
Ohh

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da

Ladies and gentlemen
I'm blessed to have the honor and pleasure 
To introduce to y'all tonight
From the elements, Earth, Wind & Fire
The legendary, the icon Mister Philip Bailey

Don't, never change, no
