		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

Yeah, fuckin' on her like I love her (ugh)
Just 'cause I got somethin' to offer and havin' this flavor, she think I'ma sucker (a lick)
No sleep for days and nights, zoomin' through time, I'm on a upper (so up there)
Back in that mode, belt to they ass like granny, you niggas in trouble (go)
I'm tryna make sure we all gon' profit
I'm tryna make sure you see how I pop it
Maybach truck (skrrt) got hydraulics
I'm tryna make sure you know how I'm rockin'
I'm tryna make sure you know what you doin'
I'm tryna make sure you know we into it
I'm tryna make sure the score on the board
I'm tryna make sure this ho don't record (don't do it)

A hundred thou' ain't nothin' (nathanial) 
Put hundred thou' in a trunk (bunk)
Pull up and slam on 'em, Tim Dunc' (uh)
Them niggas still ain't score, that skunk (hah)
Fourth quarter pressure, make a nigga punt (kick)
I'm in my own lane, no comp' (bitch)
I put a shit-eater in Saint Laurent (boots)
It's like her mouth better when she drunk (ooh)
I be havin' rich problems, damn, ten thousand for a Double-R window
Another ten, it's a dent on the fender (fuck)
Stand on business like I'm wearin' suspenders (suit)
I made a friendly bet with my nigga (what?)
We made a bet that (shh, ah)
We made a bet that (shh, be quiet)
By the end of the song, they get back, we won, we gon' get it (go)
I post a pic, she commentin' heart eyes, 'bout to blow our cover (dumb bitch)
She get on that dick and blow bubbles (brr)
That's why her Patek is custom (shine)
No rubber on top of the covers (uh)
She doin' what the last bitch wasn't (what?)
Label that pussy a controlled substance 
Hit it, it feel like I'm high when I'm bustin' (ugh, ugh, ugh, ayy)

Yeah, fuckin' on her like I love her (ugh)
Just 'cause I got somethin' to offer and havin' this flavor, she think I'ma sucker (a lick)
No sleep for days and nights, zoomin' through time, I'm on a upper (so up there)
Back in that mode, belt to they ass like granny, you niggas in trouble (go)
I'm tryna make sure we all gon' profit
I'm tryna make sure you see how I pop it
Maybach truck (skrrt) got hydraulics
I'm tryna make sure you know how I'm rockin'
I'm tryna make sure you know what you doin'
I'm tryna make sure you know we into it
I'm tryna make sure the score on the board
I'm tryna make sure this ho don't record (don't do it)

It's overstood, when you put in work, you gon' get you a jugg
Ferrari SF90, reversed psychology, trunk in the hood (it's swapped)
Just doubled my cup, feelin' good (the Wock')
Smoke a signature leaf, not a 'wood
Ayy, for real, send me the baggy Louis
They didn't even know I had that pull
I'm tryna make sure the bag is full (stuffed)
Picked up a stray, you can have her though (who this for?)
She want me now 'cause her man was broke (ah)
75K and that's just for the pendant
I done two-toned the loaf (Bread Gang)
Had to put on for sure, I ain't through (no)
Gotta put on some more (keep goin')
You rent that bitch, you don't own that ho (ayy)
One thing, for sure she gon' go (out of there, out of there, gone, ayy)

Yeah, fuckin' on her like I love her (ugh)
Just 'cause I got somethin' to offer and havin' this flavor, she think I'ma sucker (a lick)
No sleep for days and nights, zoomin' through time, I'm on a upper (so up there)
Back in that mode, belt to they ass like granny, you niggas in trouble (go)
I'm tryna make sure we all gon' profit
I'm tryna make sure you see how I pop it
Maybach truck (skrrt) got hydraulics
I'm tryna make sure you know how I'm rockin'
I'm tryna make sure you know what you doin'
I'm tryna make sure you know we into it
I'm tryna make sure the score on the board
I'm tryna make sure this ho don't record (don't do it)
