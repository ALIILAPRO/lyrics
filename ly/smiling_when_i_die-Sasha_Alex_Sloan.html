		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday felt like my graduation
But now some of those kids have got their own
Been a while since I took a vacation
It's been a while since I really let go

Don't wanna look back
Thinking I could've done this
Or I could've tried that
Don't wanna look back
'Cause it's going by fast

I'ma call my mother
It's been a while since I've been home
Take a trip in the summer
See all the lights in Tokyo
Get lost in the desert
Just to see what I can find
So when it's my time, I
I'm smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)
Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)

Yesterday felt like my first day working
But now I'm not the youngest on the clock
Been a while since days were just for burning
It's been a while since I threw back a shot

Don't wanna look back
Thinking I could've done this
Or I could've tried that
Don't wanna look back
'Cause it's going by fast

I'ma call my mother
It's been a while since I've been home
Take a trip in the summer
See all the lights in Tokyo
Get lost in the desert
Just to see what I can find
So when it's my time, I
I'm smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)
Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)

There's been a couple times that I've fell in love
But a couple times just ain't enough
There's been a couple joints that I could've shared
But I guess I gotta start somewhere

I'ma call my mother
It's been a while since I've been home
Take a trip in the summer
See all the lights in Tokyo
Get lost in the desert
Just to see what I can find
So when it's my time, I
I'm smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)
Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)

Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)
Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)
Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die)
