		<p>
		  I guess I'll miss the last train, baby
It's just what I gotta do (hey, how you doin'?)
Ain't nowhere I wanna be
More than when I'm here with you

I (how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
Got a lot, got a lot to learn (how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
No my love, no my love, no (hey)

I booked it on a Tuesday, baby
Tryna get to somewhere new 
(Hey, how you doin'?)
Now I think I've found you, lady
It's crazy I'm here with you

I (how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
Got a lot, got a lot to learn (how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
No my love, no my love, no (hey)

If you want me now (how you doin'?)
Love me every moment (hey, how you doin'?)
If you want me now (hey, how you doin'?)
Don't you let me walk on (hey, how you doin'?)
(Now you ain't got no problems 'round here)

If you want me now (hey, how you doin'?)
Love me every moment (hey, how you doin'?)
If you want me now (hey, how you doin'?)
Don't you let me walk on (hey, how you doin'?)

Breathe (hey, how you doin'?)

(Hey, how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
(Hey, how you doin'?)

Love me every moment (hey, how you doin'?)
Don't you let me walk on (hey, how you doin'?)
