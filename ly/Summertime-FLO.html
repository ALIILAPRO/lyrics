		  Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh)

Summertime, it's a vibe
Doin' what we do
Livin' life, mindin' mine (mindin' mine)
So I don't care 'bout you (I don't)
I'm makin' plans, I need a tan
I need a penthouse view (yeah)
Don't mean to brag, deep in my bag (my bag)
So I don't care 'bout you

Know you see me (uh), on some real heat (uh)
With my crew, lookin' cute in my two-piece (uh)
Don't even bother botherin' me
I'm catchin' flights without the feelings
Wanna party (uh), wanna wild out (uh)
Wanna dance to the beat 'til I pass out, hey (mm)
I'm tryna kick it with my ladies
Baby, yeah

Me and my girls are going in this summer (oh, oh)
Rolling, rolling in the back of the Hummer (oh, oh)
And we gon' do anything we wanna (oh, oh)
Yeah, we gon' do anything we wanna
Me and my girls are going in this summer (oh, oh)
Hair, nails, everything did like stunners (oh, oh)
And we gon' do anything we wanna (oh, oh)
Yeah, we gon' do anything we wanna

Said my drip and my shades are on
My Givenchy linen on
Fly trip to the Dominican
On God, I'm gone, on God, I'm gone (on God, I'm gone)
Lookin' so sensational
Then my braids go down to the floor (oh, oh)
I walk 'round like a phenomenon
On God, I'm gone, on God, I'm gone

Know you see me (yeah), on some real heat (yeah)
With my crew, lookin' cute in my two-piece (uh)
Don't even bother botherin' me (don't, don't, don't bother)
I'm catchin' flights without the feelings (Feelings)
Wanna party (uh), wanna wild out (yeah)
Wanna dance to the beat 'til I pass out, hey
Ain't tryna have nobody's babies (no, no, no, no, no)
Baby, yeah

Me and my girls are going in this summer (said we goin' in)
Rolling, rolling in the back of the Hummer (in the back of the Hummer)
And we gon' do anything we wanna (oh, oh)
Yeah, we gon' do anything we wanna (ooh, oh)
Me and my girls are going in this summer (oh, oh)
Hair, nails, everything did like stunners (oh, oh)
And we gon' do anything we wanna (we gon' do, oh yeah)
Yeah, we gon' do anything we wanna

We gon', we gon' (ah, period, whoa, oh)
We gon', we gon'
Oh, dada, da-dum-dum-dum-day, yeah
That was fun
