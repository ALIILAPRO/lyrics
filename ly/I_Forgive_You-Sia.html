		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I felt the life, felt the life
Slip out of me
Black as night, as night
Blue as the sea, yeah

I would have done anything
Would have given everything for you
I would have done anything
Would have given everything for you

I-I-I, I forgive you, you know not what you have done
Oh, I-I, I forgive you, now it's time for me to move on
Oh, I-I, I forgive you, you could not see right from wrong
Oh, I, and I love you always in my heart, you'll live on
You'll live on

Good people sin when yearning's
Unspoken-en, ooh
You broke my heart, broke my heart
But it's still beating

Oh, I would have done anything
Would have given everything for you
I would have done anything
Would have given everything for you

I-I-I, I forgive you, you know not what you have done
Oh, I-I, I forgive you, now it's time for me to move on
Oh, I-I, I forgive you, you could not see right from wrong
Oh, I, and I love you always in my heart, you'll live on
You'll live on
