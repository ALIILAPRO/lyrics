		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's make some strange
Cause last night I really did
I met this girl (Gimme back the nights)
Her name was Diana
She had a stare and defect the hair
(Gimme back the nights) oh
(Gimme back the night)

Nothing will be the same after tonight
Nothing will be the same
(Gimme back the nights)
Nothing will be the same after tonight
Nothing will be the same
(Gimme back the nights)
Nothing will be the same after tonight
Nothing will be the same
(Gimme back the nights)
Nothing will be the same after tonight
I walked in to Diana and said
(Gimme back the nights)

(Gimme back the nights)
(Gimme back the nights)
(Gimme back the nights)
Night night night night nights
(Gimme back the nights)
(Gimme back the nights)
(Gimme back the night-night-night-nights)

There's nothing to lose Diana
Come as you are
All the yes and my only guess is
Said all the yes and my only guess is
Is just you and I and let's playin' the mind
(Gimme back the nights)
With my perfect love for live it
Live it over live it, live it over
Feel my perfect love, feel it, feel it over
Feel it, feel it over
Feel my comfort love, feel it, feel it over
Feel it runnin over, feel it, feel it over

(Gimme back the nights) feel my comfort love
Feel it run it over, feel it runnin' over
Feel it run it over, feel it runnin' over
Feel my comfort love
Feel it run it over, feel it run it over
Run it over, run it over, run it over
I looked in her eyes and I said
Gimme back the nights

Gimme back the nights gimme back the nights
Gimme back the nights
Gimme back the night-night-night-nights
Gimme back the nights gimme back the nights
Gimme back the nights
Gimme back the night-night-night-nights
Gimme back the nights
