		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You long for the touch of the metal man
But on nights like this any man would do
You're a lady of the night, a guardian of the light
It's burning hot in you
Feel it burn inside you, yeah

Red light paradise
Red light in paradise
Red light paradise
Red light paradise
Oh yeah

How long do you think you can carry on your wicked ways of love
Does it ever ever bring you down?
Is this why you were made, for this you're getting paid
And you really like the foolin' around
Sometimes you feel like running but you never will

Red light paradise
Red light paradise
Red light paradise
Red light in paradise
Oh yeah, yeah

You're hot and ready for love tonight
You're always eager to be amused
Turn on the light in your window
At times it's blazing bright
You scream for love tonight
It's hot and it's burning in you
