		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day by day, whats to go for
Save my feeling, see you when you going for
You are truly at the door
Of some way, admiration

Oh, what a sweet serenade
And the world is still yours
Oh, there's a flow coming soon
And it rushes me just like a

Last Friday I see you in the photo booth
We exchange your name
The screen really takes to you
Will you really make it through
On some great accolades?

Oh, what a sweet serenade
And the night is still young for a
There's a flood coming soon
And it rushes me just like a tidal wave
A tidal wave, a tidal wave, a tidal wave

Oh, there's a flood coming soon
And the night is still young for a
Feel the tug of the moon
Completely gone on a tidal wave
A tidal wave, a tidal wave, a tidal wave
A tidal wave (completely gone on a) tidal wave
A tidal wave, (completely gone on a) tidal wave
A tidal wave (completely gone on a) tidal wave
A tidal wave (completely gone on a) tidal wave
A tidal wave (completely gone on a)
