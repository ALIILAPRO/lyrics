		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees in California

Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees

So do it like me, me, me, do it like me
Do it like me, me, me, do it like me
Do it like me, me, me, do it like me
And the girls all do it like me, me, me
Do it like me, me, me

And the waves crushing all over our bodies
Let it go 'cause you and me just feel the vibe
In the hills of west L.A. we sip Bacardi
Driving in my Cadillac, Route 65

Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees in California

Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees

So do it like me, me, me, do it like me
Do it like me, me, me, do it like me
Do it like me, me, me, do it like me
And the girls all do it like me, me, me
Do it like me, me, me

In the midnight we're surrounded by Feraris
Smoking cigarettes right on Rodeo Drive
The rave is over so you meet me in the lobby
In a room with a view to the Hollywood sign

It's 6 AM in California
And I still don't wanna go to sleep
The sunrise, we're hypnotized
You and I, baby, I still wanna do it like you

Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees in California

Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees

So do it like me, me, me, do it like me
Do it like me, me, me, do it like me
Do it like me, me, me, do it like me
And the girls all do it like me, me, me
Do it like me, me, me

Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees in California

Ayy, won't you come around and do it like me
Baby, slow down and do it like me
We could just slide back
Living on palm trees so do it like
