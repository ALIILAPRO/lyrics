		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Second skin, I think I finally feel it setting in
Save me this living hell
This heart, an empty shell, this mind, a shallow prison
A menace to my health, in solitude I dwell

Why do we insist that all hope is fleeting?
How do we reset when there's nothing left?

A false idol, I've become the hand that feeds
Making a habit of feigning misery
I have lived so many lives
That I cannot fucking tell which one is mine anymore
Severing the ties, lost as I disintegrate

Fade into the deepest depths, to the darkest black
Until there's nothing left (there's nothing left)

Second skin, I think I finally feel it setting in
Save me from this living hell
The mask on my face has finally taken over
Forever stuck this way
Now that I can't give it up

I am torn apart
Burning through my veins, born in agony
I am torn apart
Beneath the surface, dying within

Carve me out, the faces blend together
One in the same with no identity
Occupying an empty space
Sentenced to Purgatory
Stuck in obscurity
Stuck in obscurity
Beneath the surface
Dying within

Fade into the deepest depths, to the darkest black
Until there's nothing left (there's nothing left)
Fade into the deepest depths, to the darkest black
Until there's nothing left (there's nothing fucking left)
