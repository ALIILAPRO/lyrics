		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look down, look down
Don't look 'em in the eye
Look down, look down
You're here until you die

Now bring me prisoner 24601
Your time is up and your parole's begun
You know what that means
Yes, it means I'm free

No
Follow to the letter your itinerary
This badge of shame you'll show until you die
It warns you're a dangerous man

I stole a loaf of bread
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving

You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law
I know the meaning of those 19 years
A slave of the law

Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to run
Yes, 24601
My name is Jean Valjean

And I am Javert
Do not forget my name
Do not forget me
24601

Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave

Freedom at last
How strange it is
Never forget the years, the waste
Nor forgive them for what they've done
They are the guilty, every one

Today begins and now let's see
What this new world will do for me
