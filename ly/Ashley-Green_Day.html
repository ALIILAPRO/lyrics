		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now you’re crying out bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Used a tangled mind with your puppet strings
You tangled your desires right in front of my face
You let me into the world but wouldn’t let me drink
Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste

But time comes around and I’m not so naive
I’ve finally lost touch 'cause you’re so out of reach
You say that you’re fine but I know that you ain’t
You’re looking like hell and you’re no fucking saint

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now you’re crying out bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now you’re crying out bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

You are what you are
A wish on a shooting star
You are a filthy thought
In my memory

I’ve tasted cigarettes and liquor on your breath
we used to call it speed but now it’s crystal meth
Like when I loved you but you’re scaring me to death
This careless memory and now I could care less

But time comes around and I’m not so naive
I’ve finally lost touch 'cause you’re so out of reach
You say that you’re fine but I know that you ain’t
You’re looking like hell and you’re no fucking saint

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now you’re crying out bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now you’re crying out bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!
