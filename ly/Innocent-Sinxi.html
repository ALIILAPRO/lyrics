		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you point the blame
You say you can't recall
Playing innocent
And cutting off our calls
But i know your type
You're always in control
You'll just fuck it up
And drag me through it all
And i don't wanna sit and wait
I'm listening yeah
You say that you're prepared to change
But i don't see it yeah
So don't you go lying babe
It ain't a good look yet
But i know that you meant to say
That you'll stay the same
You say that you're prepared to change
But i don't see it yeah
And i'll wait
With my back to the sun
Cos i'll take
All my love to the stars
And i love
Everything that you are
But you said
That it wasn't enough
'He was all i could ever want, all i ever needed and more'
You say that you're prepared to change
But i don't see it yeah
I got you my arms again
I’m too diligent
Aware of my surroundings but I fear that you’re just skipping it
Absorbing all my energy to make you feel alive a bit
I guess it hurt to say you never really gave a shit for this
Maybe I should get away
Clear my head and just
Focus on myself before I succumb to all this dissonance
I’m perfectly imperfect and you’re the one that told me this
Maybe if I died you could tell them all the lies you said
Oh
