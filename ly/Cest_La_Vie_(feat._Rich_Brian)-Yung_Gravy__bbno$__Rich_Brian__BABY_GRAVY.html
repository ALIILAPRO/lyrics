		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, uh

Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching "Stand by Me" (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby, pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie

Tall bitch, I Attack on Titan
Need a fine VP like Biden
Trap that purp' in the gold like a Viking (uh)
Double cup ice like Tampa Lightning
Double cup, ain't no lean
Only sip syrup when I'm with Chief Keef
Play clean, pipe Christine
I pipe correct, I'm so P.C.

Go to the club but I don't even drink
I don't know what to think
Got a girl with me
And we pop in the kitchen
Dick all hard, my nuts on a mission
I got cash, they got coins in my mileage
E-D-D, your credit looking childish
Your girlfriend, should change her into my bitch
She got LASIK, I nut on her iris (nut on her iris?)

Bored in the morn', yeah, just like a virus
Tongue game gnarly, I ain't talking no Cyrus
Pull up on the booty, yeah, we some pirates
I don't know why, we got huge privates (woah)
I guess we're kinda blessed, I can't complain about it (uh)
Every day I get another check, I won't complain about it

Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching "Stand by Me" (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby, pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie

Bubble bath and a bucket of cash
When your bitch said "Gravy, put it in my ass"
Lets run it (up), 'cause you kindly asked
And I guess I'll be a gentleman that's 'bout to smash
But then you gotta help me smoke this gas
And count some cash and trap some hash
And then I need a ride to my cooking class
Gravy train, choo-choo on that ass

Skrrt on a median, could whip down Fairfax
Bitch, I'm a king, you a peasant in the barracks (bitch)
Chillin' with a pornstar, life like an IMAX
Fuck grammar one time, no syntax
Cock real hard, yeah, I'm horny for the big racks
Crack my nuts, she can juice my gonads
Baby-yes-bucks, yeah, Selena Gomez
Always make big moves, last name nomad
Troll so much, made a song called "u mad!"
Next bar Gravy says I wrote, he mad

Ooh, ayy
Baby, c'est la vie
Finger-lickin' good like it's KFC
I learned to count a mil' before my ABCs
Fuck your Delta A, your bitch ate my D

Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching "Stand by Me" (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby, pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
