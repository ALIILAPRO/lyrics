		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Mm-mm)

I wanna follow where he goes
I think about him and he knows it
I wanna let him take control
'Cause every time that he gets close, yeah

He pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (oh)
Maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
Oh oh, ooh
There's nothing holdin' me back
Oh, oh no no
There's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She doesn't really like to wait
Not really into hesitation

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (oh)
Maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, oh

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
Oh
There's nothing holdin' me back, baby
Oh ooh, oh ooh oh
There's nothing holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back 
Nothing at all, girl, nothing 
There's nothing holdin' me back (oh)
I feel so free when you're with me, baby (baby)
Oh, there's nothing holdin' me back
