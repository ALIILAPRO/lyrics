		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another party is over
And I'm left cold sober
Baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low, so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues

I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues
