		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will we ever have to make a choice again?
Buried in false ties and the cost of our descent
Our veil is lifted to a paradigm
Of eternal penance

All control is fading out
Warm beds are taken up
We're stranded waiting for a lie
With half-cut tongues
We struggle endlessly for naught
This life has come undone

A sight unfolds
We can't remember if we've been here before
We can't get close
If even for a moment now
When I feel so alone

The weight is borne by the ones still left
For we all have a cross to bear
But is there faith with a lack of trust?
Our most stable crutch

When's it gonna be the end of this?
Biting tongues at the mouth of war
When's it gonna be the end of this?
We've recused ourselves to damnation by the book
Will it light the way when the torches overwhelm?
Will it light the way when every bridge is burning down?

A sight unfolds
We can't remember if we've been here before
We can't get close
If even for a moment now
When I feel so alone

Blood spilled in error
Love left behind in your wake
Blood spilled in error
Love left behind in your wake

The silence hurts
It's not your heart bleeding on the ground
We can't get close
If even for a moment now

A sight unfolds (a sight unfolds)
We can't remember if we've been here before
We can't get close (can't get close)
If even for a moment now
When I feel so alone
Alone, alone
Alone, alone
