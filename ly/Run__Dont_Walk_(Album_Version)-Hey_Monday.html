		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am restless and I keep trembling
Everyone watch me as I descend
Into a feeling that's overwhelming me
I've finally stopped, stopped making sense

I can't stop talking to myself
I'm a desperate cry for help

Run, don't walk, the sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight, I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you
I don't care where we are or where we're heading to
But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you, with you

You're mouth keeps moving but I've lost focus now
Clock keeps ticking, time's running out
Where we're headed, there is no heading back
Tripping ugly, I'm losing ground

I can't stop talking to myself
I'm a desperate cry for help

Run, don't walk, the sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight, I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you
I don't care where we are or where we're heading to
But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you, with you

For the record, when I'm with you
Things are looking better for once
Everything is brighter
Than the darkness before you

Run, don't walk, the sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight, I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you

Run, don't walk, the sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight, I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you
I don't care where we are or where we're heading to
But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you
