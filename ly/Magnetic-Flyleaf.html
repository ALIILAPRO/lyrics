		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You seem to know when I need to feel you closer
Pulling me places I've never been
There is a light inside you that hypnotizes
Where I am ending is where you begin

Pulling me from the other side of the world, magnetic
Filling up the space between the stars, we are magnetic
Nothing's gonna come between us now
Always gonna find each other somehow
Magnetic, magnetic
Oh, magnetic, magnetic

The waves you're sending to me, they're getting stronger
Pushing me back when I drift too far
So say you'll stay with me in this dream forever
Where I am ending is where you begin

Pulling me from the other side of the world, magnetic
Filling up the space between the stars, we are magnetic
Nothing's gonna come between us now
Always gonna find each other somehow
Magnetic, magnetic
Oh, magnetic, magnetic

Oh, ah

Always gonna find each other somehow
Always gonna find each other somehow
Magnetic

Pulling me from the other side of the world, magnetic
Filling up the space between the stars, we are magnetic
Nothing's gonna come between us now
Always gonna find each other somehow
Magnetic, magnetic
Oh, magnetic, magnetic
Oh, magnetic, magnetic
Oh, magnetic, magnetic
