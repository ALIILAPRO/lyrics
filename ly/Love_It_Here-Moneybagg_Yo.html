		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It get worse 'fore it get better
Just make sure you mean it before you say them four letters
Feel like this could be forever
I ain't tryna pick for you, but it's now or never
The streets and you, I be torn between the two
Got to a point I was lyin' to keep you
Knowin' she just talkin', but she talkin' 'bout how she through
I'm like, "Bitch, stop playin' with me, find you somethin' safe to do"
They want my attention, but you saw me play it cool
I really paid dues, your foot couldn't fit inside my shoes
I'm stamped where I'm from, I ain't got nothin' else to prove
Tryna better my position, I had no choice but to choose
Your bitch see what you don't see when them niggas actin' fool
If shit pop off right now, who you really know gon' shoot?
Mean, but lovey-dovey, gangsta when she in public
Fuck her she talkin' slutty, left it in when I nutted

Trouble in paradise, sometimes it be
Pointless if we ain't on the same time, it be
Listen, quit talkin' over me when I be tryna speak
Her vibe like the guys, so I call her my G
Trouble in paradise, sometimes it be
Pointless if we ain't on the same time, it be
Listen, quit talkin' over me when I be tryna speak
Her vibe like the guys, so I call her my G 

So I call her my G, so I call her my G, so I call her my G
