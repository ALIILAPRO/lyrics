		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I broke up with you on your birthday
Should never have been with you in the first place
'Cause you had me so messed up
Misbehavin' in the club
So I had to break up with you on your birthday

Was gonna buy you a cake
Red velvet that's your favorite, for God's sake
How was I such an idiot? You know, babe
Good luck with all your party plans
I'll go find me another man, it's okay

Happy fuckin' birthday
I hope it is the worst day of the year
Every time you celebrate, you'll be thinkin' of my face
Sayin' "Happy fuckin' birthday, my dear"

Remember when we took that trip to Paris?
You had just turned twenty-two, I'm so embarrassed
Left me standin' there for hours
Underneath the Eiffel Tower
You were chatting to the girl from the cafe

Who's gonna buy you a cake?
When they don't know your favorite, for God's sake
You really are an idiot, oh well, babe
Good luck with all these party plans
I'll be with my other man, doin' great

Happy fuckin' birthday
I hope it is the worst day of the year
Every time you celebrate, you'll be thinkin' of my face
Sayin' "Happy fuckin' birthday, my dear"
Oh, oh

Happy fuckin' birthday (happy fuckin' birthday)
I hope it is the worst day of the year (the absolute worst)
Every time you celebrate (uh-huh), you'll be thinkin' of my face (they say)
Sayin' "Happy fuckin' birthday, my dear" (happy fuckin' birthday)

Happy fuckin' birthday (you prick)
Happy fuckin' birthday
Happy fuckin' birthday (yeah, yeah)
Happy fuckin' birthday, my dear
Haha, oh God, hahaha
