		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Twisted Sister...
Come out and play...
Twisted Sister...
Come out and play...

Are you afraid
Of things that go bump in the night?
Behind closet doors
Of things when you turn out the light
Don't be afraid of the night
There's a light in the dark burning bright
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid...
...Of the light

Come inside our world
An oyster 'round a pearl
You'll all be safe inside
A perfect place to hide, you'll see
Fun by decree
Ride above the storm
The average and the norm
A new found ecstacy
A wild fantasy come true
This one's for you
Oh, welcome to our show
Oh, welcome to our life
Just follow me and you'll set yourself free
Now won't you come out and play

Come out and play
Come on out and play

Join our cavalcade
Enter the world you made
We're only here for you
To do what you won't do, you know
On with the show
A place where fallacy
Becomes reality
We'll spin you head around
We're programmed to astound, stand by
Prepare to fly
Oh, welcome to our show
Oh, welcome to our life
Just follow me and you'll think that you're free
Now won't you come out and play
