		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We gotta stop meeting like this
In the shadows of the night
When the high starts to hit
That black leather jacket
Got me like an addict

Your hand on my neck in the car
No, you can't break my heart
If it's only in the dark
Acting like a savage
You're my favorite sabotage

You keep me coming, coming back

I just can't get you out of my bed
You're so bad but I just can't help myself
Say goodbye then I do it again
I should quit but your lips got me high as hell

Like la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 

These sheets are calling your name
You turned me into a fiend
I need your love in my veins
It's your fault the mattress
Is holding us captive

You keep on comin', comin' back

I just can't get you out of my bed
You're so bad but I just can't help myself
Say goodbye then I do it again
I should quit but your lips got me high as hell

Like la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 

I can't, I can't, I can't get you out, now
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha taste in my mouth
I can't, I can't, I can't get you out, now
Don't know how to stop

I just can't get you out of my bed
You're so bad but I just can't help myself
Say goodbye then I do it again
I should quit but your lips got me high as hell

Like la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
