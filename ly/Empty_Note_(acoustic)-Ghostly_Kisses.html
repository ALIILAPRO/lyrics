		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could I ever know you? 
When everything lies in disguise 
How could I ever forget? 
Those eyes looking for my weal 

How could I ever know more? 
When everything is held by threat 
How could I ever feel you? 
Once again, without losing my mind 

Oh empty note 
Shadows of my past 
Made it to the end 

How could I ever know you? 
When you are miles and miles away 
How could I forgive myself? 
How blind and scared I was 

Oh empty note 
Shadows of my past 
Made it to the end 

Oh empty note 
Shadows of my past 
Made it to the end
