		  Ah, ah, ah-oh
Ah, ah, ah-oh
Ah, ah, ah-oh
Ah, ah, ah-oh
Ah, ah, ah-oh
Ah, ah, ah-oh

Everyone knows I'm right about one thing
You and I don't work out
You bring out the mean in me
I bring out your insecurities
You know what I am talking 'bout
Eventually you'll be fine if we break up
And one day I'll be fine too
But we should just end it now
Before someone gets more hurt than they have to

As for our house, I'll move out
You can keep the dog we trained
Things soon will be like before I ever met you
Before I ever met you

Before I ever met you
I never knew that my heart could love so hard
Before I ever met you
I never knew I would be enemies with disregard
Before I ever met you
I never knew that I liked to be kissed for days
Before I ever met you
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways, yeah
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways, yeah
I never knew I could be broken in so many

Everyone knows I'm right about one thing
You are my only vice
And I got you addicted to trying to be bulletproof
But you have too much to lose

As for our house, I'll move out
You can keep the dog we trained
Things soon will be like before I ever met you
Before I ever met you

Before I ever met you
I never knew that my heart could love so hard
Before I ever met you
I never knew I could be enemies with disregard
Before I ever met you
I never knew that I liked to be kissed for days
Before I ever met you
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways, yeah
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways, yeah
I never knew I could be broken in so many

Everyone knows I'm right about one thing
You and I don't work out
