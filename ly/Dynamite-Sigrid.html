		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know where I am with you
Forgetting time and space with you
Oh, I wish we had a common view
You see my red as blue
I don't belong in your universe
For better or for worse

I'm the same, but I'm bolder
You'll get home, but I'm on my way out now
Not the same destinations
I will stay when you get off the train

You're as safe as a mountain
But know that I am dynamite
Oh, you're as safe as a mountain
But know that I am dynamite

Your hand is warm but my heart is blue
Is blue now
I miss you, but I've got things to do
Oh, I wish we had a common view
You see my red as blue
I don't belong in your universe
For better or for worse

I'm the same, but I'm bolder
You'll get home, but I'm on my way out now
Not the same destinations
I will stay when you get off the train

You're as safe as a mountain
But know that I am dynamite
Oh, you're as safe as a mountain
But know that I am dynamite
Know that I am dynamite, now ooh
Oh know, know that I am dynamite
Know that I am dynamite

Oh, it's so cold here
'Cause I left my heart to be with you
Oh, it's so cold here
'Cause I left my heart to be with you

I'm the same, but I'm bolder
You'll get home, but I'm on my way out now
Not the same destinations
Know I will stay when you get off the train

You're as safe as a mountain
But know that I am dynamite
Oh oh, you're as safe as a mountain
But know that I am dynamite
