		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't hear myself
Yeah
(When I see you, I) yeah
No, I'm-, no, I'm not-, no, I'm not the same
No, I'm not the same, no, I'm not the same
No, I'm not the, fuck
No, I'm not the same, uh
I think I done changed, yeah
Woo, woo, woo

No, I'm not the same, nigga (not the same, no)
I think I done changed, nigga, uh
See somethin' not the same, nigga (not the same, no)
I used to walk into the room head down
I don't walk, now I float

Float on 'em, I float on 'em, just float
They hangin' on to that Goose down in my coat
Float on 'em, I float on 'em, just float
I don't step, I don't walk, I don't dance, I just

Float, float, float, float
I don't dance, I just
Float, float, mm, float, float, float
Mm, I just float

I'm light as a feather, I'm light as a feather
Yeah, baby, I float
It's hard to look at my resume, hoo
And not find a reason to toast
She throwin' that thang in a circle
Makin' it viral, I might just elope
Say, "Listen lil' mama, you like shibari? 
Watch while I show you the ropes"
I used to let niggas get to me
I used to be my own enemy
Now I done had several epiphanies over some breakfast at Tiffany's
Had to forgive all my frenemies
They are not who they pretend to be
I had to protect all my energy 
I'm feelin' much lighter, now I float

Float on 'em, I float on 'em, just float
They hangin' onto that Goose down in my coat
Float on 'em, I float on 'em, just float
I don't step, I don't walk, I don't dance, I just

Float, float, float, float
I don't dance, I just
Float, float, mm, float, float, float
Mm, I just float

I wear the attire, check out the robe.
I'm fresh like a pope
I'm doin' my dance on catamarans 
And you gotta cope
I'm countin' my blessings, we ain't stressin'
Just look at this glow
I got that magic, I'm really prepared for whatever 
Whenever so who want the smoke?
Came back from the future to take all y'all niggas 
And take all y'all hoes
They said I was bi, yeah, baby
I'm by a whole 'nother coast
She stay in the hills, he stay in Atlanta
I paid for them both
My face card don't come with a limit 
I swipe it, I spend it, I swear I be doin' the most

Float, float on 'em, I float on 'em, just float
They hangin' on to that Goose down in my coat
Float on 'em, I float on 'em, just float
I don't step, I don't walk, I don't dance, I just

Float, float, float, float
I don't dance, I just
Float, float, mm, float, float, float

(When I see you, I)
Alright, I have a toast if you're willing to repeat it (yeah)
Repeat after me (alright)
To the lives we lead
To the lives we lead
To the dreams we chase
To the dreams we chase
To the moments that we make
To the moments that we make
And the fucked up shit we can't erase
And the fucked up shit we can't erase, woo
