		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get so damn high that I can't feel none
Staring at the sky, I'm thinkin' 'bout my life
Things ain't go my way, you know I can't run
You act so surprised, like I ain't know it's right
I do what I can
Even when I can't
Why you always feel like you right, oh
Blame it your trauma don't make it right, oh

But I guess I am who I am
And I got a word in my hands
Did what you did, I did what I did
I could forget, not forgive
It's too hard to let go
When you're all that I know
'Cause you can't trust anybody
Took another half, I can feel it in my body
Getting on my nerves seem to be your favorite hobby
If it's not you, then it's me, that really got me in the end
Be so caught up in my feelings, I forget (I forget)
I'm the only reason that I'm here (that I'm here)
It wasn't you, no, and that's the truth, oh

I get so damn high that I can't feel none
Staring at the sky, I'm thinkin' 'bout my life
Things ain't go my way, you know I can't run
You act so surprised, like I ain't know it's right
I do what I can
Even when I can't
Why you always feel like you right, oh
Blame it your trauma don't make it right, oh
