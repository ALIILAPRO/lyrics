		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake it up
Get it started now
Will drive this groove that'll make you drop
You want it very sexy, wanna feel me
I'm gonna rise and set you free

Waited for this very moment
Raise your hands for me
Stressed out from stale common logic
Strain your voice and scream

Tell me what you want from me
Tell me your perversions
Got the thing that works on this
Chaos and confusions

I hear a siren that's wailing away

Go all the way with your voice aflame
Go all the way forget about those pains that stain
Go all the way when the world's insane
When your life feels hollow
Just let it out

Can't stop what we're starting now
It's time for ecstasy
There's no sense concealing within
Feigning preciously

Tell me what you want from me
Tell me your perversions
Got the thing that works on this
Chaos and confusions

I hear silence withdrawing away

Go all the way with your voice aflame
Go all the way forget about those pains that stain
Go all the way when the world's insane
When your life feels hollow
Just let it out

You're ready now
Gonna start again
Better drive this groove that'll make me drop
You want it laid on tight, you wanna taste it
I'm gonna rise you come with me

Wake it up
Get it started now
Will drive this groove that'll make you drop
You want it very sexy, wanna feel me
I'm gonna rise and set you free

Go all the way with your voice aflame
Go all the way forget about those pains that stain
Go all the way when the world's insane
When your life feels hollow
Just let it out
