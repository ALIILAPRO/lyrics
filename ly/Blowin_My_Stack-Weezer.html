		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woe is me
I'm standing in line for the first time in a mighty long time
But it feels good to be a jerk I'm just a loser on his way to work
'Cause I need cash to pay my bills
And buy some groceries to eat my fill
But I'm pissed off cause no one cares
They walk on by me like I ain't ever there

So I'm blowin' my stack
Blowin' my stack
It makes me feel good
Blowing my stack
Blowin' my stack
It makes me feel good

So easy to roll through life
You know the answers but you don't know why
You just stand tall and move ahead
your heart it beating but you wind up dead
'Cause you can't feel any love inside
It tries to find you but you run and hide
Cause your so scared (so scared) so scared (so scared)
And I'm scared too

So I'm blowin' my stack
Blowin' my stack
It makes me feel good
Blowing my stack
Blowin' my stack
It makes me feel good

I'm too tired to fight
I'm too tired to fight
I'm too tired to fight!
I'm too tired to fight
Fight, fight

Aah I'm blowin' my stack
Blowin' my stack, blowin' my stack
It makes me feel good
Blowing my stack, blowin' my stack
It makes me feel good
