		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna give you everything you need from me
Everything (ayy), I wanna

Wanna make you fall in love
First thing we need is trust
Second thing I need is love
Third thing I need is you on me
Just make that decision 'cause it's all on you
Tell me what you like and whatever what you wan' do
If you wanna ride on me like a typhoon
Let me eat you like some food

Let me do what I do and I promise you love it
I promise when we go shopping, it ain't no budget
Whatever you got on the side, you just gotta cut it
If they see us outside, they gon' try to make something of it
Just to be clear, they 'bout to mistake your Richard Mille for chandelier
I don't try to implement no strife or pain here
I don't try to implement my life for gains here
'Cause I been through this shit over and over
My heart so cold, I been a loner
Every time, I tell myself, "This time, it'll be different"
But every time, these bitches gon' let me down
I don't want no shawty they can pass around
You just stay with me and I'ma be the last one
We ain't 'bout to let one apple spoil the whole batch
Yeah, I be outside, but I always know where home at

Wanna make you fall in love
First thing we need is trust
Second thing I need is love
Third thing I need is you on me
Just make that decision 'cause it's all on you
Tell me what you like and whatever what you wan' do
If you wanna ride on me like a typhoon
Let me eat you like some food

Fashion week walking, take you out to Paris
Have these bitches talking, they just be embarrassed
They just wanna be in headlines with me so they can share it
I just want you naked with that silk robe
Walkin' around the house with your heels on
Fresh out the shower, sex with new set of toes
This dick inside your belly, deep stroke, make you moan
I go hard inside your guts when I'm deprived too long
When you text me, got your body all inside my phone
I know that you a real one
One time for the real ones
I know that you a real one, one, one, one, one
Sing this shit if you a real one, one, one, one, one, one, one

Wanna make you fall in love
First thing we need is trust
Second thing I need is love
Third thing I need is you on me
Just make that decision 'cause it's all on you
Tell me what you like and whatever what you wan' do
If you wanna ride on me like a typhoon
Let me eat you like some food

I wanna give you everything you need from me
Everything
I wanna

I wanna give you everything you need from me
Everything
I wanna give you everything
