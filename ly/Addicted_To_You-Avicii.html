		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know just how it happened, I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming, caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going, I fell into your arms

You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you

Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotized, I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you
