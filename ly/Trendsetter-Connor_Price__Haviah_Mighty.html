Yeah
Trendsetter, whoa
League of my own it don't get better, no
Read what I wrote I'm a best seller, yeah
Reach for my goals hit it dead center
Hit it dead center

Bullseye hit it the most there's no misses
Something like fish in a barrel it's no different
Blindfold on me I still got the most vision
Trendsetter told 'em before but they don't listen
Batter better bring a better bat because I'm bigger, better
Solo singles selling several shows out every single second
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Connor came and crushed the competition
Hope they get the message
Look
Living it fast, been in my Eminem bag
I never go slow
Thinking I'll crash, end up a thing in the past
They know I won't though
Big fish catching me, they gon' need a bigger boat
Ironic how the world stops when I spin the globe (spin the globe)
Always showing up
Last year's songs still holding up (uh-huh)
See the name now and they know what's up (right, yeah, ayy)
Price hit the top and it's going up

I'm a trendsetter, whoa
League of my own it don't get better, no
Read what I wrote I'm a best seller, yeah
Reach for my goals hit it dead center
Hit it dead center
Yeah, ayy
Trendsetter, whoa
League of my own it don't get better, no
Read what I wrote I'm a best seller, yeah
Reach for my goals hit it dead center
Hit it dead center

B-O-D
Get the spell checker, fact check and prevent errors
Going up, see the bent lever
Jalape√±o hot, y'all just red peppers
All y'all carbon copies but I'm left center (yeah)
And your shorty glitching on me like a tech center
Hit her with a French tenor
Crazy, wait until I do the next record, I'll leave heads severed
I don't need to hit the bench ever
But if I do, I'm PR'ing to the next level
Condor flights to Lufthansa
Already know who you people fans of
Call me big daddy in a big body wrangler
Call me big daddy, Adam Sandler
Bullseye, aiming for a cottage with a poolside
Full size

Always showing up
Last year's songs still holding up
See the name now and they know what's up
Price hit the top and it's going up

I'm a trendsetter, whoa
League of my own it don't get better, no
Read what I wrote I'm a best seller, yeah
Reach for my goals hit it dead center
Hit it dead center
