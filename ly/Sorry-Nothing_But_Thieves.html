		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You might kill me with desire
Wind me tighter than a wire
It's something that you do to me
I run away like mercury

And I know you think it's rough
When you're try'na patch us up
And I say honey what is love?
You just say I drink too much

Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

And I'm the t-shirt that I wear
Pick the thorns out of my hair
I broke your heart so carelessly
But made the pieces part of me

And now it hurts what we've become
'Cause you taught me how to love
It's me who taught you how to stop
And you just say I drink too much

Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I been waiting so long

I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I've waited for this
I'm ready for it
I been waiting so long

Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
