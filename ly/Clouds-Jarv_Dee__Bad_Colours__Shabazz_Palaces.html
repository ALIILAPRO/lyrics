		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no rain goin slow me down you know how my city be
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
I just mind my business
Fill my pipe with the Popeye spinach
Low key in a 98 civic
They know my wife but the bitch is still with it
Move around get the money that's the plan
Straight Sativa we ain't sticking to a strand
They whipping in a pot I'm cooking in a pan
They trying to get some bitches man I'm trying to get some land
But I don't even know what the lick read
Still grinding up the hill on a six speed
Avoiding all the drama on my damn feed
I see em living fake but it's not me
They see the come up and I know it hurts
I don't praise your god I praise the universe and I ain't gonna tell you unless I do first
No false prophets stepping in my church
Ain't no rain goin slow me down you know how my city be
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
Im posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down
What it is
What's good
You wish you could and I wish you would
Spit boss game on the shit I stood
Coming out the CD hood
There always some dough and a hoe around
Cuz your niggas stand out in the crowds
You boys cloaked in a shroud
I show niggas how then I take a bow
The glows infinite
The clothes rose scented we magnificent
Cazal 850's and they're gold tinted
Rubbing on her back while I burn incense
It's the dons of the fly sentence
On the dawn of the styles glistening
Wake up to it bake up to it get your cake up do it!
Flow so fluid we the quantum druids and now you know it.
Ain't no rain goin slow me down you know how my city be
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down (let the Earth shake)
I'm posted in the clouds I ain't never coming down
