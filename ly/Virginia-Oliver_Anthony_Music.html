		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been pickin' on the same back porch since
I was just a boy with a dream
Daddy had a cow, bitty horse
Down in the field, runnin' back and things
Preacher talk about heaven, Lord, it sure sounds nice
At least I can tell them that I had me a slice
Nobody's singin' songs 'bout Virginia
But sweet Virginia's always a-singin' to me

On them old back roads
Where the green grass grows
Way down in the hills
Where the folks on horseback rode
Lordy, I'll tell the youngins
If I grow old
What they all told me
They don't ever sing songs 'bout Virginia
But Virginia is always a-singin' to me

I got a lighter and I got a bowl
I know a spot where the law don't go
Now we can smoke somethin'
That daddy never grow back in his day

Down an old dirt road
Where the green grass grows
Way down in the hills
Where the folks on horseback rode
I'll tell the youngins
When I grow old
What they all told me
Well, they don't ever sing songs 'bout Virginia
But Virginia is always a-singin' to me
