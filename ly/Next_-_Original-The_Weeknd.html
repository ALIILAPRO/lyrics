		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh, whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

She pop that pussy on a Monday
She never falls in love
But she heard me in the club, she put in work
She wanna give me all her money
She used to spend it all alone 
'Cause her man went and did her wrong, so she

But baby I'm not trying to be the one
I got my baby waiting home
She been too good to let that go
And I ain't tryna win your heart
And you can't pay to win my love
So keep dancin', baby, keep dancin', dancin'
Keep dancin', dancin', keep dancin'

(I want you)
I know, yes I know, yes I know, yes I know, yes I know
(Baby, I want you)
I'm too far in this game, to let go
So let go, so let go
(Baby, I want you)

Baby, who you tryna fool?
Girl, I might be twenty-one but I got memories to prove
That I've seen your kind before
And I know exactly what you want

You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next, baby
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next

You just want me 'cause I'm next, baby
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next, ooh yeah

You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next, oh-oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, who you callin' soft?
Don't make me smoke up all your kush
Don't make me pop your cheap ass pills
I used to do this for the thrill, ooh yeah
I know you got a lot to lose
But ain't nobody here but me

So, baby, what you got to prove, ooh yeah
I see the way your body moves
On the pole, on the floor, you're alone (na-na-na-na)
But there ain't nothing I can do
So keep dancin' baby, keep dancin', dancin'
Keep dancin', dancin', keep dancin'

(I want you)
I know, yes I know, yes I know, yes I know, yes I know
(Baby, I want you)
I'm too far in this game, to let go
So let go, so let go
(Baby, I want you)

Baby, who you tryna fool?
Girl, I might be twenty-one but I got memories to prove
That I've seen your kind before
And I know exactly what you want, oh

You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next

You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next

You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next
You just want me 'cause I'm next, oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
