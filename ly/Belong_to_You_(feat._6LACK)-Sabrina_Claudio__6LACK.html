		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take care of me
Talk all day then at night fall in deep
Stimulate me
I want you mental and physically
I belong to

I belong to you
You
You

Don't come my way
If you ain't here for love
Don't you dare, stay
Put some time aside I've set vibes in LA (yeah)
It ain't strictly physical but I know that
I wanna lay (yeah) 
Where you lay
So, I think you should fuck with me (yeah)
Be the one to take me out the street (yeah)
I can give you everything you need (yeah)
Need you in my reach (yeah)
You know I fall really, really deep (yeah)
You can put your lovin' where I speak (yeah)

Baby, I belong to you
I belong to you

I belong to you
You
You

Take care of me (take care)
Talk all day then at night fall in deep
(You're fallin' deep, you're fallin deep 
You're fallin deep, you're fallin deep, yeah)
Stimulate me
I want you mental and physically

I belong to you (yeah-yeah)
You (yeah-yeah, yeah)
You
I belong to you
You
You
I belong to you
