		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, pretty baby, you're my motivator
Got me changing my words and my behavior
Pretty lady, you're my operator
Got me dialing your number just to hear ya

Tell me the things that you want
I give you all that I've got
Open your eyes, then you will see

It's just you and me
Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Listen to you breathe
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me

My disaster, you're my only answer
You got me thinking that I could be your master
Pretty baby, you're my heavy ocean
Weigh me down and give me your devotion

Tell me the things that you want (you want)
I give you all that I've got (I've got)
Open your eyes, then you will see

It's just you and me
Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Listen to you breathe
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me

Take, take me over
They'll take me over
And I don't wanna wake up
It's just you and me
Take, take me over
They'll take me over
And I don't wanna wake up
It's just you and me

Dream, dream, dream, dream world
Dream, dream, dream, dream world (take, take me over)
They'll take me over
I don't wanna wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Listen to you breathe
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me

Dream, dream, dream, dream world
It's just you and me
Dream, dream, dream, dream world
Only
