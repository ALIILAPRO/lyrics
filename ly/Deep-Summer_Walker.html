		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trust me, trust me
I don't like being alone
Thinkin' 'bout ringing your line
I wish you would come home
But I'm just tryna balance my space
I'm just tryna protect my space, oh
I don't really need the pain (pain)
But I love to feel the pain
Maybe I could use a break
So we just might have to wait, oh

'Cause we're way too in love
Just to fuck and let go
'Cause we're way too involved
Just to cut and not call (call, call)

Way too in deep, deep
Way too in deep (call)
Way too in deep, deep
Way too in deep, oh, I
Wish I could call, wish I could call and go home
Oh, no-no-no, we can't even let it go
