		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  K/DA
Should we show 'em how we do it every day?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Let's get it

Akali that girl, 'kali go grr
'Kali don't stop, 'kali don't skrt
'Kali got a job, 'kali go to work
뜨거워 언제나 don't get burnt
넘쳐 흘러 more than a buffet
죽여 주잖아 like I'm buffy
누가 감히 on my huffy
거, 문 열지 마 that's a rough day
I'm givin' you more 'cause I'm greater than
필요없는 시험들, 답은 이미
But all of my numbers are talkin', babe
블루마블 Mrs. 모노폴리 (Monopoly, ah-hoo)
넌 종이돈이, 나는 real money (hey)
필요 없대 너네들이 많은 돈들
Go get it, go get it, go get it, the mission
눈을 못 떼, 모두 그래, 너도 그래
'Cause I got it different ('cause I got it different)

All I'll ever know is life up on a throne
시작하면 끝을 보는 거야
You want

More
Know I got it, so here you go (let's go)
You look like you could use some more (more)
Know I got it and never runnin' low (low, oh)
Yeah, I got more than enough, add it up and away (ay, ay)
You know I got it like bomb-bomb, blow your mind
Never givin' less and that's how it'll stay (ay, ay)
You know I got it like all day, all the time

When I go, it's for gold
Yeah, they cool, but I'm cold
I don't fit in the mold
I'm a rebel
I don't do what you say
Makin' moves, I don't wait
While I smile in your face
I got different DNA

What's higher than the top? That's me (that's me)
Come take a look before falling at my feet (oh)
조용히 몸을 숙여 봐 (yeah-yeah)
So take a look 나를 기억해 a queen 

(Oh-oh)
All I'll ever know is life up on a throne
시작하면 끝을 보는 거야
You want

More
Know I got it, so here you go (let's go)
You look like you could use some more (more)
Know I got it and never runnin' low (low, oh)
Yeah, I got more than enough, add it up and away (ay, ay)
You know I got it like bomb-bomb, blow your mind
Never givin' less and that's how it'll stay (ay, ay)
You know I got it like all day, all the time

Way out
感觉犹如海浪, on the wave now
不断往前遨游, never weighed down
This is how I do it every day, wow, wow
这一路上的奇迹 都记住了你的
每一个瞬间, 无比的耀眼
I know, I know, you want some more
准备好就一起走 givin' it all

More
Know I got it, so here you go (let's go, babe)
You look like you could use some more (more)
Know I got it and never runnin' low (low)
Yeah, I got more than enough, add it up and away (ay, ay)
You know I got it like bomb-bomb, blow your mind
Never givin' less and that's how it'll stay (ay, ay)
You know I got it like all day, all the time
