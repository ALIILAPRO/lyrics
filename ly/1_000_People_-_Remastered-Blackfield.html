		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A thousand people yell
They're shouting my name
But I want to die in this moment
I want to die

And a thousand people smile
They're smiling at me
But I want to die in this moment
I want to die

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am
When the sky is filled with stars
I find a place inside my heart

Some people can take a blow
And they won't ever drop
But I want to die in this moment
I want to die

She will tell me she loves me
That she won't ever stop
But I want to die in this moment
I want to die

The coldness in my soul
And I reach out for her to hold

And then I watch her close her eyes
It's only me that needs to cry

And if I stay with you
Do you believe that I'll pull through?

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am
When the sky is filled with stars
I find a place inside my heart

And then I watch her close her eyes
It's only me that needs to cry

A thousand people yell
They're shouting my name
But I want to die in this moment
I want to die
