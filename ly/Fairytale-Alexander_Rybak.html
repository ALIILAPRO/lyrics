		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it's true

I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above
I don't know what I was doin'
When suddenly, we fell apart

Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do
We'll get a brand new start

I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

She's a fairytale
Yeah
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed
