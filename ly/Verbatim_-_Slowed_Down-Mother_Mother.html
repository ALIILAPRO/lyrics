		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

I wear women's underwear
And then I go to strike a pose in my full length mirror
I cross my legs just like a queer
But my libido is strong when a lady is near, yeah
What defines a straight man's straight?
Is it the boxer in the briefs or a twelve ounce steak? Nah
I tell you what a women loves most
It's a man who can slap but can also stroke

Goin' in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no 
No, no, no more gettin' elated
No more listless invitations

I live by a hospital
And every day, I go out walking past its sickly windows
I see people dying there
But my tender age makes it hard to care
The incinerator and a big smoke stack
It's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh
All I need is a heart attack
Come on, humble my bones with a cardiac

Goin' in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no 
No, no, no more gettin' elated
No more listless invitations

For the love of fuck
For the sake of Pete
Oh, did you ever really think you'd love a guy like me?
I am the rooster in the morning
I'm the cock of the day
I'm the boxer in the briefs
I'm a twelve ounce steak

Ayy-oh
Ayy-oh
Ayy-oh
Hey-oh 
Yeah-bo
Yeah-bo
Yeah-bo
Yeah-bo
Yeah-bo 

It's verbatim
And yeah, and it's naked
And yeah, and it's shakin'
It shakes, shakes, shakes

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
