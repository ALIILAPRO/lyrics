		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  we were the authors running from our past,
both no perception how long would this last,
Somehow i find myself now getting lost
driving around thinking how all of this ends
there’s nothing leading back to you,
I wish i could find a way,
To manifest our destiny,

our destiny that vanished long ago,
turn back and open up the door

I’ve left my heart on the floor when i got out,
Hiding behind this curtain cuz i’m feared by doubt
I can’t feel warmth nor cold anymore
Losing everything I once adored
I’ve left my heart on the floor, left to rot, left to dissolve

wanting to leave what leaves me terrified
red flags that are covering up my mind
I trouble breathing and it’s half my heart
But I can’t separate that it’s tearing me apart

Now that the voice is taking over
it’s preventing my head from getting sober


I’ve left my heart on the floor when i got out,
Hiding behind this curtain cuz i’m feared by doubt
I can’t feel warmth nor cold anymore
Losing everything I once adored
I’ve left my heart on the floor, left to rot, left to dissolve

Struggling every single day,
Not getting out of this i’m drifting away,
No matter what the fuck i do,
i end up being left all alone in the blue

And it will ruin me
I’m losing all control
I can not seem to breath
it is eating my restless soul

Struggling every single day,
Not getting out of this i’m drifting away,
No matter what the fuck i do,
i end up being all alone in the blue
