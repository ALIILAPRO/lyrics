		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lions are hungry
and filled with rage
afraid and angry
locked in a cage

The circus is coming to town

Bright colours and string lights
shining in the heights
the sound of an old music box
a spooky melody that never stops

The circus is coming to town

Ashes to ashes
and dust to dust
Bread and circuses to masses
lust turning to disgust

In this circus of doom
marionettes are dancing
circus of doom
time passes and fades away
circus of doom
shadows keep on laughing

Whiplash and scream
one more broken dream
in silence they fall
tears of a clown

Acrobats are hanging
high in the air
forever, never landing
smiles upon despair

The circus is in the town

trying to reach the dreams
of some distant past
in this circus of extremes
where nothing can last

The circus is in the town

Ashes to ashes
and dust to dust Bread and circuses to masses
lust turning to disgust

In this circus of doom
marionettes are dancing
circus of doom
time passes and fades away
circus of doom
shadows keep on laughing

Whiplash and scream
one more broken dream
in silence they fall
tears of a clown


What will remain
of a life spent underground
an echo of pain
fear that makes no sound

When the lights go down
When there’s no one around

Wrapped in the absence
of it all
Trapped in silence
they fall

The silence descends
when the lights go down
far from home and friends
something hit the ground

Tears of a clown
When there’s no one around

The circus has left the town.
