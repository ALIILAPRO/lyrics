		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sing for me,
Sing for me.
You can come with me;
You can live with me.

Heal my soul,
Make me whole.

Sister, I lost you,
When you were still a child,
But I need you now,
And I need our former life.
I'm afraid to wake,
I'm afraid to love.

But just because I'm weak,
You can steal my dreams.
You can reach inside my head,
And you can put your song there instead.
Please, come to me.
Please, stay with me.

Please,
Sing,
Cry,
Cry.

Sing to me, raven,
I miss her so much.
Sing to me, Lily,
I miss you so much.

Sing to me, raven,
I miss her so much.
Sing to me, Lily,
I miss you so much.

Sing to me, raven,
I miss her so much.
Sing to me, Lily,
I miss you so much.
