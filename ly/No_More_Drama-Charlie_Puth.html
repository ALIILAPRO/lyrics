		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you, uh

Took a year 'fore I recognized (recognized)
That our love had already died, uh (already died)
Baby, I was down bad, I was down bad, now I'm healing, yeah
Some nights you would stay here (stay here)
Some nights you would disappear (disappear)
No, I'll never go back, never go back to that feeling

Baby, I ain't even wondering (ah-ah)
About everything we could've been (ah-ah)
Ever since you looked me in my eyes
Turned around and said goodbye

Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life (in my life)
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized (yeah)
I'm better without you

You start fights while we're up late (up late)
Use your lips to manipulate, uh (manipulate)
Baby, how'd you do that, how'd you do that, make me need it? (Listen)
Some nights you were baby (baby)
Some nights it was crazy (no)
No, I'll never go back, never go back to that feeling

Baby, I ain't even wondering (ah-ah)
About everything we could've been (ah-ah)
Ever since you looked me in my eyes (yeah)
Turned around and said goodbye (yeah, oh)

Oh, I got no more drama in my life (in my life)
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized (yeah)
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life (time of my life)
And it's been amazing (oh)
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you, oh
Alone, ooh-ooh
