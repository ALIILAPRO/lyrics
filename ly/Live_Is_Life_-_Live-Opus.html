		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All together now

Live, live is life
Live, live is life

When we all give the power
We all give the best
Every minute of an hour
Don't think about a rest
Then you all get the power
You all get the best
And everyone gives everything
And every song everybody sings

Then it's life
Live is life
Live is life, live

Live is life, when we all feel the power
Live is life, come on, stand up and dance
Live is life, when the feeling of the people
Live is life, is the feeling of the band, yeah

When we all give the power
We all give the best
Every minute of an hour
Don't think about a rest
Then you all get the power
You all get the best
And everyone gives everything
And every song everybody sings

Then it's life
Live is life
Live, live is life

Live, live is life
Live, live is life

And you call when it's over
You call it should last
Every minute of the future
Is a memory of the past
'Cause we all gave the power
We all gave the best
And everyone gave everything
And every song everybody sang
Live is life
