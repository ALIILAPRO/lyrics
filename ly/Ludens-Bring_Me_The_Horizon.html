		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some resist the future, some refuse the past
Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash

(How do I) form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

Sticks and stones may break my bones, but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em a hell of a show

(How do I) form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like the phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
Yeah

Alright, you call this a connection?
You call this a connection?
You call this a connection? (okay)
You call this a connection?
Oh, give me a break
Oh, give me a break
Oh, give me a break (okay)
Ugh, oh

Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah

Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
