		  (Slime time)
(I'm on a bad bend, when I'm on that time)
(Yeah, pull up on me, yeah, slime time)
(Run this one up)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm on a bend like, "Wassup?" (Bend like wassup)
I'm on a bad bend on these pills, man, and this shit don't stop (I'm on a bad bend)
I pop a pill man, pop a Perc', man, man, this shit don't pop (percocet)
I drop a big album every time, I do, and shit don't flop (that shit be floppin')
Yeah, do this all the time (wah), demons on my line (hol' up, hol' up)
I got money, I got money all the time (oh, oh oh, hol' up)
I don't give fucks, I'm saying, so I do this all the time, huh
I do whatever I want, huh, I do whatever I want, yeah (what)
'Bout to go back to back, bitch, album like every damn month (yes)
Huh, I got a slime of the month, huh
It's bout that time of the month, yeah (time of the- What?)
I feel like makin' a beat, bitch so I make me this beat (I made it, hoe)
We finna get you deceased (tch)
We finna call up the fleet (bah)
Shoot his ass up, it's a scrimmage (bop bop)
Uh, hit him, "bye-bye", on his feet (yeah)
Now they only walkin' in they sleep, huh
Michael Jack, walk on my feet (miney)
I'm gonna walk on the beat (walk on the)
I'm 'bout the turn up the sheep (luh turn up, sheep)
I got demons on my mind, demons on my line (line)
Every song I call him on my phone, I know he lyin' (everytime)
You don't know the song, so I told you every time
And you know I'm ballin', had to score, you know that's fine

I'm in that slime time with that GLE Tonka, that big body rip out the curb, and it's swerving a (what?)
I ain't ever heard no shit from a pussy, lil' bitch, you best know that I heard enough (heard enough)
Pull up with Glocks, and we shoot his ass up, he gon' die, we gon' fire and muh'fuckin' burn him up
I made a mil' every day of this month, and, lil' bitch, you know that I'm rich, that's what you heard of

Do this all the time (wah), demons on my line (hol' up, hol' up)
I got money, I got money all the time (oh, oh oh)
I don't give fucks, I'm saying, so I do this all the time
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm on a bend like, "What's up?"
I'm on a bad bend on these pills, man, and this shit don't stop
I pop a pill man, pop a Perc', man, man, this shit don't pop (percocet)
I drop a big album every time, I do, and shit don't flop (that shit don't be floppin')
I do whatever I want, huh, I do whatever I want, yeah
'Bout to go back to back, bitch, album like everyday month (bitches)
Huh, I got a slime of the month, huh
It's bout that time of the month, yeah (time of the- What?)
I feel like makin' a beat, bitch, so I make me this beat (I made it, hoe)
We finna get you deceased (tch)
