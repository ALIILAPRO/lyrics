		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She in the club, shaking that jelly, shaking that jelly
Shaking that jelly, shaking that jelly

Your body looking right, baby please don't take me wrong
Excuse me if I stare but I can see your thong
I think I need to pull it, pull it towards me
Shawty gonna push it, but push it on me
I like it when you twerk, better when you jerk
Move it like a snake, bite me till it hurt
Whip, whip that body like a slave,
Make, make, make sure that booty don't escape

Where she going, where she going, I'm looking for
Where she going, where she going, I'm looking for
Where she going, where she going, I'm looking for
Where she going, where she going, I'm looking for

She in the club, she going ham,
Shaking that jelly, cause this a jam,
Shaking that jelly, cause this a jam,
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam

Keep popping that body, we're faded in the club
She feeling all on my body,
Riding like the Ducatti, she gonna fuck somebody
Dj play this shit, she gonna go karate
I'm kick, kicking my game up, bad bitch and I banged her
My chain like an anchor, but that shit cost some franklins
Don't motherfuck with nobody, nobody riding that Shawty
Unless her ass fly, then she could be a copilot
Like, ah, fly shit we jetting off
My future brighter you a falling star
At the bar, buying bottles, we don't even fucking drink it all
Showing off, going hard with this bitch

She in the club, she going ham,
Shaking that jelly, cause this a jam,
Shaking that jelly, cause this a jam,
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam

Whole lot of jelly, a whole lot of bread
Her skin pina butter, so go and let it spread
Tryina see it now, fuck ? seen the ground
Love you till it hurt, have you saying aww
Girl you the truth, I'm a lion on the prowl
Better can you hear ? make the stomach growl
I'm looking at you, I'm looking at you, lego, lego

She in the club, she going ham,
Shaking that jelly, cause this a jam,
Shaking that jelly, cause this a jam,
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
She shaking that jelly, cause this a jam
