		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look into my eyes and read my thoughts
Don't wanna have to tell you what they are
I need someone who wants to risk it all
I'm tired of pretending that
Losing love doesn't hurt
And I don't ever cry alone
Baby I've been getting by
But my heart wants to find a home
So let me live
Like I'm losing every second of my life
To the lies and misdirection
Precious time I've been wasting on pretending I'm good
And that losing love doesn't hurt
And I don't ever cry alone
Baby I've been getting by
But my heart wants to find a home
My past life got me fucked up
So many long nights that I didn't get the best of
Tell me one more time I don't wanna get it messed up
One god
One flame
In the dark
Baby guide me home
I'm tired of pretending
Losing love doesn't hurt
And I don't ever cry alone
Baby I've been getting by
But my heart wants to find a home
So let me live
Like I'm losing every second of my life
To the lies and misdirection
Precious time I've been wasting on pretending I'm good
And that losing love doesn't hurt
And I don't ever cry alone
Baby I've been getting by
But my heart wants to find a home
