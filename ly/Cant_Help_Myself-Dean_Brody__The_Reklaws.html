		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If there's work
You know I'm gon' work
And if there's dirt 
This ol' truck gon' swerve 
If there's pretty girls sittin' on tailgates
Just say the word
And I'm on my way
Don't tell me bout a party on a backroad 
Cause you know I'll party on a backroad all night
That's right

I like cold beer yes I do 
I like cold beer how bout you
I turn up when I let loose 
I can't help myself
Get loud on Friday night
Drop it down in 4 wheel drive
Been like this my whole life
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Can't blame nobody else
I can't help myself

Can't just have just one
Probably gon' have me another
Soon as I feel that buzz
I'll have another
And another
I'm Dangerous I'm rowdy 
If it's redneck I'm bout it
I'm off the wagon 
I'm brown baggin'
I'm Caddilac'in don't doubt it
Find me at a party on a backroad 
Cause you know I'll party on a backroad all night
Hell right

I like cold beer yes I do 
I like cold beer how bout you
I turn up when I let loose 
I can't help myself
Get loud on Friday night
Drop it down in 4 wheel drive
Been like this my whole life
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Can't blame nobody else
I can't help myself

One, two, three, four, I declare a beer war
Five, six, seven, eight, just killed another case

I like cold beer yes I do 
I like cold beer how bout you
I turn up when I let loose 
I can't help myself
Get loud on Friday night
Drop it down in 4 wheel drive
Been like this my whole life
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Can't blame nobody else
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Can't blame nobody else
I can't help myself
