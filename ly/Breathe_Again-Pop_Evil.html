		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can finally breathe again

Buried and burdened, my patience was gone
Blinded, my vision was wrong
Head underwater in waves I could see
I found the strength in me
The strength in me

Get up, get up

I can finally breathe again
Standing on my own two feet again
Learning that my scars won't bleed again
Mistakes I couldn't undo
Try to destroy you
I can finally breathe again
I can finally breathe again

It's getting darker, numbing the pain inside
Feels like forever, all the times I tried
To be myself, break the chains, no one ever sees
I found the strength in me

I can finally breathe again
Standing on my own two feet again
Learning that my scars won't bleed again
Mistakes I couldn't undo
Try to destroy you
I can finally breathe again
Breathe again

Letting go of the weight inside
Can we give this another try?
Letting go, I feel alive

I can finally breathe again
Standing on my own two feet again
Learning that my scars won't bleed again
Mistakes I couldn't undo
Try to destroy you
I can finally breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
Breathe again
