		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was made to love her, been working at it
Half of my life, I've been an addict

And she's been good to me
Far as I can tell, she's happy
Livin' with her Macky

So please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

Please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

And where would I be, feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

And what's there left to say?
Far as I can tell that day 
Could be on its way

So please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

Please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
