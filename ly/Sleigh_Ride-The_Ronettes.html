		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo hoo!" (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding! Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding! Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding! Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding! Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding! Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding! Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
