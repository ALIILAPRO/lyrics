		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what I mean?
You could put a label on a life
Put a label on a lifestyle (sometimes), you know
Put a label on how you wake up every morning
And go to bed at night (Hybrid)

I've been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
Chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes
And show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness on all of the MCs that hate us
So can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit, with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(Akira) I put a kink in the backbones of clones
With microphones, never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood type is Krylon, Technicolor type A

On highways, bright with road rage
Cages of wind in cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound, devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings overall the same thing
Sing-song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with the pencil, pistol, official
Sixteen-line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spin rah blah blah blah, you can say you saw

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

And like the rock and rap
You know what I mean
People act like, you know
Wow, that's a new invention
That shit's ain't new
We're constantly evolving
It is constantly changing (sometimes)

There's a lot of change
Everybody's always tryna put labels on it
It ain't no label for this shit
They always gotta try to put a label on it
Try to create something, so they can water it down

Sometimes I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood
Under the gun like a new disease

Sometimes I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood
Under the gun like a new disease

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

You know what I mean, you can put a label on a lifestyle
