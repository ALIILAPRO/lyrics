		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking for something
Yeah, oh
Yeah

(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
(Fame) I feel it comin' together (oh, yeah)
People will see me and cry
(Fame) oh, I'm gonna make it to heaven (heaven)
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name

All my greatness
It doesn't come for free
All my talent
It doesn't grow on trees
Take a breather
They'll take it all the way
If the top's where you wanna stay

You gotta work hard to make it look it easy
You gotta live fast to keep makin' that money
If you want to be as famous as me
You gotta work, you gotta work, you gotta work
You gotta work hard, you gotta live fast
If you want to be as famous as me
You gotta work, you gotta work, you gotta work
You gotta work hard

I'm gonna live forever
Learn how to fly (if you want to be as famous as me)
You gotta work, you gotta work, you gotta work
You gotta work hard to make it look easy (if the top's where you wanna stay)
You gotta live fast to keep makin' that money
If you want to be as famous as me (baby, remember my name)
Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember
Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember
