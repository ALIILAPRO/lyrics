		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  目指し歩いた夜空の向こうでは
ただ一羽のカラスが
急かすように叫んだ

遠く昔の記憶ではただの
ドクロの影が笑った
顔見てそう笑った
Oh, oh oh oh

So I just bleed and feel the blood I have inside me
Holding to the creed and blade to slay thee
Carry on the oath until my last scene
Higher than the sky and deeper than the sea
Keep your precious justice to yourself bud
Use it till they're torn become a pile of mud
I don't need their choice or voice to judge me
The one and only way I had and always seek

Anyone, everyone, I will crush 'em all
Enemies let 'em see now I see you fall
Kings and Gods, change the odds
I'm the one who makes my final call

傷も過去も孤独さえも
握り潰しただ抗う
Keep your crown, I'll take you down
I'm the one who makes my final call

息を殺し辿り着いたのは
果ての無い奈落の螺旋か
どこまで続くのか

So it goes on and on not knowing when it went wrong
Like the sand in hand you cannot hold long
Carry on the oath until your last scene
Standing on your own know your enemy
Keep your precious justice to yourself bud
Use it till they're torn become a pile of mud
I don't need their choice or voice to judge me
The one and only way I had and always seek

Anyone, everyone, I will crush 'em all
Enemies let 'em see now I see you fall
Kings and Gods, change the odds
I'm the one who makes my final call

風も雪も運命さえも
捻り潰しただ抗う
Keep your crown, I'll take you down
I'm the one who makes my final call

So I don't need it anymore
I don't need it anymore
I don't need it anymore
I don't need it anymore

忘却と追憶をただ繰り返し
朧げに思い出すんだ
あの日の夢を

Your eyes were always telling the answer
What I should be what tomorrow could be
And what it all means

Anyone, everyone, I will crush 'em all
Enemies let 'em see now I see you fall
Kings and Gods, I'll change the odds
I'm the one who makes my final call

傷も過去も孤独さえも
握り潰しただ抗う
Keep your crown, I'll take you down
I'm the one who makes my final call

Anyone, everyone
Enemies let them see
Kings and Gods, I'll change the odds
I'm the one who makes my final call

So I don't need it anymore
I don't need it anymore
