		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our story's old, older than the wind
It's been decided for years
How can we pretend
That we all know just how it's gonna end

Rescue me in the middle of the ocean
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
Some say, it's easier to give up on it
I say, it's time to rescue me

Lost and lonely people standing by, afraid to try
Some of them here, the same as you and I
The differences are all but left behind
So I need you now

Rescue me in the middle of the ocean
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
Some say, it's hard to make the changes
Rescue me and I'll never be the same

Rescue me in the middle of my darkest hour
Time will tell I never really had the power
Some say, it's easier to give up on it
I say, it's time to rescue me

We gotta get out, how foolish I would feel
To say it's all been a waste of time
We may lose and we may win
But like the sun, we will rise again
But until then

Rescue me in the middle of the ocean
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
Some say, it's hard to make the changes
Rescue me and I'll never be the same

Rescue me in the middle of my darkest hour
Time will tell I never really had the power
Some say, it's easier to give up on it
I say, it's time to rescue me

Rescue me in the middle of the ocean
