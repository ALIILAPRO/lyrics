		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me the pistol, aim it high
I'm out in the desert shooting at the sky
Guess I really miss you
And I don't know what else to do

Beautiful pictures that you took of us
Used to hang up there on your bedroom walls
But you took 'em all down now
And you put 'em into a drawer

You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long I can't deal with it
You've been on my mind
And I'll waste my time
'Til you lift me off the floor and love me again

I know if I saw you and we kissed just once
You could be happy, maybe you'd come back
'Cause I really miss you
Don't know how much more I can take

You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long I can't deal with it
You've been on my mind
And I'll waste my time
'Til you lift me off the floor and love me again

Oh yeah
'Til you lift me off the floor and love me again
Oh yeah
