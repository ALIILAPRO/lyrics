		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't make me dream about you, don't make me dream about you.
Don't make me dream about you, don't make me dream about you.
I dream in day time and night time, dream of love or romance.
Won't be nice if they catch me, I can't live with the chance.
Because I love you, because I want you.

I will win your love for me, yeah I will win your love for me.
Look so sweet when I meet you, now your acting so bold.
Feels so hot when I kiss you, and now you come on cold.
And I still love you, I still want you.

I will win your love for me, yeah I will win your love for me.
No
No, no, no, don't make me dream about you, don't make me dream about you.

Took a chance when I meet you, should of know I would loose.
I know it's wrong I should leave you, you make it so hard to choose.
And I still love you, I still want you.

I will win your love for me, yeah I will win your love for me.
No
No, no, no, don't make me dream about you, don't make me dream about you.
Don't make me dream, don't make me dream.
