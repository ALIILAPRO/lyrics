Matchstick
Yeah tonight all the drinks on me (on me)
We can dive but we still above sea (that's me)
From Mykonos to Chios round Crete
The best life, καλύτερη ζωή (ζωή, ζωή, aye)
Always keeping it a hunnid', century (one hunnid')
I'ma eat it yeah I love a Greek feast (eat it up)
She know I'm unforgettable, Swae Lee (Swae Lee)
Κανείς δεν είναι σαν τον Ζ
Ain't nobody like Z, aye
The way I'm living is unforgiving
Round Greece I'm tripping
I'm ouzo sipping
Then skinny dipping
Bottles popping
Her body rocking
The way she drop it
Got people talking
Keep window shopping
Dip it in my sneaky, tzatziki (cheeky)
Dancing on it move it like the sirtaki (crazy)
She ordered meat so I give her souvlaki (freaky)
Here for keeps, I ain't ever been lucky
Yeah wait real quick
Hold on let me talk my shit
I'm sick, better call a doctor quick
This drink, got me on a buzz legit
If I take another sip I'm lit
Matchstick
Show them how you shake that thing, so thick
Love it when you're confident, don't trip
Take it as a compliment
Wouldn't tell you if I wasn't this lit
Matchstick
Live my best life everyday
Just getting started, entree
He say, she say, I'm unfazed
Can't tame this flame no (no ashtray)
Negativity, I don't condone it
I'm the Euro 50, In Da Club I own it
Παντο κάνω ζεστή, so hot, so fire
Πρέπει να κρυώσει, Greek Boy attire
Yeah I be
Pleasing my needs while pleasing ladies
While they be, asking me "Z, why you such a tease"
Yeah I be collecting women like souvenirs overseas
Let me see them panties disappear, the magic stick make them freeze
When I turn up for clubbing, Kris Kross, I got the place jumping
Fingers constantly throbbing, from all the numbers I'm thumbin'
Everybody be asking how I turned nothing to something
Was never up and coming, born to be the topic of discussion
Yeah wait real quick
Hold on let me talk my shit
I'm sick, better call a doctor quick
This drink, got me on a buzz legit
If I take another sip I'm lit
Matchstick
Show them how you shake that thing, so thick
Love it when you're confident, don't trip
Take it as a compliment
Wouldn't tell you if I wasn't this lit
Baby - that shit
Ah, baby shake that shit
Ah, girl you know I love it
Shake that shit
Yeah, baby shake that shit
Ah, baby shake that shit
Ah, girl you know I love it
Ah, when you shake that
Ha, I'm done, that's it
