		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to think maybe you loved me now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'til the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around

Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
Hey, yeah

I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't wanna spend my whole life just a-waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day, no, no, no
I said, baby, I just want you back
And I want you to stay
Oh, yeah

Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
Yeah, oh yeah
And don't it feel good

Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine, yeah

I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I'm on sunshine, baby, oh
Oh yeah, I'm on sunshine, baby, oh

I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good 
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now
And don't it feel good
Hey, yeah now
And don't it feel good
Now don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it feel good
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now
And don't it feel good
Don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it and don't it feel good
Now tell me, tell me, tell me again now
And don't it feel good
Oh yeah, now
And don't it feel good
Oh, don't it feel good, don't it feel good
Now don't it feel good
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah
