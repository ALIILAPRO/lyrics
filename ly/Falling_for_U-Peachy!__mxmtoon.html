		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was hanging with you
And then I realized
I didn't think it was true
I was surprised
When I found out I'd fallen for you (la-la)

I didn't wanna believe
My feelings for you
I didn't wanna believe
That I could lose you
If I told you just how I felt

But I can't help it 
I'm falling for you
And I can't quit it 
'Cause I'm stuck on you

And it might be pathetic 
And you might be skeptical
But I just want to be with you

Please tell me boy can you 
Get a clue or come through
'Cause I just want to be with you

I'm scared 
Of telling you how I feel
Maybe 
It's better
If I just try to conceal
The truth
For me
And for you

But I'm still stuck on you
I
I'm still falling for you (for you)
For you 
(Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm)
