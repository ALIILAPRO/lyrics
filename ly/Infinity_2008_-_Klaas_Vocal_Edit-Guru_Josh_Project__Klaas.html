		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's my key
Philosophy
A freak like me
Just needs infinity

Relax
Take your time

And take your time
To trust in me
And you will find
Infinity, infinity

And take your time
To trust in me
And you will find
Infinity, infinity

And time goes by
So naturally
While you receive
Infinity

Here's my key
Philosophy
A freak like me
Just needs infinity

Relax
Take your time

And take your time
To trust in me
And you will find
Infinity, infinity

Infinity, infinity, infinity
Infinity, infinity

And take your time
To trust in me
And you will find

And time goes by
So naturally
While you receive
Infinity

Infinity
