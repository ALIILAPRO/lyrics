		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Busy, busy, there's so much to do here

Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
I must fly

Sunny day begin
Souls in them all
Found it really good
Thousand knights unsee the sin

Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Busy, busy, there's so much to do here

Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
Gotta go to work, work, work, work, gotta work
I must fly

Sunny day begin
Souls in them all
Found it really good
Voices unheard

Sunny day begin
Souls in them all
Found it really good
A thousand voices

For the swarm (for the swarm)
For the swarm (for the swarm)
For the swarm (for the swarm)
For the swarm
