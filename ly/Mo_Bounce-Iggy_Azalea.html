		  Mo bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce, mo bounce
Mo, mo-mo bounce, b-bounce, bounce
Bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce, b-bounce
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce
Bounce in the motherfuckin' house, bounce
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house

Bounce like a motherfuckin' '64, sick flow
Slick talk, spittin' that Crisco
Drop that shit like a cholo at the dub show
Can you hit the switch and pick it up and let the world know?
Homie, if you're broke, oh, no you don't deserve hoes
All these fake boulders only gettin' on my nerves though
I just cracked a 40, now I'm sippin' out the straw slow
Little bit of ratchet, little boujee, you should all know
Everybody got opinions, yeah, like assholes
You ain't gotta worry 'bout those, 'cause they assholes
We just came to party, party, party, what you came for?
(Make, make the neighborhood bounce to this)

When that shit goes down, the block get loud
In your backyard bumpin' while we blazin' out
Make it bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house
When that shit goes down, the block get loud
In your backyard bumpin' while we blazin' out
Make it bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce (to the red light)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce (make your headlight)
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce, b-bounce
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce (like a low-low)
B-bounce, bounce, b-bounce (throw it up)
Bounce (at the pole, pole)

Bounce that ass, bounce that ass, yeah, bounce it
Puff the lah or get high off the contact
Call the law, we gon' make sure we come back
Fallin' off, we ain't ever been about that
Hundred spokes spinnin' on a chrome rim
I got a feelin' that tonight we gon' be goin' in
I'm with a few bad bitches and some grown men
With the ice so cold, I feel like I'm Snowden
I feel like I'm rollin', but the whole place geeked up
It's gettin' hot in here, down to my wife beater
But you ain't gotta worry, we ain't dangerous
We came up
(Make, make the neighborhood bounce to this)

When that shit goes down, the block get loud
In your backyard bumpin' while we blazin' out
Make it bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house
When that shit goes down, the block get loud
In your backyard bumpin' while we blazin' out
Make it bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce (to the red light)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce (make your headlight)
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce, b-bounce
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce (like a low-low)
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce, b-bounce (throw it up)
Bounce (at the pole, pole)

Mo, m-m-mo bounce, blazin' up
Backyard, back, b-b-b-bumpin'
Backyard bumpin', the block get loud
Mo, m-m-m-mo bounce
Backyard, backyard b-bumpin'
Backyard bumpin', the block get loud

When that shit goes down, the block get loud
In your backyard bumpin' while we blazin' out
Make it bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house
When that shit goes down, the block get loud
In your backyard bumpin' while we blazin' out
Make it bounce in the motherfuckin' house
Mo bounce in the motherfuckin' house

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce (to the red light)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce (make your headlight)
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce, b-bounce
Bounce, b-bounce, bounce (like a low-low)
B-bounce, bounce, b-bounce (throw it up)
Bounce
