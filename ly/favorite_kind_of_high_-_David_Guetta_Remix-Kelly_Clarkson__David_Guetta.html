		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me home tonight, kiss me how you like
I've been waiting for you (ooh)
I know you ain't shy, well, neither am I
What you waitin' for? Yeah (ooh)

There's no escapin' your ghost of love
There ain't a drink that's strong enough
So I close my eyes, kiss you how I like
I've been waitin' for you

You're my favorite kind of high
Rushin' through me like a fire
And I need you to know
I say I won't, but I do
When it comes to lovin' you
I don't have no control
You're my favorite kind of high
You're my favorite kind of high

Until you're lyin' in my arms of love
I won't waste mine on good enough
So I close my eyes, kiss you how I like
I've been waitin' for you

You're my favorite kind of high
Rushin' through me like fire
And I need you to know
I say I won't, but I do
When it comes to lovin' you
I don't have no control

I wanna feel high
I gotta feel you tonight, oh-oh

You're my favorite kind of high
Rushin' through me like fire
And I need you to know (I need you to know)
I say I won't, but I do
When it comes to lovin' you
I don't have no control (I'm out of control)
You're my favorite kind of high
You're my favorite kind of high
You're my favorite kind of high (high, high, high)
You're my favorite kind of high
You're my favorite kind of high
You're my favorite kind of high (high, high, high)

You're my favorite kind of high
