		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this time I sink
Drowning like a stone
Tryna close my eyes shut my ears on this throne
Losing my way home
Then you came along
Everywhere we are felt like where I belong
Lost in your eyes there was no place I could hide
Take me inside and let me live in your mind
No pain tonight this place is reserved for only you and I

Because I
Wanna stay
On your side
Even if the world come crashing down tonight
We'll be fine
Hold me close and we'll just leave it all behind
Why don't you stay

These bruises and wounds
Fractures on my bones
Tryna fix it all but I failed all alone
But Just to be with you
Just you lying close
I can see the scars fade away on their own
Lost in your eyes there was no place I could hide
Take me inside and let me live in your mind
No pain tonight this place is reserved for only you and I

Because I
Wanna stay
On your side
Even if the world come crashing down tonight
We'll be fine
Hold me close and we'll just leave it all behind
Why don't you stay

Oh no right it
We'll be (stay stay)
Let's me stay alone (stay stay)
Oh no right it
So we'll be
Stay I just wanna stay here let's just stay right here
Wo oh oh
I will be okay we can live forever in each others eyes
I will be O I will be okay
Stay stay I just wanna stay here let's just stay right here
So let's me stay alone
I will be okay we can live forever in each others eyes
We can live forever why don't we just stay stay
