		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took a page out of your favorite book
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I've never speak
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me
I dug my grave watchin' the way you move
You took me higher than I ever flew, ooh
Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, I'm just a man, I'm, I'm just a man

No more thinkin' about you late-night
No more runnin' around with your friends now
Done pickin' up pieces of my soul up off the floor, ohh

I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't play this game no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door

You never thought this day would ever come
But I looked you in the eyes and pulled the rug
You tried to take away my sanity
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me

Oh, no more thinkin' about you late-night
No more runnin' around with your friends now
Done pickin' up pieces of my soul up off the floor, ohh

I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't play this game no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door

When I showed you the door
When I showed you the door
But tonight I saved my life

I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby (I don't wanna lose you, baby)
But I can't play this game no more (no more)
I thought it would kill me (I thought it would kill me)
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
