		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By myself sometimes
To give my mind some space
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that it hurts
When I push your love away, I hate myself
I wanna tell you lies
So your heart won't break
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that I made my fair share of mistakes

Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

Thousand miles apart, yeah, you're the one that holds my heart
It's no surprise
And I tell you all the time
And when life gets way too hard
I'll meet you in the stars, you know I will
I'll keep you near (mmm)
As I wipe away your tears (mmm), yes

Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere" (yeah, yeah)
Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

You were there for me when I was acting selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away (yeah)
You were there for me when I was acting selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away

Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me, with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not going anywhere"
