		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The systems in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is what I need
From the electric eyes

No matter where I am, I see my face around
They realize on my name, and push from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place
So I won't hide away

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
It's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you
I can do what I want to

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way

Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape

When I go, this problem world won't bother me no more

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away
Xscape, the pressure that I face
Xscape, the man with the pen
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
Xscape

Xscape, gotta get away, the pressure that I face, the man with the pen
