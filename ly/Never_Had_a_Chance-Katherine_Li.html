		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why am I still here and waiting for us to happen 
‘Cause you’d never want it 
Everything I loved ‘bout you I probably imagined
‘Cause we never had it

Stupid of me to think that you could ever be mine 
I could blame it on the drinks but I’m so sick and tired of lying

And I wish I could think of you and not have to still feel
Everything you probably don’t but I still think it’s real 

Why am I still here and waiting for us to happen
‘Cause you’d never want it  
Everything I loved ‘bout you I probably imagined
‘Cause we never had it

Funny it’s been so long and still there’s nothing that’s changed
And it was never your fault, wish there was something to blame

And I wish I could think of you and know that it was real 

Hate that I’m still here and waiting for us to happen
It’s not like you’d want it 
Everything I loved ‘bout you I know I imagined
‘Cause we’d never happen
