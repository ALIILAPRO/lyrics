		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spend my days inside my room
Feels like there’s nothing left to do
Lay in my bed stare at my phone
So I don’t have to feel alone
We both said this was for the best
But I still feel it in my chest
It’s all okay, you’re not to blame
But now there’s nothing left to say when I’m with you
I hope you feel the same when I miss you
Cause falling out of love got me anxious
Thinking bout the time that I wasted
Tell me that you love me, I don’t wanna fall
Maybe it’s to late see the writing on the wall
Every single night I’ve been losing all my patience
I just can’t decide if its you that I’ve been chasing
Treat me like a stranger, tell me that we’re done
I’ll look the other way and pretend we’re not in love
I know it’s gon’ be hard but I promise I can take this
Cut me out your life without any hesitation
We used to laugh until we cried
I’d hate to leave you in July
You found it hard to let me go
I feel the same I hope you know
Some how these days turned into weeks 
I only see you in my dreams
But even then its not the same
Cause now it all just fades to grey when I’’m with you
I hope you feel the same when I miss you
Cause falling out of love got me anxious
Thinking bout the time that I wasted
Tell me that you love me, I don’t wanna fall
Maybe it’s to late see the writing on the wall
Every single night I’ve been losing all my patience
I just can’t decide if its you that I’ve been chasing
Treat me like a stranger, tell me that we’re done
I’ll look the other way and pretend we’re not in love
I know it’s gon’ be hard but I promise I can take this
Cut me out your life without any hesitation
