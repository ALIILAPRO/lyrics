		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So sad
Watch good love go bad
Smoke from a distance
Fire burning me
Oh, babe, the heaven can't wait
I need these hints
I'm feeling, my heart is appealing

Sweet lady sheila
Do you? Do you really want me?
Sophisticated lady want me
Sweet little Sheila
Do you? Do you really love me?
She's a different baby to me

I only want Sheila 
Oh my Sheila
Oh, she's precious
Like the sun
I only want Sheila
Oh, my Sheila
Oh she's foolish 
And most fun

Oh, babe
For the promise you made
Be careful they've got storms, you're afraid
Oh, babe
Don't say it's too late
Words can't express my feelings, being
Believing
