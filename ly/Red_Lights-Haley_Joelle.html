		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't think of any time
I hoped my day would fall apart and break
Stuck in traffic for the day
I've always been the planning type
But today I just want all my plans to change
I don't wanna board that plane
Twenty more till we're at the airport
Oh extra time is all I'm hoping for
Oh I want red lights
Someone getting a flat tire
Anything to keep me grounded
Anything so I can stay
Oh I want red lights
Red like all the wildfires
Like a stupid romance movie
Where we get one more day
Before it all flies away
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Yeah I wish I was the kind
To forget my stuff so I can never leave
But that won't ever be me
I tell myself I'm gonna be okay
But the continents aren't even the same
So I know we're gonna change
(It's only)
Twenty more till we're at the airport
Oh extra time is all I'm hoping for
Oh I want red lights
Someone getting a flat tire
Anything to keep me grounded
Anything so I can stay
Oh I want red lights
Red like all the wildfires
Like a stupid romance movie
Where we get one more day
Before it all flies away
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
