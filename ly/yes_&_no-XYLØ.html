		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People say I'm indecisive (I am, I'm not)
If one day I hate it, then the next I'll probably like it
Do I feel like being alone or with all of my friends?
Fuck, I don't know if I should say or if I should go (huh)

I don't have the answers you need
'Cause I live in the in-between
So if you put your bets on me
You better be down for anything

'Cause I'm like yes and no
Wait, I don't know
I think I'm dying
Hold up, I'm invincible
Yeah, I'm like yes (yes) and no (no)
Wait, I don't know
I'll pull you closer into to me
And I'm pushing you away
'Cause I'm like yes and no
Wait, I don't know (kn-kn-know)
I think I'm dying
Hold up, I'm invincible (ether)
Yeah, I'm like yes (yes) and no (no)
Wait, I don't know
I'll pull you closer into me
And I'm pushing you away

Don't know if I'm feeling happy (no)
Im kinda confused, I'm not in the mood to try and fix me (uh)
Do I feel like being alone or with all of my friends?
Fuck, I don't know (Fuck I don't no)
If I should say or if I should go (huh)

I don't have the answers you need
'Cause I live in the in-between, ha-ha

'Cause I'm like yes and no
Wait, I don't know
I think I'm dying
Hold up, I'm invincible
Yeah, I'm like yes (yes) and no (no)
Wait, I don't know
I'll pull you closer into to me
And I'm pushing you away
'Cause I'm like yes and no
Wait, I don't know (kn-kn-know)
I think I'm dying
Hold up, I'm invincible (ether)
Yeah, I'm like yes (yes) and no (no)
Wait, I don't know
I'll pull you closer into me
And I'm pushing you away

(Hi Paige, this is Liz)
(Would you mind giving me a call, please?)
(Thank you)

I think I'm dying
Hold up, I'm invincible
Yes, no
I pull you closer into me
And I'm pushing you away

'Cause, I'm like yes (yes) and no (no)
Wait, I don't know (kn-kn-know)
I think I'm dying
Hold up, I'm invincible (ether)
Yeah, I'm like yes and no
Wait, I don't know
I pull you closer into to me
And I'm pushing you away
