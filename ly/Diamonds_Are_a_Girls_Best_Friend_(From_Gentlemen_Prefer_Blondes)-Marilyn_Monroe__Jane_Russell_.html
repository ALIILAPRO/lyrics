		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The French are glad to die for love
They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels

A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

Men grow cold 
As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end

But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Tiffany's
Cartier
Black Starr
Frost Gorham
Talk to me Harry Winston
Tell me all about it

There may come a time 
When a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy 
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on
And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back 
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's

Diamonds
Diamonds
I don't mean rhinestones
But diamonds are a girl's best 
Best friend
