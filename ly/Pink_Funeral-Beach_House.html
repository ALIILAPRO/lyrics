		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How sweet (how sweet)
The sound (the sound)
The swell of strings begins to rise
The stage (the stage)
Is set (is set)
The painted stars, they fill our eyes
This heart of mine
Goes out of time
Blue skies turn black
Behind our back

Don't let me go
Once was a fairy tale
Then it all went to hell
Swans on a starry lake
Hearts that were made to break
Tears through a white lace veil
Pink funeral

Somewhere underneath the boughs
You'll get away, get away somehow
Far from here
All around (all around)
The lake of tears (the lake of tears)
You'll know she's near (you'll know she's near)

Don't let me go
Once was a fairy tale
Then it all went to hell
Swans on a starry lake
Hearts that were made to break
Tears through a white lace veil
Pink funeral

Somewhere underneath the boughs
You'll get away, get away somehow
Far from here
All around (all around)
The lake of tears (the lake of tears)
You'll know she's near (you'll know she's near)

Don't let me go (blue skies turn black)
Once was a fairy tale (behind our back)
Then it all went to hell
Swans on a starry lake
Hearts that were made to break (this heart of mine)
Tears through a white lace veil (goes out of time)
Pink funeral
