		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything that's real
And everything unrealized
All infinity
Starts falling from your eyes
We are fluid dreams
Vivid memories
All uncertainly
Leads to eternity

All that we perceive
In every mystery
Who are we
What we see
I can't comprehend

Who are we
What we see
I can't comprehend

Illuminating love falls from the skies
To water the illusions in our eyes
All that we desire and all we fear
All our aspirations grow unclear

We feel endlessly
Beyond all gravity

Who are we
What we see
I can't comprehend

Who are we
What we see
I can't comprehend
