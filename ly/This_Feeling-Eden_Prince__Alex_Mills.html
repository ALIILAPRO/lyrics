		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jealous, but I'd die before I'd let it show (hi)
I'll tell you that I'm so much better now you're gone (hi)
That I don't have to fight or modify my tone (hi)
And I'm happy that your new girl looks so beautiful (hi)

And I don't know if this stupid feeling reflects what I want
Or if this heartache is just a reflex eating me up

This feeling, my envy of what we never had
And my instincts can't be free from what we never had
And though your love leans on my heartstrings, that won't ever stop
I drown in the shadow of what we never had

What we, from what we, what we never had
What we (oh), from what we, what we never had

Jealous, but I'd lie before I let you know (hi)
I'll say our love was nothing but a stepping stone (hi)
That I'm over the moon that you're moving on, on oh
And I don't resent, I taught you everything you know

And I don't know if this stupid feeling reflects what I want
Or if this heartache is just reflex eating me up

This feeling, my envy of what we never had
And my instincts can't be free from what we never had
And though your love leans on my heartstrings, that won't ever stop
I drown in the shadow of what we never had

What we, from what we, what we never had
(Oh) what we (oh), from what we, what we never had (hi)
