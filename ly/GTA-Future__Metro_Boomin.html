		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  307, two-door coupe
GTA, I got shooters
Turtle shell top, bulletproof

Whatever I'm with, my bitch with it too
Balenciaga and them sticks included
Crash out, crash out, crash
Crash out, crash out, crash

Send a nigga straight up to God
Hold it two hands, it's a carbon (hold it two hands)
Either you trappin' or robbin' (either you trappin')
Why waste your time if you flaugin'? (Why waste your time?)
Stackin' it, uh, rackin' it, uh, all the way up to Jupiter (Jupiter)
Flip it, uh, flip it, flip it, cool
Servin' junkies, I was still in school
Zone 3, Zone 6 niggas don't play fair, they gon' slime you out
Once you join the gang, it ain't no way you can get out
They just jacked the car, they need 'em somethin' to spin out
Layin' inside the bushes tryna get my rent up
Came up on a bird and ever since, I've been up
Re-up on the first and third, stashin' cash in shoe boxes
Go wash your hands, you got 'em dirty, you gon' need a new Glock
Drinkin' on syrup, work, splurge
Adderall, Perc', Xan', X
P90 Ruger, fully loaded TEC
Ho confused, she just too obsessed

Whatever I'm with, my bitch with it too
Balenciaga and them sticks included
Crash out, crash out, crash
Crash out, crash out, crash
Whatever I'm with, my bitch with it too
Balenciaga and them sticks included
Crash out, crash out, crash
Crash out, crash out, crash

Hemi, Trackhawk, Scat Pack, dash
458 Ferrari, drivin' it fast
Trappin' is a hobby, you ain't gotta ask
Turned her to a Barbie, spoilin' her like a brat
Punch sodas, woo, pour my Tus' for me, baby
Puttin' the motor in the truck, then I go crazy
Loaded up on new ice, yeah, load up on new car
Workin' it out of the 'partments, nigga, trappin', servin' hard
Young niggas campin' outside, sleepin' in your yard
Coppin' a bigger house, forty car garage
See what hustlin' get you when you goin' against the odd?
No cappin', I'm taxin', wrappin' up a bale
What kind of ice? That's a chandelier
My earrings lyin' to me when I look in the mirror

Whatever I'm with, my bitch with it too
Balenciaga and them sticks included
Crash out, crash out, crash
Crash out, crash out, crash
Whatever I'm with, my bitch with it too (hold it two hands)
Balenciaga and them sticks included (either you trappin', why waste your time?)
Crash out, crash out, crash 
Crash out, crash out, crash

Send a nigga straight up to God
Hold it two hands, it's a carbon
Either you trappin' or robbin'
Why waste your time if you flaugin'?

307, two-door coupe
GTA, I got shooters
