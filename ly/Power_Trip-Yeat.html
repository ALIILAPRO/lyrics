		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You live and learn
Except I don't feel like that
You live and you don't learn

I wonder what I could've did and what I never did
I wonder what you could've hid and what you could've said
It's not a lot of people like us, so I have respect
But don't go talking out ya neck unless you love being dead
I might go crazy, I'm out my head
I might kill 'em, and drop 'em dead
I might've did it, but I don't think I did
I might've done some things I never did
What would you do if everything was just not for you?
What would you do if every time you jumped, the hula hoop's on fire?
But tell me just don't lie
Well, tell me when you lie
Don't tell me when you cry
Just inform me when you die
I don't search for nothing I'm not one to go and pry
But I'm one to leave you backstabbed and leave ya blind
A cut across the eyes'll leave you blind for life
It only takes one time, it only takes a knife
I brought a big AR out, and you brought the knife
I'ma kill you nice and quick, that's kinda kind
And don't go waste my time
And don't go talking to me if you know you not gone be mine

I own a private jet
I'm on a power trip
You don't have to say what you did
I already know before you said
Pushing button's a instrument, so let me play
I ain't heard you, so speak up when you gone say it
Somebody getting saved tonight
Somebody getting played tonight
Got a very bad, but very good mind
A whole lot of things look worse in the light
And a whole lot get worse when you try
That's why I don't let a lot of things fly

If I could, then I would
I don't ever get stuck to a thing unless it's good
Is it good for me or bad for you or both of us?
And it's hard to believe you more than most of us
Riding 'round, a gun inside my pocket like I'm supposed to
They ain't ever gonna let you in, they ain't supposed to
Every time you walk a mile you only a inch closer
Keep on inching like a slug till it's over
Keep in mind that this shit ain't gone be over
Keep in mind when you push me, push me over
I'm a G-Wagon, you a Range Rover
And it's hard for me to ever stay sober
I'ma sit down at the top until its over
Wait, wait, till it's over
Wait till it's over

Oh, moving
Oh, places with ya
I told myself, "Never again," but I did it again and I do it every time
Moving fast, moving slow, moving sideways at times
When I'm high, and I can't hide behind the lies
And I know that you know that you feel that
'Cause you couldn't look me in my motherfuckin' eyes
What you mean when you talking to me?
All that we have's the future
You not on our fucking level
And this new life now
It's a new life now
The plane just landed
For my trip
But I'm always on that trip
