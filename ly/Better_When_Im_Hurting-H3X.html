		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody hates me
The way that I do
You can't make it any worse
Dug up my own grave
Spit in my own face
I throw knives while you throw words

'Cause I could make the best time
The worst night of my life (the worst)
I'll always turn it upside down (upside down)
My feet are on the ceiling (where)
Where nightmares are real things (the real)
But you're just standin' on the ground

Maybe I need somebody else
Somebody that won't pull me down
But I hate myself
Being loved is harder than it sounds

Break me out
Let's take that drive
We can talk all night
To save my life
You gave me everything I've needed
But I'm still better when I'm bleedin'
You clear my head
You talk me down
You calm my thoughts
Then show me how
I don't know why you think I'm worth it
But I'm still better when I'm hurting

(But I'm still better when I'm hurting)

Yeah
It's the way it hurt
But it made it worse
Puttin' you up on a pedestal
Never let you go
I always point the gun where your heart is
Forever love is the hardest
I can never make happiness work
(Can't make it work)
I left you stranded (why?)
You let me plan it (no)
Know you're way too good for me
(Know you're way too good)
The shit I damaged (I hurt)
You fixin' bandaged (you heal)
I'm sorry I'm the one to leave
(The one to leave)

I need somebody else
Somebody that won't pull me down
But I hate myself
Being loved is harder than it sounds

Break me out
Let's take that drive
We can talk all night
To save my life
You gave me everything I've needed
But I'm still better when I'm bleedin'
You clear my head
You talk me down
You calm my thoughts
Then show me how
I don't know why you think I'm worth it
But I'm still better when I'm hurting

You clear my head
You talk me down
You calm my thoughts
Then show me how
I don't know why you think I'm worth it
But I'm still better when I'm hurting
