		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And we broke
Everything that was right
We both enjoyed a good fight
And we solved
All the holes we had to breathe
To make the other one leave

And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And we stole
Every moment we had to make the other one feel bad
And we hoped that we could be what we knew
It never turned out to be real

And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right?
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right?
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right?
And if we turn back time
Could we learn?

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you
Like I used to
