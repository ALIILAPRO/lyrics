		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard

I'ma go hard, hard to the core
Hard like motherfuckin' liquid swords
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, delorian doors

Will he survive? Never deceased
I don't think I'm ever gonna rest in peace
I'ma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipe
Tell a jealous chicken I don't know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my grankids' nieces
I'ma work hard, that's my basis
This beat is a shit, feces

Pardon me ma'am, I'ma go dumb
Small.i.am, I'm complicated, hard.I.am
I end the beginning, then start it again

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard

You can get that, or you can get this
You can call it demon, I'ma call it Jesus
You can get a curse, you can get a cross
You can go to work, or you can be the boss
I'ma be the owner, be a thought Donor
I'ma go hard, like a motherfuckin" boner
I'ma make a beat to put the people in a coma
You can be a geek or be a rolling stoner

I woke up in the morning,
Hard like morning wood in the morning
Woke up thinking about microphoning
E.T. own the mic phone the homeland

I wait out like NASA, I'm way over here I done past ya
I get stacks of cash, you get cashews, I go hard, statues

Uh, you can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Now let me take this time to say
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
Well I, I know it is a lot to take
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard

Wait a minute, I'ma make it a little harder
I'ma make it a little harder
Give it to you a little harder

This is hard, hard like a rock n roll
Time bombs's ticking, explode
Baby, this is dynamo
Better move back now, it's bout to blow
Hard like Geometry, and Trigonometry
This is crazy, psychology
Get it baby, I'm about to win
Watch out now, I'm going in

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
