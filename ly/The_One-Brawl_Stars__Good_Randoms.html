		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tilt every night, babe
This is no life
Stuck playing those Mortis Games
This is a knockout, babe
And you are gone
But these odds, they can't be my fate (no way)
I felt lost and astray
But that was yesterday
Over with and done
Cause if you believe in me
Like Rosa believes in Bea
Then I finally found the one
Yeah, you can be the one
The one that I can trust (the one)
The one to be the clutch (the one)
You know I found the one and
You can
You can be the one
Yeah, you protect the zone (the one)
You never go alone and (the one)
You open up the goal and
You can
You can be the one
Had enough thumbs down, pain
But no more, I won't be blamed
Yeah there's got to be something better
I'm stuck in bronze babe
I can't win a round
And now you know I'm starting to rage
Cause I fell on my knees and prayed
Cause you didn't know your lane
That's over with and done
I need love that never leaves
Like Ruffs is for Eve
Then I've finally found the one
Yeah, you can be the one
The one that I can trust (the one)
The one to be the clutch (the one)
You know I found the one and
You can
You can be the one
Yeah, you protect the zone (the one)
You never go alone and (the one)
You open up the goal and
You can
You can be the one
I have never felt like this before
You heal me and you score
I will never have that fear nor pain
You know how to play with your main
At long last I can press play again
So babeâ€¦
Yeah, you can be the one
The one that I can trust (the one)
The one to be the clutch (the one)
You know I found the one and
You can
You can be the one
Yeah, you protect the zone (the one)
You never go alone and (the one)
You open up the goal and
You can
You can be the one
Yeah, you can be the one
The one that I can trust (the one)
The one to be the clutch (the one)
You know I found the one and
You can
You can be the one
Yeah, you protect the zone (the one)
You never go alone and (the one)
You open up the goal and
You can
You can be the one
