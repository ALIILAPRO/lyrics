		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came to me in peace
I gave you what you wanted but
No more than just enough
And now I'm on my knees
Have mercy on my soul
I am here to return your love
I'm reaching to be found
Let anyone that trusts in me
Be seen and be heard
And Lord, if I had known
That love would be your punishment
I would've kept my word

Is that what you do? For someone you love

You'll do it all for someone you love
Someone you love
You'll do it right for someone you love

You came to me out of nothing
Your beauty almost killed me
And the notion left me cold
I saw only your reflection
As always in this life I
Never saw the image whole
And now the little I can give
Is all my love into a song
I'll never stop to sing
You've shown the will to live
And someday we'll meet face to face
And I'll be born again

Yes you'll be born again
For someone you love

You'll be born again for someone you love
Someone you love let yourself be born again
For someone you love someone you love
Let yourself be born again
For someone you love someone you love
You'll do it all for someone you love
Someone you love
(You'll do it all for someone you love
Someone you love)
You'll be born again for someone you love
Someone you love let yourself be born again
For someone you love
