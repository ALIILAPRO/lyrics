		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'm home, but I cannot stay
I dream of you every day
Got to know every inch of you
Will you make my dream come true?

There's no place like home they say
You're my home, so hear me pray.

I don't know you, but I need more time
Promise me you'll be mine
Birds are flying over Europe skies,
Tell me please why can't I?

Times have changed, but so have I
I view my life through your eyes
On the go in my tourist's shoes
But I'll stay truthful to you

Cause there's no place like home they say
You're my home, so I guess I'll stay.

I don't know you, but I need more time
Promise me you'll be mine
Birds are flying over Europe skies
Tell me please why can't I?

I don't know you, but I need more time
Promise me you'll be mine
Birds are flying over Europe skies
Tell me please why can't I?
