		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They call me WHAM and they know who I am, yeah

She got that WAP and the way that she use it
Saliva with top and she come with a mop, I need to stop
Been out here rockin' the game with these features 
It's over for niggas as soon as I drop
She lookin' for love, but my heart somewhere in a box
She trippin', I changed the locks
Never tell nobody, you seen me by myself
Out and about, it was me and the Glock
Sun up to sundown, ain't nothin' else to do
But get money, so fuck it, I'm workin' the block
AP a cool quarter-million, I'm sorry
This watch did not come from me punchin' no clock
Built up some plays, got my number in motion
And got me a spot and start workin' my flock
Why you keep textin' me "W-Y-D"?
And "WYA" you out givin' out cock?
I told lil' bro if he can't get a knife
Get a lock and a sock and just work what you got
I know for sure if she went, she a go
I ain't cuffin' these hoes, like we swappin' 'em out
We really spin shit, I really did shit
I can't talk about, 'cause I'm not for the clout
They puttin' trackers on cars, watch your Insta'
As soon as you dip, they gon' break in your house
Put Unc' in the chopper and mind if they ever come in
You better not let none of them get out
I be performin' whenever I'm in it
As soon as I nut, I should take me a bow
I done had this one, and this one, and this one
And that one, like fuck it, let's fuck up the town
She super pretty and handle her business
Like fuck all these bitches, I'm bucklin' down
She super friendly and like her a nigga who spend it
I'm tellin' ya, don't bring her around
She post a picture without my permission
Got me in some shit, man, these women is wild
She fuckin' niggas, but think I don't know
That shit really a joke, man, lil' mama's a clown
I know some hitters who dead to the wrong
But they still came home, we took it to trial

Yeah, I'ma tell you when I'm finished (never)
I get sturdy when I'm in it, baow
Talkin' 'bout I hurt her feelings, ouch
If I want it, I'ma get it now
Shooters in here, all the windows down
Oh you tryna get a bag, how?
Everybody know we pushin' them pounds, yeah

In here I go, I ain't walked in a minute
Fully in charge, I'm the boss of the business
And it's a problem, ain't callin' nobody
The hitters is already with me, I come from the heart of the city
The streets, I was all the way in 'em, I just dropped a banger with Nicki
My TRX taller, I lifted it, soon as we harvest, they ship it
I just pray to God to forgive me, I've been out here killin' it
It was startin' to go left, then I shifted it
You can come work for me, I got benefits
You can't do what I do, I invented this
.357 with a switch and extended clips
And another clip, that's a back-up
Stayin' out the way, I've been runnin' my sack up
I wish one of you pussy lil' niggas would add up
I bet we OD on 'em, bulletproof Cadillac
That's two-hundred racks, I told the set to go buy three of 'em
He thinkin' that he straight, because I let him skate
I hope a nigga know that we on 'em
Hate they had to call him that
But ain't no comin' back, it is what it is
Beat the quarterback and I'm the running back
I get the team off the field
Look at my chain, it got bigger, change up the face, you look bitter
I hold it down for the real ones
I'm tryna pocket a billion, get out of line, you gon' feel me
When I get high, that's the real me, I know my opps wanna kill me
Ain't goin' nowhere, I'll be here, post the location, we'll be there
Get out of place and get beat up, brrt (bah, bah, bah)

Yeah, I'ma tell you when I'm finished (never)
I get sturdy when I'm in it, baow
Talkin' 'bout I hurt her feelings, ouch
If I want it, I'ma get it now
Shooters in here, all the windows down
Oh you tryna get a bag, how?
Everybody know we pushin' them pounds, yeah
