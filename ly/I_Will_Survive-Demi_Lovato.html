		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I
Learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked into find you here with
That sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you
Think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Keep tryin' hard to mend the
Pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and
Just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you
Think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you
Think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
