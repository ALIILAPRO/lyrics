		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What about the glass dandelions?
What about the TV screen?
What about the undeveloped camera?
Maybe we should bury these
What about the last of the good ones?
What about the ceiling fans?
What if we moved back to New York?
What about the moon drop light?

You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it
I'm only gonna break it
You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it, you should take it

What about the rainbow eucalyptus?
What about the instruments?
What about the Cowboy Junkies?
What about the Afghan Whigs?
What about the Mountain Valley Spring?
What about the ornaments?
What if I reinvented again?
What about the moon drop light?

You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should it take it
I'm only gonna break it
You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it, you should take it
You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it 
If I miss it, I'll visit
You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it, you should take it

I don't want it, I don't care
I don't want it, it wouldn't be fair
It'd be so alone without you there
It wouldn't be fair, it wouldn't be fair
There's nobody home, I'm already there
It wouldn't be fair

You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it
I'm only gonna break it
You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it, you should take it
You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it 
If I miss it, I'll visit
You should take it
'Cause I'm not gonna take it
You should take it 

It wouldn't be fair
It'd be so alone without you there
It wouldn't be fair, it wouldn't be fair
There's nobody home, I'm already there
It wouldn't be fair
