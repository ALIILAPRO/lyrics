		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing for me here, life in the dust
The desert sings of bones
You can wait forever
No one will pass you by
The snake has eyes of stone

His mouth is death
He takes your life, he fears no knife
It bites him too

There's no place like hell
Life in the fire, a funeral pyre for you
You can scream and cry
Nobody cares
The dead do what, they do
Your fate is death
You take your life, you fear the knife
It bites you too

Brothers of the snake
Sisters of the flame
We're not the same as you

We know you well
We wait in hell
We burn with lust for you
Our touch is death
You taste our breath,
We fear the knife
We take your life

It bites us too
It bites us too

You take a life, you feel the knife
It bites us too
It bites us too
