		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your hand
Is deep in the pocket of your jeans

Your mind
Is desperately searching for release

You don't know how much you should take
But I do

The sun goes down and it's getting late
It's on you


Will you meet me there

Come and join me
Drift away
Take a journey
I'll be right there

I'm getting lonely
In my place
Get to know me
I'll meet you there

Feels like you got no time to waste
Need the truth

I am always willing to wait
Wait for you

I know
That you're looking for me
