		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk

And I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe

It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
