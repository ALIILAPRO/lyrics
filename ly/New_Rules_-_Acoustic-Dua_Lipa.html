		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I got new rules, I count 'em

I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I got new rules, I count 'em

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em (oh, woah, oh)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em (baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
You ain't getting over him
