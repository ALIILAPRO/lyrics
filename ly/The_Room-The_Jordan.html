		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The ticking of the window
You took me on your knees
The touch of overwhelming
I can hardly breathe

The dress that you unbuttoned
I'm counting all the steps
Coming out of nowhere
I just held your hand

Now that we're lying here
And pretend that it's all gone
Now I feel your body near
Please never end
Never end

The little drops of hunger
Just tell me you'll be mine
Quickly going deeper
Too young to die tonight

All that we needed is inside
Of this room
Oh make me believe it
Make me believe it
All that we needed is inside
Of this room
Where no one can touch us
No one will know

Holy mess, oh baby
I can hardly breathe
The touch of overwhelming
The beauty of our needs
