		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you will, you said you won't 
You can't tell if you don't 
You stand alone on your own 
Reaching out, holding on 

Now you will but then you don't 
You say you want to but now you won't 
You stand alone on your own 
Reaching out, holding on

Where's the love? Where's the feeling?
Where's the belief in the words we're breathing?
Why do wander away from me?

Don't need no other like I need you (Oh, I need you)
Always, I need you 

I need your love 
To silence all my shame 
I need you always 

The feeling of falling 
The shadow's a warning 
Wanting to quiet to tame this disorder 
But round in a circle you go 
Don't need no other like I need you 
Always, I need-

I need your love to silence all my shame 
I need you always 
So please don't misunderstand 
To silence all my shame 

I need you always 
I need you always 
Always
Always
Always
Always
