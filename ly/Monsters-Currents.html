		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're stuck in the same old standstill again
Sick of waiting for you to feel it
Always waiting for the next breakdown to begin
Scared of getting too complicated

What a shame, hiding in your shell again
Bitter, fucked out of better days
And missed opportunities
I don't wanna hear that the times are changing
I'm the same as I've always been
Why can't you see?
Are you even listening to me?

I am not the one to blame for the monsters we've become (whoa)
Get in or get out
I don't care but don't waste my time
Stand by my side or you can move on with your life

Burnt out, enslaved
I'm left carry a weight that has me
Worn down, in doubt
I'm left to drown with no oxygen
Burnt out, drain me
Until there's nothing left to bleed
Burdened by the chains and too exhausted to run away

I gave you everything
You spit it back in my face
It never meant anything
Left me to swallow the pain
So much for the dream

What a shame, hiding in your shell again
Bitter, fucked out of better days
And missed opportunities
I don't wanna hear that the times are changing
I'm the same as I've always been
Why can't you see?
Are you even listening to me?

I am not the one to blame for the monsters we've become (whoa)
Get in or get out
I don't care but don't waste my time
Stand by my side or you can move on with your life

You took what you could just to throw me away
I gave you everything
So much for the dream
I gave you everything
