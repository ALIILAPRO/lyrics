		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're clever, catch the mood
We been waitin' up and now it's midnight
Don't you grieve what you can't undo?
I think we're onto something familiar

Do you even remember how you're supposed to move?
Switch it on and groove
Stand up and just dance
Down, up, left, right
Down, up, left
Down, up, left, right
Down, up, left

Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes
Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes

Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes
Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes

Not some flavors, neither someone's honeymoon
This is how you glow without a spotlight
It's a moment you can have just on your own
But if you change your mind, feel free to join now

Do you even remember how you're supposed to move?
Switch it on and groove
Stand up and just dance
Down, up, left, right
Down, up, left
Down, up, left, right
Down, up, left

Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes
Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes

Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes
Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes

Giulia, Maisha
Monica, Francesca
Greta, Mercy
Alexis, Sandra

Hush, all my ladies (hush, all my ladies)
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes (we're all over this party)
Hush, all my ladies
We are just getting ready
No guilt over these bodies
We're all over this party, yes (we're all over)

Hush, all my ladies
Hush, all my ladies
Hush, all my ladies
Hush, all my ladies
