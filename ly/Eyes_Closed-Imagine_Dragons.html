		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I could do this with my eyes closed)

I'm back from the dead, from the back of my head
Been gone and facing horrors that should never be said
The wrath and the grit from the pit of despair
Been taking every whip and word, I've never been spared

They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
They say the angels are among us

Lock me up in a maze
Turn out, turn out the lights
I was born, I was raised for this
Turn out, turn out the lights

Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry bout me
I was driving in my car, throwing up my hands
Put it in coast

(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could do this with my eyes-)

Less medications, less manifestations
Mantras, meditation, throw it all away

All the places I've been
All the blood that I've bled
I've been broken down and beat up but I still get ahead
All the faceless embraces and the tasteless two faces
Killed and resurrected 'cause I'll never be dead

They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
They say that piranhas are among us

Lock me up in a maze
Turn out, turn out the lights
I was born, I was raised for this
Turn out, turn out the lights (turn out the lights)

Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry bout me
I was driving in my car, throwing up my hands
Put it in coast

(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could-, I could do this with my eyes-)

And when the day broke, buried in violence
Something made my mind up
I will spend these days as an island
Alone and far away

Lock me up in a maze
Turn out, turn out the lights
I was born, I was raised for this
Turn out, turn out the lights

Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry bout me
I was driving in my car, throwing up my hands
Put it in coast

(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could do this with my eyes closed)
Turn out, turn out the lights
(I could-, I could do this with my eyes closed)
