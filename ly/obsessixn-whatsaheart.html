		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby why you look so scared
Baby why you look so scared
Don't run away bae just come here
Don't run away bae just come here

Who the fuck you think
You're talking to
It's been a while now
I've been watching you
I watch you comb your hair
And brush your teeth
I watch you talk on the phone
And I watch you sleep

Baby why you look so scared
Baby why you look so scared
Don't run away bae just come here
Don't run away bae just come here
You're all mine i'll never share
You're all mine i'll never share
I run my fingers through your hair
I run my fingers through your hair

Yeah i'll never stop
Yeah i'll never stop
Not until I have you here in my arms
You can call the cops
You can call the cops
But they can't catch what they
Can't outrun

Who the fuck you think
You're talking to
It's been a while now
I've been watching you
I watch you comb your hair
And brush your teeth
I watch you talk on the phone
And I watch you sleep
Yeah, girl you know that i'm
Coming for you
Don't invite your friends or
I'll get them too
You call your boyfriend tell me
What's he gonna do
When i'm done with him
I'm all on you

Baby why you look so scared
Baby why you look so scared
Don't run away bae just come here
Don't run away bae just come here
You're all mine i'll never share
You're all mine i'll never share
I run my fingers through your hair
I run my fingers through your hair
