		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I wake up in my own pink world
I get up out of bed and wave to my homegirls
Hey, Barbie (hey), she's so cool
All dolled up, just playin' chess by the pool

C'mon, we got important things to do
It's her (ayy), and her (ayy)
And me, and you

In pink, goes with everything
Beautiful from head to toe
I'm read' to go, you know, you know
It's pink
Good enough to drink
We like all the colors, but pink just looks so good on us

What you wearin'? Dress or suit?
Either way, that power looks so good on you
Hey, Barbie, I like your style
If that was really a mirror, you'd see a perfect smile
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round and

That's my Barbie (go, Barbie, go, Barbie)
That's my Barbie (ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's my Barbie (go Barbie, go, Barbie)
That's my Barbie (ooh, ooh, ooh)

C'mon, we got important things to do
It's her (ayy), and her (ayy)
And me (ayy), and you

In pink, goes with everything (oh, yeah)
Beautiful from head to toe
I'm read' to go, you know, you know
It's pink (pretty pink)
Good enough to drink (oh yeah)
We like all the colors but pink just looks so good on us

P, pretty
I, intelligent
N, never sad
K, cool

Hey, Midge
Never mind
