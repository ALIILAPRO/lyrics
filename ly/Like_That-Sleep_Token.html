		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trapped under the surface of your words
There is a new intention
New whispers that once could not be heard
Catching your intention
Wait, talking with razors on your tongue
Just to provoke my combat
New weapons to snap those final strings
Just to watch me fall back

Do you like that? (Do you like that? No)
Do you like that? (Do you like that?)

Push down into membranes and layers
Creating a slow dissection
I stumble into your tar trap
An addition to your collection

Do you like that?
Do you like that?
Do you like that?
Do you like that?

Fall into your eyes like a grave (all that is inside, all your anger)
Bury me to the sound of your name, oh (all your disgust, all your resentment)
Fall into your eyes like a grave (all your pain, all your pain)
Bury me to the sound of your name

All your pain (fall into your eyes like a grave)
All your pain (bury me to the sound of your name)
All your pain (fall into your eyes like a grave)
All your pain

(Do you like that? Do you like that? Do you like that? No)
(Do you like that? Do you like that? Do you like that? No)
