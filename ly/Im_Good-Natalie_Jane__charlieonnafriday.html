		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thanks (thanks)
For telling me that you never felt this way
And promising you'd never go away
It's the first time I ever felt that safe, I swear
I was safe, I swear, yeah
Thanks
For leaving me without telling me goodbye (bye-by)
For leaving me with no explanation why (why?)
It's the first time I fell for a lie, I swear
I was blind, I swear, yeah

Words like scissors, you cut my heart in half
Torn up pictures, oh, who the hell was that?
Stuck a knife in, funny now you want me back
And that's too bad (oh-oh-oh)

I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love
I'm actually doing better than I ever was
I'm going up, don't interrupt
I miss you but I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love
These days I'm doing better than I ever was
Don't hit me up, not picking up
I miss you but I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love (onnafriday)

Yeah, you hit me up and you want me back
But to be honest, I'm good, love
You callin' back and you need me bad
I always knew that you would, love (that you would)
She loves the way that I pop these tags
Say she need that Birkin bag (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I know you just want my racks
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah)
You tried to tell me cut off all my friends, oh yeah
But my dawgs and me, we ain't ever gon' end, oh yeah (oh)
Yeah, we knew you was shady from the jump, jump, jump
Yeah, that's why you be calling when you drunk, drunk, drunk
Yeah, you up in the club and you takin' these shots
All of a sudden you calling again (calling)
You toxic as fuck but I'm cutting you off
And then all of a sudden I'm ballin' again, yeah
I'm good, love
I'm good, love
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love

I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love (I'm good, I'm good, I'm good)
I'm actually doing better than I ever was
I'm going up (oh yeah), don't interrupt (interrupt)
I miss you but I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love (I'm good, love)
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love (I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love)
These days I'm doing better than I ever was (oh yeah)
Don't hit me up (oh yeah), not picking up (not picking up)
I miss you but I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, love

Nobody told me
Nobody told me how
Nobody warned me (warned me)
How we were doomed to drown
I figured it out by myself
Damaging my mental health
I swear, I was blind, I swear
