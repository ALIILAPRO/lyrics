		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah

When I walk on by
Girls be looking like, "Damn he fly"
I pimp to the beat
Walking down the street in my new LaFreak, yeah
This is how I roll
Animal print pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
And like Bruce Leroy I got the glow, yeah (ah)

Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
I-I, I work out (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
I-I, I work out

When I walk in the spot (yeah) this is what I see (okay)
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it
I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

Yeah
When I'm at the mall security just can't fight 'em all
And when I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo tryna tan my cheeks (what?)
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service, watch

Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
I-I, I work out (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
I-I, I work out

When I walk in the spot (yeah) this is what I see (okay)
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it
I'm sexy and I know it
Ay
I'm sexy and I know it

Check it out
Check it out

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah, yeah
Do the wiggle, man
I do the wiggle, man
Yeah
I'm sexy and I know it

Ay
Yeah

(Ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
I-I, I work out (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
Girl look at that body (ah)
I-I, I work out

I'm sexy and I know it
