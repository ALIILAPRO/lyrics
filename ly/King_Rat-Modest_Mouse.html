		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well!
Well!
Well!
Well!

We spun like birds on fire right down towards the residence and I
I took all that I desired, even crooks have to pay the rent.
We swam like rats on fire right, right down the reservoir
We took all that we could carry but we tried to carry more.

And you know you know you know it all went wrong.
And you know you know you know it was all wrong.

We choked on street tap water well I'm gonna have to try the real thing
I took your laugh by the collar and it knew not to swing.
Anytime I tried an honest job well the till had a hole and ha-ha
We laughed about payin' rent 'cause the county jails they're free.

And you know you know you know it all went wrong.
And you know you know you know it was all wrong.

Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child
Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child

Oh, lucky lucky lucky lucky me again.
I said it looks like I've got to use my feet again
Well I just spent my last one-hundred dollars
God I'll pay my bill again

Oh, I don't care
Oh, how I just don't care.

Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll shooken and shy
Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll rat of a child

Well King rat has me on his list again
I can never be on the fence again
I found out it's all loud
Open like an organ and it
Talk, talk, talk, talk again
He promised me that when I cheated him
But I could open my eye well

Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky,
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again.

Deep water, deep water
This senseless denial
I got fed like a fish, full of open smiles
Blue water, deep water
Oh senseless denial
I got fed like a fish on the cardboard smiles

Well well
What do you have to say for yourself?
I said, well well
Well?
I said well, well, well, well!

Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again.
I hardly knew I should use my feet again
What do you have to say for yourself?
What do you have to say for yourself?
