		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it all surround me
Breathe all your hate into my lungs
I know that you can't stand me
Cannot help the way that I've become

But all I wanted to be was
So much more than I am now
It doesn't even matter
The thoughts from you were just so loud

I'm not afraid
I've been here for so long
Escape from me
My world is breaking down

I try to see right through this
But I think you know the way I feel
Cannot see beyond this
It all just seems so unreal
So hard to peel
This mask of you that's on my face
I feel it running through me
Those thoughts of you that I disgraced

I'm not afraid
I've been here for so long
Escape from me
My world is breaking down

Is there a way to feel this?
The thoughts inside my head
But in the pool of fears I swim in, I hold on to the ledge

Right, its not right

I'm not afraid
I've been here for so long
Escape from me
My world is breaking down

Is there a way to feel this?
It's coming to me
The thoughts inside my head, they flow within me
But in the pool of fears I'm out onto the ledge
I hold on to the ledge
But in the pool of fears I swim away from you
