		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swerving in the traffic on the freeway
Keychain digging in my skin 'til I bleed grey
Dizzy, I don't see straight
(Drank your Kool-Aid)
Taking a machete to the silence
Sirens, ringing in my ear, drum violence
My body kinda lifeless
(You're still smiling)

Shattered glass and burning plastic
You look like you feel fantastic

Was it a fun night for you?
Speeding down I-5, no cops on the map
Screaming out, "I'd die for you"
But after all the stops and starts, crashes and carnage
I'm just carsick
I'm just carsick

Floating twenty feet above the pavement
Tasting metal on my tongue
Got monoxide in my lungs and my eyes dilated
(Watch it slowly)
How did I submit to being spineless?
Cross double lines 'cause you like doing wild shit
My body looking lifeless
My body looking lifeless

Shattered glass and burning plastic (plastic)
You look like you feel fantastic

Was it a fun night for you?
Speeding down I-5, no cops on the map
Screaming out, "I'd die for you"
But after all the stops and starts, crashes and carnage
I'm just carsick
I'm just carsick

I'd die for you

After all the stops and starts, crashes and carnage
I'm just carsick
