		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come a little closer
I got something to tell you
I can't keep my composure
Whenever I am near you
You look over your shoulder
Give me those eyes, I could die

I know it's been a while
But is my shit still in your drawers?
Mi amore
I know it's been some time
I should not hurt anymore

You weren't mine but I was always yours, yours
I was always yours, yours
Oh, I was always yours, yours
Are you listening to me?
You weren't mine but I was always yours

I wish I didn't know you
You made me forget everything I've known
There's not a place I can go to
Where I'm not thinking about you, ah

I know it's been a while
But is my shit still in your drawers?
Mi amore
I know it's been some time
I should not hurt anymore

You weren't mine but I was always yours, yours
I was always yours, yours
Oh, I was always yours, yours
Are you listening to me?
You weren't mine but I was always yours, yours
I was always yours, yours

Yours, yours
I was always yours, yours
Yours, I was always yours, yours
Are you listening to me? (Yours)

You weren't mine but I was always yours, yours
I was always yours, yours
Oh, I was always yours, yours
Are you listening to me?
You weren't mine but I was always yours
