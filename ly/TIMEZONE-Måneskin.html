		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're wearing my old clothes
But you, you wear it better
And every time I see your face
The moon should be jealous
And I keep talking to the wall
Till he's a friend of mine
I call you every hour just to tell you
That I'm losing my mind

Now I know you're sleeping
Where I'm supposed to be?
Wish I could've stayed
The only thing that keeps us apart
Is seven thousand miles
Running like a mad dog

The only thing that keeps us apart 
Is a different timezone
So fuck what I'm dreaming, this fame has no meaning
I'm coming home
The only thing that keeps us apart 
Is a different timezone

Tomorrow I've got another plane
I'm not gonna take it
Mmm, instead I'm gonna fly straight to you
I paid double for the tickets
And I don't give a shit about
The contracts that I signed
And they can say whatever
We'll be making love
I'm fucking you tonight

Now I know you're sleeping
Where I'm supposed to be, eh?
Wish I could've stayed
The only thing that keeps us apart 
Is seven thousand miles
Running like a mad dog

The only thing that keeps us apart 
Is a different timezone
So fuck what I'm dreaming, this fame has no meaning
I'm coming home

The only thing that keeps us apart 
Is a different timezone

So fuck what I'm dreaming, this fame has no meaning
I'm coming home
The only thing that keeps us apart 
Is a different timezone
