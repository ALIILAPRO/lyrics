		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's two minus one?
Hope you listen to this song 'cause I, I, I
'Cause I'm doing right just fine
I'm doing alright, doing alright 

All the time in the world to myself
I can go out and drink all day and night
But why can't I get you off my mind

I can't get you out of my head, yeah
Gotta get you out of my head, yeah
How can you be so fine when I'm, I'm, 아이야이야

Two minus one
I can see you're doing really good without me, baby
Two minus one
I'm doing great myself 
Hope you know I am

'Cause I'm not lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Two minus one
I'm super fine
I don't need you anymore

And every time I see you in my feed
I don't feel anything anymore
We used to be best friends
I remember you said that you can be yourself when I'm around
Guess that didn't really matter
All the feelings we had were not worth much to you at all
Well I moved on, so keep your two cents
Sympathy subtraction

I can't get you out of my head, yeah
Gotta get you out of my head, yeah
How can you be so fine when I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

Two minus one
I can see you're doing really good without me, baby
Two minus one
I'm doing great myself 
Hope you know I am

'Cause I'm not lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Two minus one
I'm super fine
I don't need you anymore

I thought you were the one
Didn't need any other
I can still smell the perfume you used to wear in my clothes 
Can't erase it, no

I used to think you were that someone
We used be so much alike 
I can still see you in myself

Love is so blinding
Love is so blinding 

Two minus one
I can see you're doing really good without me, baby
Two minus one
I'm doing great myself 
Hope you know I am

'Cause I'm not lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Two minus one
I'm super fine
I don't need you anymore

Don't need you anymore

I need you
