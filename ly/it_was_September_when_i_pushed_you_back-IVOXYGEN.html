		  Dear Mama
I really love you
I just wanna sit back, kiss and hug you
Tell you how I miss you and vent about my issues
Maybe grab some tissues
Because I know I’m gonna shed some tears
Especially after all these years of not having you right here
Next to me, making sure I’m being the best for me
You was like my recipe to avoid catastrophe
I’m losing my mind, trying to escape to make up lost time
It don’t work because I still remember the day I seen you in a hearse
Broke my heart I felt shattered, got numb and wanted to go batter
Everyone in my path I really missed you super bad
And I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
Maybe go back some years
I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
So I can stop shedding tears
I wish you was here
Maybe go back some years
I wish you was here
And I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
Maybe go back some years
I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
So I can stop shedding tears
I wish you was here
Maybe go back some years
I wish you was here
And I wish you was here
And I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
So I can stop shedding tears
And I wish you was here
So I can stop shedding tears
So I can stop shedding tears
I wish you was here
