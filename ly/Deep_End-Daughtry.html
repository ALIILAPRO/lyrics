		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm underwater and I'm on fire
There's nothing wilder than my heart
Just let the current set it in motion
Then nothing can keep us apart

We're all swimming into the light
I want you by my side
And I'm right here waiting for you
Right here waiting for you
We're all living on borrowed time
I've been holding my breath all night
Waiting for you

I'm diving into the deep end
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared
And I've been way over my head
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared, no

I am an island, you are an ocean
I wanna float here in your arms
High as a mountain, deep in devotion
There's nothing wilder than your heart

We're all swimming into the light
I want you by my side
And I'm right here waiting for you
Right here waiting for you
We're all living on borrowed time
I've been holding my breath all night
Waiting for you

And now I'm diving into the deep end
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared
And I've been way over my head
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared, no

I'd follow you straight to the bottom
Not afraid, hell or high water
I wanna dive into you
I'd follow you straight to the bottom
Not afraid, hell or high water
I wanna dive into you

I'm underwater
And I'm on fire

And now I'm diving into the deep end
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared
And I've been way over my head
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared, no

I'd follow you straight to the bottom
Not afraid, hell or high water
I wanna dive into you
I'd follow you straight to the bottom
Not afraid, hell or high water
I wanna dive into you
