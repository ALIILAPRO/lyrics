		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna walk like Tyra
I wanna look like Linda Evangelista
I wanna be Madonna
Get you on your knees like a preacher
I wanna be iconic
You've never seen anything quite like me
I wanna be iconic, I wanna be iconic
I wanna be

We're serving fish for lunch today
Spilling tea on Broadway
She's giving Princess Di in her freakum dress
She is gaggy boots, passing in pinstripe suits
They are so pass√©, wish they were snatched like me

My life is a runway
Perfect, plastic, on display

I wanna walk like Tyra
I wanna look like Linda Evangelista
I wanna be Madonna
Get you on your knees like a preacher
I wanna be iconic
You've never seen anything quite like me
I wanna be iconic, I wanna be iconic
I wanna be

I shit rainbows bitch
Kunt is the main dish
I said what I said and that's on period
It is effortless, the way that I can switch
From George Clooney to Regina George
I'm everything you want and more

My life is a runway
Perfect, plastic, on display

I wanna walk like Tyra
I wanna look like Linda Evangelista
I wanna be Madonna
Get you on your knees like a preacher
I wanna be iconic
You've never seen anything quite like me
I wanna be iconic, I wanna be iconic
I wanna be

Walk, pose, shuffle, turn So camp, we're bout to burn  Marvelous!
Walk, pose, shuffle, turn
So camp, we're bout to burn
Paris, Notre, Damn them all!

I wanna walk like Tyra
I wanna look like Linda Evangelista
I wanna be Madonna
Get you on your knees like a preacher
I wanna be iconic
You've never seen anything quite like me
I wanna be iconic, I wanna be iconic
I wanna be, I wanna be
