		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is empty
Like cold open ground
Where ghosts & memories
Follow you round

Replacing old friends
No more to be found
All gone their ways
With the new stars in town

All of their laughter
Has drifted away
Gone with the wind
Like yesterday's song

Gone with the wind
Like yesterday's song
Gone
Gone with the wind

There's no sign of the lover
Who pins butterflies
No sign of fair-weather
No sweet soundin' lies

Now I'm a stranger
My eyes are set free
Like a man on a mountain
How I can see

All the ways
Illusions deceive
In a city of prayers
Where no one believes

When all of your dreams have scattered away
Gone with the wind
Like yesterday's song
Gone with the wind

Like yesterday's songs
Gone
Gone with the wind
