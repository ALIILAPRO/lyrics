		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Swallow all these pills with my pride, uh
Married to my highs, you may kiss the bride
Trouble in my brain, see it in my eyes
I got voices in my head, they keep me up at night
Said I was okay, but I'm lying, feel like that I'm dying
Soul screaming, crying, feel my brain frying
Try to numb the pain, all the drugs I been buying
This Oxy gettin' pricey, pour the codeine in the Hi-C
Blood red blend in the Hi-C
I've been doing so much wrong
Even though ma told me to do the right thing
Poppin' pills all night long
In the studio pourin' out my feelings
Can't explain this feeling
Kinda feels like I'm losing
Even though I'm winning

Drain out bad energy (drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (forget the bad memories)
Drain out bad energy (drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (forget the bad memories)
Ayy

Multi-million dollars
All mine from the start
Codeine kills the drama
And the trauma in my heart
Just got a call from the dark side
Stab wounds in my chest, but I'm alright
I miss my friends, I hate this spotlight
I love my girl, I hate the thot life
Yellow diamonds, shiny pearls
I'm tryna give her the world
I'm tryna show her the world
She ain't no ordinary girl
I know she know, I know she know I'm down and out
Life is a ocean, demons I've been drownin' out
I watch the crowd and crack a smile
I have a job to lead them out

Drain out bad energy (drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (forget the bad memories)
Drain out bad energy (drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (forget the bad memories, drain)
Ayy

Oh, oh (Daytrip took it to ten, hey), oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
