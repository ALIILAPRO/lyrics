		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
This keeps going through my head
Man
Look
I don't even know what to do
Look
Yeah, ay, yeah
We 'bout to have a talk
Yeah
Look at the skyline
As you looking in my eyes
Sick of these dry cries
Hate that the fact that we all die
And it gets to my head and I won't lie
Took your own life I don't know why
Never even got to tell you bye
Know you looking at me through the sky
Lemme just take away your pain
Living day to day
Back and forth I sway
I don't want the fame
I just want the fix
Nothings been the same
Hate the fact I miss
You
And I hate to admit it
Talking bout my life and I just really wanna quit it
All these people round me I just never really fit in
Try to talk about they just never wanna listen
Wait
Take me away
Lemme just leave wanna go far away
Far from this place that I use to just chase
Chase all these dreams that I never could take
Leave me alone I just need me a break
Why did you do this I'm hoping it's fake
Living in hell and I'm hating this place
Pain on my shoulders it's starting to weigh
Starting to weigh
Give me a sign that I will be okay
Make the sky blue I don't wanna see gray
Not this bad person of who I portray
Killing my body and watch it decay
So out of words I don't know what to say
The demons that do it I swear they will pay
Astral projecting I'm fading away
But I'm gonna make you proud
Know you looking at me from above I'm down
Never gonna give it up
Never ever gonna let em get me stuck
Gotta find a way but I need some luck
Hit me in the heart and I'm feeling struck
Living this life and it doesn't make sense
No dollars no quarters it doesn't make cents
Faking a smile I don't wanna pretend
Looking for love I don't know where it went
Hate the fact that I don't have any friends
I need to find me a way to prevent
Evil and kill it and watch it repent
I know that it's time I don't want you to leave
Pain and the hate is just all I can see
Please don't you leave 'cuz I need you by me
Yeah
We're just gonna let that
That beat ride out
It really be hard sometimes, you know
You have to get through it
Lemme just take away your pain
Living day to day
Back and forth I sway
I don't want the fame
I just want the fix
Nothings been the same
Hate the fact I miss
You
And I hate to admit it
Talking bout my life and I just really wanna quit it
All these people round me I just never really fit in
Try to talk about they just never wanna listen
Wait
Take me away
Lemme just leave wanna go far away
Far from this place that I use to just chase
Chase all these dreams that I never could take
Leave me alone I just need me a break
Why did you do this I'm hoping it's fake
Living in hell and I'm hating this place
Pain on my shoulders it's starting to weigh
