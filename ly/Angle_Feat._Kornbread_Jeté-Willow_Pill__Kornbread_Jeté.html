		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angle



Begin my life as an ethereal being

Step on the sands as I start to spread my wings



Got my girl Demoria

As we soak in your praise, euphoria

Blessed by the Gods of sex and funk

We ascend to the skies in glory. I-



Want you to take a dose of me

Feel the rush of pain and ecstasy

Put faith in me and embrace the fear

Fuck it, Revelations says the end is near 



I can be your angel

I can be your angel

Flying down from the heavenly world up above

I can be your angel

I'm what you want from me



You can be my offering

if you wanna break the bread then you know you have to pay me 

My love so toxic

Pop a  Pill spread my thighs

I'm on my fat girl thot shit



Fly me out private jet let's go shopping

Cloud 9 mile high in my cockpit

Group scene 14 is how I like it

in a room full of demons with we main two topics



We can shoot a movie in this sitch quick flick snap a pic don't gag don't spit

Pull my horns if you into that shit 

Get it POPPIN grab the poppers gang bang in this bitch



I make the rules when we tango 

Kitty sweet when you eat call it mango. 

I don't top flip flop 1 angle

Other 4 queens you should thank my ankle.



I can be your angel

I can be your angel

Flying down from the heavenly world up above

I can be your angel

I can be your angel

I can be your angel

Can you taste the heavenly lord on my lips

I can be your angel

I'm what you want from me



A-N-G-L-E, I'll be your angel! (x4)



Every time the devil touches me I come

alive

Feel him growin inside of me

Now you all must use your tongues for good

So bow down and just pray to me

Every time the devil touches me I come

alive

Feel him growin inside of me

Now you all must use your tongues for good

So bow down and just pray to me



I can be your angel

I can be your angel

Flying down from the heavenly world up above

I can be your angel

I can be your angel

I can be your angel

Can you taste the heavenly lord on my lips

I can be your angel

I'm what you want from me
