		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singin'
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door

There's a giant doin' cartwheels, statue wearin' high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancin' on the lawn
Dinosaur Victrola, listenin' to Buck Owens
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door

Tambourines and elephants are playin' in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo, doo
Wondrous apparition provided by magician
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door

Tambourines and elephants are playin' in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo, doo
Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrows
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door

Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancin' on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrow
Doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door
