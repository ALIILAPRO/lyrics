		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go
Don’t let go
Go
Go
Go
Don’t let go
Let go
Don’t let go
We’ve been going strong but now it’s sinking
What has it come to, that now I’m drinking
You’ve been avoiding my calls
And now you’re going around
Telling other dudes you aren’t committed
Guess you ended it when I was blinking
Is it cause I didn’t give you
Enough time cause my
Work comes first
And you come next
I didn’t realise
You were upset
But I gotta tell you
Go
Don’t let go
Go
Go
Go
Don’t let go
Let go
Don’t let go
We wouldn’t have started if you didn’t like it complex
There is no straight answer for someone to solve our mess
Now that you’ve departed with those who came to solve it
Guess there is an answer, by leaving you just solved it
What did I expect from someone from Bombay
Talk all high decked up, but came here to find their prey
I know I’m being bitter, and it’s a bit cliche
But I thought we were fine
I’m used to things my way
We’ve been going strong but now it’s sinking
What has it come to, that now I’m drinking
You’ve been avoiding my calls
And now you’re going around
Telling other dudes you aren’t committed
Guess you ended it when I was blinking
I thought things were going fine
Wanna make it all alright
Don’t know if it means we should be together
So I say
Go
Don’t let go
Go
Go
Go
Don’t let go
Let go
Don’t let go
Go
