		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the age of
Illusion
The age of
Illusion

Everyone is beautiful
Everything is fine
In the land of illusion the water babies speak Japanese and the faeries drink wine

Everyone is beautiful
Everyone is gay
In the land of illusion we paint our faces with chocolate cake and everything's okay

Let's go
Yo, let's go

To the land of
Illusion
The land of
Illusion

Everyone is beautiful
Everything is chill
Everyone is famous, evеryone is happy, let's pop another bluе pill

Blue pills
I've got mad blue pills
Blue pills
I've got big black pupils

Naze watashi wa nihon ga daisuki nano desu ka
Naze watashi wa nihon ga daisuki nano desu ka
Watashi wa zense de nihonjin deshita ka
Tabun
Tabun

In the land of
Illusion
The land of
Illusion

Everyone is beautiful
Everything is fine
In the land of illusion the water babies speak Japanese and the faeries drink wine
