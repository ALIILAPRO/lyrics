		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way

Yeah, I'm no my way but I ain't tryna stay
I'm just tryna smash and dash like the other day
Ain't nothing changed, give me brain, I'm stuck in my ways
I ain't tricking, I pay up bitch to get out my face
See, that's the pimping in me, I'm what these niggas envy
I hit that bitch and I'd be gone she leave your pockets empty
I swear my trigger finger got it bustin' like a semi
I play these hoes like Michael Jordan, you just Scottie Pippen
See, I be dodgin' bitches, I got a lot of misses
Man your bitch just wanna give my dick a lot of kisses
She keep telling me she love me, I don't wanna hear it
Bitch the only time I'm tricky when I'm disappearing

I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way

I'm always on the mission, I got a lot of women
Ain't no relationship after I get that mouth I'm dippin'
Put so much OG Kush upon a scale I got a tippin'
And now she caught me trippin', that wasn't my intention
Bombay I'm always sippin', KK that's my religion
Them niggas talking down to one come up missing
Them bitches won the Gram, ain't got a pot to piss in
Tryna get another one, don't give a fuck about your mentions
Who paying for the clothes?
Why your clique full of hoes?
Why you always at my shows?
All the real niggas know
And ain't any too many left of us
She ain't new to this, she do this on the regular

I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way

I just touch down in the city and I need that fix
If the head right then, I might keep you on the list
I bet the bitch are coming fuck me for some kids
She wanna fuck me cause I got a Maybach on my wrist
I call her head doctor, she keep the head proper
She need a headboard cause I'm the bed rocker
Told her she running out of time, I got a shot clocker
She wanna kick it all day, but we ain't playin' soccer
I hit her, she hit me right back
My nigga she know what I'm on
I'll let her play with the money
then I let her play with my ball
She told me her nigga was weak
So I let her smoke on this strong
I hit her then put her to sleep
Then I get right back in my zone

I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryna fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way
