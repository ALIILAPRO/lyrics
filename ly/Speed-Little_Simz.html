		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Niggas wanna put me in a box
Niggas think they're coming for my spot
I could buy your life with no excuses
If I had penny for all the rappers that I influence
I know what I bring, yo, I ain't stupid
You should try that shit on someone 
That isn't being their truest (true, true)
Figured I'd just leave you niggas to it
But watch how you step
Promise you don't wanna see me lose it (no, no)
Niggas know I got this shit on lock
Niggas think they coming for my spot
Don't you know your dealing with a boss
I make winnings out of any loss (any loss)
I think I do just what I please
I'm already a legend, you should humble your speech (yeah, yeah)
Age 101, disturbing the peace
I think I'm Kanye West, I see the blood on the leaves (yeah, yeah)
Muhfuckers ain't ready for my steez (woo)
Muhfuckers monitoring my speed
I'm running with ease, how you mean? (How you mean?)
Catch up if you please, I got 'em singing

Influential as fuck
I should ink in my skin
All this ink in my pen
Is what led me to win
Do my ting then I duss
I don't linger for fun
Oh you wish you could come
Wanna be my plus one
Give a fuck 'bout your style
Or the latest of trends
If you knew what it took
Just to get out the ends
Wanna stay where I stay
Know you owe me some rent
Still running with ease
Marathon not a sprint, nigga

You can tell I'm really going at it
They know when I drop it's problematic
Keep it on the move, I'm never static
I go in the booth and show you magic
Got a hard drive full of classics
I keep that shit locked up in the attic
If I bring 'em out it's a wrap though
I'm not sure if these niggas can hack it

Still running with ease, marathon, not a sprint

(Don't you know your dealing with a boss?)
(Don't you know your dealing with a boss?)
