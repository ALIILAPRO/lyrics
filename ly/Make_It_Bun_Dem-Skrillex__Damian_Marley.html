		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now greetings to the world
Voice of the one, Big Gong-Zilla
Alongside Skrillex
Dem fe know
Who we?
Awoah!

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make them all have fun
A-we a blaze the fire
Make it bun dem

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make some soundboy run
And we will end your week
Just like a Sunday

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make them all have fun
Skrillex a blaze the fire
Make it bun dem

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make some sound boy run
And we will end your week
Just like a Sunday

Rude boy!
Rude boy!
Rude boy!
Rude boy!

If I nah pose
But if I supposed
Them see we a close
Them wouldn't suppose it

Killing the flows
We're sicker than most
Defeating the foes
We weather the most

Never yet falter
Never yet flop
Never yey halt
And never yet stop

Keep up with God
And neva ya drop
All 'em a talk 
And all 'em a chat

Skrillex and Gong
The legend lives on
We give dem it hard
We give dem it strong

We give dem it rough
We give it long
We give dem it right
And never yet wrong

Sweeter the victory, the hotter the battle
The bigger the cover the fatter the bottle
The bass haffi rattle, a my tabernacle dis
Rudeboy bass!
Mash up the place!

Rude boy!
Rude boy!
Rude boy!
Rude boy!

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make them all have fun
A-we ablaze the fire
Make it bun dem

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make some soundboy run
And we will end your week
Just like a Sunday

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make them all have fun
Skrillex ablaze the fire
Make it bun dem

We mash up the place
Turn up the bass
And make some sound boy run
And we will end your week
Just like a Sunday

Rude boy!
Rude boy!
Rude boy!

Pack up and run
We'll pack up and run
We'll pack up and run away, huh?
Pack up and run
We'll pack up and run
We'll pack up and run away, huh?
Rude boy!

Pack up and run
We'll pack up and run
We'll pack up and run away, huh?
Pack up and run
We'll pack up and run
We'll pack up and run away, huh?
Rude boy!

Pack up and run
We'll pack up and run
We'll pack up and run away, huh?
Pack up and run
We'll pack up and run
We'll pack up and run away, huh?
Rude boy

Rude boy bass
Mash up the place
