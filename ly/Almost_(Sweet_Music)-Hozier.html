		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came in from the outside
Burnt out from the joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside
Is "Stella By Starlight"
"That Was My Heart"
The drums that start off "Night And Day"

The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me

Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft
As Chet can sing "Let's Get Lost"
And "Let The Good Times Roll"
Let "Smoke Rings" from this "Paper, Doll"
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of
"It Don't Mean A Thing"

I've got some color back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

"The Very Thought Of You" and "Am I Blue"?
"A Love Supreme" seems far removed
"I Get Along Without You Very Well," some other nights
The radio news reader chimes
Reporting "Russian Lullabies"
She'll turn to me awake and ask, Is everything "Alright"

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start
"Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
Be still "My Foolish Heart"
Don't ruin this on me
