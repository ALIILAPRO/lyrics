		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What they gonna say (Oh)
They acting like they never seen me
I live to see another day (Whoa)
I know that they wanna be me

This world is pretty evil, Imma part of it
Thank goodness I wasn't really the start of it
They call me illegal, I like the thought of it
I live reckless sorta like the college kid (Ooh)
Like an eagle yeah I'm dominant
Thank goodness I wasn't really the opposite
They call me illegal, I like the thought of it
I live reckless sorta like the college kid (Ooh)

Like an S.A.T. man you can put me to the test
Let me get it off my chest man I'm out here with the best
Yeah I'm lo-looking for leverage dawg I ain't looking for rest
Got the city on my back I guess you can say I'm blessed.
I got what you need
This is what I bleed what bleed
Let me plant the seed
You see what I see what I see
Ain't no questioning
Leader of the pack
If you disagree head straight to the back (Uh)

My trophies in front
Day ones on my side
Foes to my back

Building my strength and chi
Nobody's stopping me
I call it c'est la vie

This world is pretty evil, Imma part of it
Thank goodness I wasn't really the start of it
They call me illegal, I like the thought of it
I live reckless sorta like the college kid (Ooh)
Like an eagle yeah I'm dominant
Thank goodness I wasn't really the opposite
They call me illegal, I like the thought of it
I live reckless sorta like the college kid (Ooh)
