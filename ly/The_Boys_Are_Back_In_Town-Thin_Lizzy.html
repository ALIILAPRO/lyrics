		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess who just got back today
Them wild-eyed boys that had been away
Haven't changed, had much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
I said, the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town

You know that chick that used to dance a lot
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she'd got
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
I mean, she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't want to know, forget her

The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
I said, the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town

Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town?
You spread the word around

Friday night, they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's Bar 'n' Grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys want to fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favorite song
The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til the summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
(The boys are back, the boys are back)

The boys are back in town again
Been hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again
