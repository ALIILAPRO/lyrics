		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said she want a stunner
I said, "baby girl, I'm gettin' money"
Drop it down, get low, uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't forget the girl if I wanted
While she up and down on that pole
While she up and down on that pole
When she up and down, she got me sayin'
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low
Got me sayin',
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low

I blew ten, I blew twenty, it's nothin' to me, I get money
I eat, sleep and I shit money, I, I, I can't get this bitch off me
I'm tossin' it and she want it, that's the way we own it
Sound crazy, don't it? I'm turned up, never turnt down
Them bottles come when we want 'em
Pass 'em out to my homies, shorty break it down for me
I done gave her head for that knowledge
Shorty lap dancin' all on me
Probably give it to me now, give it to me now
First she got me up, then she's goin' down
Finna climb that, I mean climax
We ridin' out, I'm gon' ride that
Triple X flick, we gon' try that
She could press record, don't rewind that

She said she want a stunner
I said, "baby girl, I'm gettin' money"
Drop it down, get low, uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't forget the girl if I wanted
While she up and down on that pole
While she up and down on that pole
When she up and down, she got me sayin'
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low
Got me sayin',
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low

My hair longer than hers, bitch, life ain't fair
I'm gettin' paid off ad-libs, all I got to do is say, "yeah"
Ridin' around in that foreign, all your stories sound distorted
Got so many Cuban links with me, my chain could get deported
At the bar takin' shots, seek her out, you need reloader
If you even took a bitch from me, I come back to repo her
Dirty Sprite, I'll repour it, smellin' like a car dealership
And I don't think it's gon' work out
So, bitch, you need a membership

She said she want a stunner
I said, "baby girl, I'm gettin' money"
Drop it down, get low, uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't forget the girl if I wanted
While she up and down on that pole
While she up and down on that pole
When she up and down, she got me sayin'
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low
Got me sayin',
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low

Olay, olay, olay, olay
Look at '64s, out everyday, olay, olay

Let a nigga let you know how much you care about a bitch
I'm 'bout as cold as it get
Only thing you get is a whole lot of dick
Shout to Collipark when it's sold by the brick, nigga, hold up
Sittin' on the stage with the racks on go
Got some bitches with me, turn to the max, on go
But we with the shit, you bitch try me we shootin'
And shootin' 'til the gun don't blast no more
Back it up to me
Grind on me like you're tryin' make love to me
And go and bring the baddest girl in the club to me
That'll make you the baddest girl in the world to me
For real, huh, and I'm still ridin' one hand on the wheel
The other one touchin' the girl while she kissin' the other one
Makin' her face her like she finna bust her one

She said she want a stunner
I said, "baby girl, I'm gettin' money"
Drop it down, get low, uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't forget the girl if I wanted
While she up and down on that pole
While she up and down on that pole
When she up and down, she got me sayin'
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low
Got me sayin',
Yeah, drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low, drop it down and get low
