		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing now
Calling all the people here to see the show
Calling for my demons now to let me go
I need something, give me something wonderful

I believe
She won't take me somewhere I'm not supposed to be
You can't steal the things that God has given me
No more pain and no more shame and misery

You can't take me down
You can't break me down
You can't take me down

You can't take me down
You can't break me down
You can't take me down

Love and hate
How much more are we supposed to tolerate?
Can't you see there's more to me than my mistakes?
Sometimes I get this feeling, makes me hesitate

I believe
She won't take me somewhere I'm not supposed to be
You can't steal the things that God has given me
No more pain and no more shame and misery

You can't take me down
You can't break me down
You can't take me down

You can't break me down
You can't take me down
You can't break me down

I can see a place of trouble (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)
And I'm on the verge (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)
For the love of everybody (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)
I need something more (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)

Now I feel some days of trouble (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)
In the house of war (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)
For the love of everybody (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)
Look behind a wall (I can't stay away, I can't stay away)

Standing now
Calling all the people here to see the show
Calling all my demons now to let me go
I need something, give me something wonderful
