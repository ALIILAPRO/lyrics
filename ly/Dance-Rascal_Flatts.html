		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Headphones, downtown train, outside in the rain
In my shotgun seat right beside me
Country rock and roll, hip hop throwback soul
Cross the kitchen floor, just the bare feet
Crank the dial up clockwise, windin' up her wild side
That girl is ready to move

She don't really care who's watchin'
When she gets goin', there's no stoppin' her
If there's a beat somewhere that's droppin', she's rockin'
It's a party anywhere that her feet land
My baby loves to dance, dance, dance
My baby loves to dance

Don't need Friday night
Don't need flashing lights
Moment's always right when the feelin' hits her
It's all I can take, when she swings and sways
I can't look away, can't resist her

Crank the dial up clockwise, windin' up her wild side
That girl is ready to move

She don't really care who's watchin
When she gets goin', there's no stoppin' her
If there's a beat somewhere that's droppin', she's rockin'
It's a party anywhere that her feet land (her feet land)
My baby loves to dance, dance, dance
My baby loves to dance, dance, dance
My baby loves to dance

Yeah, she gets my heart racing (my baby loves, loves to dance)
All through my body beating like a drum (my body beating like a drum)
Yeah, the sexy way she shakes it
My baby loves to dance
She don't really care who's watchin'
Once she gets goin', there's not stopping her
There's no stopping her

If there's a beat somewhere that's droppin', she's rockin'
It's a party anywhere that her feet land (her feet land)
My baby loves to dance, dance, dance (my baby loves to dance, my baby loves to dance)
My baby loves to dance, dance, dance (my baby loves to dance, my baby loves to dance)
My baby loves to dance
