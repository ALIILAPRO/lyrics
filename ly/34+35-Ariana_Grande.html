		<p>
		  Hm

You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been craving
If I put it quite plainly
Just give me them babies

So what you doing tonight?
Better say, "Doing you right" (yeah)
Watching movies but
We ain't seeing a thing tonight (yeah)

I don't wanna keep you up (you up)
But show me, can you keep it up? (It up?)
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit maybe, I'ma keep you up, boy

I've been drinking coffee (I've been drinking coffee)
And I've been eating healthy (and I've been eating healthy)
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah (you know I keep it squeaky)
Saving all my energy (yeah, yeah, saving all my energy)

Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five

Can you stay up all night? (All night)
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five

You drink it just like water (water)
You said it tastes like candy

So what you doing tonight? (Tonight)
Better say, "Doing you right" (oh babe)
Watching movies but
We ain't seeing a thing tonight (yeah)

I don't wanna keep you up (you up)
But show me, can you keep it up? (It up?)
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit maybe, I'ma keep you up, boy

I've been drinking coffee (said I've been drinking coffee)
And I've been eating healthy (and I've been eating healthy, 'cept this wine though)
You know I keep it squeaky (you know I keep it squeaky)
Saving all my energy (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Can you stay up all night? (All night)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (daylight)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (thirty-five, ayy)

Can you stay up all night? (Can you stay up?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (can you stay up?)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Baby you might need a seat-belt when I ride it
I'ma leave it open like a door come inside it
Even though I'm wifey
You can hit it like a side chick
Don't need no side dick, no

Got the neighbors yelling, "Earthquake" (earthquake)
4.5 when I make the bed shake (bed shake)
Put it down heavy
Even though its lightweight
(It's lightweight, yeah, yeah, yeah)

We started at midnight
Got 'til the sunrise (sunrise)
Done at the same time
But who's counting the time
When we got it for life? (Got it for life)
I know all your favorite spots (favorite spots)
We could take it from the top (from the top)
You such a dream come true, true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh

Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight (yeah, yeah)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (ahh, yeah)
Thirty-four, thirty-five 

Can you stay up all night? (Do you know what that mean?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (do you know what that mean?)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Means I wanna sixty-nine with ya (no shit)
(Math class, never was good)
