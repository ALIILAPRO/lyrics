		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't here to play no games
I'm gonna give it to you just how you want it
You can call me crazy, baby
You just drive me crazy when you touch on it
Got my legs up, hands up, at attention
You make me stand up and switch up on it
Make your head go 'round and 'round
And got me makin' sounds until the mornin'

I be screamin' oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, on you
Got me sayin' oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, on you
Got me sayin', yeah
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah
Damn

Ain't no limit what I'm pullin' when I fuck on you, babe
Oh no
Talk that shit, play with that clit and watch it rain on you, babe
Funny how you thought I tapped out when we was fuckin'
We're just gettin' started, ooh-whoa

Hit it, quit it
Feel that shit, get it
Lick it, fuck it, feel it
Touch it, ooh (oh)
Titties in your mouth
With your tongue all out, whoa-oh

I ain't here to play no games
I'm gonna give it to you just how you want it
You can call me crazy, baby
You just drive me crazy when you touch on it
Got my legs up, hands up, at attention
You make me stand up and switch up on it
Make your head go 'round and 'round
And got me makin' sounds until the mornin'

I be screamin' oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, on you
Got me sayin' oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, on you
Got me sayin' yeah
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah

Tryna see if it feel what it look like
Been had a urge that I can't fight
It's a lot of time in one night
And I'm a little bark, but I'm all bite
Tryna eat you, then I'm tryna kiss you
'Cause I know you freaky and you wanna taste you
Yeah, I fuckin' feel you, mean I feel you fuckin'
Shit, I feel you cummin', ain't gon' be no runnin', no
I'm five-foot-five, I can handle it
You fine-fine-fine, you scandalous
You ain't gotta be mine to do all this
Just gotta make time, preview that bitch
So I'ma keep it real with ya, real with ya, real with ya
I'm tryna experience-perience-perience
Gotta take me serious, serious, serious
Oh no, oh, oh

I ain't here to play no games
I'm gonna give it to you just how you want it
You can call me crazy, baby
You just drive me crazy when you touch on it
Got my legs up, hands up, at attention
You make me stand up and switch up on it
Make your head go 'round and 'round
And got me makin' sounds until the morning
