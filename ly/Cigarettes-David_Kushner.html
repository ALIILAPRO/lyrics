		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh-oh

The smell of cigarettes is always a reminder that you're gone
I smell it on your breath every time we sing our songs
Ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh-oh

Now you're gone, out of reach
It's said and done and I can't sleep
Now you're gone, gone from me
It's so dark, I can't see
Lost your light that guided me
Now you're gone, now you're free

I smell cigarettes, so I can feel you in my lungs
I wish I could accept everything we left undone
Ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh-oh

Now you're gone, out of reach
It's said and done and I can't sleep
Now you're gone, gone from me
It's so dark, I can't see
Lost your light that guided me
Now you're gone, now you're free

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
