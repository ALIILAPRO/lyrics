		  (Damn shawty what you doin')

I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin'
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' (Go!)

(Boys)

Love me, love me, it's the way you love me
Touch me, touch me, it's the way you touch me
Fuck me, fuck me, it's the way you fuck me
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
You got me goin' crazy, you got me goin' crazy (ah!)

Ooh ah baby don't stop
You know how I like it daddy when you hit the spot
Ooh ah baby don't stop
I'mma take control when I climb up on top
I can take that shit boy, switch up your position
Yea you do it hard baby, like you on a mission
Now I do it Superman, Love, or addiction
Baby you can you can count down, renew your prescription

Yeah, you can see, just where we wanna be
I got that kinda lovin' that'll keep you off the streets
Yeah, you can see, just where we wanna be
The way you love me the way you love me (Fuck Me)
Yeah, that's me, just where we wanna be
I got that kinda pussy that'll keep you off the streets
Yeah, that's me, just where we wanna be
The way you love me the way you love me

Love me, love me, it's the way you love me
Touch me, touch me, it's the way you touch me
Fuck me, fuck me, it's the way you fuck me
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
You got me goin' crazy, you got me goin' crazy (ah!)

Boy I got that magic raise your wand I'll be your wiz'
I know your Ex Ms wasn't hittin' like this
Don't be gentle don't be rough until I say so
You know I will be grippin' tighter than your bankroll

They say I'm the best (they're the best)
Now you want me in the worst way
Ooh it's so juicy boy I hope you come first place
So good I make ya think my bed is my workplace
You can't overwork me, baby don't hurt me (yeah)

Yeah, it's me, just where we wanna be
I got that kinda lovin' that'll keep you off the streets
Yeah, it's me, just where we wanna be
The way you love me the way you love me (Fuck Me)
Yeah, that's me, just where we wanna be
I got that kinda pussy that'll keep you off the streets
Yeah, that's me, just where we wanna be
The way you love me the way you love me

Love me, love me, it's the way you love me
Touch me, touch me, it's the way you touch me
Fuck me, fuck me, it's the way you fuck me
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
the way you love me baby you got me goin' crazy
You got me goin' crazy, you got me goin' crazy (ow!)

(Rick Ross Verse)

Love me, love me, it's the way you love me
Touch me, touch me, it's the way you touch me
Fuck me, fuck me, it's the way you fuck me

You got me goin' crazy, you got me goin' crazy

Love me, love me, it's the way you love me
Touch me, touch me, it's the way you touch me
Fuck me, fuck me, it's the way you fuck me
