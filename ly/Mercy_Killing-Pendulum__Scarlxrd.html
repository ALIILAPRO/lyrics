		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is running out, time is running out
Turn this ship around, turn this ship around
It's too late to let yourself go
One last chance to make it alone

You don't wanna start no conversation with me, brother
I ain't like no other, I be going harder
Y'all be out of luck and always hating for the drama
All I do is prosper, kill 'em, call it karma
Tryna test my skill, see the shit I built
Drowning you in the field, living how I feel, yeah, yeah
This shit get real, uh, building for the thrill, uh
They all call me crazy 'cause I say just what I feel, yeah, yeah

They say the sun's inside you
Underneath the pain you've given
No wasting time, no virtue
Another day of mercy killing

Time is running out, time is running out
Turn this ship around, turn this ship around
It's too late to let yourself go
One last chance to make it alone

I ain't tryna gas it up, I don't need attention
Right hand gonna make you jaw swing like a pendulum
Fuck you up like fentanyl, fuck it, we offending them
We gon' up the dose and leave them choking on the medicine
Cold to the core I'm never hesitant
Madness on my face when I'm genuine
Way too lit to ever get your messages
Even the score leave you left for dead

They say the sun's inside you
Underneath the pain you've given
No wasting time, no virtue
Another day of mercy killing

Time is running out, time is running out
Turn this ship around, turn this ship around
It's too late to let yourself go
One last chance to make it alone
Time is running out, time is running out
Turn this ship around, turn this ship around
It's too late to let yourself go
One last chance to make it alone
