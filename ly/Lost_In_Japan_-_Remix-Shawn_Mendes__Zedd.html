		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I Can't get you off my mind
(Uh)
(Uh)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind

I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you?
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
(Uh)
(Uh)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise (paradise)
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight) (oh)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
