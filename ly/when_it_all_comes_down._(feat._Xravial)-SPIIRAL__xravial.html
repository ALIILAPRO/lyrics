		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't fall back
Won't stop, to the top until It's all dark
I decline but I'm hostage to the syntax
Can't describe so I wont, I just
Fight back in formats
Written down, dormant
Fuck that I'll scour my soul
To the core and back
Discover nothing but empty shells at the doormat
My eyes they deceive
Didn't clean those boots black
Fucked them up, burnt ash
I don't wanna live in this moment
That I'm feeling enclosed in
Don't wanna waste away
And I been counting my diamonds
Hidden deep in my lining
Until I'm losing them, wait
Now I'm gaining all these intrusions
Extruding through frequencies
In my brain, like cavities
Center gravity, cave in me
Sending me to insanity
Shadows gone while I'm
Standing at the gates of Hel
When it all comes down
Left unsaid, no one around now
What comes next don't wanna frown oh
Reset, recollect cos we're dead in the end
Stuck here in this town
Objecting to anything too loud
Well fuck you and what you said
Kill my debt, gotta let live
Until we drown
(You can't stay here)
(Until we drown)
I wish I'd died
On those hills why can't I cry
So mundane what do I tell
Myself on days when I lay in this well
It's all the same
Weeks go by with silent days
Nothing but death up on the brain
Stuck in my ways, sick of lying to myself
When it all comes down
Left unsaid, no one around now
What comes next don't wanna frown oh
Reset, recollect cos we're dead in the end
Stuck here in this town
Objecting to anything too loud
Well fuck you and what you said
Kill my debt, gotta let live
Until we drown
