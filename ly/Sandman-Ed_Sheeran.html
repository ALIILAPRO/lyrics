		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And mama made the mobile in the sky
And loving you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in a shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the Sandman
But though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the Sandman

Chocolate covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

But come along for the ride
And in a shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the Sandman
But though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the Sandman

Come along for the ride
And in a shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the Sandman
But though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the Sandman

We're hanging out with the Sandman
We're hanging out with the Sandman
We're hanging out with the Sandman
