		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tongue-tied or short of breath, don't even try 
Try a little harder
Something's wrong, you're not naive, you must must be strong
Ooh, baby, try

Hey girl
Move a little closer

You're too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush

Modern medicine falls short of your complaint
Ooh, try a little harder
You're moving in circles, won't you dilate?
Ooh, baby try

Hey girl
Move a little closer

You're too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush

You're too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush
You're too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush-hush, eye to eye
