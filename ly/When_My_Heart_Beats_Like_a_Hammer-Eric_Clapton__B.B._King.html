		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When my heart starts beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
Oh, when
When my heart starts beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears

You know you've only been gone twenty-four hours, baby
Oh, but it seems like
It seems like a million years

Now, if I ever mistreated you, baby
You know I didn't mean no harm

Oh, if I ever mistreated you, baby
God knows, I didn't mean no harm

You know, I'm just a little country boy, baby
And I was raised right down
On the cotton farm

Oh, you give me so much trouble, baby

Baby, that I don't know
What to do

Oh, you give me so much trouble, baby
Baby, I don't know
I don't know what to do

Oh, I ain't got nothing, I ain't got nothing now, baby
Babe, and it's all on
It's all on account of you
