		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could face them
If I could make amends
With all my shadows
I'd bow my head
And welcome them
But I feel it burning
Like when the winter wind
Stops my breathing

Are you really going to love me
When I'm gone
I fear you won't
I fear you don't

And it echoes when I breathe
'Till all you'll see
Is my ghost
Empty vessel, crooked teeth
Wish you could see
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath
In this storm

I am a stranger
I am an alien
Inside a structure
Are you really going to love me
When I'm gone
With all my thoughts
And all my faults
I feel it biting
I feel it break my skin
So uninviting

Are you really going to need me
When I'm gone
I fear you won't
I fear you don't

And it echoes when I breathe
'Till all you see is my ghost
Empty vessel, crooked teeth
Wish you could see
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath
In this storm

I feel it
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me underneath
To this storm
