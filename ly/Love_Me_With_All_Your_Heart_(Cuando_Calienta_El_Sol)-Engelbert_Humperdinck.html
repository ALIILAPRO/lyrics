		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me with all of your heart
That's all I want, love
Love me with all of your heart
Or not at all
Just promise me this
That you'll give me all your kisses
Every winter, every summer
Every fall

When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart
As I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment or an hour
Love me always as you've loved me
From the start
With every beat of your heart

Just promise me this
That you'll give me all your kisses
Every winter, every summer
Every fall

When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart
As I love you
Don't give me your love
For a moment or an hour
Love me always as you've loved me
From the start
With every beat of your heart
