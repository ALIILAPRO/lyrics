		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's when everything went wrong
Now that's when everything went wrong
I lay down to die on the concrete floor (baby)
that's when everything went wrong

Ninety-nine ways that you're willing to die
Break your mama heart now she startin' to cry
Broken beer bottles that are starting to fly
know my time is coming soon
Seven-foot goon lined up in the room
Kickin' up dust in the shadow of doom
Temper start to flare, now they're starting to fume
I know my time is coming soon

That's when everything went wrong (everything went wrong)
that's when everything went wrong (sing it)
I lay down to die on the concrete floor (ooh)
Oh, that's when everything went wrong (woo, yeah, uh)

That's when everything went wrong (everything went wrong)
that's when everything went wrong (everything went wrong)
I'm laying down to die on the concrete floor (I lay down to die)
Now that's when everything went wrong

The devils coming after me
devils coming after me
The devils coming after me

I ran past a neighbor sitting on the sidewalk (hey, hey, hey)
Come on! (no more)
I don't smoke no more (no more, no more)
(Don't come here no more)

That's when everything went wrong 
that's when everything went wrong (everything went wrong)
I lay down to die on the concrete floor (that's when)
Now that's when everything went wrong (everything went wrong)
That's when everything went wrong (everything went wrong)
that's when everything went wrong
I lay down to die on the concrete floor
Now that's when everything went wrong, oh
