		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the mornin' blood ran through my veins
Comatosed, Holy Ghost again and again
And the night, yeah, pullin' up my head
On your back, Cadillac, drinkin' till' I'm dead

Oh, come with me
I'll show you how to live for free
Nobody got a thing on me
Done singing in the midnight street (ooh)
Oh, diamond deeds, a minimal variety
I'll play until my fingers bleed
I'll never lack the quality

Well I get my kicks
Take the money
I'll get my fix
Well I get my kicks
(Oh yeah)
Well I get my kicks
Now and forever, I get my fix
Well I get my kicks
(Oh yeah)

I am the wild one, lightning in my veins
Same again, lazy day, one man hit parade
Silver dollar, black smoke in my eyes
Shattered glass, fallen fast, leave me paralyzed

Oh, come with me
I'll show you how to live for free
Nobody got a thing on me
Done singing in the midnight street (ooh)
Oh, diamond deeds, a minimal variety
I'll play until my fingers bleed
I'll never lack the quality

Well I get my kicks
Take the money
I'll get my fix
Well I get my kicks
(Oh yeah)
Well I get my kicks
Now and forever, I get my fix
Well I get my kicks
(Oh yeah)

Oh, come with me
I'll show you how to live for free
Nobody got a thing on me
Done singing in the midnight street (ooh)
Oh, diamond deeds, a minimal variety
I'll play until my fingers bleed
I'll never lack the quality

Well I get my kicks
Take the money
I'll get my fix
Well I get my kicks
(Oh yeah)
Well I get my kicks
Now and forever, I get my fix
Well I get my kicks
(Oh yeah)
