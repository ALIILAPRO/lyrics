		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you get frustrated
You want too much out of me (too much)
And I know you're hurting lately
Your friends are all against me
And I told you how it goes
Before this got too deep
And you ask why I'm so cold
I'm just not what you need, no

Oh, things are movin' too fast
You should take it slow if you want it to last
I've been before, things are movin' too fast
You should take it slow, I know it from my past
Oh-oh (oh-oh)
Driftin' away
Just simmer down, you gotta let me lead the way
Oh, oh (oh-oh)
Driftin' away
You're my escape, don't make it feel like workin' days

I don't feel the same way, don't feel the same way
You gotta give me time and give me more space
I don't feel the same way, don't feel the same way
Put your focus on yourself, oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh-oh)
You be needin' too much when you callin' 
And it's turnin' me off like (oh, baby)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
You keep wonderin' if I'm still home or I'm with anyone (oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
I like when you get your own and you do it alone like (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I just need to miss you some more, I can't be this involved

Oh, things are movin' too fast
You should take it slow if you want it to last
I've been before, things are movin' too fast
You should take it slow, I know it from my past
Oh-oh (oh-oh)
Driftin' away
Just simmer down, you gotta let me lead the way
Oh, oh (oh-oh)
Driftin' away
You're my escape, don't make it feel like workin' days

(Hey, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Hey, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)
