		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some nights, I don't even sleep
Chest tight with anxiety
Stay up to see the moon leave the sky
Some days, I'm not even me
Same old insecurities
They tell me there's something going wrong inside

I've been there, down that road
When you need me, I'll be here to let you know

It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
And call me whenever you're feeling lonely
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone

Break down 'cause you're breaking through
No sky is forever blue
Things bloom whenever they've seen the rain
Your thoughts lie, but I know the truth (I know the truth)
The best days are ahead of you (ahead of you)
Tomorrow isn't your yesterday

I've been there, down that road
When you need me, I'll be here to let you know

It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
And call me whenever you're feeling lonely
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone

You're not alone, you're not alone
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
You're not alone, you're not alone
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone (pick up the phone)
You're not alone, you're not alone (pick up, pick up the phone)
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone (you're not, you're not alone)
You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone

It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
