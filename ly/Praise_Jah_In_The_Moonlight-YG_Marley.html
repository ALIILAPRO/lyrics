		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say the sun a na shine for all
But in some people world
It never shine at all

These roads of flames are catching a fire, ahh
Showed you I loved you, and you called me a liar
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone
I've been fiendin' for your love so long
We can praise Jah in the moonlight
Baby, if you with me better do right
And I've been gone too long
And I'm hoping that you sing my songs (sing my songs)
I've been on this road for way too long
I've been hoping that we all get along

These roads of flames are catching a fire, ahh
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar
Give Jah the thanks and praises

I've been on my own all along
But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone
And if I'm telling you the feeling is wrong
Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long
And when you're feeling alone
You can call my phone
Is there a better way to go?
Teach them something before they lose their soul
Oh, no, no, no freedom is the road
Oh, no, no, no coming in from the cold
Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold
And guiltiness will catch them in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets (ahh)
Now you're caught up in a funk with the optic, with the vision (ahh)
Trying to control your soul and take control
Oh, no, no, no (ahh)
No, we don't play that game right here to win power (ahh)

Give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises) give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises) I sing, give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises) give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises) give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises) give Jah the thanks and praises

Oh, give Jah all the thanks, the thanks
The thanks, the thanks, the thanks (give Jah thanks and)
The thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks (praises)
Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks and praises (praises)
(Give Jah thanks and)
Give Jah the thanks and praises (praises, praises)
(Give Jah thanks and praises, praises)
(Give Jah thanks and praises, praises)
(Give Him the thanks and the praises)

(Give Him the thanks and the praises)
(Give Him the thanks and the praises)
