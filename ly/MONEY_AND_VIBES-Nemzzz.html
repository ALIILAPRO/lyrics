		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Don't be so quick to walk away)
(Dance with me)

I just need money and vibes
Don't need none of that toxic shit
My social battery gone, I gotta stay out the mix
I'm tryin' to be so rich, I put the l in lit
Call you and say, where you at?
Already know what time it is

What a win, I turned my back, so many man get scarred for life
So when I'm outside, oh no, I don't lack
Ain't gonna lie, I wifed a dime
But I hit them hoes too though, I admit
Me and this bread get along too well
When I put on this fit, I feel like him, ay
You want my attention bad but I ain't the guy that I was before
I heard them stories about you, there's no way I'm hittin' it raw
You don't want to get misled, you wanna feel secure
Can't even lie, you're cool when you wanted to fuck though
I weren't too sure

I just need money and vibes
Don't need none of that toxic shit
My social battery gone, I gotta stay out the mix
I'm tryin' to be so rich, I put the l in lit
Call you and say, where you at?
Already know what time it is

I don't wanna be in the mix, I'd rather grind and stay on the low
Half these men got a lot to post but ain't got nothing to show
Them girl doin' the most but you ain't got do too much
Nah, nah, nah, nah, when I'm on the block, I be feelin' loved
So many people around me but I went through shit alone
Who do you call when I don't pick up the phone?
When I'm away, who's gonna take you home?
She said, man ain't shit but I get paper though

I just need money and vibes
Don't need none of that toxic shit
My social battery gone, I gotta stay out the mix
I'm tryin' to be so rich, I put the l in lit
Call you and say, where you at?
Already know what time it is

I just need money and vibes
Don't need none of that toxic shit
My social battery gone, I gotta stay out the mix
I'm tryin' to be so rich, I put the l in lit
Call you and say, where you at?
Already know what time it is
