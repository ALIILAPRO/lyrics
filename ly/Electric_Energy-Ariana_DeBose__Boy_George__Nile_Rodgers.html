		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking down the street 
Never looking for a fight 
All those bad boys call you 'freak'
Oh, their mother thinks they're right

Screaming for the glitter boys 
All the devils you employ
All the things you fake
All the ways you hate

Give me your electric energy 
Let me feel that fire burning inside of me 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Send it from my fingers to my feet
Aim that light, and shine it down on me, electric energy
Give it to me

Come on, take my hand yeah the temperatures rising 
We're turning up the heat baby, you and me
So hold on to me tight 'cause the world is spinning 
Underneath our feet, oh, oh

Screaming for the glitter boys 
All the devils you employ
All the things you fake 
All the ways you hate

Oh, give me your electric energy
Let me feel that fire burning inside of me 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Send it from my fingers to my feet 
Aim that light, and shine it down on me electric energy 

Give it to me
Give it to me 
Give it to me, bad boy
Give it to me, sad boy 
Give it to me, ghost boy 
Give it to me 
All the devils you employ 

And give me your electric energy 
Let me feel that fire burning inside of me (oh, me)
Oh-oh, send it from my fingers to my feet 
Aim that light, and shine it down on me electric energy
