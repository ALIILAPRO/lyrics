		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Krept, Kone
Rita, I see you
Poison

Look, I can get you hot right now
Said he can but he can't like me
Have you taking off your top right now
Tell them other guys RIP (R..I..P)
Rita and Kones
The English Bey and Hov, no tea and scones
I can tell by your look you're ready
We ain't even got to the chorus but I got you hooked already
You won't know where your head is
And I got a thing for them red lips
So girl you better take time
'Cause this poison ain't nothin' like a snake bite

Nothing ever gets me high like this (this, this)
Nothing ever gets me high like this

I picked my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're goin' straight to my head
And I'm headin' straight for the edge
I picked my poison and it's you
I picked my poison and it's you
(Hah!, poison)

It starts with a "where were you tonight?", yeah
She don't trust men, she can never choose 'em right, yeah
You want a bad boy, well I'm the realest dude alive, yeah
I'm poisonous, you took one sip and I'm killing you inside, yeah
I get why you mad at me, you acted drastically
Actually, casually poisoned you, made you a casualty
Then you came back to me, oh ma you way too attached to me
Poison all in your veins huh, now you're saying you hate us
Telling me that you're leaving me, then the next day we make love, you're addicted

Nothing ever gets me high like this (this, this)
Nothing ever gets me high like this

I picked my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm headin' straight for the edge
I picked my poison and it's you
I picked my poison and it's you

Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind
But it's alright, it's alright

I picked my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're goin' straight to my head
And I'm headin' straight for the edge (I'm headin' straight for the edge)
I picked my poison and it's you
I picked my poison and it's you
