		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're gonna do
What I tell you
And you live under my roof
You gonna follow my rules
But wear this
And wear more that
And that's too much black
And eating makes you fat

I fucking hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom

Don't speak
Unless your spoken too
Because it's really rare
And if so I
Don't need to know you
Turn this on
Still leaning on, yeah

I fucking hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my

If he bullies you
It means he likes you
See I don't really get
This stupid gay shit
You kids do nowadays 
For attention or whatever
It's most life
You want your lines 
Older than they already are
It'd be so much fucking easier
If you just fucked boys
Like a normal goddamn girl would Rachel

Yeah
I fucking hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom
I hate my mom, I hate my mom 
I hate my mom, I hate my mom (I hate my mom)
I hate my mom, I hate my mom (i hate my mom)
I hate my mom 
I hate my mom 
Oh, I hate my mom, I hate my mom, I hate my mom

Oh, man, your mom sucks
