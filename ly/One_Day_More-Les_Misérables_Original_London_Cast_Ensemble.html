		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day more
Another day, another destiny
This never-ending road to Calvary
These men who seem to know my crime
Will surely come a second time
One day more

I did not live until today
How can I live when we are parted?

One day more

Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you, my world has started

One more day all on my own

Will we ever meet again?

One more day with him not caring

I was born to be with you

What a life I might have known

And I swear I will be true

But he never saw me there

One more day before the storm

Do I follow where she goes?

At the barricades of freedom

Shall I join my brothers there?

When our ranks begin to form

Do I stay and do I dare?

Will you take your place with me?
The time is now, the day is here

One day more

One day more to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood (one day more)

Watch 'em run amuck
Catch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all
Here's a little 'dip'
There a little 'touch'
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much

One day to a new beginning

Raise the flag of freedom high

Every man will be a king

Every man will be a king

There's a new world for the winning

There's a new world to be won

Do you hear the people sing?

My place is here, I fight's with you

One day more

I did not live until today (we will join these people's heroes)

We will follow where they go
We will learn their little secrets (how can I live when we are parted?)
I will know the things they know (one day more)

Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

We'll be waiting for this day

Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day

Tomorrow we'll discover
What our God in Heaven has in store
One more dawn
One more day
One day more
