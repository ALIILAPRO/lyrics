		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought it'd only be a moment
Like a night of summer rain
But it's like a landslide of emotion
Everyday 

I've been trying to recover
I put you to the back of my brain
Now I'm just to remember you
In the best way

I
I go from feeling numb to feeling everything at once
And don't know if I
Wanna cry, one of the hardest things I've ever had to learn
Is how to lose someone

First, you don't have the words
It's the kinda flame you don't see 'til it burns
Then it hurts 'til it eats you alive
Changes you forever in the blink of an eye
And it's not something that just fades overnight
It's something that stays for the rest of your life
When you lose somebody you love
When you lose somebody you love

It comes and goes like it's a season
But the clouds are always grey
And late at night when I'm alone with my thoughts
It feels like a Ferrari racing (on and on)

I go from, feeling numb, to feeling everything at once
And don't know if I
Wanna cry, one of the hardest things I've ever had to learn
Is how to lose someone

First, you don't have the words
It's the kinda flame you don't see 'til it burns
Then it hurts 'til it eats you alive
Changes you forever in the blink of an eye
And it's not something that just fades overnight
It's something that stays for the rest of your life
When you lose somebody you love (lose somebody you love)
When you lose somebody you love (goes on and on)

(When you lose somebody) when you lose somebody
(When you lose somebody) when you lose somebody you love
(When you lose somebody) when you lose somebody
The hardest thing I've ever had to learn

First, you don't have the words
It's the kinda flame you don't see 'til it burns
Then it hurts 'til it eats you alive
Changes you forever in the blink of an eye
And it's not something that just fades overnight
It's something that stays for the rest of your life
When you lose somebody you love 
When you lose somebody you love 
When you lose somebody you love 
The hardest thing I've ever had to learn
