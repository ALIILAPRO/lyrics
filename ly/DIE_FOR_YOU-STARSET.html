		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will run alone tonight
Without you by my side
I guess you had a place you had to get to
I know your eyes
I know inside
The walls you hide behind
And I saw the truth inside the real you
Because I know you're lost when you run away
Into the same black holes and black mistakes
Taking all my will just to run alone
When are you coming home?

Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you

And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you

One day the earth will open wide
And I'll follow you inside
Cause the only hell I know is without you
Some day when galaxies collide
We'll be lost on different skies
I will send my rocket ship to find you
Because I know you're lost when you run away
Into the same black holes and black mistakes
Taking all my will just to run alone
Until I bring you home

Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you

And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you

And if the sun grows cold for you along the way
And if the stars don't line to light the way
And when you fall away and crash back down below
I'll search the skies for you and I'll follow
I'll be in your afterglow
And I'll bring you home

Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
I can't see but I'll follow you
Even if I'd die...

And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you
