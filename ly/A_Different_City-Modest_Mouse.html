		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to live in the city with no friends or family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
I will remember to remember to forget you
Forgot me
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV

Through the cracks in the wall
Slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bar
Someone smart said nothing at all
I'm watching TV
I guess that's a solution
They gave me a receipt that said I didn't buy nothing
So rust is a fire
And our blood oxidizes
My eyes roll around all around on the carpet
Oh hit the deck
It's the decal man
standing upside down and talking out of his pants

Through the cracks in the wall
Slow motion for all
Left holding the ball and a part for your car
