		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit

Every kiss is stolen, mmh
Each and every time his back is turned
Our silence is golden
And virtue becomes a blur

'Cause he loves you
He's my bestfriend
But you love me

You're just stuck in-between 
This tri, tri, triangle love, ay
Yeah sugar
Shh

And we just keep dancin' on the edge of a sharpened blade
To "Me and Mrs. Jones" as if it was sweet (sweet)
Color me guilty, my mind's filthy
Keep tradin' my conscience to copulate
But every time feels like fate
Oh, I know you're tired of tip-toeing around the truth, woman
Pillow talk, pillow talk
Every night, here we are
Your phone rings, you take the call (hey)
(Hey, where you at? Tryna get ahold you)
(I'm on my way home)
But I'm a mess when you go

Oh this, tri, tri, triangle love, yeah
Ooh and it's such a façade (did you do it here?)
Tri, tri, triangle love (no) 

(Why not?)
Yeah sugar, ooh-oh (do you wish we did?)
(Just tell me the truth) Yeah
Yes we did it here
Ooh-oh (where?)
There
On this?

Ooh, tri, tri, triangle love (we had our first fuck on this)
Triangle love, baby (did you think of me?)
Ooh and it's such a façade, yeah (when?)
Tri, tri, tri, triangle love (Yeah, baby)

When did you do it here? (Oh no)
Answer the question (ohh)
This evening (whoa, ohh)
Did you cum? (Ohh) 
Why are you doing this? 
'Cause I wanna know (yeah, yeah)
Yes, I came (hey, hey)
How many times?
Twice (hey, yeah)
How?
First he went down on me and then we fucked
Who was where? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was on top and then he fucked me from behind
And that's when you came the second time?
Why is the sex so important?
Because I'm a fucking caveman
Did you touch yourself while he fucked you?
Yes (you wanked for him?)
Sometimes (and he does?)
We do everything that people who have sex do
(You enjoy sucking him off?) Yes
(You like his cock?) I love it
(You like him cumming in your face?) Yes
(What does it taste like?)
It taste like you but sweeter
That's the spirit, thank you
Thank you for your honesty
Now fuck off and die
