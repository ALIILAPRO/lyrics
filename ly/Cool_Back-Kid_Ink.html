		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain (villain, villain, villain)

Uh, I'm just tryna bring cool back
Can't too many motherf***ers pull that off
Lookin' like a million dollar outfit
Nah, n****, that's me, it don't matter what it cost
Make it look good, had it on 'fore you seen it in a look book
Said, you ain't f***in' with a young fresh a** n****
Fashion police should arrest that n****
Okay, okay, kay, kay, okay
I'm with a model a** b**** out in St. Tropez
In some high hot heels, can't stand all day
It's a price for your beauty, baby girl, I pay

I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****
I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****

I'm just tryna bring cool back (cool back)
I'm just tryna bring cool back (cool back)

I walk in like Joker, livin' like Bruce Wayne, can I get a toast to
All of the light skin girls and the mochas
Tryna get it in for the night, no emotion, motion
My way, everythin' I own off the runway
Talkin' 'bout the girls and even the white tape
Yippee ki-yay, hippie eyes, sit behind, need a frames
I'm way too fresh go and let a n**** cook
Money on the cover, n****, I'm that book
Know you went to the store, they ain't had this
All you motherf***ers look like last year, and I

I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****
I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****

I'm just tryna bring cool back (cool back)

I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Wax in a blunt, wax in a denim, rodeo for the linen
And I'm a cool n**** out in Beverly Hills like Dilla
Okay, okay, wavin' this dede all up in your face
See the O.J. Glove, red carpet killer
Rest of you n****s just seat fillers
Say ain't nobody cooler
All you dirty motherf***ers look like Kunta
Walk right by get a wet in the chooch
Steal yo b****, n****, like King Koopa, when I

I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****
I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****
I'm just tryna bring cool back
Fashion police should arrest that n****
I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****
I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that n****
I walk in this b****, like a motherf***in' villain
Fashion police should arrest that
I'm just tryna bring cool back
