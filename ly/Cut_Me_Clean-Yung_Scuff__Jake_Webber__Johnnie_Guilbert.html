		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cobwebs sing from my eyelids

Cobwebs sing from my eyelids
Waiting for the fog to show your skin
Rip me from the ice cold mirror wall
You take me lower than I've ever been before
Cut me clean till I can't think at all
Till I can't think at all

Cut me clean
Till I can't think at all
Cut me clean
So I don't have to anymore

Vultures get the best of me
Searching for the parts that still bleed
Break me down until I'm nothing but the dirt beneath you 
Don't think I could feel much worse
Spit me out like I'm nothing at all
Like I was nothing in the first place

These tiny moving pieces
Just hold me back
I tried to find the answers
And lost track
There's no place I'd rather be
So cut me clean

Cut me clean till I can't think at all
Cut me clean so I don't have to anymore

This conversation ended
When you left me
We tried to find ourselves here
And lost everything
There's no place I'd rather be
So cut me clean
