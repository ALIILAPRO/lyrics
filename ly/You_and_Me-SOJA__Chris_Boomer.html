		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's you and me, it's always been
And how I feel about you, there's no end
But you make me chase you around, all around
And then you need me there when you fall down, down
And when this dance is done,
You and me are still the only one
Well since our time begun
And I'm still with you even when your gone
When this dance is done,
You and me are still the only one
Well since our time begun
And I'm still with you even when your

So I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
Yeah yeah yeah

It's you and me, back again
Don't introduce me to all your new friends
Why do you make me chase you around?
Why do your words make me not make a sound, sound?
And when this dance is done,
You and me are still the only one
Yes since time begun
I'm still with you even when your gone
When this dance is done,
You and me are still the only one
Yes since time begun
I'm still with you even when your

I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
Yeah yeah yea
