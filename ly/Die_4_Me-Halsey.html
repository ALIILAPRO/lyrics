		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah, oh no, oh no
I'm gon' save her tonight
But you lied, savior, but you lied
You lied to me

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah

I hope you think about me every time you touch it
I hope your new girl hears it and she loves it
Devil's front door and I'm banging on the line
If I said I want an answer, I'd be lyin', I'd be lyin', yeah
They say what the devil can't do
He's gonna send a woman to
You seek to hide, you're dead inside, won't see me cry

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah

Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured I should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage, you can hear it in this verse, honey
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold forty million copies of our break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds, so now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets, you thought they'd probably die with me (nope)
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy 'cause I know
Nothing's changed though

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (you'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (you'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (you lied, you lied, you lied)

This is the last time, I'ma do you the honor
I'll give you a headline, I know I shouldn't bother
This is a lesson to take, hold someone tight and they break
Then you say it's a mistake, but you meant it anyway
Now you can't blame me, tell them you made me
Ignore the shit that you did on the daily
Think that you played me, but you can't save me
All of that shit 'bout how I'm fucking crazy

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (you'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (you'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (you lied, you lied, you lied)
