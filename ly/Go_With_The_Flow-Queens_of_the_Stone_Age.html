		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said I'll throw myself away
They're just photos after all
I can't make you hang around
I can't wash you off my skin
Outside the frame, is what we're leaving out
You won't remember anyway 
I can go with the flow (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't say it doesn't matter, matter anymore
I can go with the flow (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Do you believe it in your head?
It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate
Do you believe it in your head?
I can go with the flow (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't say it doesn't matter, matter anymore
I can go with the flow (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Do you believe it in your head?
Do you believe it in your head?
Do you believe it in your head?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
