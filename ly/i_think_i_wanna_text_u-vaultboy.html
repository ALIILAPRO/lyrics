		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I wanna text you
But I don't know what I would say
We didn't leave it on the best note
But I don't wanna be afraid
Remember talking after midnight?
Remember trying to stay awake?
Remember feeling just a little bit less
Alone on the next day?

'Cause I do i, aye
Every second with you running
Circles in my brain i do
I, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made? I do

I think I wanna call you
I wonder if you'd call me back
'Cause I can hear it when you're smiling
And I can feel it when you're mad
Remember talking 'bout our exes?
Remember laughing through the pain?
Remember feeling just a little bit less
Alone on the next day?

'Cause I do i, aye
Every second with you running
Circles in my brain i do
I, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made? I do

Up late for no damn reason
I always end up thinking
You're still the only person that's living
Rent free inside my head
Don't know if I'm still healing
But I wonder what you're feeling
And if you had a reason
Would you wanna see me?

'Cause I would i would

'Cause I do i, aye
Every second with you running
Circles in my brain i do
I, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made? I do

I do, I i do, I

'Cause I do i, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made? I do
