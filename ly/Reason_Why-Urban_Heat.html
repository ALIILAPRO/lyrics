		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come now child, don't be scared.
You need help and they're well-prepared.
Once you walk through the door
you won't feel troubles anymore.
Close your eyes. Keep it still.
Be a good child and take your pills.
Read your charts. Check your temp.
You can tell it's cash well-spent.

Down the halls they wander with eyes rolled white.
You can tell that something's not quite right.
But if you can pay we'll extend your stay
and we'll mask your pain, keep it pumping through your veins.

Keep you there in your bed
We'll keep you warm and we'll keep you fed.
Don't mind them, they'll be fine.
Sign in blood on the dotted line.

Down the old halls they wander with eyes rolled white.
They've come to remind you that you're not alright.
But if you decide that it's not your time
Gonna dry your eyes, gonna find your reason why.

But if I decide that it's not my time
Gonna dry my eyes. Gonna find my reason why.
