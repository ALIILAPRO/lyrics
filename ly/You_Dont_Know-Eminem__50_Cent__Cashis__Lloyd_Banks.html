		  Shady! Yeah
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Now homie I say I run (it run) it 'cause I'm in control
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feelin' aight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
'cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know The Units the game
I got my grimy Shady with me
You front you'll have to get me off your ass
I pay the lawsuit and laugh, it's not a big deal
It's nuttin' but some cash

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Come hizzon what kinda fizz-uckin' position is that

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin" G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know what this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath,
Lloyd Banks, Cashis, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50,
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of Tony Yayo, go
