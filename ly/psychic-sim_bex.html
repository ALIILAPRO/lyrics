		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you want me
I don’t even know
There’s no telling
Lover made of stone
And you wonder why I’m always cold
Don’t fight it
Say you love me back
I know you like it
When I’m on your lap
But your psychic said I’d keep on lying
I swear I’m trying
No I never once saw you cry
Guess you never really cared about you and I
I was meant to be your lover
Tell your new girl I hate her
Do you want me
I don’t even know
There’s no telling
Lover made of stone
And you wonder why I’m always cold
Don’t fight it
Say you love me back
I know you like it
When I’m on your lap
But your psychic said I’d keep on lying
I swear I’m trying
No I never once saw you cry
Guess you never really cared about you and I
I was meant to be your lover
Tell your new girl I hate her
