		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We at the top again, now what?
Heavy lay the crown, but
Count us 
Higher than the mountain
 
And we be up here for the long run
Strap in for a long one
We got everybody on one
 
Now you're coming at the king so you better not miss
And we only get stronger
With everything I carry up on my back, you should paint it up with a target

Why would you dare me to do it again?
Come get your spoiler up ahead

We're taking over, we're taking over
Look at you come at my name, you 'oughta know by now
That we're taking over, we're taking over
Maybe you wonder what you're futures gonna be, but
I got it all locked up

Take a lap, now
Don't be mad, now
Run it back run it back run it back, now
I got bodies lining up, think you're dreaming of greatness?
Send you back home, let you wake up
 
再以后，除了厮杀，这还有其他么？
我左右，键盘噼啪着，时间滴答着 
还不够，你的固执，让我来守候
哪怕太迟，也不想以后
就在这时，放肆的打斗

I got the heart of lion
I know the higher you climbing, the harder you fall
I'm at the top of the mount
Too many bodies to count, I've been through it all
I had to weather the storm to get to level I'm on
That’s how the legend was born
All of my enemies already dead
I'm bored, I'm ready for more
They know I'm ready for war
I told 'em

We're taking over, we're taking over
Look at you come at my name, you 'oughta know by now
That we're taking over, we're taking over
Maybe you wonder what you're futures gonna be, but
I got it all locked up
