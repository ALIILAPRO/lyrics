Got a smart mouth for you dumb-dumbs
He say he tired of these bitches, now he want one
Kitty in your mouth, got your tongue, tongue
You know I'm one of a kind, get that one of one
He say, "I don't play 'bout what's mine"
I'm not a psychic, I can't read your mind
If you with it, don't waste my time
If you with it, don't waste my time

Give me love with it, never done with it
Finger in your face, tellin' you to come get it
It's levels to a bad bitch, you gotta come different
He used to the same so I gotta show him different
Anything you want, you could say and I'm with it
You know I got that yummy-yummy-yummy, come lick it (yeah)
You know you in love with it, never done with it
Finger in your face, tellin' you to come get it (come get it)

I can see the future
I can see the future
And it looks like you and I
And it looks like you and I, oh
I can see the future (oh I, oh I)
I can see the future (oh I, oh I)
And it feels like paradise
And it feels like paradise, oh

Baby, all up on me, ignore 'em, they all spam
Face is picture-perfect, the body is on ten
I don't argue with these bitches, they petty, they all fans
I got drip from next season, exclusive or custom
It's a cold world, I'm smothered in Moncler
What you see in me it's not her and it's not fair
I got money like the boys, I pull up, they all stare
They like, "Who that slim baddie, with all of the long hair?"

He say, "I don't play 'bout what's mine"
I'm not a psychic, I can't read your mind
If you with it, don't waste my time
If you with it, don't waste my time
Give me love with it, never done with it
Finger in your face, tellin' you to come get it
It's levels to a bad bitch, you gotta come different
He used to the same so I gotta show him different

I can see the future
I can see the future
And it looks like you and I
And it looks like you and I, oh
I can see the future (oh I, oh I)
I can see the future (oh I, oh I)
And it feels like paradise
And it feels like paradise, oh

Down
Get ready for love (get ready for love)
Get ready for me (get ready for me)
I've made up my mind (I've made up my mind)
I want you to myself (to myself)
Get ready for love (get ready for love)
Get ready for me (get ready for me)
I'll make you worthwhile (I'll make you worthwhile)

I can see the future (oh I, oh I)
I can see the future (oh I, oh I)
And it looks like you and I
And it looks like you and I, oh (you and I, oh)
(Oh I, oh I)
(Oh I, oh I, oh)
And it feels like paradise
And it feels like paradise
