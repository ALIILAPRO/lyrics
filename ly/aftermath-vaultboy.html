		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I moved away and changed my
Number when I did it
I'd hoped that cuttin' you off
Would make me feel different
I know I'm weaker than I probably seem
I can't lie I blame you for everything

All pins and needles when I
Meet somebody new and I
Get all choked up whenever they
Ask about you and I
Feel so pathetic and I wanna scream
I can't lie I blame you for everything
And I think you know exactly what I mean

You really fucked me up
Screamin' at my mirror like
I'm fuckin' drunk
Question who I am and what I could've done
But you're the one who told me
That you were in love, ohh

You really fucked me up
Close my eyes and think of anything but us
Made me feel like I'm the
One who's not enough
But you're the one who told me
That you were in love, ohh

Try to forget how you could never
Meet me in the middle
How all the pain that you inflicted
Made me feel so little
A little tired of remembering
I can't lie I blame you for everything

You'd change so quick you'd start a fight
Then you'd be saying sorry
Made me look like a fuckin'
Idiot at every party
It made me sick, it's so embarrassing
I can't lie I blame you for everything
And I think you know exactly what I mean

You really fucked me up
Screamin' at my mirror like
I'm fuckin' drunk
Question who I am and what I could've done
But you're the one who told me
That you were in love, ohh

You really fucked me up
Close my eyes and think of anything but us
Made me feel like I'm the
One who's not enough
But you're the one who told me
That you were in love, ohh

You really fucked me up
Screamin' at my mirror like
I'm fuckin' drunk
Question who I am and what I could've done
But you're the one that said
That you were in love, mm
