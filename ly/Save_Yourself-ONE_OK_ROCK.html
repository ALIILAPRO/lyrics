		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
Waves this strong, just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
But you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself

I'm caught up in a current, babe
Heartbreak games, you won't play
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

I will trust my fate
You live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
Waves this strong, just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
But you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself

嵐から逃げる君と対照的 非効率的な
僕はまだ挑み続ける 迷いはない このゲームに
Ah 信じた運命 君は君 じゃ真実は何?って
分かれば苦労しないよ oh 君も僕もでもまだ

Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt (you've never felt)
Waves this strong, just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
But you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt, just save yourself

(Save, save) save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
Waves this strong, just save yourself
上がるも沈むも 詰まるところ自分次第なら
Save yourself
ここにいるくらいなら
Save yourself
