		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye baby
I have to save the world tomorrow
I have to let the sun
Shine in our hearts again
I have to get out and make it
But honey, I'm gonna do it in style

Dreams they grow in silent places
Somewhere deep inside tears
They dry on the smiling faces birds
Got wings to fly

And when the stars explode tonight
We have to kiss this life
Goodbye

Goodbye baby
We have to save the world tomorrow
We have to let the sunshine
In our hearts again (oh yeah)
Goodbye baby
This life is much too short for sorrow
We have to find a way to
End the days we spend
Together I know we can make it
And honey, we're gonna do it in style

I did not mean what I have said, I'm sorry
Before the world is falling into pieces
I change my mind right now
But you just tell me

Fuck you baby
You have to save the world tomorrow
You have to let the sunshine
In your heart again (oh yeah)
Fuck you baby
This life is much too short for sorrow
We have to find a way to end this punishment
You have to admit that maybe
You'd better, you'd better
You'd better bring it to the end
