		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ooooh
You make them wild now
You make them lost now
You're in the zone
ooooh
You make them want you
Oh, how I want you, not to go

But everything comes falling down,
A sillhouette, a smile or frown
And anytime,
All we do is wrong

And I need you, But then what?
And I leave you, But then what?
Once again I stay here corrected
Thinking it's too soon, To have it all
Hard enough to know, What I really want
I start changing with everything around me
I brush it off.

ooooh
I'm walking wires
Over a train crash
I'm holding on
And you, you make me useless
You left me senseless
You lead me on

But please go on, it feels so good
I need this pain, it's understood
That everytime,
All we do is wrong

And I need you, Then what?
And I leave you, Then what?
Everytime I stand here corrected
Thinking it's too soon, To have it all
Hard enough to know, What I really want
I start changing with everything around me

I was here,
Still more than once
It's carved into my mind
I was here,
You were out of reach
Still, somehow scars my memory
Though I'm still here
Though I'm always behind I need to know
Will I do right this time?
Not anyone, seeks a lie.

I brush it of, but then what?
Everytime I stand here corrected
Hope it hits you hard, if it hits at all
So you finally know, what you really want
Maybe then, I'll be gone forever
