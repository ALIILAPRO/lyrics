		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "This world's all about money and pussy
And you need to figure that out
Once you figure that out
You'll be better off in life"

(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Rich nigga shit, I do a lot of
Nigga, we be sippin' out the bottle
I be fresh as hell, rockin' Prada
Hoppin' out the PJ with a model
Swimmin' in a baddie, tryna drown
Every nigga with me got style
I won't put a watch on 'less it cost a hundred thou'
I want all the money and the power

She took me for granted even when I tried to show her the better me
I did a sixty-nine with her friend, I'm prayin' to God she don't tell on me
Used to ride MARTA, now a nigga get head in the Cullinan
Percocet got me floatin' like a butterfly
But I'll sting you like a bumblebee
Saint Laurent the only thing I put on my back
Off-White jeans look like cooked crack
I call the Porsche stomach 'cause the shit snap
Gave my girl a dub, now her butt fat
You might take your women to the Louis store
My bitches be askin', "Where's Chanel at?"
I know you see them crosses, yeah, that's Chrome Hearts
All this water on me, where the whales at?
Stars in the ceilin', I'm where God at
This supercharger whine like the car mad
Savage got a whole lotta hits, dawg
I be droppin' bombs like Baghdad

Rich nigga shit, I do a lot of
Nigga, we be sippin' out the bottle
I be fresh as hell, rockin' Prada
Hoppin' out the PJ with a model
Swimmin' in a baddie, tryna drown
Every nigga with me got style
I won't put a watch on 'less it cost a hundred thou'
I want all the money and the power

Yeah, I've been in the vault with the gold in the back (ayy)
No longer my dawg 'cause you told, you a rat (ayy)
Back-to-back Porsche, me and Savage ridin' 'round
In the town where the pipes hangin' loud out the back (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Five hundred racks what this cost to be exact
And it takes one mil', five hundred thousand racks (yeah)
I ain't even take the Rolls-Royce truck back (yeah)
Bought the new one with the stars and the wheelbase stretched
You can open up the door, but you ain't gotta close it back (woo)
Everything electric, baby, everything a blessin' (it's a blessin')
Keep a ring and a Rollie for your next bitch (yeah)
Niggas riding 'round in Chargers tryna split shit (slatt)
I been ridin' with a cutter, call it stick shift (brr)
When I eat, I got a Goyard handkerchief (yeah)
Keep lil' mama on her knees and her ankle lift (facts)
I can get 'em knocked off without a finger lift

Rich nigga shit, I do a lot of
Nigga, we be sippin' out the bottle
I be fresh as hell, rockin' Prada
Hoppin' out the PJ with a model
Swimmin' in a baddie, tryna drown
Every nigga with me got style
I won't put a watch on 'less it cost a hundred thou'
I want all the money and the power
