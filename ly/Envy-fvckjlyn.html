		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't even know what to say, don't even know what to say
Envy all over your face, envy all over your face
Niggas be sending me hate, niggas be sending me hate
Keep your emotions at bay, keep your emotions at bay
These niggas be getting so jealous, that's why I don't fuck with you peasants
Why is you worried bout me? You better be counting your blessings
I already went through all the shit, my nigga, I learned all my lessons
You shouldn't be angry bout me, my nigga, we share the oppression
Whenever you look in my eyes, my nigga, I see your aggression
You mad but you don't even try, you whine and you bitch and you cry
You really be wasting your time, my nigga, I'm always bout mine
You watch as I put in the effort, the same shit you never apply
Don't even know what to say, don't even know what to say
Envy all over your face, envy all over your face
Niggas be sending me hate, niggas be sending me hate
Keep your emotions at bay, keep your emotions at bay
Don't even know what to say, don't even know what to say
Envy all over your face, envy all over your face
Niggas be sending me hate, niggas be sending me hate
Keep your emotions at bay, keep your emotions at bay
