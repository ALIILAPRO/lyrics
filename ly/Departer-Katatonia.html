		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The blinding white
so far behind, I am
and running over idle ground
This evening I kept my word
Did you? I'm turning around
wait for your sound
(all day)
So far, according to who?
Departer
The journey of our lives
I'm so slow compared to you
Departer
Its the month of July

Brother
In your eyes i was the stronger
so how am I to cover you now?
without shadowing your path?
This time, I watch from the sidelines
you're a ghost in the limelight
face your fears and pierce the night.

I'm so close
If only you knew
Defender
Story of our lives
I'm so rash compared to you (I swear)
Surrender (you know its the truth)
Its the path of our lives
