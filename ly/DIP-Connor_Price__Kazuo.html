		<p>
		  I'm just trying to make it last
I keep going till I crash
Even then I'll hit the gas
I ain't stopping that's a fact
Got some heaters in the stash
Just incase they wanna ask
I can show them where I'm at
Do my verse and then I dip out
I had to stick out
They copying the script now
The fakes are getting sniffed out
They want me on their list now
No thank you imma skip out
I coulda gone the big route
I probably woulda missed out
Ok ok

Pockets so deep its a Trench coat
European bread I got French toast
Know I shouldn't do it I'm obsessed tho
Gotta make that check
Gotta make that list
Gotta make them sweat
Gotta make that kick hit hit hit
Woah
I make 'em dance
Holding my own got aching hands
Got a big list I'm making plans
Seeing me out they shaking hands
Sayin they like what I'm doing
Usually not one do this
But when I saw you I knew it
Just please keep on dropping this music

I need it bad
I'm just trying to make it last
I keep going till I crash
Even then I'll hit the gas
I ain't stopping that's a fact
Got some heaters in the stash
Just incase they wanna ask
I can show them where I'm at
Drop a verse and then I dip out
I had to stick out
They copying the script now
The fakes are getting sniffed out
They want me on their list now
No thank you imma skip out
I coulda gone the big route
I probably woulda missed out
Ok ok

Hi, 俺進化してるyeah
Being nice がめんどくせえ
真似が無理の蹴るぜ
ハイ、ハイ
I've been off my medicine
Consequence? I'm caring less
ほんまのアクマですね、見せるぜ
嫌がってもいいですけど事実だ
俺は日本の未来よ、believe it or not
自ら、任命して, 利己的だが
神のように俺を信じてない君馬鹿
Just got signed, just got paid
I've been quiet, that's 'gon change
Waste no time 失礼
I'll be right in their face
うるさいthey 'gon say
超問題なるぜ
Your 未来消すぜい
その前気をつけ-
KAMI!
ただ一般人じゃない
やりたいことをやり
注目下さい
Aight peace

I just do my verse and then I dip out
I had to stick out
They copying the script now
The fakes are getting sniffed out
They want me on their list now
No thank you imma skip out
I coulda gone the big route
I probably woulda missed out
Ok ok
