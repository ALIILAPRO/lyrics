		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see the world in black and white
No color or life
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might

The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
As us

You see the world in black and white
Nothing too bright
You see no meaning to your life
Yes you try
Yes you try

And all you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
And all you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up

And don't you want to see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given your own silver spoon

Don't you want to see it come down
Enough of throwing your arms around
And saying not a moment too soon

'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Ooh
Yeah I feel low
Oh no
Oh ooh
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Ooh
And I feel low
Oh no
Ooh
