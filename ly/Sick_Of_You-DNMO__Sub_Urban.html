		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been away too long from you and I'm sorry
But I can't control just what you do
And I hope to God that you leave me soon, that you walk away
From this burnin' bridge that you crossed too late
And you just forget that we ever met
But before you forget, there's just something I have to say

I'm sick of your voice, sick of your face
Sick of your choices, sick of your name
Sick of your pleasure, sick of your pain
Sick of your pressure, sick of your game

I wish I never ever met you
Five years of mistakes I'll never undo
I'm not your medicine or your tool
Don't expect me to ever fix you, you, you, you

Every little thing always seems to be about you
Exercise your criticism then get mad when I'm through
You think your traumas don't affect a single person around you
I'm not your therapist or boyfriend, try and get the two confused

I'm best friends with your new boyfriend and I'll tell him every truth
I don't care if he don't like it, I don't care if he tells you
Text me that you fuckin' hate me, well it's 'bout time that you do
Get the fuck up out my life because I'm still in love with

I'm sick of your voice, sick of your face
Sick of your choices, sick of your name
Sick of your pleasure, sick of your pain
Sick of your pressure, sick of your

Sick of your sight, sick of your shape
Sick of your spite, sick of your shade
Sick of your lies, sick of your lazy
So sick of your cries, I'm sick of your crazy

I wish I never ever met you
Five years of mistakes I'll never undo
I'm not your medicine or your tool
Don't expect me to ever fix you
