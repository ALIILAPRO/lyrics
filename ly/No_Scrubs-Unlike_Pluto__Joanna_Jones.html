		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talking 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

So, no, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine
And no, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time

And no, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

But a scrub is checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like glass and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with a deadbeat ass

So, no, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine
And no, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time

And no, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes, son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your mama
Oh yes, son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty but you don't show no love
Oh yes, son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't know

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Trying to holler at me
