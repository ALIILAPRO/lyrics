		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I step outside to be defeated
I'm suspended by a parting thread
A fool awash with wine
Migrated far to be convicted
You sucked me in and you bled me dry
It's a song we need to cry

Even if we try
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection
We'll just live to see the essence die

I'm calculating our criterion
And listen hard for the note of serenity
But I didn't mind the heat
I remember well the contradictions
How you turned your face towards the city lights
And the shadow fell behind

Even if we try
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection
We'll just live to see the essence die

Even if we try (try)
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection

Even if we try
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection
We'll just live to see the essence die
