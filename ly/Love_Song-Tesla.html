		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you think that it's over
That your love has finally reached the end
Any time you call, night or day
I'll be right there for you if you need a friend

It's gonna take a little time
Time is sure to mend your broken heart
Don't you even worry, pretty darlin'
I know you'll find love again
Yeah

Love is all around you
Love is knockin' outside your door
Waitin' for you is this love made just for two
Keep an open heart and you'll find love again, I know

Love is all around you, yeah
Love is knockin' outside your door
Waitin' for you is this love made just for two
Keep an open heart and you'll find love again, I know

Love will find a way
Darlin', love is gonna find a way
Find its way back to you
Love will find a way

So look around, open your eyes
Love is gonna find a way
Love is gonna, love is gonna find a way
Love will find a way

Love's gonna find a way back to you, yeah
I know, I know, I know, I know
