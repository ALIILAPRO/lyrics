		  Hey, you there
Can we take it to the next level, baby, do you dare?
Don't be scared
'Cause if you can say the words, I don't know why I should care

'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up
Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear
That getting half of you just ain't enough

I'm not going to wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)

Hey, get out
I've got nothin' left to give for you give me nothin' now
Read my mouth
If you ever want me back, then your walls need breakin' down

'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up (all you ever do is mess it up)
Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear
getting half of you just ain't enough

I'm not going to wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)

I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything

I'm not going to wait until you're done
'Cause you pretended you don't need anyone
'Cause you see that I'm naked (naked, naked)
Oh, you see that I'm naked (naked, naked)
I'm not going to try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked (naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (I'm standing) (naked, naked)

I'm standing
I'm standing here
