		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop digging in your heart 'cause tonight is on me
Tonight is on me
Stop trying so hard of what you said to me
What you said to me

Get too high when I'm high
So we see eye-to-eye, whoa, oh
Think the higher with the low
And away and away we go

Living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you
Until we die
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you

We got the whole night, 
won't you spend it with me?
Live it with me?
We got our lives, 
but living ain't cheap
Living ain't cheap

Get too high when I'm high
So we see eye-to-eye, whoa, oh
Think the high out with the low
And away and away we go

Living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you
Until we die
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you

Sugar caught a break
The fluid ain't to blame
For the sugar causing pain

We're living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you

I always believed in second chances
I always believed in you
I always believed in second chances
I always believed in you

Living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you
Until we die
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you

Sugar caught a break
The fluid ain't to blame
For the sugar causing pain

We're living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you
