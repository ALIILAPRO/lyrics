		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  DJ Khaled, we the best
Who, we nigga
We the best
The Runners, I represent the ghetto across the world
And you represent the hood, two hands in the sky

I'm so hood (listen)
I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth 
If you get closer to my house 
Then you know what I'm taking 'bout, I'm out the hood
And if you feel me put your hands up (hood) 
My hood niggas can you stand up (I'm so hood)
If you not from here you can walk it out 
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talking 'bout

Everybody wanna motherfuckin' know why, I dress so fly, sit so high
Bitch, I do it for the hood
Bitch ass niggas, I do it ,cause I could
Heavy starch in my jeans please, four X's on my white tee
Living life like a G, that's why these bitch ass niggas wanna fight me
But I ain't gon' play wit 'em
Uh uh, rather let the AK hit 'em
Tough niggas get fucked up
And put on ice for the rest of they life
I'm straight out the hood, bruh
See that's who I do it for
And my low class ghetto ass
Just renewed my ghetto pass

I'm so hood 
I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth 
If you get closer to my house 
Then you know what I'm taking 'bout, I'm out the hood
And if you feel me put your hands up (hood) 
My hood niggas can you stand up (I'm so hood)
If you not from here you can walk it out 
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talking 'bout

Ross
Yeah, .45 off in the ride
Four blunts for me to get high
Feel a bump when I ride by (I'm so hood)
I got 'em hatin' talking like plies
Niggas keep dropping like flies
Snitching ain't going cut no time (I'm so hood)
I murder one of you fuck niggas
Rob you for your last, the north coming mad (I'm so hood)
Mo' money, mo' mayhem, the yayo, the millions I made 'e,m
My Maybach is mine, my city is mine (Boss)

I'm so hood 
I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth 
If you get closer to my house 
Then you know what I'm taking 'bout, I'm out the hood
And if you feel me put your hands up (hood) 
My hood niggas can you stand up (I'm so hood)
If you not from here you can walk it out 
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talking 'bout

Damn my P.O., y'all can tell her I said it
Violate me if she want, gon' have to come catch me
Piss test me all you want, I'ma smoke when I'm ready
Pants hanging off me now, 'cause my pistol heavy (hood)
But I ain't spoke to you yet dog, 'cause I ain't friendly
I drink 'gnac homie, y'all drink Cris'
I like bust it babies, I don't want that boogie bitch
I'll never buy a Phantom, 28's can't fit
They say I'm fed bound, they call me high risk
I'ma full bloodied goon, lames make me sick
You gettin' three or four birds, where I'm from we call you rich
I'd like to thank the hood, homie, you taught me how to rip

I'm so hood 
I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth 
If you get closer to my house 
Then you know what I'm taking 'bout, I'm out the hood
And if you feel me put your hands up (hood) 
My hood niggas can you stand up (I'm so hood)
If you not from here you can walk it out 
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talking 'bout

I'm so hood
Trick Daddy, T-Pain, Rick Ross
Plies
Nigga, we so hood
I'm so hood
We the best
DJ Khaled, Florida stand up
Let's go
Hood
