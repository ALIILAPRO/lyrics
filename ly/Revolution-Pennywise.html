		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As we walk through these troubled times
We struggle through this so called life
Waiting for something to change
And now all hope is gone
The pain has lingered far to long
Black is a sky filled with rage
It's been too Long
We're holding on
We'll right this wrong
And fight on
We will remember today

Let me hear you say wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
One more time in for solutions
Say it again wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
Now's the time for retribution
Say it again, that's right

Yesterday is a memory
Your fading light will set us free
Free from these thoughts of despair
Your end is coming fast
We're moving forward, we won't look back
The message will be loud and clear

It's been too Long
We're holding on
We'll right this wrong
And fight on
We will remember today

Let me hear you say wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
One more time in for solutions
Say it again wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
Now's the time for retribution
Say it again, that's right

We stood tall in the pouring rain
Our bodies broken
Our hearts are brave
One million strong
We cannot fall
It's all for one and one for all

Let me hear you say wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
One more time in for solutions
Say it again wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
Now's the time for retribution
Say it again, that's right

We want a revolution
We're living for today
It's time for resolution
And we will remember

We want a revolution
It's time we had our say
We want a revolution
And we will remember today
