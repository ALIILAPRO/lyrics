		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  RIP my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me
Bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
RIP my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me
Bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm in the AMG
No bitch you better not play with me
This ain't no 50, coming up is he
Copped the 63
Wrapped in satin black just like my soul
No holy ghost in me
Pull up half alive, I feel like dying
What's it gonna be?
I'm rolling with a box of blades
I'm coming for your throat
Slash 'n' dash and then I float
Now you know I want that smoke
On this road I walk alone
Can nobody tell me shit, fuck boy
Got a problem, we can end this quick
If I die I'm gonna hunt up
Pull 'еm underground with me
Six feet deep, I'ma put you therе quickly

They say they miss the old me
Here I go I'm back again
I never left I just been
Planning this destruction to begin
Bitch I'm killing shit, don't survive
Then why so violent, i don't know
Asking stupid fucking questions
You know that's just how it goes

RIP my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me
Bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
What?!
RIP my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me
Bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
You know, you know, you know

You know lately things been
Moving kinda slow, i need excitement
I'm feening for some violence
I see you bitch, now pull up if you want
Pussy boy
You talk like I don't run this shit
Pull out the gun
Now pulling a blade like it's
Dovakhiin in this bitch
You want some problems
Well that's good 'cause I ain't got
Shit left to live for
I'm severing your liver
My presence make you shiver
I'll drown 'em in a
River, watch 'em wither, lovely story
That's the consequences stepping on
My deadly territory
Don't you worry, it'll be swift
My blade like lightning, open a rift
Throw you in it, better repent
Making you bleed, my favorite sin

I I 'm in the AMG
No bitch you better not play with me
This ain't no 50, coming up dizzy
Cop the 63
Wrapped in satin black just like my soul
No holy ghost in me
P-pull up half alive, I feel like dying
What's it gonna be?
I'm rolling with a box of blades
Coming for your throat
Slash 'n' dash and then I fall
Now you know I want that smoke
On this road I walk alone
Can nobody tell me shit, fuck boy
Got a problem, make it end this quick
If I die I'm gonna hunt up
Pull 'em underground with me
Six feet deep, I'ma put you there quickly
