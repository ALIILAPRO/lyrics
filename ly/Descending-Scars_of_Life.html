		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm descending, into you

Feels like, dry hands, tearing me inside out
It all is burning
I can't, breathe anymore, too much to push away
I tell you how you make me feel and you just look away
And I don't know how much more of you that I can take

As it hits me
Wake me before its over
I feel gone
There's nothing I can do

Then you tell me
Its over and walk off
On your own
I'm descending into you

All I hear is, screaming, inside and out
My head, just can't take this
It feels like I don't exsist in this world you've made
The look of disgust on your face whenever I'm near you
Scratch the surface of me is all you'll ever do

Your all I've ever known
To hard to just look away
Put out all I have shown
As I watch you throw it away

I'm descending, into you
