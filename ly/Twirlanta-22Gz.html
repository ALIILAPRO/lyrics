		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gang, gang, gang
I'm the hottest young nigga in the city (skrr, skrr, skrr)
(Rra-rra-rra)
Innocent charges and shit
Gang, gang, gang (skrr-skrr-skrr-skrr-skrr)
Grrrrr, bang-bang-bang (skrr-skrr-skrr-skrr-skrr)

My stepper gon' brush him
If I press the button, too drippy to scuff 'em (drip, drip)
The blick' in the duffle, it came with a muzzle
So why would I tussle? (blicky, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky, why would I tussle?)
Diamonds dancin', flooded
We done turned nothin' to somethin' (we done turned nothin' to somethin')
Niggas be cappin', bluffin'
Tweak, that's a hole in your muffin (that's a hole in your muffin)

What's all the attention? 
Try to run off with the drip and ain't give me a mention
Swish and we bench him, treesh at the drop
We gon' pull up with blickies and drench him (grrrr)
Look at these actors, droppin' the rates
Ain't ever spin Cali (ain't ever spin Cali, pussy)
Spinnin' for rappers
What's the chances that he got his ratchet? (boom-boom-boom)
It's gon' be a disaster, he ain't no stepper
That boy into fashion (pussy)
Stop all that cappin', aim for his matta, cabbage, he in a casket
Gang-gang gon' wack him
He made a diss tryna get a reaction (pussy)
Can't wait to catch him, crash him,
Whole gang spinnin' for the back end (back end)
Want me to be disrespectful?
Pull up to the funeral, spit in that coffin (spit in that coffin)
Put some more shots in his matta
They can't see his face, that's for all that talkin' (pussy)
Headshot, he ain't gon' make it
His brains on the pavement, no witness, no statement
My killers ain't takin' no payment, they said it's for free
Point him out, they gon' off him (gang-gang-gang, pussy)
Gun a nigga down, drop a diss, R.I.p. Lil Pint, pour a four of that drip
All we know, run down, go stiff
Let my ooter, catch him lackin' and they hoppin' out the whip
See all the hate through these Carti's
Kodak fresh home off a pardon
Caught some 'migos, don't sip no Bacardi (no Bacardi)
Rep a R.I.p. Like Biggie and Hardie (Brooklyn)
Ride out, AR with the scope
Pull up with Coach, now he a ghost
Kill a opp, then make a toast
Hit a opp treesh while she drivin' the boat
Stuffin' the stick and the Glizzy (Glizzy)
Clip came see-through just like Bizzy
Hoolies gon' spin 'til he dizzy
Spider-man, hop out the rented
Catch a body then hit up the jeweler (boom, boom, boom)
I got twenty blue tips in the Ruger (gang, gang, gang)
Back then, used to flock out the Uber
All for Scooter, then maneuver
Can't respond to no nigga that gave his whole crew up (hahaha), goofies
Niggas stole all the drip, act like they never knew us
(Niggas stole all my drip, act like they never knew us)
Got a bad yellow bitch that'll line you from Cuba
(Got a bad yellow bitch, treesh, treesh)
She gon' swing me the addy, we pulled up and smoked 'em like hookah
Niggas ain't spinnin' shit, they just type on computers
And my last name "Blick," so I'm picking the tool up (blick, gang-gang-gang, blicky, the blicky)

My stepper gon' brush him
If I press the button, too drippy to scuff 'em (too drippy to scuff 'em)
The blick' in the duffle, it came with a muzzle
So why would I tussle? (So why would I tussle?)
Diamonds dancin', flooded, we done turned nothin' to somethin' (dance, dance)
Niggas be cappin', bluffin', tweak
That's a hole in your muffin (That's a hole in your muffin)
My stepper gon' brush him
If I press the button, too drippy to scuff 'em (too drippy to scuff 'em)
The blick' in the duffle, it came with a muzzle
So why would I tussle? (So why would I tussle?)
Diamonds dancin', flooded, we done turned nothin' to somethin' (dance, dance)
Niggas be cappin', bluffin', tweak, that's a hole in your muffin
