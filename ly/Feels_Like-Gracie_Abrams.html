		<p>
		  Oh
We almost got away, we cut it close
The city's gettin' loud
If I choke, it's only 'cause I'm scared to be alone
Been tryin' to work it out, you should know

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like
Livin' in a movie I've watched and
Funny 'cause I couldn't have called it
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

Oh
The train was cold, we left Connecticut
We stayed a couple hours
Our clothes matched enough to throw me off a bit
Your phone was playin' "Towers" and I

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like
Livin' in a movie I've watched and
Funny 'cause I couldn't have called it
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

And I need you sometimes
We'll be alright
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like
And I miss you some nights
We'll be alright
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like
