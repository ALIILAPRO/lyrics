		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to the silence
Of sleepless nights
The world is yours
Starting from now

Can you feel the heartbeat
From the whole town
Beautiful dreams
Sweat in your mind

Seeking an answer
Somewhere somehow
Freedom is lost
Stuck on the ground

Listen to the demons
Hiding inside

Just lost control
That's how you'll shine

Fever is the thinkers
Everyday weight
Lift it with pride
It means you're alive

I'm on my way to understand,
How can I heal my promised land

But it is
Too dark to see the lighthouse
Fogbound in my mind
Too dark I can't read the lines
Lost in my hands palms

Force yourself to dream wild
Be your own judge
Don't fear the crowd
Pushing you down

Don't forget the free eye
That lives inside
We are all dust
Of distant stars

Of distant stars

I'm on my way to see the world,
And all I am is a bird in the storm
We're on our way to see the world,
And all we are is birds in the storm

And it is
Too dark to see the lighthouse
Fogbound in my mind
Too dark I can't read the lines
Lost in my hands palms

Never lose the free eye
That shines inside
Because we are all the dust
Of distant stars
Yes we are all dust
Of distant stars
