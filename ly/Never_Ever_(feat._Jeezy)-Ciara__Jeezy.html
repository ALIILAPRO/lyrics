		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Throw yo' hands up in the air
If ya know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song right here
If ya know he love ya
Let, let, let, let me see you two-step
If ya know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself
If ya know he love ya

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you (oh-ooh)

I know you think that I just be trippin' on ya
Boy you see, this ain't how I normally be
But I can't help this jealousy
Ooh it's taking over me, ooh I'm fallin' way to deep
Without you by my side I feel like I can't eat or sleep

But I, gotta come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I, gotta let you go, but baby I don't wanna
And I, I gotta see, that you and me, ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you (he will)

Baby, I can't help but fantasize
Wonderin' what it might be like
You and I sound so right
But I'ma let it go tonight
Ain't nothin' coverin' my eyes
Ain't gotta see it more than twice
I get it, I got it
Baby, baby

But I, gotta come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I, gotta let you go, but baby I don't wanna
And I, I gotta see, that you and me, ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you (oh-ooh)
(Girl, you better listen)

(Let's go) alright, alright, alright, okay
I see ya point, I must admit
I grind, I grind, I grind all day
This paper's what I'm tryin' to get
Now normally when I'm paper chasin', I be having tunnel vision
And if it's really like that lady, just turn on ya television (ayy)
And there go Young (and there go Young)
I said there go Young (I said there go Young), you tryin' to get it did (did)
Just know I gets it done (done), she love the I cheat
She love the way I move (I move), I sh- I show up to her
Shows wit 'bout a hunnid goons (yeah)
Its black this, black that
Black card, black flags
I really hope that's money that y'all got up in them black bags (ha ha)
808's & heartbreaks (heartbreaks)
State troopers & interstates (interstates)
Givin' me a bad vibe (ooh-ooh, help me see)
Guess I'm just a bad guy (oh, yeah)

Throw yo' hands up in the air (ayy)
If ya know he love ya (ayy)
Tell the DJ play this song right here (ayy)
If ya know he love ya (ayy)
Let, let, let, let me see you two-step (ayy)
If ya know he love ya (ayy)
It don't matter if you by yourself (ayy)
If ya know he love ya (ayy)

Oh, oh, badadum, dum, dum
If you know he love ya
Let me see you two-step
If you know he love ya
Matter if you by yourself
If you know he love ya (oh)

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you (oh-ooh)
If that boy don't love you by now
