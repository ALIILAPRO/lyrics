		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sky high
You know how it goes
Rolling like the stones ohh
Can't pick up the phone
Psilocybin got my mind 
Got my mind I'm gone 

Sky high
You know how it goes
Rolling like the stones ohh
Can't pick up the phone
Psilocybin got my mind 
Got my mind I'm gone 

Gone

I do shit only if you could imagine
Stick by me and ima make sure you gone have it 
Stick on me if you wanna see the magic 
Left the scene before my youngin made it tragic
Darling we never fight
My money long and u know na it never dies
No hiding, moving right dirty money pay the homage ,40 glock ima put it in her birkin  
See the pain when you looking in my eyes
cll this money we be making from the basement

This shit just feels amazing 
Took it in the basement 
We trying to make it out the basement
New vacations
It's been so vacant 
I been on my own
Call my phone 
Please don't call my phone 
I been zoning 
Seen them lurking trying to close in 
Double up 
We don't give a fuck 
Space X call it Elon Musk 

Sky high
You know how it goes
Rolling like the stones ohh
Can't pick up the phone
Psilocybin got my mind 
Got my mind I'm gone 

Sky high
You know how it goes
Rolling like the stones ohh
Can't pick up the phone
Psilocybin got my mind 
Got my mind I'm gone 

Gone

Sky high
Sky high
Sky high
