		  Oh boy
Who does she think she is?
Yeah who is she?
I don't know what she's doing?
I think its dancing
She thinks she's fly with that
Uh what is that,a Gucci bag?
Oh boy I really don't either
What ever

Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say
I don't even look their way
Look their way look their way
Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say
I don't even look their way
Look their way look their way

Every time I walk in the club
They hating on me cuz they know I look good
My hair done right and my dress real tight
All eyes on me I took the night
Every time I walk in the club
They hating on me cuz they know I look good
My hair done right and my dress real tight
All eyes on me I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
All eyes on me I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
All eyes on me I took the night

Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say
I don't even look their way
Look their way look their way
Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say
I don't even look their way
Look their way look their way

Every time I walk in the club
They hating on me cuz they know I look good
My hair done right and my dress real tight
All eyes on me I took the night
Every time I walk in the club
They hating on me cuz they know I look good
My hair done right and my dress real tight
All eyes on me I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
All eyes on me I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
I took the night
All eyes on me I took the night

One two four three
None of these chicks look better than me
Better then me better than me
None of these chicks look better than me
One two four three
None of these chicks look better than me
Better then me better than me
None of these chicks look better than me
One two four three
None of these chicks look better than me
Better then me better than me
None of these chicks look better than me
One two four three
None of these chicks look better than me
Better then me better than me
None of these chicks look better than me

Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say

Look their way look their way
Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say
I don't even look their way
Look their way look their way
Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say
I don't even look their way
Look their way look their way
Hate hate hate hate hate
I don't care what these chicks say
I don't even look their way
Look their way look their way
