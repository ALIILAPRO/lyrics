		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only one
And I swear I mean it
When I love someone
I'm tied to you
Don't let go
'Cause I know you feel it
And I don't know what I would do
But I know I'm losing you

Only one
And I swear I mean it
When I love someone
I'm tied to you (tied to you)
Don't let go
'Cause I know you feel it
And I don't know what I would do 
(I don't know what I would do)
But I know I'm losing you

I can be resentful
And you always let it slide
I know I'm a handful
Sometimes
Oh, I never meant for it to make you leave
Honestly you might be the best part of me

I've changed my ways
You're all I know
You keep me sane
Keep me afloat
Don't erase everything 
That we've made, stay with it
Boy, you're the

Only one
And I swear I mean it
When I love someone
I'm tied to you (tied to you)
Don't let go
'Cause I know you feel it
And I don't know what I would do 
(I don't know what I would do)
But I know I'm losing you

Only one
And I swear I mean it
When I love someone
I'm tied to you (tied to you)
Don't let go
'Cause I know you feel it
And I don't know what I would do 
(I don't know what I would do)
But I know I'm losing you

(tied to you)
