		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you walk without ease
On these
Streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted twenty years, seven months, and twenty seven days
I never, I'm alone, and I
Never, ever oh, had no one ever

Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude
Oh, alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
And I never, never, oh, had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one never
Never, no
Oh
