		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care if these bitches don't like me
'Cause, like, I'm pretty as fuck

Just the other day, I heard a ho say
Matter of fact, what could a ho say?
With a face like this and a bitch this paid
Shit, what could a ho say?
The bag so expensive, my pussy came with it
Body so nice, they be sayin', "Who did it?"
But everything natural, actual, factual
Prissy in the streets, but I fuck like an animal
All you hoes know who the fuck I am
From your boyfriend down to my Instagram
To all them busted-ass hoes that you ki-ki with
I bet your jaw drop if you ever see me, bitch

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (ah)

Bitch, you do you and whatever that is, I'ma do it better
Hoes must've just seen me and they playin' catch-up
Bitches lookin' like lil' Megans playin' dress-up
Would I ever spin the block on a nigga? Never
I don't even wear an outfit twice, dead 'em
Any bitch got a problem? Probably never met 'em
Tell a hater kiss both cheeks, ciao, bella
But I'm used to the chatter 'cause

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (ah)

All this hate givin' me a pretty face
I eat hate, that's why I ain't got a waist
The more hoes hatin', more money I'ma make
And the more niggas talk, more niggas want a taste
'Cause I'm the most sickenin', hoes so fuckin' sick of me
No matter what they do or say, it ain't no gettin' rid of me
I come in every room and draw attention like a centerpiece
Steppin' for a long time, movin' like a centipede
I ain't scared of shit, man or a bitch
To everybody hatin', y'all could suck this clit
'Cause the hate campaign ain't workin' at all
I ain't Jack or Jill, bitch, I ain't gon' fall

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (ah)
