		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' it won't

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head

Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' it won't

Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I'll feel the power
'Cause I can't make you love me

'Cause I can't make

'Cause I can't make

I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
Love you don't feel
When you're holdin' me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' it won't

Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I'll feel the power
'Cause I can't make

'Cause I can't make
