		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh, do it to the music
Ooh, do it to the music)

No time for criticising
Music's hypnotising
Everybody's temperature's rising
So get down
(If the music makes you move)

When you're movin'
When you're groovin'
When you really got your body
(Do it)
All that shaking
You're not faking
So move your body right down to the ground
(Ooh, do it to the music)

Do your thing baby
(Do your thing for me yeah
Why don't you do it?)
For me-e-e-e-e
Do it, do it, do it
(Do it to the music)
Do it
(If the music makes you move)
Do it, do it, do it
(Do it to the music)
Do it
(If the music makes you groove)

Music takes you higher
Than you may desire
Especially when your soul's on fire
So get down
(If the music makes you move)

When you're movin'
When you're groovin'
When you really got your body
Do it
All that shaking
You're not faking
So move your body right down to the ground
(Ooh, do it to the music)

Do your thing baby
(Do your thing for me yeah
Why don't you do it?)
Do it for me-e-e-e-e
Do it, do it, do it
(Do it to the music)
Do it
(If the music makes you move)
Do it, do it, do it
Do it to the music
Do it
(If the music makes you groove)

Do it to the music
If the music makes you move

Do it to the music
If the music makes you move

Do it
Do it

Get movin'
Get groovin'
Come on everybody
(Do it)

Get movin'
Get groovin'
Come on everybody
(Do it)
With feelin', yeah

Get movin'
Get groovin'
Come on everybody
(Do it)

Get movin'
Get groovin'
Come on everybody
(Do it)

Do it
Do it

Get movin'
Get groovin'
Come on everybody
(Do it)
The music's makin' you move
