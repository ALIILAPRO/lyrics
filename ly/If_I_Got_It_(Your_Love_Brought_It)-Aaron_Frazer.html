		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I got a penny or a dime
Or any peace of mind
If I got it, your love brought it

If I got a house, got a home
Little meat left on my bones
If I got it, baby your love brought it

Before I met you dear, couldn't face my fears
I was insincere, there was a price to pay
Did it every time, stepping out of line
Can't remember why I'd even act that way

Now the music in my soul
The butter on my roll
If I got it, baby your love brought it
If I got the strength to carry on
I'll admit when I was wrong
If I got it, baby your love brought it

Yeah

In my darker days, I was out of phase
I was out of place in my own hometown
Then you came to me, showed me all that I could be
And baby, now I found

You're the moonlight on my bay
The sunshine in my day
If I got it, baby your love brought it
You're the sugar in my tea
You're everything to me
If I got, baby your love brought it, yeah

Hey baby
Ooh, baby

If I got it, baby your love brought it
If I got it, baby your love brought it

Hey baby
Ooh, baby

If I got it, baby your love brought it
