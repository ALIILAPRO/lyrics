		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I'm moving

War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim, raw dogs
You other rappers mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mats off, till I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr Miyagi and Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah?
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long

Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that Joseph is in me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it
On plenty, any foe or
That ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated all of the wrong they did me
You stored in my memory all of the doors that I thought of
Means more from my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis
Bitches been sniffing (Flocko Jodye season, bitch)
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on em
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams

Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini (gotta find my way back home)
We gon' take it up town one time (I've been away too long)
We gon' take em back, show em how me do (gotta find my way back home)
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen (I've been away too long)
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr (gotta find my way back home)
Yasiin Bey (I've been away too long)

Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to Arizona
Steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready Rover
Flacko glowing in that Owens, that's how it's going (gotta find my way back home)
Awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes (I've been away too long)
Travellin' man, moving through places space in time (gotta find my way back home)
In a country called Earth (I've been away too long)

Nah'mean? 
These tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures
Wearing all types of motherfuckin' red and green stripes
Over accessorizing out this motherfucker

We from Harlem, we gave y'all motherfuckers this wave
Grab y'all surfboards, 'cause y'all got your boogie boards right now out this motherfucker
Y'all just gon' keep watching us at the beach shore
With your motherfuckin' khakis rolled up
With your chancletas in your hand
And we just gon' keep surfing on this motherfucker

Straight up
It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini
Yo Rock man, let these motherfuckers know what it is
Out this motherfucker
A$AP, bitch
