		  Shots

Order what you want, put it all on my tab (Tab, t-t-t-ta-a-ab)
(Shots, shots)
Hyp-hyp-hyp- h-h-hypnotic (Ah)
Hyp- hy-hyp-hypnotic (Ah)

H-h-hyp- hy-hyp-hypnotic
(Data, yeah) Hy-hy-pnotic, ah
She not a girly girl, nah, she naughty
It's just me-me-e, a-and you-you-you
I-i-in this club, club, club, club-ha, club-ha
No one matter to me, m-me
Except for us, us-us-us-us

Girl (Uh, uh)
If you ain't notice this my world (Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh)
There's still a lot you gotta lear-e-e-earn-earn
What's mine is hers-ers-ers-ers
Everything I got, I work my ass off, I deserve it
Bitch, I'm not your fuckin' (uh-uh)

She like, "I think I recognize you," bitch, I ain't nobody (uh, uh)
You can keep all the shit that you wearin'
We already know that it's fake
Ain't nobody impressed by the shit that you play
How they hatin' on me, but they look like they lame?
How they acting like that and they don't got a name?

Order what you want, put it all on my tab (Tab, t-t-t-ta-a-ab)
(Shots, shots)
Hyp-hyp-hyp- h-h-hypnotic, ah
Hyp- hy-hyp-hypnotic, ah
Hy-hy-hyp- hy-hyp-hypnotic
(Data, yea) Hy-hy-pnotic, ah
She not a girly girl, nah, she naughty
It's just me-me-e, a-and you-you-you
I-i-in this club, club, club, club-ha, club-ha
No one matter to me, m-me
Except for us, us-us-us-us
