		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay, are you?

Are you tryna get back at me?
(Get back at me, back at me)
You can't let 'em win
All they really wanna do is distract me (distract me)
She like, "who you fooling?" 
"You been out here tryna make a movie" (movie, movie)
She like, "boy, it's a two-way" (two-way)
"Groupies only following what you say" (ay, ay, ay)
It's a sham, 'cause they all know who I am (who I am)
Overlooked, now they think they understand (understand)
Got a benz that'll put 'em in a trance (in a trance)
I can't let my baby slip up out my hands, damn

Yeah
If I let her go 
(Whoa) will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it's something I don't know 
(Whoa) it's something I don't (something I don't, uh)

If I let her go (go)
Will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it's something I don't know 
(Something I don't know, something I don't know)
It's something I don't know (something I don't know)

You know, you the main attraction (ah, ah, ah)
I can't hear nobody else for the love, I need you for direction 
And she like, "who you trying?"
"I ain't the only one that you been eyeing"
I'm like, "whoa must see two sides" (whoa, fine)
She told me she love me, now it's time to choose sides (whoa, fly)
It's a shame, how could I be running game (running game)
After all the trials after everything (everything)
Wedding ring, I could change your last name (last name)
But I can't let 'em get my baby out the paint, aye yeah

If I let her go 
(Whoa) will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it's something I don't know (whoa)
It's something I don't (something I don't, uh)
If I let her go (go)
Will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it's something I don't know 
(Something I don't something I don't)
It's something I don't know (something I don't)

(Yeah)
(Let her go, let her go)
(Let her go, let her go)
(Let her go, let her go)
(Let her go, let her go)

(Whoa, oh)
(Oh)

People will get me like I'm crazy
I just think dick is a distraction, you know?
Like, niggas ain't shit, and bitches ain't shit either
Me, personally, I just, I can't afford distraction
Um, and um, that's what I feel like niggas are
