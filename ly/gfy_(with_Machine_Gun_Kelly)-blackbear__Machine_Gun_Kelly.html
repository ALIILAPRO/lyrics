		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, tell me what you want from me, can we just pretend?
Pretend that you didn't try to fuck all my friends
Wish I could erase you, you're tattooed in my head
There's three little words that I should have said
"Go fuck yourself"

Look at this picture, something ain't right
I'm feelin' shitty, broken inside
You cut me up in four letter lines
Stabbin' my back with this four letter lie

You gave my hoodie to some other guy
I fell for you and I'm payin' the price

Do you do it for clout?
Do you do it for hype?
Do you do it for love?
Do you do it for likes?

I am so high, there's stars in my eyes
I wanna go back, I wanna rewind
You got many faces, Gemini
You're worse than all of my exes combined

I said that last time would be the last time
You always fucking gaslight, you're never all alone
I need to say what's on my mind and then it's goodbye
You left me high and dry and now I gotta go

So, tell me what you want from me, can we just pretend?
Pretend that you didn't try to fuck all my friends
I wish I could erase you, you're tattooed in my head
There's three little words that I should have said
Go fuck yourself

I wish you well, but go to hell
Go fuck yourself
I wish you well, but go to hell
Go fuck yourself (yeah)

Please, take me out of this episode of Euphoria
Back to the Waldorf Astoria
Do not disturb on the door while she screamin'
My D-I-C-K B.I.G. like Notorious

Don't know who that dude on your story is
But you dumb as fuck for ignoring this
And I won't remember recording this
I'm off these red and blue pills, like I'm Morpheus

You started this shit, and I'ma make it end, yeah
Heard that you asking 'bout who I been with
You should ask your friend, damn

I said that last time would be the last time
You always fucking gaslight, you're never all alone
I need to say what's on my mind and then it's goodbye
You left me high and dry and now I gotta go

So, tell me what you want from me, can we just pretend?
Pretend that you didn't try to fuck all my friends (yeah)
I wish I could erase you, you're tattooed in my head
There's three little words that I should have said
"Go fuck yourself" (hahaha)

I wish you well, but go to hell (yeah, ayy, ayy)
Go fuck yourself
I wish you well, but go to hell
Go fuck yourself

(woo hoo, hoo ooh)
(woo hoo, hoo ooh)
