		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late night
TV makes me daydream on this
Lame night
What if all my fears were on display
Right in front of all the world
Under a spotlight
Would they still be on my side?

After all the curtains close
They'll leave their seats and drive on home
They might not know a single word I said
If the highlight reel is on repeat
And only on repeat for me
Could I say I'd do it all again?

And if I'm being honest
Don't know if I can tell you
Whose the harshest critic in the room
It could be the studio audience
But they're just payin' for admission
And I'm the one with everything to lose

Who's the harshest critic in the room?

I'm terrified
Of the way I look when it's through strangers eyes
I wish I had a way to peek inside their minds
But it wouldn't fix the problems I see through mine
It's just how I'm wired

After all the curtains close
They'll leave their seats and drive on home
They might not know a single word I said
If the highlight reel is on repeat
And only on repeat for me
Could I say I'd do it all again?

And if I'm being honest
Don't know if I can tell you
Whose the harshest critic in the room
It could be the studio audience
But they're just payin' for admission
And I'm the one with everything to lose

Who's the harshest critic in the room?

Ooh, oh
Why is being good to myself
For someone else?

Ooh, oh 
Why is being good to myself
For someone else?

If I'm being honest
Don't know if I can tell you
Whose the harshest critic in the room
It could be the studio audience
But they're just payin' for admission
And I'm the one with everything to lose

Who's the harshest critic in the room?
Who's the harshest critic in the room?
Who's the harshest critic in the room?
