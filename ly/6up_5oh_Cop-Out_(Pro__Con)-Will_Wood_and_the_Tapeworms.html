		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Six-up, five-oh, pigs come, I cop n' go
The blotter shows they got me on the rocks like Galapagos
Good luck finding critters creepy as me
They shoulda fried me, I'll give ya PTSD
Vodka shots droppin' down the throat they been stompin' on
Cockin' guns, lockin' up, the quotas all for shock n' awe
Drivin's tirin', and I been hot-wirin'
To make my get away from the jailbreak riot and
Cellmates scrapin' upon the bricks in the basement
Tryin' to escape this probation generation
Too late, crazy fucker's gotta do the time
Committed to the mental ward, committing all the crimes
I'm alive and kickin' till the split ends fray
Maybe plead insane, guilty, but I'm not to blame
I'm a slave to the main vein, sprayin' on the mainframe
Suffering the infrastructure, hoping I can maintain

Oh, how I know, how I go, how I go
csk me a question the answer I know
Yes or no options don't weigh out, and so
I don't ever see the cons and the pros

You bare a striking resemblance
(Some kind of semblance of somethin' I been rememberin')
You appear familiar, dear
(You look just like my bathroom mirror)
Please, policeman, no heel-to-toe
Oh please, let me go
Please, policeman, is it a test?
I won't know till I'm under arrest

The drunk-tank's blood red, junkie's gonna relapse
Some think punk's dead, me, I don't believe that
Rock n' roll gatherin' the moss till I be that
Lichen-coated boulder, make you slip, bust your kneecap
Open on the cmazon, hide the cure for cancer
I'm Lance crmstrong, you're the necromancer
Slash n' burn, crash into the 42nd answer
cll my fellow skeletons adore the army ants here
Flies on my eyeballs, scabs on my elbows
Heaven knows God's sittin' up there like, “Hell no!”
Only one thing comes to those who wait
It's never too late to embrace your fate

May death come swiftly and gently to you
Mayhem, cry mayday, and oncoming doom
Save your convictions, they never will do
What you say's at least 1/6 billionth true

You bare a striking resemblance
(Some kind of semblance of somethin' I been rememberin')
You appear familiar, dear
(You look just like my bathroom mirror)
Please, policeman, no heel-to-toe
Oh please, let me go
Please, policeman, is it a test?
I won't know till I'm under arrest

cm I being detained?
cm I under arrest? (Yes, you are)
Read me my rights, please (No)
I want my phone call
Please policeman, no heel-to-toe
Oh please, let me go
Please policeman, is it a test?
I won't know till I'm a tsa-tsa-tsa-tsa-tsa-tsa-tsa

Please, policeman, no heel-to-toe
Oh please, let me go
Please, policeman, is it a test?
I won't know till I'm under arrest
