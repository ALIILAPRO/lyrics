Let me tell you bout a bad ass bitch
Lil freak like to twerk that shit
The way she move make you wanna spend
Come here baby throw it back again
(Throw is back x 4)
Now let me tell you bout her bad ass friends
Foreign bitches and they all on ten 
They like to touch like to fuck thats it
Told em shut up come on girl let’s get it 
(Throw it back x 4)

Verse

Said her name was Lisa
But I don’t care what her name is can you please her
Get ya visa
First class flights mami come on let me take ya
Make me a believer
Cause right now girl I don’t believe ya
Said she was a singer
But couldn’t hit a note til I put it in her deeper, deeper 
Now lil baby hitting high notes (aye)
While I’m swimming in her back stroke
Gotta her running like a track show
Now come on baby run it back though
Don’t get to sassy
Cause I like a girl who like to fuck is you nasty
Stop acting too fancy
Before I take you out your Jimmy choos in the back seat
