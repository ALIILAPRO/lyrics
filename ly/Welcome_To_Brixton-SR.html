		  Welcome to Brixton
I'm in the party with barbies and drillas (drillas)
The kickback mad on the spinna
I've seen nuff man just run from my niggas (niggas)
How they talk about dingers? They ain't got dingers
They ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My lil nigga riding loose with a chinga
Man you get done with your nigga (and again, and again)

Welcome to Brixton
I'm in the party with barbies and drillas (drillas)
The kickback mad on the spinna
I've seen nuff man just run from my niggas (niggas)
How they talk about dingers? They ain't got dingers
They ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My lil nigga riding loose with a chinga
Man you get done with your nigga (and again, and again)

Brixton bullies, slide with the botty
Man hold two from the woody (woody)
Shy rude gangster, niggas know me
Man leave two in your hoodie (hoodie)
My youngers are nutters, stay with the cutters
Chef up you and ya mudda (mudda)
Free R1, got nicked for a mazza
Now he's doing life in the slammer (slammer)
How many times have I circled the opp block
Again and again, 'til a man got slapped with a hammer (bow bow)
Bro bros a well known rider, he'll hop of a bike
Watch the opps and sing like Mariah (sing)
It was Screw and Shh that slapped that corn when shh got bun
Man ain't a liar, corn come gold like Kiah
Slap man live, I'm a well known striker (striker)
Aim for the chest and higher (higher)
If I missed then watch, best back that bulldog
Everything there get fry up (fry up)
Bad b's come to the rack
I tell the young G's be gentle and line up (line up)
Gwintz got nicked with a whole lip of grub
Free bro, he's a well known rider (rider)

Welcome to Brixton
I'm in the party with barbies and drillas (drillas)
The kickback mad on the spinna
I've seen nuff man just run from my niggas (niggas)
How they talk about dingers? They ain't got dingers
They ain't beat corn out a dinger (no way)
My lil nigga riding loose with a chinga
Man you get done with your nigga (and again, and again)

My lil nigga riding loose with a chinga
Man you get done with your nigga (and again, and again)

I see bare man ducking and diving
I crash this wap, I'm trying to leave heads bleeding
I'm sick and tired of this skeeting
Back this wap, I see bare man breezing (always)
Bro bro circled a shh with a shh
Something got dropped in the evening
Bad b's come down south for the D
If I ain't got a jimmy, I ain't beating (fuck off)
Slap at a man on the backroad
Look to my right, see my ex is preein and screaming
"Aye broski just spin this whip
Let me lean out the ride and crash at his wig"
The opps are pricks
They get touched and talk to the pigs
Man got grabbed for aiming the aim
On the Friday man got slapped in the bin (bin, bin)

Welcome to Brixton
