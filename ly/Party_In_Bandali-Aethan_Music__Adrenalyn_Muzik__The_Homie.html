		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better love somebody
I know a party in Bandali
Baby your body is a summer body
She look the same way when she is thirty

People keep on telling me your love will go away
But I keep on telling them that you are here to stay
Kubanga wansakata
Wantabula
Wankyamula
Wanteka mu kakyupa nenkumatira
Wansakata
Wantabula
Wanteka mu kakyupa nenkumatira
Wansakata
Wantabula
Wanteka mu kakyupa nenkumatira
Wansakata
Wantabula
Wanteka mu kakyupa nenkumatira
Yeah

See I met her on a Friday
She had a couple of friends
A couple of fine things
A couple of tens
Groupie hype
I'm talking about the bougie type
Who don't sit in a car
Unless it's a Benz
And that's ironic
I just hopped off a bodaboda
She said her ex couldn't afford a soda
Being her next
I kindly suggest
I get a couple of drinks I proceed and get the next order
Dutty whine she put it on me
She loves to break it down paka wansi
She say life is short byonna byansi
So we get a cab leave the bar quarter past three
I shot my shot okya gana
Mpa omukwano mpa bana
Yede bangi bakuwana
Nze musaja akusana

People keep on telling me your love will go away (go away)
But I keep on telling them that you are here to stay
Kubanga wa Sakata
Wa tabula 
Wa chamula
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila
Wa Sakata
Wa tabula (eh)
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila
Wa Sakata
Wa tabula (eh)
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila
Wa Sakata
Wa tabula (eh)
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila

Girls these days too slippery
Too slippery for mans trickery
But you got something that's special 
She's half muganda half mu teso
Let's go
On a vacation to another nation 
I got more time than peso
I'm spontaneous we can do kesho
Matter of fact sugar darling let's go
You been running through my mind you should rest ko
Looking like a snack can I taste ko
(You should test ko) 
Indeed I should test ko 
Let's take it to the crib, baby, let's go

People keep on telling me your love will go away 
But I keep on telling them that you are here to stay
Kubanga wa Sakata (ehz)
Wa tabula (oh)
Wa chamula (ehz)
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila (ehz)
Wa Sakata (oh)
Wa tabula (ehz)
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila e
Wa Sakata (oh)
Wa tabula (ehz)
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila
Wa Sakata (oh)
Wa tabula (ehz)
Wa teka mu kachupa nkumatila

You know I gat some money and a vibe
Order what you want and tell the waiter it's alright
Earlier on you said you're leaving early it's a lie
Don't you worry promise you look better in the night
I like drinking
So you put me in a bottle
You friends say you're famous
See you in my photos
All these dream gwe sula mundoto
So fire 
Ndi ku Kyoto
You better love somebody, I know a party in Bandali
Baby your body is a summer body
She look the same way when she is thirty

I hit my notes like a teenager Whitney
You be my best friend even when I'm fifty
Don't you worry about the bag you'll be with me
And the stairs so stressful, you lift me

People keep on telling me your love will go away 
But I keep on telling them that you are here to stay
You better love somebody, I know a party in Bandali
Baby your body is a summer body
She look the same way when she is thirty
