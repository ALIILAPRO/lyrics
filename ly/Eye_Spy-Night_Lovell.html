		  Caress me 
(outby16 or dead on the scene but together for fucking ever)
Finesse me
Ayy
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, uh

I smell like bands, I won't spend it on a bitch (spend it on a bitch)
Drippin' down my hands, all this blood that's on my fist (blood that's on my fist)
I spy a buster, them niggas ain't on shit (them niggas ain't on shit)
I know she want me to kiss her (ayy, ayy)
Tell her to suck my dick (tell her to suck my dick)
I'm angry, bitch
Fuck-niggas walkin' around me, it got me pissed off
You see the look on my face
Fuck it, tonight I might try me the pistol
I don't leave a trace
Hop on a plane and fly to Ibiza 
I promise you this ain't a game (yeah) 
These niggas afraid just from my demeanor (hey, okay)

Fat ass Spanish bitch, wanna caress me
I know who sent your ass, I ain't stupid, you can't finesse me
It's time to leave 'em to burn, nigga (ayy) 
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy) 
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), uh (ayy)
Young stunner, she know how to address me (address)
All of the niggas around me tryna eat
Please, don't check me (what the fuck did you say? Skrrt-skrrt)
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy)
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), uh (ayy)

I spy a buster (I spy), buster, buster 
Focus on my bands
You can't finesse me (I spy) 
That nigga a buster (yeah)

I count all my blessings, I done started from the dirt (the dirt)
All these bitches fell in love, I can't help that I'm a flirt (a flirt)
Break your back, make you squirt (squirt), uh, she leavin' my crib in a hearse
She stuck to my dick, uh, I'm leavin' that bitch with a curse (curse)
I do not trust a bitch, fuck it then toss the bitch, don't kiss the bitch
The end of the life, we live, I'm ready for any apocalypse
Swear to God, this is not a trip (a trip)
You talkin' shit (shit), empty the clip (the clip), uh
I don't got a fuck to give (yeah)
The banks exhaust a quiet profit, ayy (yeah)

Fat ass Spanish bitch, wanna caress me
I know who sent your ass, I ain't stupid, you can't finesse me
It's time to leave 'em to burn, nigga (ayy) 
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy) 
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), uh (ayy)
Young stunner, she know how to address me (address)
All of the niggas around me tryna eat
Please, don't check me (what the fuck did you say? Skrrt-skrrt)
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy)
Burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), burn, nigga (ayy), uh (ayy)
