		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stare down on the defeated
Declare the puritan command by doctrine
Feed off the backs of the dismal

Obey contempt
Give in as confines on this loathing fray
Ripped apart and the aversion will vanish

To be unmasked
Disappear for any hope at redemption
Beset by shame

The scourge left trailing the parasitic
Entire orders eaten away from the inside
Wrung dry and spat out

They would turn in disgust
If there were any will to look back on

Cede to the unyielding
Fed by repulsion granted in shame
Bring an end to the reign of the cursed

The scourge left trailing the parasitic
Entire orders eaten away from the inside
Wrung dry and spat out

No halting the flood's advance
Let it wash over
No halting the flood's advance
See it through to the end
