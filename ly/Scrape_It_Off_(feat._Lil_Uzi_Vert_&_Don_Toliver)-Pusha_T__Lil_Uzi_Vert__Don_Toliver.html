		<p>
		  I just scraped it off the top (cut it)
Got it off the road, off the curb, off the block (cut it)
I was already sold out of work by ten o'clock (cut it)
Too deep in the streets
Felt that pain but it make a lot
Whenever she calls
Do what I gotta do
I'm movin' with a tool (yeah)
I paid it out in full, woah
Yeah, oh

Yeah, uh
Tell me what I gotta do
Pull up in a bucket coupe
One for me and one for you (skrrt)
Yeah, like what the motherfuck's a roof?
Yeah, I'm off the chain don't cut me loose
Yeah, I'm off the chain, I'm off the noose (the noose)
Yeah, get 'em picked off Bentley white like cotton (cotton)
Residential so good, my doors don't gotta lock 'em (yeah)
Wash the dirty money with the Oxi
I miscount 'cause I'm off of Oxy
Yeah, these niggas faker than a damn proxy
Callin' my shooter he said, "Copy"
Get that nigga plucked like a boogie
I like riches, hit like noogies
How the fuck you ain't scared of no nigga
But you scared to put on yo' hoodie?
Man, my buzz light like Woody

I just scraped it off the top (cut it)
Got it off the road, off the curb, off the block (cut it)
I was already sold out of work by ten o'clock (cut it)
Too deep in the streets
Felt that pain but it make a lot
Whenever she calls
Do what I gotta do
I'm movin' with a tool (yeah)
I paid it out in full, woah
Yeah, oh

New toys (new toys)
Convoys (convoys)
Hunnid karats on my neck, my boy
That a hunnid bunny rabbits tryna get, my boy (my boy)
From the cabbage I collect, my boy
Heard you niggas is gorillas, let me check, my boy (my boy)
Say nothin' silly you regret, my boy
'Cause we got banana clips on the TECs, my boy (my boy)
And I can send it in a text, my boy
Thumbs up or the emoji with the flex, my boy (my boy)
Personalize every threat, my boy
Toll-free (toll-free)
That's direct, my boy
And if you need a couple keys I'm the connect, my boy
Off the top

I just scraped it off the top (cut it)
Got it off the road, off the curb, off the block (cut it)
I was already sold out of work by ten o'clock (cut it)
Too deep in the streets
Felt that pain but it make a lot
Whenever she calls
Do what I gotta do
I'm movin' with a tool (yeah)
I paid it out in full, woah
Yeah, oh
