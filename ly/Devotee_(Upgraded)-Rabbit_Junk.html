		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see my thing is to bang
The broken hearted man right out of my head
Forget I am tears on a pillow
Make a last move or make her a widow
But I won't be going down below
Dial the digit's of an evil cell phone
Push past the clones in our comfort zones
To a bottom party of these broken bones

Big lights, bright city
Small minds feeling pretty
Small winner, big sinner
Dead city, pull the trigger

All night long night, night long

She took me round back, showed me her rack
I'm looking for something else but
It ain't for lack
She hiked up her dress and said
"You got it all wrong"
I want to pull the trigger, well
Sing a sad song
God, lord, take me in a troubling hand
She bit her lip and
She's trying to understand
Craziest day she had yesterday
A drone in a suit asking to be blown away
Big lights, bright city
Small minds feeling pretty
Small winner, big sinner
Dead city, pull the trigger

All night long night, night long

Go! Just wake up!

I know of party sickness
But I'm too sick to get well
So it comes to you of an easy sell
If we can be together
Then we'll come down together
Certainty of a devotee

So tell me what the hustle is
I thought I seen it all in this fucked up biz
But cloaked in a Southern drawl
She wanted a story so I told it all
She looked like she heard it a million times
The loving and the cheating wives
She looked down my sight
I think she wouldn't miss
She closed one eye and blew me a kiss
Big lights, bright city
Small minds feeling pretty
Small winner, big sinner
Dead city, pull the trigger

All night long night, night long

I know of party sickness
But I'm too sick to get well
So it comes to you of an easy sell
If we can live together
Then we'll come down together
Certainty of a devotee
