		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's feeding time in the jungle, jungle
The cold streets, yeah, they come alive
Ain't a time to be humble, humble
'Cause only the strong survive

The nights are here
I'm starving just to feel inspired
The fights, no fears
Tonight I won't be denied

Can you feel the hunger, the hunger?
Can you feel the hunger, the hunger?
Never ever satisfied, gotta feed this appetite
Before it pulls me under
(Can you feel the)

I ain't waiting for this, I'm breaking out of my cage
I'm howling, can you hear the sound?
It's the call of the wild, wild
I'm an animal you can't hold down

The nights are here
I'm starving just to feel inspired
The fights, no fears
Tonight I won't be denied

Can you feel the hunger, the hunger?
Can you feel the hunger, the hunger?
Never ever satisfied, gotta feed this appetite
Before it pulls me under

Can you feel the hunger?
The hunger?
Can you feel the hunger?
The hunger?

Can you feel the hunger, the hunger?
Can you feel the hunger, the hunger?
Never ever satisfied, gotta feed this appetite
Before it pulls me under

Can you feel the hunger?
