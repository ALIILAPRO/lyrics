		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crucify what it's like to be normal
Terrified, dig inside, sit me down and tell me

Why do these voices always try to change me?
Sick from the noises
They keep whispering 

Do you wanna leave me here?
We're always in your head, imaginary friends 

Do you wanna leave me here?
With you 'til the end, imaginary friends

Give in to the fire and the fear
The liar in your ear
And you'll never be lonely again

Do you wanna leave me here?
My imaginary friend

Crystalize all the cringe and the sorrow
Live a lie, what a bitter pill to swallow

I'm sick of it all, sick of it all
Sick of it all, sick of it all

Tell me, why do these voices always try to change me?
Sick from the noises
They keep whispering 

Do you wanna leave me here?
We're always in your head, imaginary friends 

Do you wanna leave me here?
With you 'til the end, imaginary friends

Give in to the fire and the fear
The liar in your ear
And you'll never be lonely again

Do you wanna leave me here?
My imaginary friend

Do you wanna leave me here? 
Do you wanna leave me here? 
Do you wanna leave me here? 
My imaginary friend 

This is a real good person (good person)
In a real bad place (I've sinned really bad)
