		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could it be you calling me down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else 
And you're putting this all on me, forgive me

There's a time and a place for all this
This is not the place for all this
Is there a reason why you're saying all this?
And can we talk about it later?
I've gotta right my wrongs
With you is where I belong
You've been down from the go, recognition's what you want
And it's something that I should know

Something that I should know
All the things that you went through 
Girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
Tell me how can I right my wrongs
That's something that I should know
All the things that we've been through
Girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no no

Could it be you calling me down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else
And you're putting this all on me, forgive me

I say you don't need nobody else
Feels like you don't got me 
So you feel like you've been by yourself
I've been feeling kinda down myself
I've been going through it as well
Girl, I guess time will tell
That's the problem, I ain't got any left
There's somethings I can't help
But you would make the time for me
Oh, isn't that something that I should know?

Something that I should know
All the things that you went through 
Girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
Tell me how can I right my wrongs
That's something that I should know
All the things that we've been through
Girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no no

Could it be you calling me down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else
And you're putting this all on me, forgive me
