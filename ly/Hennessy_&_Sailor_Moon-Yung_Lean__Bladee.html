		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through

I be, I be grinding, making money, it's for me and you
I love the way you dancing and your top is see-through
We can go up to the stars, see clouds and fall through
Money in my pocket and you know I want you
I've been busy, got so much work, I can't always be with you
Percocets my system, when I go to sleep I know it's you
When I was in the hospital, I saw you
I know what you feel inside 'cause I feel you
I gotta stay true, my money rain blue
Hennessy and Sailor Moon, I just wanna be with you
I know what your feelings are 'cause I know I feel you
My money rain blue, Hennessy and Sailor Moon

I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you (all I ever see)
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through

She shouldn't have to ask, whatever she wants
I stay up 'til dawn, barbed wire on my arm
They wanna see me fall, they wanna see me fall
I don't care at all, I'm a young rockstar
Livin' in the dark, livin' in the dark
Leandoer the god, we've been goin' hard
Ever since she called, I don't have a heart
I went to the stars
What you want from me? I can get it for you
Get-get-get-get-get it for you
You-you-you don't, you don't want me, do you? (Do you?)
You don't want me, do you? (Do you?)
Know what I'll do to you

I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you (fiending for you)
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true (don't know if it's true)
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you (fiending for you)
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true (don't know if it's true)
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
