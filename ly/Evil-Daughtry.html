		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh God, got a feeling
I've got a feeling
And it's a bad one, yeah
I'm lost in a season
In a season
And it's a mad one

Yeah, oh my God, it's raining
Yeah, old blue sky is grey
Yeah, it's deadly how you do
What you do for love
What you do for love, yeah

Taking me to the dark side of life
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)
Giving me bad vibes inside
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)
Way down below
Only heaven knows
Laying where the demons lie
Taking me to the dark side of life
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)

Oh, the devil got a feeling
Got a feeling
And it's a good one
She got her own rhyme and reason
Got a reason
And it's a cold one

Well, oh my God, it's raining
It's driving me insane
Ain't it deadly how you do
What you do for love
What you do for love, yeah

Taking me to the dark side of life
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)
Giving me bad vibes inside
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)
Way down below
Only heaven knows
Laying where the demons lie
Taking me to the dark side of life
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)

And I fell for your wicked games
That I can't win
So I wear these chains

(So I wear these chains)
(Oh)

You're taking me to the dark side of life
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)
Giving me bad vibes inside
And it's evil (evil)
Evil (evil)
Way down below
Only heaven knows
Laying where the demons lie
You're taking me to the dark side of life
And it's evil (evil)
Evil
