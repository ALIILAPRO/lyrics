(Drop that shit, T-Head)

Yeah (hold up), park the Rolls truck (skrrt)
Why not pull up Lambo' car and pop it with the doors up? (Low)
This shit got colossal, I got models tryna pay me to fuck (hahaha)
Tell her the price done went up (up)
It's gon' cost more than a buck
Know that shit gon' be hot, it got my name on this chronic
Drivin' slow now, but the car go zero to sixty if I punch it
She wake up and munch it
Let me pull yo' hair, take off that bonnet (uh)
Don't catch me speakin' on no M, nigga, you ain't gon' know if I done done it
Or done sent it
I'm celebratin' what I accomplished, I'ma pop it constantly (constantly)
Flew this bad bitch in from London, she like how I'm comin' (bad) 
Dressin' snazzy, talkin' country, got her hooked on phonics (throw)
Call me toxic, but she can't keep me from out her stomach (love this shit)

I got all these hoes requestin' toxic dick (safe)
Fuckin' her for years, she can't post my pic (she can't)
Five deep, ridin' 'round with ten stick (ten stick)
Slide through, come back, hit your bitch (come)
Yeah, I got all these hoes requestin' toxic dick (it's all they want)
Fuckin' her for years, better not post a pic (she better not do it)
Finger itchin', tryna hit somethin' with that switch (frrt-frrt)
Slide through, come back, took your bitch (gone)

Bitch ain't speakin' on the business, keep it low
Snatch a whip, that's a Double-R, Rolls-Royce truck (where?)
In my ear, penthouse, I see the city 
When I'm hittin' that bitch from the back, big dawg (what happened?)
I can be out the country and make a call and get you whacked (what?)
Bitch look up to me like God, I can't wait to kill her throat (bad)
I got mind control on bitches, I don't have to use a remote
These lil' niggas on go (go), they swiss cheese and a rat (rat)
They can't wait to up the score, a hundred rounds, a hundred racks (where)
All I do is break them hundos off and fuck her like I'm broke (broke)
You bet' not cry in this Phantom, bitch, you know where you belong (the streets) 
Buy the average ones some jewelry, I made that bitch the one (where?)
Hoes requestin' for that toxic dick, that's all these bitches want (brrt)

I got all these hoes requestin' toxic dick (safe)
Fuckin' her for years, she can't post my pic (she can't)
Five deep, ridin' 'round with ten stick (ten stick)
Slide through, come back, hit your bitch (come)
Yeah, I got all these hoes requestin' toxic dick (it's all they want)
Fuckin' her for years, better not post a pic (she better not do it)
Finger itchin', tryna hit somethin' with that switch (frrt-frrt)
Slide through, come back, took your bitch (gone)
