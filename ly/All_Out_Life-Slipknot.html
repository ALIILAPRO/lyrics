		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a world, the horizon
It's coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

Give it to 3
I'm going to show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

Old does not mean dead
New does not mean best
No hard feelings
I'm tired of being right
About everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine
Kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses
I challenge you to all out fucking life

Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't want to go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

Give it to 3
I'm going to show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I got to know now, you better tell me

Old does not mean dead
New does not mean best
No hard feelings
I'm tired of being right
About everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine
Kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
"I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever!"

We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind

Old does not mean dead (Hey!)
New does not mean best (Hey!)
No hard feelings
I'm tired of being right
About everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine (Mine!)
Kill does not mean die (Die!)
Pay attention
It's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright

Old does not mean dead (Hey!)
New does not mean best (Hey!)
No hard feelings
I'm tired of being right
About everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine (Mine!)
Kill does not mean die (Die!)
We are not your kind
No excuses
I challenge you to all out fucking life

All-out life
Yeah
I challenge you to all-out fucking life
Yeah
Live!
Live! 
Live! 
Life!
