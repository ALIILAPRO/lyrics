		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting years for this
And you're hearing this
Voice in the back of your head

Fake it
With every moment spent
Make it
Worth every single risk

You're prepared for this
Leave not one regret
Oh, and it whispers again

Take it
Illuminate, ascend
Break it
And build it up again

I stand
Down again
Take my hand

Break break my code remake it
Shape shape what's yours, awaken
Pain pain repeats, embrace it

Listen
None of us may live to see the day it all ends 
It's not enough
When lucid nights forget you
Listen
Do you really want to see the day it all ends
It's not enough
To spark the light inside you

Thinking back on it
Now you're doubting this
Voice in the back of your head

Fake it
With every moment spent
Make this
Worth every single risk

Bleeding nervousness
Far too late to quit
Oh, no it whispers again

Take it
Illuminate, ascend
Break it
And build it up again

I stand
Down again
Take my hand

Break break my code remake it
Shape shape what's yours, awaken
Pain pain repeats, embrace it

Listen
None of us may live to see the day it all ends
It's not enough
When lucid nights forget you
Listen
Do you really want to see the day it all ends
It's not enough
To spark the light inside you

Twilight strangles our good morning
You've been dreaming wide awake
Chasing high anticipations
Man-made stars will light the way

Listen
None of us may live to see the day it all ends
It's not enough
When lucid nights forget you
Listen
Do you really want to see the day it all ends
It's not enough
To spark the light inside you
