		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, what they think about you

Oh, what they think about you
Prepare to leave my body when the time it comes through
Lovin' on you 'til the time it comes through
Why you always hate to break bread?
Think about the way that you would feel if never said
Jokes on you, well, it's time to come through

(Yeah)
Well, if she had to choose me or her mom
I know I wouldn't last long, yeah
No problem with the truth
But when she made me laugh
Doom-doom right to my tomb
I love that it's not hard to be in a place where laughing's easy like
What the fuck is real?
What the fuck is wrong?
I think I can fit with your tone, like

Oh, what they think about you
Prepare to leave my body when the time it comes through
Lovin' on you 'til the time it comes through
Why you always hate to break bread?
Think about the way that you would feel if never said
Jokes on you, well, it's time to come through

Time to come through
Time to come
Time to come through

You know I wanna be
Everything that you need
But I'm startin' to see
You know I wanna be
Above everything
But I'm just not there yet
