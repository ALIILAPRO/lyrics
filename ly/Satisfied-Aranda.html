		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied

If the sun came up tomorrow
And you lived in a perfect place
That just wouldn't be good enough for you
You could have a happy family, money,
And the perfect face
But that wouldn't be good enough for you
Enough for you

And I no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied
On a Sunday morning never moving on

I no I never wanna see you die
But I never wanna see you satisfied
Are you satisfied

Are you satisfied how it came and went
Satisfied when I pay your rent
Will you ever regret all the things you said
Satisfied oh

I crashed and burned a thousand times
Just to be your friend
But you gave me nothing in return
You played on my obsession for ya
Until the bitter end
I can't believe I got what you deserved
What you deserve

I no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied
Are you satisfied

Are you satisfied how it came and went
Satisfied when I pay your rent
Will you ever regret all the things you said
Are you satisfied oh
Are you satisfied in another man's bed
Satisfied you left me all but dead
How dare you ever deny all the things I did
Satisfied ah
Oh

I no I never wanna see you die
But I never wanna see you satisfied...
