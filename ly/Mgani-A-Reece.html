		  Ngijabulile ubuye mngani wami
Haven't seen you in a while
Girl I thought you're better off without me
I ain't gotta stress about it no more

Ngijabulile ubuye mngani wami
Haven't seen you in a while
Girl I thought you're better off without me
I ain't gotta stress about it no more

One time for my shorty she the shit yeah
She stuck around when I was going through some things yeah
And now I'm proud to call her mine and even say it loud
It's going down ziyaphihlika once you in this house
Cause we gon do it all night
Sharing special moments we just celebrating life
I'm looking at the sky everything is alright
We can take it slow
Baby we could do this all right
Stay strong maintain shorty
I know things are not the same shorty
What if kaosane never comes shorty
Fede ke waar yeah we only live once
Girl you gotta take me back cause I won't give up
That's just how it go I ain't playing no games
Love you like I should ain't no damn thing changed
Girl that's just how it go I ain't playing no games
I'ma love you like I should ain't a damn thing changed

Ngijabulile ubuye mngani wami

Ngijabulile ubuye mngani wami

Ke hopola the times I would kick it at your crib my love
Or wave at you inside your mama whip my love
I know that you've always kept it real my love
I can't even see you with another nigga my love
It's just me and you don't get it confused
As long as you can keep it true then I'll do it too
Cause I ain't tryna lose a day-one
Skeem 'til forever le he ba ka re ba e hana

And I'ma ride with you die with you shine with you

That's just how it go I ain't playing no games
Love you like I should ain't no damn thing changed

Ngijabulile ubuye mngani wami
Haven't seen you in a while
Girl I thought you're better off without me
I ain't gotta stress about it no more

I swear a lot of shit been happening
Back when you and I had to split
Now I'm where the action is
In this music industry biz
Mama happy there's groceries inside of the fucking fridge
I think I'm big cause they scream and shout whenever they see the kid
I finally made it I'm finally famous
I'm getting paid they paying homage
I put smiles on they faces when I'm on stage
I'm proud to say this
You told me be patient the time will come
Now I'm on the road city to city they showing love
I just wish that you was with me inside of this H1
I just wish that you was with me inside of this plane girl
I just wish that you was with me
When I was in Cape Town for the first time
Now that you mine re kena hape

Ngijabulile ubuye mngani wami
Haven't seen you in a while
Girl I thought you're better off without me
I ain't gotta stress about it no more

Ngijabulile ubuye mngani wami
Haven't seen you in a while
Girl I thought you're better off without me
I ain't gotta stress about it no more
