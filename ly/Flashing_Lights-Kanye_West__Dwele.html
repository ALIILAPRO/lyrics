		  Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Order the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi ('razzi)
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazi

As I recall, I know you love to show off (off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (far)
What do I know? Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do I know? Flashing (know) lights (lights, lights)

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul, baby
Ay, babe lately you been all on my brain (brain)
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting, though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go, get this difficult (difficult)
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey, Mona Lisa
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

As I recall, I know you love to show off (off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (far)
What do I know? Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do I know? Flashing (know) lights (lights, lights)

As you recall, you know I love to show off (off)
But you never thought that I would take it this far (far)
What do you know? Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do you know? Flashing (know) lights (lights, lights)

Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights, lights)

Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
