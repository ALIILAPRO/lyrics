		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a toke from the smoke
Never standing by the door
Just stretching out pan de floor
That way him don't fall over
No way him gwan fall out pan me
That way him won't fall over
No way him gwan fall out pan me

'Cause he's laid back, not laying back
Laid back, not worried back
Laid back, not thinking back
Laid back, never holding back
My Jamaican guy, my Jamaican guy

When my dread start to sw..
Him no think if it hot nor cold
We just come in a de riva cold
Dat way him don't waste him wata
No way it gwan run out pan him
Dat way him don't waste him wata
No way it gwan run out pan him

'Cause he's laid back, not worried back
Laid back, not thinking back
Laid back, not laying back
Laid back, never holding back
My Jamaican guy, my Jamaican guy
My j.a. guy

Take my life for a drive
Never need to change his tools
Him drive like a stubborn mule
Dat way him naw go plop plop
No way gas gwan bun out pan him
Dat way him naw go plop plop
No way gas gwan bun out pan him

'Cause he's laid back, not thinking back
Laid back, not worried back
Laid back, not laying back
Laid back, never holding back
My Jamaican guy
My j.a. guy
