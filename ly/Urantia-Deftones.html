		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I slipped into the cloak you left
I fiddle around in the ashtray
To find your cigarette pinkish red
I light it and take a drag

I swear
I'm losing it
With all these erased recordings, I'm rearranging parts
You should accept we'll probably remain this way to the end
In steps

Underneath the sheets I find your
Makeup and shoes in a bag laid open
Grab my keys and some money and circle around the lake

I guess
You're losing it
I like to believe that maybe you're a lot like me
Try using this equality, we might need in the air
'Cause there are no more left like you
A picture perfect strange
Imagined in one shape
Unchained

Tempt my spirit within my name
We crawled in the tomb and release some honey
Eighteen hundred million ways striving to make it last
There is no one left like you
A picture perfect strange
Imagined in one shape
Unchained

There are no more thrills I'll need
The desire that we shared
From the channels of our dreams
To the grave
Find you again somewhere, I believe
You'll find me somewhere again, I believe
