		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We strolled through fields all wet with rain
And back along the lane again
They were the sun shine
In the sweet summertime
The way that young lovers do

I kissed you on the left once more
And we said goodbye by the door in the nighttime
Yeah, that's the right time
To feel the way that young lovers do

Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that we were and the
Way that we were meant to be
Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you
And you were for me
And then we danced the night away
And turned to each other, say, 'I love you, I love you'
The way that young lovers do

Do, do, do, do...

Then we sat on our star and dreamed of the way that we were and the way
That we wanted to be
Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way that I was for you
And you were for me
I went on to dance the night away
And turned to each other, say, 'I love you, baby, I love you'
The way that young lovers do, lovers do, lovers do

Do, do, do, do....
