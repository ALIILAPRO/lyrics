		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger
Down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Ooh
This place is the same as it ever was
Ooh
But you don't like it that way

It's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know, you'll always know me
Dorothea (ah-ah)
Dorothea (ah-ah)

Ooh, you're a queen
Selling dreams
Selling make up and magazines
Ooh, from you I'd buy anything

Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer
Skipping the prom
Just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea
They all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul
I met under the bleachers? 
Well

Ooh
I guess I'll never know
Ooh
And you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know, you'll always know me

Dorothea (ah-ah)
Dorothea (ah-ah)

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Dorothea (ah-ah)
