		  Hey
Ooh-ooh

My love, would you walk
For hours, just to talk?
You did it better when you were on my side
Covered in leather, now you are in overdrive, hey

Mmm

Oh, young were we
But I'm sick of sayin', "You made me weak at the knees"
'Cause I was a runner and I could go for miles
Give me a reason

Now I'm in overdrive (put me in overdrive)
Overdrive, ooh (put me in overdrive)
Oh-oh-oh (put me in overdrive)
Over and over

I don't wanna do this again if you're gon' break my heart
I'm tearin' at the seams
Can't believe that it's gotta be this hard
You told me that I was all you could see
But you kept me in the dark

Put me in overdrive (put me in overdrive)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (put me in overdrive)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
