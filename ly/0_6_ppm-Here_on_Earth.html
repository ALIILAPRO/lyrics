		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel this
Piercing poison
Concentrated
And so ominous

I'm not deranged
Just want to find
If this will lead us all
To die?

Filling orders
With blind persistence
Running towards
False existence

It's all arranged
So you don't mind
That it will lead us all
To die...

There's this blindness touching weaker minds
Shattering our hope
There's this sickness driving through the human hearts
Leave your soul to fall apart

We're all estranged
We feel the sore
Soon we'll be gone
And nevermore

We're cought in design to enslave us all
Everything you thought was safe is made to break your soul

Look from above to see it all
Just open your mind and make these painful things be gone

Don't loose your sight to grasp some more
Everything will turn around and won't be like before

Come to my side and see the whole
These terrible things can change if you can stand against it all
