		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm scared, it feels like you don't care
Enlighten me, my dear
Why am I still here? Oh
I don't mean to be complacent with the decisions you made
But why? Oh

In the back of my mind you died
And I didn't even cry
No, not a single tear

And I'm sick of waiting patiently
For someone that won't even arrive
Whoa

In the back of my mind I killed you
And I did not even regret it
I can't believe I said it
But it's true, I hate you
