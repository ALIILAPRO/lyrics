		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flying kites
With boy wonder
Hold tight
To me all summer
Reading my magazines
Dancing in my blue jeans

Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do for everybody to see
Polaroid through your lashes
Only thing that will last is

I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save the light

Fireworks, and night streamers
Baby blue with the day dreamers
Underwater close to me
Hold my breath in my blue jeans

Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do for everybody to see
Polaroid through your lashes
Only thing that will last is

I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save

I wanna live tonight
I wanna save the light
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live, we wanna live
I wanna live tonight
I wanna save the light
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live, we wanna live

Tonight, I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
Tonight, I take a picture of you taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save the light
