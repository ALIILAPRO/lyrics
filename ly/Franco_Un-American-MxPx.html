		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought about the universe
It made me feel small
Never thought about the problems of
This planet at all
Global warming, radioactive sites
Billionaire cons and reproductive rights, no!

Why think of all the bad things
When life is so good?
Why help with an "am" when
There's always a "could"?
Let Drew Brees worry about
The levees breaking free
Outside of Puerto Rico, we're doing fine
You see

I don't want changes, I have no reactions
Your dilemmas are my distractions

That's no way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco, Franco Un-American

I never looked around, never second-guessed
Then I read the YouTube comments
Now I'm always depressed
And now I can't sleep from years of apathy
All because I saw kids in cages on TV

I'm eating avocados to support Vegan Nation
I'm learning only fake news
'cause of Facebookization
I'm watching Joe Rogan like there's
Gonna be a test
I'm listening to Anti-Flag and singing NOFX

I see no interstellar peace 'cause
Of zealous Space Forces
Just fratboy Neo Nazis marching
With their tiki torches
Now I can't believe what the
Dems did with Bernie
The president's laughing 'cause he grabbed
Us by the puss

That's no way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
Where can we go, Franco Un-American

I wanna go east and eat with Japenese again
Or climb the wall and hang
Out with the Mexicans i don't wanna be
Another "I don't-care"-ican
What are we gonna do Franco
Franco Un-American
