		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In another life
I swear I'll find my way to you
In another life
I'll have that last dance saved for you
In another life (In another life)

This cloud over me
Keeps looking down on me
With a frown on it's face
Mistakes have been made

Gone without a trace
Way you left without a say
You meant everything to me
Thought I had eternity

I got lost
Now I'm stranded in the dark
The hardest part of all
Is your not here at all

In another life
I swear I'll find my way to you
In another life
I'll have that last dance saved for you

Your love was like a home
I tore it down to stones
Im the reason for your sadness
The reason for my madness

Carry on without me
Girl you deserve the world
This grief that I caused you
Will always keep me up

I got lost
Now I'm stranded in the dark
The hardest part of all
Is your not here at all

In another life
I swear I'll find my way to you
In another life
I'll have that last dance saved for you

I'm stranded in the dark
The hardest part of all is your not here (In another life)

I'm stranded in the dark
The hardest part of all is your not here (In another life)
