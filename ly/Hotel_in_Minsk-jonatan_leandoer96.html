		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sticks and stones in my body
I close my eyes, I want to leave my body
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes and I'm flying
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes and I'm flying

Right on time, you were right on time
Right on time, you were right on time
Right on time, you were right on time
You're stuck in my brain forever
I try figuring out what he did better
I wanna forget you
I'd kill for your love
I'd die for your love
I'd die

Sticks and stones in my body
I close my eyes, I want to leave my body
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes and I'm flying
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes and I'm flying

Sticks and stones in my body
I close my eyes, I want to leave my body
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes and I'm flying
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes and I'm flying
