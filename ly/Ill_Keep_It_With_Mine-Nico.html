		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You will search, babe, at any cost,
But how long, babe, can you search for what's not lost ?
Everybody will help you,
Some people are very kind.
But if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me,
I'll keep it with mine.

I can't help it if you might think I am odd
If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
But for what you're not.
Everybody will help you,
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me,
I'll keep it with mine.

The train leaves at half past ten
But it'll be back tomorrow same time again.
The conductor, he's weary,
Still stuck on the line.
But if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me,
I'll keep it with mine.
