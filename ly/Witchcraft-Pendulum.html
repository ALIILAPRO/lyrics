		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's in your eyes, a colour fade out
Looks like a new transition

It's starting up and shaking your ground
Turning your head to see a new day calling

Does it feel like a head to lean on?
A snapshot from where you were born
I'm looking for your hand in the rough
You're caught in the wire
Well, I'll lift you out

Leading on the action
Caught in a cellphone's rays
Bleeding on a sofa
Staring at the waistline
He's coming and she knows it
Even though she knows why
Footsteps in the hallway
Girl, you haven't got time

(You gotta get out)
(Go far away)
(You gotta get out)
(Go far away)

Darkness in the bedroom
Maybe she is resting up
Maybe she was out late
Just come back from the club
I can't hear her breathing
Something doesn't seem right
Killer in the hallway
We're living on a set time

(We gotta get out)
(Go far away)
(We gotta get out)
(Go far away)
