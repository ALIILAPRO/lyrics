		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, tap in, lil' nigga
We 'bout to kill all these niggas, bruh
Have these niggas shook
They gon' be shakin' like strippers, nigga
Shot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo

I'm sorry, we strictly gang shit (yeah)
You ain't gang-gang
Look at who you came with (yeah)
You can't gangbang, you be on that lame shit
I like havin' fun
I can't fuck the same chick (yeah)

She gon' suck me like a slurpee
Chew me up like Scooby Snack
She think she too cool for drama when I fuck
I do my dance hold up, hold up, hold up
You can't tell me that I don't do the rap
You don't think I lie to you
But I do everyday (yeah)
Do a nigga bad once I find out where he stay
(yeah) that's a hit and run
And that's on my uncle grave
I'ma fuck your sister and she
Want me 'cause I'm violent
Had her in the room and
She wasn't bein' silent
'Cause this is Baby Keem
Give no sympathy for these hoes
Give her to the crib
I'ma knock her down like free throws
This shit got me hot
She a monster and I know that
She just wanna fuck
But I might just let her blow that (yeah)
I make blood mad
I'ma take his woe out shoppin'
(yeah, yeah) what you want
Baby? You can get it 'cause you poppin'
(yeah)
I might text my ex, I'm all out of options
(yeah, yeah)
Got a list of hoes that I don't trust
You on my top ten (yeah, yeah)

I'm sorry, we strictly gang shit
You ain't gang-gang
Look at who you came with (yeah)
You can't gangbang, you be on that lame shit
(yeah) i like havin' fun
I can't fuck the same chick
