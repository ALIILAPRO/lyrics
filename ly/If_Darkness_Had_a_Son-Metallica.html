		  Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

The beast still shouts for what it's yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiving misbehaving

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

So paint your eyes as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
The nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Return again to where it's darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water

If darkness had a son, here I am
If darkness had a son, here I am
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be
