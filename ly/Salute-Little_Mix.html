		  Ladies all across the world
Listen up, we're looking for recruits
If you with me, lemme see your hands
Stand up and salute
Get your killer heels, sneakers, pumps or lace up your boots
Representing all the women, salute, salute

Ladies all across the world
Listen up, we're looking for recruits
If you with me, lemme see your hands
Stand up and salute
Get your killer heels, sneakers, pumps or lace up your boots
Representing all the women, salute, salute

It's who we are
We don't need no camouflage
It's the female federal
And we're taking off
If you with me, women lemme hear you say

Ladies all across the world
Listen up, we're looking for recruits
If you with me, lemme see your hands
Stand up and salute
Get your killer heels, sneakers, pumps or lace up your boots
Representing all the women, salute, salute

Attention (salute)
Attention (salute)
Attention (huh)
Representing all the women, salute, salute

Sisters we are everywhere
Warriors, your country needs you
If you ready ladies, better keep steady
Ready, aim, shoot it
Don't need ammunition, on a mission
And we'll hit you with the truth
Divas, Queens, we don't need no man, salute

Sisters we are everywhere
Warriors, your country needs you
If you ready ladies, better keep steady
Ready, aim, shoot it
Don't need ammunition. On a mission
And we'll hit you with the truth
Representing all the women, salute, salute!

It's who we are
We don't need no camouflage
It's the female federal
And we're taking off
If you with me, women lemme hear you say

Ladies all across the world
Listen up, we're looking for recruits
If you with me, lemme see your hands
Stand up and salute
Get your killer heels, sneakers, pumps or lace up your boots
Representing all the women, salute, salute

Attention (salute)
Attention (salute)
Attention (huh)
Representing all the women, salute, salute

You think we're just pretty things
You couldn't be more wrong
(We standing strong, we carry on)
Knock us but we keep moving on (we're moving up, yeah)
Can't stop a hurricane, ladies it's time to awake (yeah)

Attention
Attention
Individuals
Originals
Huh
Lemme hear you say

Ladies all across the world
Listen up, we're looking for recruits
If you with me, lemme see your hands
Stand up and salute
Get your killer heels, sneakers, pumps or lace up your boots
Representing all the women, salute, salute

Attention (salute)
Attention (salute)
Attention (huh)
Representing all the women, salute, salute!

(Ladies, the time has come, the war has begun
Let us stand together
And remember, men fight great, but women are greater fighters)

Huh!
Representing all the women, salute, salute
