		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, na, na
One time
Oh, na, na
Two time

I was doing fine, oh living my best life
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Money on my mind
Love only for one night

Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I armed the guards around my heart
You shot them down, down, down, down
I tried so hard to keep you far

But you had to mess with me, when you gave me one, two, three
Oh, na, na
One time, pull me closer
Oh, na, na
Two times, won me over

'Cause you're so na na
Night three I need your love
Why you had to mess me up?
Oh, na, na
One time, pull me closer

Oh, na, na
Two times, won me over
'Cause you're so na na
Night three I need your love
Why you had to mess me up?

Take me far away, let's swim in your ocean
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Players gonna play but this is a motion
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I armed the guards around my heart
You shot them down, down, down, down
I tried so hard to keep you far
But you had to mess with me, when you gave me one, two, three

Oh, na, na
One time, pull me closer
Oh, na, na
Two times, won me over

'Cause you're so na na
Night three I need your love
Why you had to mess me up?
Oh, na, na

One time, pull me closer
Oh, na, na
Two times, won me over
'Cause you're so na na
Night three I need your love

Why'd you had to mess me up?
Why'd you had to mess me up? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why'd you had to mess me up?
Why'd you had to mess me up? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why'd you had to mess me up?
(Oh, na, na)
(One time)
(Oh, na, na)
(Two times)
