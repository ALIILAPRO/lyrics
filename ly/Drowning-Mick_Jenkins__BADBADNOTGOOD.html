		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We gon' need some drugs for the situation
Shout out to my plug, its a lituation
Won't we need the litigation
All we ask is ventilation
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right? 
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't sound right
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't (sound right)

I was high and I was startin' to lose focus
Then I stumbled in the water, I was trippin', I was chokin'
I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe
Started floatin' way out in the open
'Fore I knew it I was driftin' in the middle of the ocean
Saying, I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe
Started whalin', started flailin'
I was splashing, waves crashing all around me
Felt the passion of the water
Saying, I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe

When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right? 
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't sound right
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't sound right

Dial tone on my hotline, it don't bling much
Sing songs like Tubman
Young Stephen Morris, I ain't seen much
Just a couple motherfuckers tryna rape the culture
Tell the vultures I don't need lunch
It's like morse code
Gotta be in touch to communicate it to the people
Love heals all
Best get your immunization, that THC
So we smoking in here like we fumigating
For the fuckboys too much truth in me
I don't trust niggas
I ain't preaching at you
I don't touch boys
Brought the baggage with me
Like a bus boy I don't need tips
You could see mines
Rap Genius, you could read mines
In between lines
Yeah they act genius but the way society is set up
Almost like they read minds
You heard Alchemy, boy I'm Magneto
They can't read mines
Niggas bark loud
Talkin' revolution, when the waves come they turn feline
I been turnin' tricks
In the coldest part of the deepest water like a sealion, you could see why

We gon' need some drugs for the situation
Shout out to my plug, its a lituation
Won't we need the litigation
All we ask is ventilation
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right? 
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait one second, that don't sound right

When the real, hold you down, you supposed to drown
When the real, oh hold you down, you supposed to drown
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown
I can't breathe I can't breathe no no no no no no no no no no no no aw!
I was high and I was startin' to lose focus
Then I stumbled in the water, I was trippin', I was chokin'
Saying, I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe (I can't breathe with this muhfuckin' flag round my neck)
Started floatin' way out in the open
'Fore I knew it I was driftin' in the middle of the ocean
Saying, I can't breathe (I can't breathe with this muhfuckin' flag round my neck)
Yeah, I can't breathe
Started whalin', started flailin'
I was splashing, waves crashing all around me
Felt the passion of the water
Saying, I can't breathe (I can't, I can't breathe with this muhfuckin' flag round my neck)
Yeah, I can't breathe

We gon' need some drugs for the situation
Shout out to my plug, its a lituation
Won't we need the litigation
All we ask is ventilation
We gon' need some drugs for the situation
Shout out to my plug, its a lituation
Won't we need the litigation
All we ask is ventilation
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
