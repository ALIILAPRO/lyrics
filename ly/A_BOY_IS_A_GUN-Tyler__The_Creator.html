		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, don't shoot me down (yeah)
No, don't shoot me down (okay)
No, don't shoot me down

You so motherfuckin' dangerous (you started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (a boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
We show 'em no respect

(You started with a mere hello) When the time's right, yeah
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (a boy is a gun)
(Turn me up a little bit)
No, don't shoot me down

Take your hoodie off, why you hide your face from me?
Make your fuckin' mind up, I am sick of waitin' patiently
How come you the best to me? I know you the worst for me
Boy, you sweet as sugar, diabetic to the first degree
My spidey sensies, got me on the fencies
Whole squad in Ginza, travel bag by Balenci'
Big dawg hittin' big wheelies on the six speed

No, don't shoot me down
You so motherfuckin' dangerous (you started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (a boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
They showin' no respect

(You started with a mere hello) When the time's right, yeah
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (I said a boy is a gun)
(Look) No, don't shoot me down

Oh, you passive-aggressive? (You started with a mere hello)
Oh, you fakin' you're mad?
Oh, you wanna go home? Cool, you better call you a cab
I ain't takin' you home, yeah, I'm brushin' you off
'Cause this parka is Comme, you're my favorite gar√ßon
Don't leave, stay right here, yeah, I want you right near (you started with a mere hello)
You invited me to breakfast, why the fuck your ex here?
Well, let's see if you 'round the God around this time next year

No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down (fucked up)
No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down

You so motherfuckin' dangerous (you started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (a boy is a gun)
That's why I start to think it's lame as fuck
(Well, I'm here for you)

(You started with a mere hello) When the time's right
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (a boy is a gun)
No, don't shoot me down

(You started with a mere hello) you're a gun 'cause
I like you on my side 
At all times
Keep me safe (No, don't shoot me down)
Wait, wait, depending on, you know (all the time)
You could be dangerous to me (time, time)
Or anyone else

Look, they be bringin' us up (you started with a mere hello)
Yeah, like now and again
Give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout, I see you as a ten
I'ma leave it at that, I'ma leave us as friends
'Cause the irony is I don't wanna see you again

Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I ain't gon' repeat myself, but stay the fuck away from me

(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
No, don't shoot me down
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
