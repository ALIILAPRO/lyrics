		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sail away, my little sister
Sail away to the other side

There's a light and a darkened road
There's a night and a fading hope
There was a dream that once was mine
But now it seems it has passed with time

Sail away, my little sister
Sail away to the other side
Sail away, my little sister
Sail away far into the night
Where time seems much better
Than this void called life

There's a voice inside my head
There's a hope, now long since dead
It's all a wonder, will I abide?
I hear you calling from the other side
I hear you calling from the other side

Sail away, my little sister
Sail away to the other side
Sail away, my little sister
Sail away far into the night
Where times seems much better
Than this void called life

I hear you calling from the other side

Sail away, my little sister
Sail away to the other side
Sail away, my little sister
Sail away far into the night
Where time seems much better
Than this void called life
