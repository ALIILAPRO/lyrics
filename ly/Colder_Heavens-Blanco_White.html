		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In every corridor that shifted the maze
No single part of you was ever the same
Now we're so tired by the things we have seen
cll we've forgotten only visits in dreams
How I misunderstood
Here I stand undressed
Here I confess my doubt
Did you know that I would?
From this fractured lens
We're unveiled again and again

Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost
Just hiding it is never enough
Now I find in every mirror a ghost
Only once I saw the killer
Once I saw the killer up close

Heaven's over now
I know it's gone, I know it's over now
If colder heavens come, carry me further down
Where our madness rests
Where I'll have less to doubt all I misunderstood
My abandoned friend
Our parade has already left

Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost
Just hiding it is never enough
Now I find in every mirror a ghost
Only once I saw the killer
Once I saw the killer up close

Heaven's over now, gone away
