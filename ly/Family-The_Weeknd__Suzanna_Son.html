		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Arms like the branches of a poplar tree
Eyes like the ocean or the great big blue sea
Love just like mother's, a price, it's not free
Ooh, ooh-ooh-hoo
Voice like my father's, when he screams, the house shakes
Dreams like my brother's, oh, we pray for his sake
Hopes just like my mother's, oh, they last 'til her wake
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

That's my family
Oh, we don't like each other very much
Oh, I'm okay with that
But it breaks my mother's heart
Ah-ah, ooh-ooh, ah-ooh
That's my family

When I'm alone, that's when I feel the safest
Don't like being touched
Please, don't give me a hug

That's my family (that's my family)
You're my family (you're my family)
I found my family (I found my family)
This is my family 

That's my family
