Bitch
E-S, E-S, ESPN
They didn't like my rap style (nah)
Now they want features (nah)
I turned all my doubters, into my believers (Sheck Wes)
Arguin' with my damn ma (fuck)
Fightin' with my teachers (bitch)
Skip my game for the fashion show (for the show)
One of my best decisions (facts)
Backwood addiction (I got it)
I got a Backwood addiction
Ain't the THC, that's facts, non-fiction
Or is this shit fiction?
But remember in school, I ain't pay attention
In school, I ain't pay attention

I watched E-S, E-S, ESPN
W-E-S, E-S, we fuck with him (yeah)
W-E-S, E-S, we don't need top ten (yeah, bitch)
W-E-S, E-S, we fuck with him
W-E-S, E-S, ESPN
W-E-S, E-S

Goin' through a damn phase (through a phase)
Goin' through a damn change (cosmos)
Goin' through my damn passport (passport)
I been goin' through these damn pages
Smokin 'on matter
Hoes sniffing on powder (sniff, sniff)
The money bring the power
But the money bring you problems, so when
You niggas can stuck, don't call
Please don't call, don't call Sheck, Wes no more
'Cause I ain't pickin' up my mothafuckin' phone (bitch)

Do not disturb, put it on the phone
I ain't pickin' up your calls no more
Please do not call my phone
If you ain't talkin' 'bout the motherfuckin' dough
Do not disturb, put it on my phone
I ain't pickin' up your calls no more
Please do not call my phone
If you ain't talkin' 'bout the motherfuckin' dough

E-S, E-S, ESPN
W-E-S, E-S, we fuck with him
W-E-S, E-S, ESPN
W-E-S, E-S, we fuck with him
W-E-S, E-S, ESPN
W-E-S, E-S (bitch)

They just want the turnt shit (turn up, bitch)
They don't like the sad music (nigga, burn up)
Sheck Wes been in a sad state (a sad state)
You ain't never had to do shit, huh? (never)
You ain't never had to (fuck) go through shit (bitch)
You ain't ever have to (fuck) go and shoot shit (never)
You ain't never had to (what?) go and shoot shit
'Cause you ain't never had to go through shit
You ain't, you ain't never had to

That's, that's why do not disturb, put it on the phone
I ain't pickin' up your calls no more
Please do not call my phone
If you ain't talking about the motherfuckin' dough (bitch)

ESPN, we fuck with him
W-E-S, E-S, ESPN (Kyrie)
W-E-S, E-S, we don't need top ten (yeah, bitch)
Do not disturb, put it on my phone
I ain't pickin' up your calls no more
(Kyrie, K-K-Kyrie)
No more, I ain't pickin' up your calls no more, bitch!
(Kyrie, K-K-Kyrie)
No more, I ain't pickin' up your calls no more (bitch)
(Kyrie, K-K-Kyrie, I've been ballin' like)
(Kyrie, K-K-Kyrie)

(Kyrie, K-K-Kyrie)
