		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Did you see NAV?
He was off the Perkys he was leaning
They tried to take his chain, he's surrounded by them demons
He had a bunch of bad bitches lining up to meet him
They reselling the tickets a thousand dollars just to see him
I wanna dress like him, I wish I could be him
Had to snap him on the road, his Bentley coupe speeding
We just seen NAV in Neiman Marcus blowing cash
Did you see NAV? He just slapped that bitch right on the ass

He used to be down but now all he do is laugh
We just seen him shopping and taking pictures with his fans
I'm heated my bitch liked another pictures on his 'Gram
Saw NAV in the club, in the booth, sleeping off the xan
Just heard his new mixtape, thought that shit was wack
But every time I got out, the DJ keep bringing it back
I tried to DM him and he ain't never hit me back
So I left a comment say you're ugly and your music trash
Is he really from the Rex?
Is he really from the trap?
Is he really living all the things that he say in his track
I just saw Nav, in a 'no smoking zone' rolling up dank
I just saw Nav and Bucks in the Ghost pouring up drank

Did you see NAV? 
He was off the Perkys he was leaning
They tried to take his chain, he's surrounded by them demons
He had a bunch of bad bitches lining up to meet him
They reselling the tickets a thousand dollars just to see him
I wanna dress like him, I wish I could be him
Had to snap him on the road, his Bentley coupe speeding
We just seen NAV in Neiman Marcus blowing cash
Did you see NAV? He just slapped that bitch right on the ass

Feel like the world revolve around me
Industry wouldn't be shit without me
Everybody wanna talk about me
They don't wanna do a song without me
Get out of my face, yeah
You ain't got taste
Mastermind Bape
Driving 'Raris, let's race
Fifth of my waist, make you fix your face
Everything straight, anytime I'm in the place
Nut on her face yeah, didn't go on a date
Didn't serve her a plate, yeah, give the molly a taste
I got money so I do what I want to do everyday
Book your bitch a flight, YYZ to LA
On a off day wearing PLAY
Took a day off, still getting paid

Did you see NAV?
He was off the Perkys he was leaning
They tried to take his chain, he's surrounded by them demons
He had a bunch of bad bitches lining up to meet him
They reselling the tickets a thousand dollars just to see him
I wanna dress like him, I wish I could be him
Had to snap him on the road, his Bentley coupe speeding
We just seen NAV in Neiman Marcus blowing cash
Did you see NAV? He just slapped that bitch right on the ass
