		  Yo 
Yo
Yo

Boy I'm sipping tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up, you buttercup?
Purrp in that blunt, smoking suicide bloody blunts
Pussy boy you talking shit for Twitter, it ain't adding up
How these pussy niggas moving day to day, I've had enough
Post with that fucking blade, bitch, I'll skin your face
Dick on that fucking gun, I love it when they run
Fuck all that talking shit, do that shit for fun
Fuck 'round with these niggas, aye
Stab a body- fuck do you mean?
Post with that Glock and that beam
Put that shit right in yo' spleen, aye
Run through yo hood, aye
Fuck nigga what's really good, aye
My niggas wish that you would, aye, aye

Bitch, I'm sippin' tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up?
Bitch, I'm sippin' tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up?
Bitch, I'm sippin' tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up?
Bitch, I'm sippin' tea in yo
Aye, aye
Bitch, I'm sippin' tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up?
Bitch, I'm sippin' tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up?
Bitch, I'm sippin' tea in yo hood
What the fuck is up?
