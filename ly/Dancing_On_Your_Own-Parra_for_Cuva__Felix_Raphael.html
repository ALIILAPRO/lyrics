		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met you there, you came in slowly, one of a kind
To make it true, fulfilling you
Or keep it on the bright side of heat
To find loose ends with healing hands of feeling steel
To learn the sea of haunted end to courtesy

Tree of illusions, dancing on her own
All of her confusions silence when we're home

I met you there, you came in slowly, one of a kind
To make it true, fulfilling you
Or keep it on the bright side of heat
To find loose ends with healing hands of feeling steel
To learn the sea of haunted end to courtesy

Tree of illusions, dancing on her own
(Tree of illusions, dancing on her own)
And all of her confusions silence when we're home
(And all of her confusions silence when we're home)
Tree of illusions, dancing on her own
(Tree of illusions, dancing on her own)
And all of her confusions silence when we're home
