		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Way down southern Ontario
Where the air gets sticky on the county roads
Cicadas hummin' and the corn grows high
I know just what I wanna do tonight.

Gonna sip a little rye and talk about the times
We'll get a little crooked and we'll get a little high
We'll get a little crooked and we'll get a little high
We're takin er easy in the warm sunshine
Hey pretty mama don't bother tryin'
Cause me and the boys will be up all night
Sippin' that rye, talkin' bout the times
I won't be home until the mornin' light

There's a little city at the end of the road
Where the Detroit river and the whiskey flows
Now she ain't pretty but to me she's gold
And she's always gonna be my home.

Now it's just about time in the afternoon
Where the mean green clouds come rollin' through
Now we're out on the porch it's a hell of a view
Just to watch her as she rolls on by

And we'll sip a little rye and talk about the times
We'll get a little crooked and we'll get a little high
We'll get a little crooked and we'll get a little high
We're takin er easy in the lightning strikes
Hey pretty mama don't bother tryin'
Cause me and the boys will be up all night
Sippin' that rye, talkin' bout the times
I won't be home until the mornin' light

Sippin' that rye, talkin' bout the times
I won't be home until the mornin' light
