		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And now niggas gon' stop playing with me
All y'all niggas actin' like y'all niggas got a issue or something
Or it's a, if it's a
If it's a joke or it's a mothafuckin' game or something you know?
I don't play no mothafuckin' games, man, yeah
Woo

Staring at my wrist, it froze (wrist), yeah, it blew a kiss at her (muah)
Water diamond crystal flow (water), keep your kids from Mystikal (hey)
Smoke, what's your temperature? (Smoke), better not at or mention 'em
Get you whacked intentional (whacked), we send hits ain't missing 'em
Bought another Cullinan (Culli'), bulletproof like government
Grew up with my brother dem (big bro), big bro always hustling (hey)
Since my brother got killed, it ain't no fightin', ain't no tusslin' (tussle)
Fightin' in the courthouse for my kids, I need some custody (hey)

Niggas fake, they counterfeit (fake), money boost my confidence
Hating, that's unfortunate (hate), I get checks, I'm corporate (checks)
White diamonds like porcelain (white)
You can't call yourself rich if you do not own no mortgages (houses)
Sometimes when I'm home I feel alone like it's an orphanage (whoa-whoa, alone)
(Hey, hey)
When it's colds outside you better grip on your heat (cold)
She got so much mileage, she tryna work one on me (work one)
I had so much knowledge, I had to get out the streets (let's go)

I didn't graduate college
White ceramic AP (white)
Black ceramic AP (black)
That's four hundred a piece (four hundred)
If I front that's a fee
When I pulled out the chopper he act like he couldn't speak (hey)
I been focused on me (let's go)
Hundred racks in the brief (let's go)
I had shackles on feet
I adapt in the streets (adapt)
I drip sauce in my sleep (drip sauce)
Baddest bitch on my arm
Niggas wish they was me (was me)
I'ma do niggas wrong (wrong)
They was doubting on me

Niggas fake, they counterfeit, money boost my confidence (boost)
Hating, that's unfortunate (hate), I get checks, I'm corporate (checks)
White diamonds like porcelain (white)
You can't call yourself rich if you do not own no mortgages (how?)
Sometimes when I'm home I feel alone like it's an orphanage (alone)
(Hey, hey)
When it's colds outside you better grip on your heat
She got so much mileage, she tryna work one on me (work one)
I had so much knowledge, I had to get out the streets

Do everything B-I-G, you niggas babies to me (toddler)
Treat that lil' boy like my son, it's a switch on my Glee (whoop 'em)
I ain't texting no ho nothing, you might spill all the tea (nope)
Quick to leave a bitch on seen, reckless messaging me (right now)
Rich nigga with broke habits, driving a Maybach on E (skrrt)
They just book me for two hundred, spent that shit on my teeth (see)
Say cheese, certified player, ain't no referee
You OD (how?) She say I be pouring too much of that lean
VVs, you see every color when these diamonds hit the light (bright)
They just gave me fifteen M's, I ain't do nothing but rap my life (true)
Everybody got opinions telling me to spend it right (what?)
You ain't never had this much money I can't take your advice
I done rode more PJs then I put on PJs (hahaha)
I might drop same time as my opp, nigga, fuck your release date
Been had them shoes four months ago before you put on them J's (late)
I can show you how to get paid, I know a hundred some ways (go)

Niggas fake, they counterfeit, money boost my confidence (boost)
Hating, that's unfortunate (hate), I get checks, I'm corporate (checks)
White diamonds like porcelain (white)
You can't call yourself rich if you do not own no mortgages (how?)
Sometimes when I'm home I feel alone like it's an orphanage (alone)
(Hey, hey)
When it's colds outside you better grip on your heat
She got so much mileage, she tryna work one on me (work one)
I had so much knowledge, I had to get out the streets
