		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Steppin' out my soul to roll a hundred more dutches
I ain't finna puff it with nobody this my dungeon
Coming down geronimo time to focus on my blunders
Live in hell I know Grey deserving to be punished
Enough of this bullshit
I never wanna do shit
Living so repetitive severing where the truth is
Mental so diluted
My frontal lobe is muted
Focus on the never the better can't make it through this

My back my back my back against the wall
Been on track to lack to mask all of my flaws
I'm erratic the static is scratching up onto my dome
Facing traffic intact and I panic inevitable
I'm fucking up everything inside my mind tho (Mind tho)
Sick of this fucking life it's just a climb tho (I don't)
Fuck with the population they all whine tho (Mind you)
Never gon make it out of my disguise tho (Side show)

Cemetery vision incision up on you fuckers
Think you shit but I don't miss I be pissing up on ya numbers
You won't never beat the Grey that's sum you forever under
Ain't a thing that you could say and ain't a thing that you could mutter

That would outdo me boy
You so lousy lil boy
I been sounding astounding stop shouting lil boy
I been out here lil boy
I just bounce in deploy
All my hounds and they mouthing they trouncing you boys
Y'all ain't never coming back without that parasitic sentence
Ain't thing up in the universe that really fucking living
Ain't no way in fucking hell I ever let you make the finish
Imma blow the fucking planet everybody got they wish yuh
My back my back my back against the wall
Been on track to lack to mask all of my flaws
I'm erratic the static is scratching up onto my dome
Facing traffic intact and I panic inevitable I'm
