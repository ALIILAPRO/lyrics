		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could have seen the other side
Taking a step into the sky
Ah, I'm always late
I could have done
the same routine
Showing the old and
golden scene
I'm lying again
To make them go
Wearing again my rocking shoes
Over the puddles made of tears
Flash back
I know you're clever
I remember
I know we could cross
over rainbows
I wish that we could aim the
sun again
I know we could dream
for tomorrow
To share the long forgotten
Glamorous days
I could have done a lot for you
Nothing was left for me to do
Ah, I'm always late
I let you go
You always said it's Rock'n'Roll
Life is a battle, fight and grow
Flash back
I loved you flavor
I remember
I know we could shine
like the starlight
I wish that we could aim
the sky again
I know we could dream
for tomorrow
To share the long forgotten
Glamorous days ...
I won't be sleeping

Sunday, Monday,
Yet another Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday,
you're still away
Friday, Saturday,
I'll be lonely everyday
And I'm crying high up
to the moon
And I somehow
hope to hear you cry
I know I could fight
all the troubles
If only I could stay
there on your side
I know I should dream
on my own now
To chase the long forgotten
Glorious days
I know we could cross
over rainbows
I wish that could aim the
sun again
I know we could dream
for tomorrow
To share the long forgotten
Glamorous days
Glamorous sky...
