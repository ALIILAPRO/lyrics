		  Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

Oh no, the fight's out
I'm 'bout to punch your lights out
Get the fuck back, guard your grill
There's somethin' wrong, we can't stay still
I've been drankin' and bustin' two
And I been thankin' of bustin' you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, (aw girl), they'll be mo' dead
Causing confusion, Disturbing The Peace
It's not an illusion, we runnin' the streets
So, bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? (No, nigga)
I'm doin' a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck outta my way
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
And you about to get ran the FUCK over

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (bitch)

Move, bitch, get out the way (watch out, watch out)
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (watch out, bitch)
Move, bitch, get out the way (watch out, watch out)
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (watch out)

Here I come, here I go
Uh oh, don't jump, bitch, move
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
I hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I fuck the crowd up, that's what I do
Young and successful, sex symbol
Now bitches want me to fuck 'em, true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty
"Oh, ah, what's up, gettin' my dick sucked, what are you doin'?"
Besides minding my fuckin' business
Tryna get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fuckin' TV's and the jewelry, bitch, tell me that?
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this, bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

2-0, I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right MAC
Hit the trunk, grab the pump, pump, I'll be right back
We buyin' bars out, showin' stars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Call up Tig, grab the pills 'cause we poppin' tonight
Beat the shit outta security for stoppin' the fight
I got a fifth of that Remy, fuck the Belve and Cris
I'm sellin' shit up in the club like I work in that bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggas
I'm from the Dec', try to disrespect D.T.P.
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the V.I.P.
Fuck this rap shit, we clap, bitch, two in your body
Grab your folk, start a fight, dawg, ruin the party
So move, bitch, get out the way, ho
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0
So

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
