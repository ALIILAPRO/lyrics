		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Say, I got a woman, way over town
Good to me, oh yeah
She give me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah

She saves her lovin', early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her lovin', early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her lovin', just for me
Ah, she love me so tenderly
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah

She's there to love me
Both day and night
Never grumbles or fusses
Always treats me right
Never runnin' in the streets
And leavin' me alone
She knows a woman's place
Is right there now in her home

I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Say, I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Oh, she's my baby
Oh, don't you understand?
Yeah, and I'm her lover man
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah

Oh, don't you know she's alright
Oh, don't you know she's alright
She's alright, she's alright
Whoa yeah, oh yeah
