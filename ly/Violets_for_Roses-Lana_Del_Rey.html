		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something in the air
The girls are running 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off
And it makes me so happy
Larchmont village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening

Ever since I fell out of love with you
I fell back in love with me
And boy, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you
I fell back in love with the city
Like the Paramount sign's sparkling
Sparkling just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for horses
Don't forget all of these things that you love
Are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is trying to make a woman change
And trade her violets for roses

Ah-laa-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-laa-ha, ah-ha

There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the madder alleys
And the streets have ceased
And still the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening

Ever since I fell out of love with you
I fell back in love with the streets
And God, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you
I break-dance to the backbeat
And God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for horses
Don't forget all of these things that you love
Are the same things I hate
The simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is trying to make a woman change
And trade her violets for roses

Ah-laa-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-laa-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
(Ah-laa-ha, ah-ha)

There's something in the air
The girls are running 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off
And it makes me so happy
