		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I need your love
Oh, I need your love

Even when I'm not around you, baby
I need your love
Just wanna tell how I'm feeling lately
I need your love

Oh, I need your love to get me through
I can't do this without you
Oh, I need your love to get me through
'Cause, baby, there's no other way

Oh, I need, need, need, need, need your love
I need, need, need, need, need your love
Oh, I need, need, need, need, need your love
'Cause, baby, there's no other way

Oh, I, without you
I can't do this
Without you
I can't do
Oh, I, without you
I can't do
'Cause, baby, there's no other way

Oh, I, even when I'm not around you, baby
I need your love
Just wanna tell you how I'm feeling lately
And what I've been thinking of

Everything just ain't what it seems
So send me a piece of your love
When I'm not around you
Ooh, when I'm not around you
I need your love

Oh, I need your love, your love, your love
Oh, I need your love, to get me through
'Cause, baby, there's no other way

Oh, I need your love
Oh, I need your love
Oh, I need your love (oh yeah)
Oh, I need your love (need your love)
Oh, I need your love, to get me through
'Cause, baby, there's no other way

Oh, I need, need, need, need, need your love
I need, need, need, need, need your love
Oh, I need, need, need, need, need your love
'Cause, baby, there's no other way

Oh, I, without you
I can't do this
Without you
I can't do
Oh, I, without you (oh)
I can't do
'Cause, baby, there's no other way
Oh, I
