		<p>
		  She told me why
She told me lies
I always take care of this
I told her how
I've always stayed
Always waited for nothing

When I get out of here
Will I leave you behind?
I found that the years passed despite

When I get out of here
Will I leave you behind?
I found that the years passed despite

And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow

When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You find that the years passed us by

When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You find that those years passed us by

And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
