		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ohh
Oh baby
Ohh
Demons in sheets baby
You take the lead
You get me off my feet
When you tell me pretty things yeah
Oh lately I just wanna be better
Just want you to settle down with me
Do me round and round yeah
Push it through the line yeah
Put me upside down
Let me prove it I'm the one
Do me round and round yeah
Move it to the lounge yeah
Put it on my mind baby yeah
Look in my eyes when you're falling for me
Buried inside, got you longing for it
I can tell you're wanting
Someone you can trust in
Focus it right when you're falling for me
It burns in your mind, how you're longing for it
I can tell you're wanting more baby
I've got more
I don't think that I could get enough
Way it's looking I'm gon' need you love
So why don't you put your body on me
Like you want me
Cause girl you don't know how I feel
When you're near
So hypnotized when I look into your eyes, I
Want this forever
No it don't matter where we are
Oh you are what I need
Do me round and round yeah
Push it through the line yeah
Put me upside down
Let me prove it I'm the one
Do me round and round yeah
Move it to the lounge yeah
Put it on my mind baby yeah
Look in my eyes when you're falling for me
Buried inside, got you longing for it
I can tell you're wanting
Someone you can trust in
Focus it right when you're falling for me
It burns in your mind, how you're longing for it
I can tell you're wanting more baby
I've got more
Ohh
No yeah
Baby
I've got more
No yeah
