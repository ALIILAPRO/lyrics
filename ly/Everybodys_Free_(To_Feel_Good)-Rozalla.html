		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free 

Brother and sister
Together we'll make it through
Some day a spirit will lift you and take you there
I know you've been hurting but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out
Whenever I can, ooh

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good, to feel good 

We are a family that should stand together as one
Helping each other instead of just wasting time
Now is the moment to reach out to someone, it's all up to you
When everyone's sharing their hope
Then love will win through, ooh

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good, yeah
Everybody's free to feel good
