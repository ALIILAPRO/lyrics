		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, oh 
"Out of luck"
That's what all the others say
Put you down just like any other days
Never knew I'd make songs you'd be singing, I
I'm so lucky to be calling you mine

Nothing much I just wanted you to know
For you I have my gratitude and so much more
Every one of your messages
I be reading inside

"I've been listening to you from the start"
Thank you for today
Tomorrow, yesterday
Every day and night
I wanna thank you for believing
"I've been listening to you all along"
Put it to my faith
I just feel amazing every day and night
You make me feel alive

Thank you for your love, yeah

Hmm, ya, let me explain
I cannot do all this just in a day
이렇게 또 난 너에게갈래 
I know that you would be feeling the same
요번 주말에 아니면 Monday
시간이 부족해도
We just keep moving along
I just had to make you a song

In your side, imagine
I don't wanna waste your time
Put you in my position
Don't want you to wait in line
All this time I've always thought to myself (alright)
What if she be the one for my life

"I've been listening to you from the start"
Thank you for today
Tomorrow, yesterday
Every day and night
I wanna thank you for believing
"I've been listening to you all along"
Put it to my faith
I just feel amazing
Every day and night
You make me feel alive, yeah

Thank you for your love, yeah
