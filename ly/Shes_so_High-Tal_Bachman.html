		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's blood, flesh and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound
But somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna happen, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da-da-da-da
She's so high
High above me

First class and fancy-free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be, why should I even bother? Ah-ha

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da-da-da-da
She's so high
High above me

She comes to speak to me
I freeze immediately
'Cause what she says sounds so unreal
'Cause somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna happen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Oh yeah, yeah
She's so high
High above me
