		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

You should come back to our place, baby
Don't be afraid of our love
On the second floor, darling
In a second flat, hurry up

'Cause down in Arkansas
The stores are all closed
The kids in their hoodies
they dance super slow
We're white hot forever
And only God knows

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

We'll be white hot forever (forever, forever)
We're white hot forever (forever, forever)
We'll be white hot forever
And ever and ever
Amen

Could I come back to the ranch, baby?
I had to get away for a while
Just to rest my nerves, darling
Can I make you laugh with a smile?
You knew when you chose me
I was nothing but ordinary
And now the wind's blowing
Reminding you of what you know

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

We'll be white hot forever (forever, forever)
White hot forever (forever, forever)
White hot forever
And ever and ever
The end

White hot forever (forever, forever)
White hot forever (forever, forever)
White hot forever
And ever and ever
Amen

(You should stay that close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind)
