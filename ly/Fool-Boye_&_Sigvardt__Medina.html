		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me running, got me way down
Sick of all, sick of all, sick of all of you
My heart is beating for no sake now
Sick of you, sick of you but the love's true

I feel for you
But I don't wanna get too real with you
Everything is so unclear with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So comfortable
Even this alone's impossible
Maybe I'm the one responsible
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-nana, 'cause I'm a fool for you
Kick out your love every weekend
Monday you're back for no reason
Oh-nana, 'cause I'm a fool for you
Sick of trying, I'm leaving
I can't get rid of this feeling

Ooh-nana, 'cause I'm a
Ooh-nana, 'cause I'm a
'Cause I'm a
Ooh-nana, 'cause I'm a

It's been so long but I still taste ya
On my skin, let you in, we don't play by rules
You got me hazy, ain't no faking us
And it's clear what I feel 'cause your love's true

I fear the truth
I don't wanna get too real with you
Everything is so unclear with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So comfortable
Even this alone's impossible
Maybe I'm the one responsible
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-nana, 'cause I'm a fool for you
Kick out your love every weekend
Monday you're back for no reason
Oh-nana, 'cause I'm a fool for you
Sick of trying, I'm leaving
I can't get rid of this feeling

Ooh-nana, 'cause I'm a
Ooh-nana, 'cause I'm a
'Cause I'm a
Ooh-nana, 'cause I'm a
