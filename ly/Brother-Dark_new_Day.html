		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time I knew everything
When I stop to think back on everything
It all runs away like a memory
Once there was a picture of a happy place 

But I always keep thinking 
What a great place to leave

I'd trade it all
To have you all here with me

Father when you coming back?
Mother leave the light on again.
Sister with someone somewhere somewhere
Brother Brother Brother

Trailer park heaven was a dream to me
Cause we had it figured out
Simple and not jaded
There was a promise of a brighter day
But soon it would all fade out 

I'd trade it all
To have you all here with me

Father when you coming back?
Mother leave the light on again.
Sister with someone somewhere somewhere
Brother Brother Brother


When it's something we love that keeps us away,
Well it costs even more and its so much to pay.

I'd trade it all
To have you all here with me

Father when you coming back?
Mother leave the light on again.
Sister with someone somewhere somewhere
Brother Brother Brother
