		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could there be laughter
Left in these songs?
How could there be mirth and
Joy in this world? For what am I now anymore
But a wretched old bard weary and torn?
For all of those dreams
Have withered and died
For all of those hopes
Have vanished into night
No grace in this voice anymore
But a wretched old bard forlorn and torn

But there was ever only one
The one that I would hold
The one that I still long

Mute is the sorrow of mine
Voiceless the yearning inside
Dark is the path in the end
Sore are the wounds I hide

Once there was a time when
They all praised my name
Once there was a time when
Hearts turned to me
For even the birds hearkened to my song
That quivered in the wind
And echoed through the night
But where is the glory
The gold and fame now?
Where is the crown that once
Blazed on my brow?
Not one by my side anymore
This wretched old bard unsung and torn

And after all the years that go by
I remember the one
The one that I still look for

Mute is the sorrow of mine
Voiceless the yearning inside
Dark is the path in the end
Sore are the wounds I hide
Mute is the sorrow of mine
Voiceless the yearning inside
Dark is the path in the end
Sore are the wounds I hide

Only for her I would play my tunes
Only for her I would write these words
Only to her I would sing
But she, she never hearkened to me

Mute is the sorrow of mine
Voiceless the yearning inside
Dark is the path in the end
Sore are the wounds I hide
Mute is the sorrow of mine
Voiceless the yearning inside
Dark is the path in the end
Sore are the wounds I hide
