		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you much too much
I've known it from the start
But yet my love is such
I can't control my heart
I love you much too much
I ask myself what for
And darling when we touch
I love you more
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly
But who am I to say
If I should hold it lightly
It might slip away
I love you much too much
You've never really known
I love you oh so much
I'm yours alone
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly
But who am I to say
If I should hold it lightly
It might slip away
I love you much too much
You've never really known
I love you oh so much
I'm yours alone
