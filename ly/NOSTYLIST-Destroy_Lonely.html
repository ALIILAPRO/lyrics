		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I wake up, no stylist
Fresh as fuck, I put it on, no help, I did this shit
Got this fine ho, no makeup, and she still look bad as shit
She in school, but it's cool, yeah, I still might bag this bitch
Diamonds flooded like a pool, yeah, my necklace wet as shit

Rock Balenciaga too, bitch, I'm flyer than a pigeon
Yeah, I stack my paper up way taller than a midget
All these niggas lame as fuck, and they hate 'cause they don't get it
Yeah, lil' bitch, I'm cool as fuck, and it's paper that I'm gettin'
Fly across the globe, bitch, I'm gettin' shows, yeah, I'm on a money mission
All that old shit over, but the old hoes still be tellin' me they miss me
Yeah, I fuck on her, but I can't cuff her, I won't make her missus
I don't know that boy, and I can't tell you how he end up missin'

I can't tell you shit
Bust down my neck, bust down my wrist
Bust down my bitch, bust down my bitch
I'm fresh as hell, bitch, I'm fly as shit
Yeah, this a hellcat, I'm whippin' this
Shawty like, "Hell yeah" she with the shits
Shawty like, "Hell yeah" she grab my stick
Shawty like, "Hell yeah" she grabbed my (shh)

Bitch, I wake up, no stylist
Fresh as fuck, I put it on, no help, I did this shit
Got this fine ho, no makeup, and she still look bad as shit
She in school, but it's cool, yeah, I still might bag this bitch
Diamonds flooded like a pool, yeah, my necklace wet as shit

Tell that bitch to keep it bool, and I might just let her kick it
Got her wet just like a pool, I'm finna dive right in her kitty
My bitch rockin' this shit too, I buy her that, she buy me this
Told my folks I'm gettin' rich, it ain't no way I'm washin' dishes
All the pretty hoes comin' to my shows, man, this shit get crazy
If I fuck that bitch I gotta wrap it, I don't want no baby
I'm in the SRT, Trackhawk, tryna let my thot drive the Mercedes
Yeah, my side, nigga, you play with this shit, you might just die today

Yeah, don't play, nigga, don't play
Niggas say they insane, but I'm really insane
Yeah, nigga stay in your lane, 'cause mine might drive you crazy
Yeah, I just fucked that bitch, I didn't know that was your bae
Yeah, I just count this cash, it ain't too much to say
Yeah, I just get too fly, like, what more can I say?
Yeah, she doin' tricks on the dick, that ho Cirque du Soleil
Yeah, I'm in Milan shawty, eatin' squid, my bitch servin' face

Bitch, I wake up, no stylist
Fresh as fuck, I put it on, no help, I did this shit
Got this fine ho, no makeup, and she still look bad as shit
She in school, but it's cool, yeah, I still might bag this bitch
Diamonds flooded like a pool, yeah, my necklace wet as shit

Rock Balenciaga too, bitch, I'm flyer than a pigeon
Yeah, I stack my paper up way taller than a midget
All these niggas lame as fuck, and they hate 'cause they don't get it
Yeah, lil' bitch, I'm cool as fuck, and it's paper that I'm gettin'
