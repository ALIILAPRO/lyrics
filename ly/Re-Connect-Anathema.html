		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The fragments of connection died
Some things just won't fade with time
Hide behind a transparent eye
You can't see me but I can you
Betray without a moment's thought
Regret nothing but getting caught
Your time comes and here I stand
Why should I hold out my hand to you
I could never turn to you
I was silenced by that look in your eye
I feel I'm slipping back again
Black cold night I toss and turn
I'm sinking feel so, drained
Shroud me, blind me, sick, weak, empty,
Drag me, into pain
I tried so hard, don't drown me, bound to me
Self indulgently, crazed
Black as coal, my sunken soul,
Will it ever be, saved?
Come on and twist that knife again
Well I'd like to see you fucking try
Never going back again
An answer won't come from me
Confront your own worst enemy
What does your mirror see
Is it time to face up to me?
