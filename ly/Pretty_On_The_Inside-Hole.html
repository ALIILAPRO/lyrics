		  Slutkiss girls
Won't you promise her smack?
Is she pretty on the inside?
Is she pretty from the back?

Slutkiss girl
Won't you water her rack?
Is she pretty on the inside, baby?
Pretty from the back?

Slutkiss girl
Molasses rot black strap
Is she ugly on the inside, baby?
Ugly, ugly from the back?

There is no power like my pretty power
My pretty power
My ugly

Slutkiss girl
Won't you promise her smack?
Is she pretty on the inside?
Is she ugly?

Ugly?
Ugly?
Ugly?
Ugly?

Ugly?
Ugly?
Ugly?
Ugly?
