		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey girl stop what you're doin'
Hey girl you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you
But I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you
Let me feel your lovin' charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Hey girl I got something I think you ought to know
Hey babe I want to tell you that I love you so
I want to hold you in my arms, yeah
I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause I like your charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

(Communication breakdown) I want you to love me all night
(Communication breakdown) I want you to love me
(Communication breakdown) I want you to love yeah! I want you to love
