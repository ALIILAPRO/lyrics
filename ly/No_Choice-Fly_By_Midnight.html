		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember us alone
Tasting you like alcohol
I know
For me it was always you
Madison and thirty four
Watched you close that yellow door
And go
I should have said
Turn around turn around let's get back to it
I should have said
I was wrong all along I put you through it
I can't undo it
But I could call your phone just to hear your voice
I could drive to you yeah but what's the point
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I could run away but I won't get far
Meet somebody new let her break my heart
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I still think of you I still think of you
I'm missing you in figure eight
Tears me down it's way too late
I know
That you already moved on
You were gone
Before I knew it
Just to come back like a song
On and on in my head i can't lose it
I can't undo it
But I could call your phone just to hear your voice
I could drive to you yeah but what's the point
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I could run away but I won't get far
Meet somebody new let her break my heart
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I still think of you I still think of you
No matter what I try to do I never get away from you
And even if I wanted to the only other choice is you
I could call your phone just to hear your voice
I could drive to you yeah but what's the point
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I could run away but I won't get far
Meet somebody new let her break my heart
I still think of you cause I've got no choice
I still think of you I still think of you
