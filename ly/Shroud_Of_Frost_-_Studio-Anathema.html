		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Undying odyssey
A myriad of times
The soul has seen
Through eyes of heaven

The Imperium of earth
Nothing left to perceive
Help me to escape from this existence
I yearn for an answer

Can you help me?
IÂ¹m drowning in a sea of abused visions and shattered dreams
In somnolent illusion
I'm paralysed 

Infinity distraction
A pious human disorder
Blind to passage of souls
Conclusion from one remembrance

Help me to escape
Transfixed
I gaze through my window at a world lying under a shroud of frost
In a forlorn stupor I feel the burning of staring eyes,

Yet no-one is here. Detached from reality,
In the knowing of dreams, 
We know the entity of ensuing agony waits to clasp us in its cold
Breast, in an empty room

We awake and it's true
I dreamed of the sun's demise, awoke to a bleak morning
In the emptiness I beheld face for the dead light is a foretelling of
What will be

I saw a soul drift from life, through death, 
And arrive at Elysian fields in welcoming song
Yet I stand in a dusk-filled room despondently watching the passing of a kindred spirit and there is no song
Just a delusion of silence
