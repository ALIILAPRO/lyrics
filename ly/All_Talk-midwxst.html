		  Okay-okay, yeah (Okay-okay)
Okay-okay, yeah (Okay-okay)
Okay-okay, yeah (Okay-okay)
Okay-okay, yeah (Okay-okay)

Singin', I feel like I'm New Edition
I've been countin' that money, addition
You been creating lies, the fiction
Everybody all talk, they don't listen
Oh, that boy want the smoke, he want friction
All the girls say that they love my diction
I know you wanna be me, I'm addictin'
Can't stop that shit, I'm on a mission

No, no, no hop in that coupe, I'm on go
I know that you don't want me as a foe
She want to fuck with me, know I'ma blow
I'm watchin' my back, I stay on my toes
I'm stayin', stay with my gang and my bros
You bangin', but we know you ain't on go
I'm steppin'
Steppin' on necks and on throats
I'm watchin'
Know I've been takin' some notes
Cuttin' her off, that bitch is too toxic
Sayin' you hard, but that shit is nonsense
All on my page, I know that you watchin'
Wanna be me, I know that you stalkin', yeah
Tryna mеss with the kid 'cause
I start gettin' poppin'
I'm in thе studio, know that I'm locked in
Doin' this shit 'cause I don't got an option
Makin' the list? Well, I'm in the top ten
And no, don't try to say that I'm braggin'
Breathin' fire, I feel like a dragon
Said I'm crazy, they said I'm a mad man
Smoke a blunt, no, I don't need a dab pen
Not a game, no, this shit is not Madden
Money only go up, no Asadin
Walk inside of the store and I'm cashin' out
You say that you hard
Let's see what you about
Oh, what did he say?
Better get back, better stay away
Need to get in line, you better behave
I know you scared, boy, I know you afraid
People really tryna say that I changed
Fuck the money, bitch, I don't need the fame
No matter what, I'll always be the same
I never cared what these
Motherfuckers have to say
'Cause they do not damn matter, oh
I'm counting all the money
I'm 'bout to put cheese and
Bread on my platter, oh
Smokin' a blunt to numb all my pain
And that boy a nub, I know he a lame
Don't try to say that I'm not the same
Getting bad energy out of my brain, yeah
Nine hundred, I just got some new sneakers
You gon' pay an arm and
A leg for this feature
Get on stage and scream like I am a preacher
Talkin' to the kids, I feel like the teacher
Remember cryin', I had tears on my t-shirt
Do what you want, give a fuck what they say
If you got a dream, then do it today
If you got a passion, then don't be afraid
Never fit in, don't fit in the classroom
Remember hidin' from class in the bathroom
You can say that we friends
But we not really friends
Bitch, I know that you won't be
There for me in the end
I might call up Jenna, might hop in the Benz
I don't know how much money I wanna spend
I don't want your girl 'cause
She is not a ten
I do not wan' talk, so do not press send
Put all my money inside of the bag
And I walk in that bitch wearin' Raf, yeah
You really be tryin' to say I'm not hard
But we all know that that shit is cap, yeah
You talkin' 'bout me
Got my name in your mouth
Boy, I already know that you mad, yeah
If I'm bein' real honest
I'm gettin' real hungry
You might as well open a tab, yeah
And I'm runnin' like a relay, oh
I got him in his feelings
Everybody wanna leave my life
Everybody leaving
I've been seeing all the fakes, yeah
They really is revealing
You've been lyin' to my face, all your lies
They unreeling girls saying I'm appealing
But my heart's still healing
You can talk, talk, talk
But it's real hard believing
Switchin' up like the seasons
You don't even got a reason
Broke all of my trust, yeah
You cannot change me

Singin', I feel like I'm New Edition
I've been countin' that money, addition
You been creating lies, the fiction
Everybody all talk, they don't listen
Oh, that boy want the smoke, he want friction
All the girls say that they love my diction
I know you wanna be me, I'm addictin'
Can't stop that shit, I'm on a mission
