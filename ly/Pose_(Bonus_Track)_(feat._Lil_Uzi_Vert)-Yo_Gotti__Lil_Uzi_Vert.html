		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Photo shoot, yeah, flash, flash, flash, flash

You are looking at a legend in the flesh
Fresh up out the kitchen to the jet
Blew a quarter key on the set
Hold up, pose
VVS in the chain lookin' wet
Deposit ain't hit the account yet
Shit ain't verified, like my check
Hold up, pose (yeah)
Pose, pose (yeah)
Pose, pose (I am, I am, I am) 
Photo shoot, pose, pose (I am, I am) 
Pose, it's a photo shoot 

Dope boy, I'm a Polaroid
Photo's make me paranoid
Bitch open up her camera phone (hold on, hold on)
This that shit I be trynna avoid (yeah)
Bitch, I ain't trynna make no blog with you (blog with you)
Hoe, I ain't walkin' through the mall with you (ay, not me)
Talking all on the radio
I should take a picture of you, you got the log with you (trash)
She been sendin' me pictures and they X-rated (X-rated)
Word on the street that her ex hate it (ex hate it)
You doin' lame shit and I'm irritated (fuck nigga)
I don't do no fuck shit, I'm an 80s baby (yum)
She wanna eat the dick on camera (camera)
Pussy bald head, like Amber (Rose)
Tights look right, this a camel (toe), photo shoot

Pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, photo shoot, pose
Pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, photo shoot, yeah, whoa

You are looking at a legend in the flesh
Fresh up out the kitchen to the jet
Blew a quarter key on the set
Hold up, pose
VVS in the chain lookin' wet
Deposit ain't hit the account yet
Shit ain't verified, like my check (let's go)
Hold up, pose
Pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, pose (Lil Uzi)

Fucked that bitch, tried put the fee on it
Uh-uh, best put the free on it (yeah)
If it's 'bout money, then we on it (whoa)
Water on my neck, you could ski on it (Oh)
You can't unthaw these diamonds, put the heat on it (what)
I was layin' in my bed while she dreamed on it (yeah)
Man, I touched that thing back, put my knee on it (yeah)
Man, my shoes was too fresh with my feet on it (whoa)
Went to the jeweler, top of the morning
24 hours, then I was snowed in (let's go)
You was not locked up, you was in holding
I know some niggas got life and they posin'
All in they picture, she know I'm richer
Yeah that her nigga, look at my wrist-er
Heard you flew sicker, I do not miss her
She not enough, I need her friend
I feel like Trisha, totaled my car
I cannot fix her, she pose for the pic (skrrt)
Make the bitch lick it, I got a lamb
I got a fist, she ride of my dick like it's a RipStik
Smack on her bottom like that shit a mystic (yeah)
I'm 30 Mss in, still in the trenches
I went to the dentist 'cause I'm a menace
Fucked the old cougar just for her picture

Pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, pose, photo shoot, pose (whoa)
Pose, pose, pose, pose, (photo shoot), pose, pose, hold up, pose
