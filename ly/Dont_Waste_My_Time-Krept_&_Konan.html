		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If she ain't fuckin', she got to go (yeah)
Tell her, "Don't waste my time"
Police want to stop me, search my clothes (word)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time"
If it ain't money I ain't involved (nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time"
Wasteman wafflin' down my phone (true)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (kaboom)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (oh yeah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (kaboom)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (behave)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (bah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)

Pray to the Lord, nigga
In this cold world, I'm a born sinner
We pour liquor (uh)
Girl, come Hova, it's all jigga
Chicks wanna holla, can't be my baby mama
'Cause I don't need that drama
Unless she Rihanna (woo)
Most of you arseholes are bummy
I pop her cherry now she call me Papi
She askin' me what's on my body
Versace, Versace, Versace (Lord)
Been that guy since Oxide Neutrino (man)
Bound 4 Da, Bound 4 Da Reload (damn)
Dick is as big as my ego (bam)
Man will give her the D on the D-low

If she ain't fuckin', she got to go (yeah)
Tell her, "Don't waste my time"
Police want to stop me, search my clothes (word)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time"
If it ain't money I ain't involved (nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time"
Wasteman wafflin' down my phone (true)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (kaboom)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (oh yeah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (kaboom)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (behave)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (bah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)

Pretty girl on my left
Pretty girl on my right
South side of that river
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (kaboom)
Troubz rolled up and he's buzzin'
Screamin' out, "If they ain't with us then fuck 'em"
Excuse my French, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga I ain't worried 'bout nothin', haan
Packin' shows, stackin' dough
VIP lounge full of ratchet hoes
Them boys talkin' 'bout trappin' O's
Fuck boys probably still jackin' phones
Ugh, roll up in my AJ slippers
Wanna fight? I hit 'em first, yeah, I Ray J niggas
No chase, no chase 'til I taste straight liquor
Got my kids in her mouth, that's a play date nigga

If she ain't fuckin', she got to go (yeah)
Tell her, "Don't waste my time"
Police want to stop me, search my clothes (word)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time"
If it ain't money I ain't involved (nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time"
Wasteman wafflin' down my phone (true)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (kaboom)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (oh yeah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (kaboom)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (behave)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (bah)
Tell 'em, "Don't waste my time" (nah, nah, nah)
