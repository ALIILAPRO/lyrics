		  Hey

Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh, na-na (uh)

He didn't walk up with that, "How you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him (ayy)
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh, na-na-na-na-na (woo)

Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy, uh-huh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na 
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh, na-na

(Jeffery)
Just graduated, fresh on campus, mm
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn
(Fresh out East Atlanta)
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ayy)
Back it on me (back it up), shawty cravin' on me
Get to eatin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
This is history in the makin', homie (homie)
Point blank, close range, that B 
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
I was gettin' mula, baby

Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, ayy, ayy, uh-huh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh, no)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh, na-na

Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (ooh-ooh)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yeah, babe)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yeah, yeah)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yeah, babe)
Take me back, back, back
(Hey, hey)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Take me back to my Havana

Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, yeah)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (ayy, ayy)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh, na-na 

Uh-huh
Oh, na-na-na (oh, na, yeah)
Oh, na-na-na
Oh, na-na-na
No, no, no, take me back
Oh, na-na-na
Havana, ooh, na-na
