		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see your red door and I want it painted black
No colors any more, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see the line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens everyday

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea turn to a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see your red door and I want it painted black
No colors any more, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
