		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never know what tomorrow may bring
The woman lyin' next to you could be a memory
I've idolized, I've memorized your face
Just in case, I need it last me eternity
It's a shame that it ain't enough for me

Life's for the the livin', I won't be givin' up
'Cause you taught me how to, you taught me how to love
Take all I cherished, beat me 'til my body's numb
But life's for the livin', I won't be givin' up
On you
On you
On you
On you

I should've known, should've tried to hold on
And never left your heart where it don't belong
If the wind would change, bring you back again, my love
Come Hell or high water, we will rise above
You are what I believe in, you are enough

Oh, life's for the the livin', I won't be givin' up
Oh, you taught me how to, you taught me how to love
Take all I cherished, beat me 'til my body's numb
But life's for the livin', I won't be givin' up
On you
On you
On you
On you

Even though, I know you'd tell me to
