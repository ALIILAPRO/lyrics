		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear, please don't reply, bye
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, yeah
Take a sip revive, take a trip to the down south, yeah

I be flying high, can't you tell from my red eyes?
Took a trip from Paris down to Houston for your apple pie
Where the girls get way too drunk
And they got that in they trunk
Now turn around and show the world
How you shake that rumpty rump
Say it, we don't fuck with cops
Oh no, we don't fuck with cops
In my backseat, I got four freaks
Who love how my speakers knock
Don't bring no sand to the beach
All we want is love and peace
Go find a girl before you get home
'Cause we about to take a flight to go be on, yeah

(It's true)
It seems like flying's all I do
(All I do)
There's no one's seated next to you
(Next to you)
In the meantime, I'll watch colors change in the sky
And I'll watch you go by (get down)

I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, it take long to get this fly
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye

(Get down)
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, it take long to get this fly
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye
