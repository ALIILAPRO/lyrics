		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's no surprise, it's what you'd expect to find.
A culture adrift in-between space and time.
Naked our arms, our fabric has come undone.
Clinging to threads on the edge of oblivion.

If this is the last time that we speak
It won't be the last time that I breathe.
It's not a hope or a farce, but a dream that's gone too far.
I'd say forever seems just a little out of reach.

Tell me again what you think you came here for.
We've been lifeless for years. Why would we ask for more?

If this is the last time that we speak
It won't be the last time that I breathe.
It's not a hope or a farce, but a dream that's gone too far.
I'd say forever seems just a little out of reach.
