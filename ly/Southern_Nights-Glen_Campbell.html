		  Southern nights
Have you ever felt a southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed southern skies? (Them southern skies)
Well, it's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog that walked the old land
Ev'ry flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy
Joy

Feel so good
It feel so good
It's frigth'ning
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good it's fright'ning
Wish I could (southern skies)
Stop this world from fighting
(Southern skies) have you ever-
