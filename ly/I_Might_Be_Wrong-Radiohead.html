		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Open up and let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Keep it moving
Keep it moving
Ah, ah
Ah
