		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's party time
별이 깨어나는 까만 여름밤
It's party time
너의 잠을 훔쳐 떠나 we go far
한 여름밤 숲속의 이야기를 만들어봐
Right here, just you and I (ah)

터뜨려 fireworks
신비한 일들이 일어날 거야
(Hey, buckle up, get ready, get ready to dance)
눈을 맞춰
저 달이 반쯤 잠이 든 지금 이 순간
(Hey, buckle up, get ready, get ready to dance)

이 숲속을 떠도는 hitchhiker
데려갈게, 니가 원하는 location
(Hey) 여기 이 순간에
(Hey) the world just stop spinning
(Hey) 끝이 없는 밤
Mixx it up, go

Come on over right now
Come on over right now
'Cause party is not a party without you
Hurry up, join the party

Waiting for you right now
Waiting for you right now
마법에 걸린 밤 꿈을 꿔 우린
You know that

Beep-beep, jingling, jingling
Keep-keep mingling, mingling
You are my answer tonight (don't stop)

Beep-beep, jingling, jingling
Keep-keep mingling, mingling
I'll be your answer tonight (don't stop)

하나둘 모여들어 이건 party invitation
머리 위로 흩날리는 confetti
Get ready, celebration
시작해 parade 우리의
Walking down dream avenue
꽃들의 환호 소리에 feeling so untrue

이 숲속에 자, 별가루를 뿌려
더 가볼게, 닿지 못할 달의 station
(Hey) show your face id
(Hey) eye to eye with me
(Hey) it's unlocked, baby
Swipe up, let's go

Come on over right now
Come on over right now
'Cause party is not a party without you
Hurry up, join the party

Waiting for you right now
Waiting for you right now
마법에 걸린 밤 꿈을 꿔 우린
You know that

Beep-beep, jingling, jingling
Keep-keep mingling, mingling
You are my answer tonight (don't stop)

Beep-beep, jingling, jingling
Keep-keep mingling, mingling
I'll be your answer tonight
(I'll be your answer tonight) Nmixx

It's party time
별이 깨어나는 까만 여름밤 (hey, hey)
It's party time
너의 잠을 훔쳐 떠나 we go far (that's right)
한 여름밤 숲속의 이야기를 만들어봐 (hey, hey)
Right here, just you and I
'Cause with you, it's a party

It's a party, every time when you're next to me
So now it's a party tonight (now it's a party)
It's a party (party), every time when you're next to me (party, yeah)
So now it's a party tonight (come on over)

Come on over right now
Come on over right now
'Cause party is not a party without you (it's not a party without you)
Hurry up, join the party

Waiting for you right now
Waiting for you right now
마법에 걸린 밤 꿈을 꿔 우린
(It's not a party) you know that
