		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We been overseas, Palermo by the beach
Which one you want? (Yeah), I think I'm 'bout to tweak
Know it's weighin' on your mind, it's weighin' as we speak (yeah)
You say, "It's all fine," but it was bad last week (week)
You say you wanna talk as we speak
You say you wanna walk, move them feet (feet)
Lay 'em down in chalk, dead in the street (yeah)
Always lose my mind (yeah)
Put in on the timeline (yeah), put in on the Instagram
Put it on the limelight, put it on her head right
Conscious on the bedside (yeah), not a phone in sight
All we call is the night (yeah), oh, you wanna feel? Alright
I'ma show you how to feel (yeah), but I'll tell you this first
Last supper was my meal, I need blood to converse
Wipe my hands of the deal (yeah), put it in a hearse
(Yeah)
Worse come to worst, put it on a verse, put it on the moon
Worse come worst, I don't want the words, I want ya room
First come first, but come first, yeah, and I'll serve you
They all want the new me, but I want the old you
Tell me what you did, put in on the light
I am down to rage, I am down to fight (yeah, yeah)
All you ever do is ride it like a bike
What come first? Everything worse (woo)
Everything worse
Take a break first
'Fore you get heated, 'fore you get worse (yeah)
I can't put it into words but I do it first (look)

Shout to Big Boat, I'm so concrete
Just made ten mil' as we speak (yeah)
Like snow to the 6ix, like sand to the beach
She wanna bring her friend, girl, I got no backseat, fuck (ooh)
Back in America, fuckin' a hoe from the ratchetest area, what?
Spanish hoes love me, they talk to me like I'm from Latin America, what?
We know your girl, she get tossed in the circle like Captain America, what?
You boys are jokin', it's actually embarrassin'
Me and Lil Twizzy's just slappin' in Maryland (uh)
Losses I took but like, "Fuck it, oh well"
Really can't even spell ball with no L's
They love to act like they hot on my trail
Thought he was big 'til I got on the scale
My nigga flicked up with an Owl chain on in the Range
Don't know how he got it in jail (woo, woo)

Don't know
No idea, no idea
Don't know, don't know
Don't know (I'm back again, yeah)

Let the money come first, let the money converse
We got billion dollar money, which one first?
I could put you in this building, I could give you much worse
I could tear it all down, make a huff and puff hurt
And you cheaper than some dirt
I'll make this shit hurt
Yeah, take you to the edge
And push you off the Earth
And all I wanna see is somethin'
And all I wanna feel is somethin'
As we speak, it's not for discussion
Time again, you always bluffin'
Yeah, you always bluffin', you always
Hidin' in your roots, hidin' in your lies, always somethin' and
Don't wanna tell the truth, you won't tell them all what you told me, yeah
Yeah, I'ma sit around and I'ma hide, yeah, 'til you find me, yeah
