		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up this morning
I feel so fucking important
I looked in the mirror, I'm different
I finally made a decision

All the rejected that lost a lack of respect in
Themselves 'cause people get hectic
They hurt you and make you feel helpless

They're not brave like you
They're too scared to do
Anything that's different
Anything that new

I don't need lessons
I do what I want, it's refreshing
As soon as you taste independence
You start living life in the present

Hey there, how you been?
I'm the voice in your head
And I know you been aching
When you find me let me in
I got power in my hands and it's yours for the taking

Give me a rule and I'll break it
Your conscience needs a shaking
I've been here before, I know the mistakes you'll be making
Forget the past, it's over, forget being the joker
Let 'em know that your're home and you're in control

Gather 'round, here's how to get what you want
Introduce a new religion of feeling like a boss

You don't need lessons
You do what you want it's refreshing
As soon as you taste independence
You start living life in the present

Hey there, how you been?
I'm the voice in your head
And I know you been aching
When you find me let me in
I got power in my hands and it's yours for the taking

Hey there, how you been?
I'm the voice in your head
And I know you been aching
When you find me let me in
I got power

This power is yours for the taking
This power is yours for the taking
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
This power is yours for the taking
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
This power is yours for the taking

This power is yours for the taking
This power is yours
Take it
