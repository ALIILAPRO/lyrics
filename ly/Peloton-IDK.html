		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, I typed a text to a girl I used to know
Like, "Baby, I done changed, see I had some time to grow"
"No", was the reply, followed by my, "Why?
Like you don't need nobody that's gon' follow by your side"
She say, "One day you gon' know exactly how it feels"

Payback is a dog (dog, it's a dog)
(Cash-Cash-Cash-Cash-Money-Money-AP)
Payback is a dog (dog, it's a dog, uh-huh, uh, dog)
Payback is a dog (dog, it's a dog, dog)
Payback is a dog (uh-huh, uh, uh, dog)
Payback is a dog (dog, it's a dog)

It make it easy when she see I got a check
Playin' chess like check
Her eyes start to twinkle when she lookin' at my neck (ooh, ooh)
All she say is, "He next"
She call a nigga Peloton, say she wanna ride the bike
She make a nigga ego go high tonight
I hope I don't have to tell a lie tonight
Yeah, so we can lie tonight

Ayy, uh-huh, is he a fine-ass nigga?
Or a waste-a-bitch-time-ass nigga? Uh-huh
You said I was a lyin'-ass nigga
Got the finance on finesse and the bitches
Call my old hoes, I'ma thumb-dance with the digits
Tell her ass she could leave but she fuckin' with the realest
Got hands on her knees when I'm givin' her the business
This the "Feel Good Inc." girl, you movin' with Gorillaz, ayy
Uh-huh, uh, full stop
Emotional intelligence, nah
My mama told me, "Treat her like a lady"
My nigga say, "Treat her like a thot"
Look, I know you worth it
But I got a couple problems bein' perfect
And I know you've got a heart but I got one too
'Fore I ever fuck it up, I'ma say, "Fuck you"

It make it easy when she see I got a check
Playin' chess like check
Her eyes start to twinkle when she lookin' at my neck (ooh, ooh)
All she say is, "He next"
She call a nigga Peloton, say she wanna ride the bike
She make a nigga ego go high tonight
I hope I don't have to tell a lie tonight
Yeah, so we can lie tonight

Uh, I know you in high-demand
But you workin' hard to find a man
You work on yourself, you work on your plans
But we work it hard to work off them pants
Dog shit
I be shootin' shots, baby, I don't miss
When I tell the truth, baby, that ain't it
You say it's me, but we both toxic

You want a nigga with a milli', yeah, or a billi', yeah
Want somebody that be really ballin', not an affiliate
Well, that come with a price, no pun intend'
You say you want a nigga that's gon' pay that rent
Don't cook, don't clean 'cause you ain't no maid
Don't serve no nigga 'cause you ain't no slave
What if they call you a bitch and you look at me
And I say, "Trick, I am not your security"?
Like, what would you think?
Would you be in shock or not even blink?
Would you expect anything
All 'cause I'm a man and that's what it bring?
To my unborn girl, yeah, you know you my world
If you fuck with any nigga, I'ma need a referral
And if you know you got a role, better play your part
'Cause that's karma for me if he break your heart

It make it easy when she see I got a check
Playin' chess like check
Her eyes start to twinkle when she lookin' at my neck (ooh, ooh)
All she say is, "He next"
She call a nigga Peloton, say she wanna ride the bike
She make a nigga ego go high tonight
I hope I don't have to tell a lie tonight
Yeah, so we can lie tonight

Payback is a dog (dog, it's a dog)
Payback is a dog (dog, it's a dog)
Payback is a dog (dog, it's a dog)
Payback is a dog
