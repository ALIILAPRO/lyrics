		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sex so good when you in your feelings
Sex so good

Text from you said, "Come see me" (come see me)
'Cause you don't like when we don't speak (we don't speak), oh-oh
Baby, you could use some company
Oh-oh (oh), but you look so good when you tight with me
So good, so good

Leave you on read, yeah (read, yeah)
I know how to get in your head, yeah (head, yeah)
Oh, you'd rather meet me in your bed, yeah (bed, yeah)
And before you cut me off, I'll come through and break you off, shawty (oh)
Oh, I got your legs up (legs up)
Make you forget you even said somethin' (said somethin')
Oh, that shit taste better when you fed up
All of this passion make the sex so good

Sex so good when you in your feelings, woah
But you can't stay mad when I'm all up in it, can't stay mad (oh, woah)
I got your legs up (legs up)
Make you forget you even said somethin' (said somethin')
Oh, that shit taste better when you fed up (fed up), oh
All of this passion make the sex so good

(Sex so good)
All of this passion make the sex so good
(Sex so good, sex so good)
Yeah, yeah

Something 'bout it just hits different when you mad at me
Your attitude turn you to a freak
I might get you to the point, make you wanna leave
But you don't ever keep that energy
'Cause I know you only act like that for me to come close
'Cause you know I'ma have to put it on you
All that frustration, take it out on me
If I hit decline, you gon' go OD

Leave you on read, yeah (read, yeah)
I know how to get in your head, yeah (head, yeah)
Oh, you'd rather meet me in your bed, yeah (bed, yeah)
And before you cut me off, I'll come through and break you off, shawty (oh)
Oh, I got your legs up (legs up)
Make you forget you even said somethin' (said somethin')
Oh, that shit taste better when you fed up, huh
All of this passion make the sex so good (oh yeah)

Sex so good when you in your feelings, woah (sex so good, yeah)
But you can't stay mad when I'm all up in it (no, no, no), can't stay mad (oh, woah)
I got your legs up (legs up, legs up)
Make you forget you even said somethin' (even said somethin')
That shit taste better when you fed up, oh
All of this passion make the sex so good
Sex so good when you in your feelings (yeah, yeah), woah
But you can't stay mad when I'm all up in it (no, no, no), can't stay mad
I got your legs up (in the air, legs up)
Make you forget you even said somethin' (said somethin')
That shit taste better when you fed up (fed up), oh
All of this passion make the sex so good

Good, good
All of this passion make the sex so good
So good
Make the sex so good
Oh
Make the sex so good
That's right, bae, just ride it, baby
