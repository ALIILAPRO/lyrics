		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catch my breath and hold it for me
I'm wasting my time, tryna make up my mind
Oh, I'm sitting here as the chandelier is whispering in my ear
Saying, "Can I get a cigarette?"
I know you'll never be mine

Can you come around tonight
And sing me a lullaby?
Just take my heart and break it
Can you come around tonight?
I might be the enemy
But nothing quite hits like you

Come on, take this pen and write for me
Oh, write me a song and I'll try to forget it
Oh, I'm standing there as the man upstairs
Comes crashing through the ceiling
Saying, "Where's my fucking cigarette?"
With fire in his eyes

Can you come around tonight
And sing me a lullaby?
Just take my heart and break it
Can you come around tonight?
I might be the enemy
But nothing quite hits like you

And as on my patience, starts to dry
And my feeling skids across the sand
They'll know that you've won
And I'll run back to where I came from
