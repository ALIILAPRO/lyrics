		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my hard 
In hard times 
But I bide
Waiting on good times 

I got you all numb in mad times 
You call me at night 
Cause you can't shut-eye 

We're running all the red lights 
Like we on a drive-by 
You give me all your bad advice 
I drink it like red wine 
Swimming in your cold eyes 
Like it's a summer high 
Got me and my hands tied 
Going through it all 

Let it go now 
Let you go now 
If you come back to me 
Must be meant to be 

Let it go now 
Let your guard down 
Show yourself to me 
Sin so bittersweet 

We're running all the red lights 
Like we on a drive-by 
You give me all your bad advice 
I drink it like red wine 
Swimming in your cold eyes 
Like it's a summer high 
Got me and my hands tied 
Going through it all
