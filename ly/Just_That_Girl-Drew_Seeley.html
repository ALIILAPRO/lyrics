		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (She, that girl)
(I know it)
(She, that girl)
(I know it)

Sometimes feels like everybody wants something from me
You don't understand I can only be one person, that's Joey
I got game, got fame got everything in this world I need

(It's the girl) I don't know her name
'Cause I've only met her in my dreams
But I'm gonna find her 'cause she's

Just that girl
The one that's dancing through my mind
Just that girl
The girl that I've been trying to find
Just that girl
Her style's crazy she's a dime
And it's almost like I could see her
She's just that girl

Something happens when you groove
Earth beneath you starts to move
It's so bad I'm looking at you
'Cause she's just that girl

Crazy how you work that frame
You and me, we could change the game
What's your secret? What's your name?
That girl

To me you're a star
When you move you're off the charts
You've already won my heart
That girl

To me you're a star
You don't have to play the part
You can be just who you are
'Cause you're just that girl

The one that's dancin' through my mind
Just that girl, the girl that I've been tryna find
Just that girl, her style is crazy, she's a dime
And it's almost like I can see her, she's just that girl

She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
That girl baby, just that girl

She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
That girl baby, just that girl

Just that picture in my mind I see
And I can't wait for the day we meet
Baby, we'd be so fly, baby just you and I
I wanna give you the world 'cause you're

Just that girl, the one that's dancin' through my mind
Just that girl, the girl that I've been tryna find
Just that girl, her style is crazy, she's a dime
And it's almost like I can see her, she's just that girl

She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
Baby, just that girl

She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
Baby, just that girl

The one that's dancin' through my mind
Just that girl, the girl that I've been tryna find
Just that girl, her style is crazy she's a dime
Almost like I can see her, she's just that girl

She's just that girl
Just that girl
Baby, I know that she's the one, one
