		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got the cheat code
Got-got-got-got-got the cheat code

Happy life is a happy wife
And I got me mine
Got an appetite for the finer side
Keep her satisfied
On a need to know what she need to know
I don't tell her no
Gotta keep it hot, gotta hit the spot
Make it afterglow
Leave her with the fever

Kiss her like a stranger I've never met
That body pleasured, keep her interested, oh
Get her out of her head, oh

Gotta treat your girl special for the rest of her life
Step it up another level if you wanna survive
If you wanna know the secret, I'll save you some time
Got the cheat code, got-got-got-got-got the cheat code

Gotta love her like a lover, keep on blowing her mind
Gotta touch her like you're touching for the first time
If you wanna know the secret, I'll save you some time
Got the cheat code, got-got-got-got-got the cheat code

Happy house is a happy spouse
And she got her boy
Give him what he needs, maybe on her knees
And we redeploy
It's a goddess, I'm getting up behind
Body looking fine
Give her what she want and it's when she want
Put in overtime
I just wanna feel her

Kiss her like a stranger I've never met
That body pleasured, keep her interested, oh
Get her out of her head, oh

Gotta treat your girl special for the rest of her life
Step it up another level if you wanna survive
If you wanna know the secret, I'll save you some time
Got the cheat code, got-got-got-got-got the cheat code

Gotta love her like a lover, keep on blowing her mind
Gotta touch her like you're touching for the first time
If you wanna know the secret, I'll save you some time
Got the cheat code, got-got-got-got-got the cheat code
