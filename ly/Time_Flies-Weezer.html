		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had another birthday, could've been the worst day
I ever had
Got a little drunk, and I fell into a funk
And I woke up sad
Looked into the mirror
There were lines around my eyes

Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you live on the run
The harder I go, the more I realize
Time flies

Life is moving fast and I'm running out of gas
Time ain't on my side
I'm still in the race and I'm barely keeping pace
But it's worth the ride
Waiting round the corner
There's another sweet surprise

Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you live on the run
The harder I go, the more I realize
Time flies

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Time flies
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Time flies

Some sad day, they'll be taking me away
But I won't be dead
'Cause even when I'm gone 
This stupid dance song will be in your head
I'll be looking down with a twinkle in my eyes

Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you live on the run
The harder I go, the more I realize
Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you live on the run
The harder I go, the more I realize
Time flies
