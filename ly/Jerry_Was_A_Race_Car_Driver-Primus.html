		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jerry was a race car driver
And he drove so goddamn fast
He never did win no checkered flag
But he never did come in last
Jerry was a race car driver
He'd say el sob number one
With a Bocephus sticker
On his 442 he'd light 'em up
Just for fun

Captain Pierce was a fireman
Richmond engine number three
I'll be a wealthy man when I get
A dime for all the things that
Man taught to me
Captain pierce was a strong man
Strong as any man alive
It stuck in his craw that they
Made him retire at the age of 65

Jerry was a race car driver
22 years old
Had one too many cold beers one night
And wrapped himself around a telephone pole.
