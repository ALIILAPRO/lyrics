		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A roaring lion, walketh about
Seeking whom he may (devour)
(Ronny J, please turn me up)

Take some rain, nonstop
Rain, don't want war
Rain come, rain come
Come shine, come rain, good month
South side, let it bang
Outside let it rain
Rain down on the pain
Rain down on the slain
Rain down for my mom (ooh)
Rain down on the farm (ah)
Shower us with your love (ha)
Wash us in the blood (ooh)
Drop this for the thugs (ah)
Know I grew up in the mud (ha)
The top is not enough
Wash us in the blood (ah)

Is there anybody here? (Ha)
Is there anybody here? (Ooh)
That can save, no matter how much he player-hate? Hahaha
It was the blood that (ooh)
It was the blood that (God)
It was the blood that cleansed me, ha
It was the (ooh)

Shower down on us (ah)
Wash us in the blood (ha)
Wash us in the blood (ooh)
Whole life bein' thugs (ah)
No choice, sellin' drugs (ha)
Southside what it does? (God)
Rain down on us (ah)
Genocide, what it does (ha)
Slavery, what it does (ooh)
Rain down on us (ah)
Whole life sellin' drugs (ha)

Wash us in the blood (ooh)
Wash us in Your blood (ah)
Wash us in the blood (and as we live in this evil)
Wash us in the blood (and crooked and just pathetic world)
Wash us in the blood 

Holy Spirit, come down (come take)
Holy Spirit, come down (come down)
Holy Spirit, help now (way down)
Holy Spirit, help now (uh, uh)
Holy Spirit, come down
Holy Spirit, come down (ayy)
Holy Spirit, help now (come down)
Holy Spirit, help now (yeah)

Wash us in the blood (yeah)
Whole life bein' thugs (ha)
No choice, sellin' drugs (ooh)
Genocide, what it does (ah)
Mass incarc', what it does (ha)
Cost a cause, what it does (ooh)
'Nother life bein' lost (whoa)

Let it off, set it off
Execution, thirty states (that's why)
Thirty states still execute (ah)
Thou shall not kill 
I should not spill Nextels at the rendez-vous (oh)
We dodgin' time in the Federal (get 'em)
Squad box you in like a sectional (oh, no)
We walk through the blast and the residue (oh)
Now look what we headed to (ah)

Rain down on us (ha)
Rain down on us (ooh)
Wash us in the blood (ah)
Wash us in the blood (ha)
Holy spirit, come down (ooh)
Holy spirit, come down (ah)
And they tryna control 'Ye (ha)
They want me to calm down (ooh)

They don't want me to Kanye
They don't want Kanye to be Kanye
They wanna sign a fake Kanye
They tryna sign a calm 'Ye
That's right I call him Calm-Ye
But don't take me the wrong way (no)
But don't take me the wrong way (ah)
'Cause God took me a long way (ha)
They wanna edit the interviews (we)
They wanna take it to interludes (need)
Cut a whole sentence to interlude (to get back)
You know that it's fake if it's in the news (home)
So I let it fly when I'm in the booth (ah)
The devil a lie and I been the truth (ha)
Livid 'cause nobody livin' and nobody gettin' it
Doin' it different (ah)

Rain down on us (ha)
Holy spirit, come down (ooh)
Holy spirit, come down (ah)
We need you now
Wash us in the blood (ooh)
Whole life bein' thugs (ah)
No choice, sellin' drugs (no)
Genocide, what it does
Slavery, what it does
