		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know ya
Gonna tap ya shoulda
Nice to know ya
It was nice to show ya what i like

We floatin' all across the ocean
We just might, we noticed
Oh, oh yeah we noticed

You actin' like you don't know
I can see inside your soul
Can you drop it we all know
Or i might just have to go

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
You is just a fucking bitch
You should back out you should quit
Shoot em down i never miss

Miss, miss, never miss you
Miss, miss, never miss you
Miss, miss, never miss you
Ouuu ouuu ouuu ou ou

Just so you know yeah i know yeah its alright
I won't tell a soul, not a soul, secrets all mine
Let me see the tears in your eyes its ok to cry
Don't know why i even try see ya bye bye

You actin' like you don't know
I can see inside your soul
Can you drop it we all know
Or i might just have to go

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
You is just a fucking bitch
You should back out you should quit
Shoot em down i never miss

Miss, miss, never miss you
Miss, miss, never miss you
Miss, miss, never miss you
Ouuu ouuu ouuu ou ou
