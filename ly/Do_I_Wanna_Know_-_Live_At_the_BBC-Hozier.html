		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like something in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found 
That makes me think of you somehow 
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

Do I wanna know
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Sort of hoping that you'd stay
Darling we both know
That the nights were mainly made 
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too 
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Do I wanna know
If this feeling goes both ways?
It's sad to see you go
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
Darling we both know
That the nights were mainly made 
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day


Oh, crawling back to you 

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too (was sort of hoping that you stay)
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new (flows both ways)
Now I've thought it through (had a few)


Crawling back to you (was sort of hoping that you stay)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? 
(Flows both ways)
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too (was sort of hoping that you stay)
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new (flows both ways)
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you (was sort of hoping that you stay)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? 
(Flows both ways)
'Cause I always do
