		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a precious stone 
You're out on your own 
You know everyone in the world 
But you feel alone 
Daddy won't let you weep 
Daddy won't let you ache 
Daddy gives you as much as you can take 
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 

A little uptight 
You're a baby's fist 
Butterfly kisses up and down your wrist 
When you see daddy coming 
You're licking your lip 
Nails bitten down to the quick 
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 

You've got a head full of traffic 
You're a siren's song 
You cry for mama 
And daddy's right along 
He gives you the keys to a flamin' car 
Daddy's with you wherever you are 
Daddy's a comfort 
Daddy's your best friend 
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end 
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday's 
Alright
