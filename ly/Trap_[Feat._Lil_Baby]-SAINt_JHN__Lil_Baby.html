		  (Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, yeah)
(Fallen)

Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was

Trap, she do licks
She the one I forget
She do coke, she do blow
She do dope, make a list
This the life, don't forget
Sober nights, make it lit
She the one, you the one
I'm the one, what a trick
I ain't never tellin' lies, cross my heart and hope to die
If it's real, it's real forever, may we never testify
Put the pedal to the floor, look the devil in the eye
If you tell me that you love me, promise not to change your mind

We like sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the light?
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police

Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was

Trap, only thing we ever had to do was trap
I was breakin' down bales and now I switched it to rap
'Member shawty was the man, like, "Damn, nigga, what happened?"
I'ma keep chasin' the money, as far as I ever see
Had to kick my double-cup, feel like it was killin' me
I was sittin' in the spot, I ain't never missed a beat
If I feel it in my heart, I'ma put it on a beat, like
Run down on 'em, don't trip
Make sure your whole clip fit
I know it's hard livin', tryna survive this bullshit
I'm a part of my niggas, we all gon' get rich
Still remember sellin' two-for-five
Now I have a million dollar ride
Still be havin' thoughts about the guys

(Only love a real nigga ever knew was-)
We like sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the lights?
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police

Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was
