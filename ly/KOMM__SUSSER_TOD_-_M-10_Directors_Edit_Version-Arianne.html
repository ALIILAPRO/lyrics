		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know, I know I've let you down
I've been fool to myself
I thought that I could live for no one else
But now through all the hurt pain
It's time for me to respect
The ones you love mean more than anything

So with sadness in my heart
Feel the best thing I could do
Is end it all and leave forever
What's done is done it feels so bad
What once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again, my world is ending

I wish that I could turn back time
'Cause now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without the trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love & pride
Because of that, it's kill in me inside

It all returns to nothing
It all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing
I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down

In my heart of hearts, I know that I called never love again
I've lost everything, everything
Everything that matters to me, matters in this world

I wish that I could turn back time
'Cause now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without the trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love & pride
Because of that, it's kill in me inside

It all returns to nothing
It just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing
I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down
It all returns to nothing
It just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing
I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down

Ah-ah-ah-ah, tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
Ah-ah-ah-ah, letting me down, letting me down, letting me down
Ah-ah-ah-ah, tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
Ah-ah-ah-ah, letting me down, letting me down, letting me down
