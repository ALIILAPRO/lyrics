		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy, JC (hey, now you know)
What's up Enron (inhale, exhale with my flow)
Ain't that Snoop Dogg over there?
What, that nigga with that blue coat on? (Breakaway)
Yeah (talkin' like this)
Hell yeah, that's the nigga (the LE to the Z, two times, don't miss)
Nigga, roll up on the side of him, man (ain't nothing to do)
Roll your window down (if you break you get broke)
Man, hand me my motherfucking Glock man, give me another clip (Me and Mr. G and it go smoke)
'Cause I'm finna smoke this fool
Yeah, roll the window down
Yeah, okay there he go
Ayy man, you Snoop Dogg?
Snoop, Snoop Doggy Dogg? (huh?)
Man, you Snoop Dogg fool
Man, fuck that nigga 
Nigga, man
Get that nigga, man
Man, get up fool, man (get up), get up man, he trying to run, man
Dump on that fool man, I don't give a fuck (what? Get that sucker now)
Fuck you, nigga, uh
Yeah nigga, what's up?
Nigga
Yeah, mothafucka
Yeah nigga, one less nigga (yeah, yeah)
Yeah nigga, you's a dead motherfucker now (fuck that nigga, man)

As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking tryna save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
Oh, will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my mama and my daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some P's to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my mama a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag'
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
'Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the Grey Goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with a izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas 'cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level, three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
'Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I'll put that on my mama, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
