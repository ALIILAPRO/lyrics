		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, whoa whoa, ooh, whoa whoa

Any time that you want
I'll be here in your arms
Silently holding on
To the girl with the charms

But if there comes a day
You should turn your heart away
I'll be down on my knees
Begging for that girl to stay

Don't let go
Ooh, whoa whoa
Don't let go
Ooh, whoa whoa

Anything you desire
I will set at your feet
With a kiss in the air
For the Gods to receive

But if there comes a day
You should turn your heart away
I'll be down on my knees
Begging for that girl to stay

Confrontations in my mind
Got me running out of time

Don't let go
Ooh, whoa whoa
Don't let go
Ooh, whoa whoa

But if there comes a day
You should turn your heart away
I'll be down on my knees
Begging for that girl to stay

Confrontations in my mind
Got me running out of time
Don't let go
Ooh, whoa whoa
Don't let go
Ooh, whoa whoa
Don't let go
Ooh, whoa whoa
Don't let go
