		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doctorin' the house
Doctorin', doctorin'

We've got a hot one for you
Can you take care of it?
We've got a hot one for you
Can you take care of it?

Yeah, you just hit me

Listen, listen
Listen for the beat box, beat dis
Now who's jackin' the house?
That wicked plastic man

Doctorin' the house
Doctorin'
We're doctorin' the house
Doctorin'
So clap your hands to what he's doin'

Woah, yeah, woah, yeah
Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?

Hey, baby
You want to dance with me?
That's right
It's an attack

Oh, boy
What a great record
I say, I say
The sound of now
That wicked plastic man

Doctorin' the house
Doctorin'
We're doctorin' the house
Doctorin', doctorin'

Listen, listen
Listen for the beat box, beat dis
Now who's jackin' the house?
That wicked plastic man

How do they do that?
It's really quite simple
You just mingle
That wicked plastic man

Doctorin' the house
Doctorin'
We're doctorin' the house
Doctorin', doctorin'

Ah, sure is cruel of you cats to leave me all alone
By myself to watch this little old kid playing actually

Say kids, what time is it?
It's time for house
I am the magnificent

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
The music maker

Doctorin' the house
Doctorin'
We're doctorin' the house
Doctorin', doctorin'

Oh, my goodness
You'll see the plastic men are coming
They're coming
Plastic man, plastic man
