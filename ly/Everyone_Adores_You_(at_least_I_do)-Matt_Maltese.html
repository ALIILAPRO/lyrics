		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can act all shy
But you know that I want you
In the dead of night
I want to live with you

So terrified 
Of the road that takes you
Me too
Don't modify
Everyone adores you
At least I do

Right where the blackbird sighs I look at you
Through and through, yeah
Right where your father died
I hold on to your hand

So terrified 
Of the road that takes you
Me too
Don't modify
Everyone adores you
At least I do (da, da, da)

Everybody has you up on their wall sometimes
Everybody thinks of you when they sleep at night
When I say everybody I'm actually referring to me
