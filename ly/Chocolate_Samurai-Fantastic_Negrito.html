		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You've got to)

Have you lost your mind yet?
To get free tonight

To all of your friends that come over
And get free tonight

Clap your hands in time
Get free tonight, yeah

Now the whole world is watching
Get free tonight

It's your mind, body and soul food tonight
Let your mind, body and soul feel it tonight

Power

Have you lost your mind yet?
Get free tonight

(Now listen)
My people, my teachers, my soldiers
Let's get free tonight

When the bomb drop are you ready?
Let's get free tonight

Shake your body 'til you
Shake your body 'til you
(Get free tonight)
Lose your mind

Let your mind, body and soul feel it tonight
Oh, let your mind, body and soul feel it tonight

Said, you got to be ready

Power

(You got to be ready)

When I was king
My mind would sing
Shake 'em again

(Get up for me)

My only friend
Spun the rhythm
Pulse me the rhythms
Slide 'em to the river
Trying to make a living with all that you've been given
Out of control like Vincent van Gogh
Penniless and broke
Goin' to California 
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke

We got to get ready
For the new cold

Power

Power

Y'all better be ready

Power

Nobody remember they gonna come

(The call of the wild)

(Shake 'em up baby)

Yeah

Eat less sugar
Have more sex
Eat less sugar
And have less stress

(I'm partying with Satan right now)

It's never too late to achieve your dreams
It's never too late to achieve your dreams

Back in my day we used to put the syrup on the pancakes
Not mix it with Sprite
Back in the day
Back in the day, yeah
