		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does heaven have a dealer? Do they sell the love for cheaper than in Hollywood?
As hell is gettin' colder, I don't plan on gettin' older in this neighborhood
I've seen the sunset rise through dilated eyes, but I can't keep this goin'
So when the sunrise sets and the beat has left my chest, oh, I think it's worth knowin'

When we die
Tell me, can we still get high?
When we die
Tell me, can we still get high?

If you fall far too deep
Lose yourself in your new life
Head over heels for your new eyes
Let's name change, you're a new wife
I wanna know
Do you still keep your promises
And make your time for me?
I have a prophecy, yeah, I think you're immortal, oh
Yeah, hey, it's a sight to see
When you come back to me, I won't hold it over your head
To escape the realities

Come and do drugs with me
Come and do drugs with me (can we still get high?)
Come and do drugs with me (can we still get high?)
Hey, hey
Can we still get high?
Can we still get high?
Can we still get high?
Can we still get high?

When we die
Tell me, can we still get high?
When we die
Tell me, can we still get high?
