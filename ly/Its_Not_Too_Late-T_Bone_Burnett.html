		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The wind turns like a dagger
The rain falls like a hammer
The sky has grown dark
But it's not too late

The weather crashes down
What's lost cannot be found
The night is closing
But it's not too late

It's not too late
It's not too late
It's not too late
It's not too late
The atmosphere is lethal
But I will fear no evil

The ocean rolls like thunder
The tempest pulls us under
The dogs are howling
But it's not too late

As broken structures rust
False idols turn to dust
All lies in ashes
And it's not too late

It's not too late
It's not too late
It's not too late
It's not too late
The atmosphere is lethal
But I will fear no evil

In the dark before the dawn
The echo of the siren's song
Dies away like a ghost
As the day breaks

It's not too late
It's not too late
It's not too late
It's not too late
The atmosphere is lethal
But I will fear no evil
