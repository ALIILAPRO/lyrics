		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You had one to many coffees
And your slippers are Versace
In my daydreams
Just to gain a little insight
I moved into your eyeline
In the moon beams

I bet your exes scarred your heart
Bet you're the fool who fell too hard
Bet I could show you after dark

Bet I hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightening super frightening, yeah
Hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightening super frightening, yeah
Hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightening super frightening, yeah
Hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightening super frightening, yeah

Thinking chronologically
Ecstasy technology
MDMA, SMR you wanna?

Make out on the balcony
It's organic alchemy
Rub my hands
And I'll rub on your shoulders

I bet exes scared your heart
Bet you're the fool who fell too hard

Bet I hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightning super frightening, yeah
Hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightning super frightening, yeah
Hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightning super frightening, yeah
Hit you with that bad bitch thunder lightning super frightening, yeah

Serotonin got me screaming, "Love, love, love" now

Serotonin got me screaming, Love, love, love, now
Serotonin got me screaming, Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Need me

Need me, why don't you let it show?
If you need me, why don't you let it show?
If you need me, why don't you let it show?
