		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let’s have a conversation in the name of reciprocity
My souls conspiring and colluding with the darkest enemy
My spirits evolution, in spite of everyfucking thing
Is never ending
My hearts defending
Communion with every living thing

So far all I know is that I don’t know anything anymore 
The further down I go this rabbit hole
The world I know simply disappears

Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please?
My soul is so diseased
This worlds de-evolution is an illusion of the mind
It can never be done
The war can never be won
Because it never begun
Because there is no time

So far all I know is that I don’t know anything anymore 
The further down I go this rabbit hole
The world I know simply disappears 

Every time I think I’m right 
I find out sooner than I’d like 
That everything’s not black and white 
And then there’s entropy

Nothing is as it appears
The soul of God is broken mirrors
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
And then there’s you and me

I decay 
I decay
I decay
I don’t fucking know anything
I decay
I don’t fucking know anything

So far all I know is that I don’t know anything anymore 
The further down I go this rabbit hole
The world I know simply disappears

So far all I know is that I don’t know
The world I know simply disappears
So far all I know is that I don’t know
The world I know simply disappears
