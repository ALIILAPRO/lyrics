		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seething with a hunger only you can fill.
I am the specimen you bend to your will.
You pertain to everything I despise and it shows.
My body burns and throes.
This love I yearn for, is hard to see.
Through trails of smoke and enkindled trees.
I have to be free...

You suspect.
You suspect.
You suspect...

But I know.
Just how it feels to be pushed aside.
And I know.
Just how many demons still reside.
I'm alone, all alone, in every essence bar my mind.
My little ventricle of light. 
I know...

Place me in containment, away from harm.
All but yours, I long for calm.
I pertain to everything you detest and it shows.
The light will swell and grow.
This world I cling to, is history.
Through walls of bodies and apathy.
I need some relief...

You suspect.
You suspect.
You suspect...

But I know.
Just how it feels to be pushed aside.
And I know.
Just how many demons still reside.
I'm alone, all alone, in every essence bar my mind.
My little ventricle of light. 
I know.
Just how it feels to be locked away.
And I know.
How you wish my ailment falls astray. 
I'm overthrown, overthrown by something I cannot quell.
My little vestibule of hell.
I know.
