		  Stories in motion
Causin' commotion
Constant devotion
Don't wanna drown in your ocean
No, no
Slowin' the process
Fuckin' up progress
Hard to acknowledge
Puttin' on mileage

Yeah, that's enough, enough
I had enough, enough
Oh, it's enough, enough
I had enough, enough
Yeah, that's enough, enough (stories in motion)
I had enough, enough (stories in motion)
Oh, it's enough, enough
I had enough, enough

I been doin' work on me, and you been workin' too
Slipped a couple times, but I got nothin' else to lose
Makin' no excuse, I got a lot of shit to prove
Cleanin' up the mess from every lie I had to choose
Was scared to show my flaws, it's hard to fail in front of you
Instead of bein' true, tried play it cool
Covered up a truckload of pain in the coupe
Couldn't drop the news, instead I dropped the roof
Shit done got strange, didn't it? Shouldn't have my name it
Shouldn't have my name on it, stories in the same motion
A lie don't care who tell it, you should see me for the real me
The one who learn from past mistakes, I know you still feel me

Slowin' the process
Fuckin' up progress
Hard to acknowledge
Puttin' on mileage

Yeah, that's enough, enough
I had enough, enough
Oh, it's enough, enough
I had enough, enough
Yeah, that's enough, enough (stories in motion)
I had enough, enough (stories in motion)
Oh, it's enough, enough
I had enough, enough

Yeah, that's enough, enough (mm)
Oh, it's enough, enough
Yeah, that's enough, enough (stories in motion)
Oh, it's enough, enough

Unfortunately, this is my cold era
I lack the emotion that's important to worthy women
It happens when most of the trophy wives is for participation
Scorin' get too easy, everybody reachin'
I am not a player, girl, I'm more official
I misused the "I miss you's," so I ain't confused
That I am food, your eyes Ginsu knives
But I'm not against you, just tired of tryin' with you
I'm tired of buyin' time, and you tired of buyin' tissue
God bless you, God bless you
