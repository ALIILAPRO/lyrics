		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am in a rush, I just have to pack my bag with cash, that flush
And it's certain to get back to my country
Didn't know that it's forbidden, I'm sorry

I am just a simple Russian girl
I've got vodka in my blood
So, I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart

I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart

Now you know - it is common to forget about the law
When especially you love - it's like a tank
It can drive you mad so you can rob a bank

I am just a simple Russian girl
I've got vodka in my blood
So, I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart

I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart

Let me go, I won't ever try to do this anymore
If you let - I'll kiss you in your chicks three times
This is a tradition, don't you be surprised!

I am just a simple Russian girl
I've got vodka in my blood
So, I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart

I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart

Oi, da, lyoly-lyoly-li
Oi, da, lyoly-lyoly-li
Oi, da, lyoly-lyoly-li
Oi, da, lyoly-lyoly-li

I am just a simple Russian girl
I've got vodka in my blood
So, I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart

I dance with brown bears
And my soul is torn apart
