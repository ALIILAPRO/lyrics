		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't stop untill ya shaking
and all ya neighbours know my name
if ya really have to ask
then you know they never came
 
ya know I like it when we're naked
I can really see ya face
when ya singing that loud,
its not a bed, its a stage
 
for  the whole night
like its fast forward
all from one smile
that's my passport
 
in the dark dark
to the sun sun
take off ya dress nananlaa
 
if ya wanna work weekends
then know where i am
call me up in the evening
ye ya know where i am
roll ya eyes to the celling
you can barely stand
if ya wanna work weekends
then know where i am
 
 
i can feel it when I want you
sweet angry kinda hazer
we dont need the love honey
being us is role play
 
I only see you at night, you're my own little moon
when I get too nice, you'll  be outta here soon
 
its that vibe
its night calling
its yours or mine
its a shirt pulling
 
in the dark dark
to the sun sun
take my shirt off and I lallahjakshdbkasd
 
if ya wanna work weekends
then know where i am
call me up in the evening
ye ya know where i am
roll ya eyes to the celling
you can barely stand
if ya wanna work weekends
then know where I am
