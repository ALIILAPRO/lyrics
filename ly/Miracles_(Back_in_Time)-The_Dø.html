		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna, really wanna go?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back?

I still have some pictures on my wall
I still know the places where they're from
I still find all answers in the trees
I still feel the gum under my shoe

How about hauling a bong full of miracles?
How about building a house on the moon?

Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back

I still care about you being well
I still wonder how we conquered hell
I still love this nonsense team we make
I still think we're twisted both the same

How about hauling a bong full of miracles?
How about building a house on the moon?

Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna, really wanna go
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna go back in time?
Do you really wanna, really wanna go
Do you really wanna go back in time?
