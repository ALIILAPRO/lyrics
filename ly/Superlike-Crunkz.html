		  Work 9-5
Not gonna lie
My brain is fried
But its friday night
I wanna fly
Oh oh oh
Pick up my phone
Ready to go
I‘m in the flow
Won’t stay alone
I‘m in control
Oh oh oh
We know that you won’t be the one
But is that a problem?
It’s not a problem! - No
Cause I‘m still gonna take you home
Gotta get it, gotta go

Left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!
You Down for tonight?
Go left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!

Let‘s get it tonight
Left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!
You Down for tonight?
Go left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!
Let‘s get it tonight

I‘m in the crowd
Music too loud
I look around
Don’t really know
This part of town
Oh oh oh
Pick up my phone
Ready to go
I‘m in the flow
I play the role
Enjoy the show
Oh oh oh
We know that you won’t be the one
But is that a problem?
It’s not a problem! - No
Cause I‘m still gonna take you home
Gotta get it, gotta go

Left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!
You down for tonight?
Go left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!
Let‘s get it tonight
Left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!
You down for tonight?
Go left swipe
Right swipe
Oh super like?!
Let‘s get it tonight
