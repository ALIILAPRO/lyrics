		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night lasts forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (loves me better)
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way (nobody)
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody)
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (better than me)
Makes me happy (feel this way)
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (nobody babe) 
Loves me better (nobody babe)
Ain't nobody
Loves me better (than you)

At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (better me)
Can make me feel this way (makes me happy) (makes me feel) this way
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody) 
Loves me better (nobody)
Ain't nobody
Loves me better (nobody babe)
Ain't nobody (nobody babe)
Loves me better (ah make me feel)
Makes me happy (so much love)
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better (ain't nobody)
Makes me happy makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (whoa!)
Loves me better (ain't nobody)
Ain't nobody (make me feel this way)
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody (nobody babe)
Loves me better (nobody babe)
Makes me happy (nobody babe)
Makes me feel this way (ain't nobody no, no, nobody babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, yeah)
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody (say yeah, makes me feel, makes feel this way)
Loves me better 
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
