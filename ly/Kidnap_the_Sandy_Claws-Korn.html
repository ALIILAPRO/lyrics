		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La-la, la-la, la, la, la
La-la, la-la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then turn off all the lights

First we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, throw him in a pot
Bury him for ninety years, then see if he talks

But Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the holding over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

I say that we take a canon, aim it at his door and then
Knock three times, and when he answers, Sandy Claws will be no more
You're so stupid, think now
If blow him up to smithereens
We may loose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean and see if he gets sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew (yum)

We're his little henchmen and we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him and stay on his good side
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one
You're no fun
Shut up

I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
(One, two, three)

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key

La-la, la-la, la, la, la
La-la, la-la, la, la, la
La-la, la-la, la, la, la
La-la, la-la, la, la, la
