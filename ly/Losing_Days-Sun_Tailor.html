		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been losing days, believe me
Ever since the light received me
I've been losing days, I've been losing days
And every night I swear to someone
Every night I care for someone 
I've been losing days, I've been losing days

Oh my love, save all this time we have
I've been losing it, I've been losing it

I'm trying to receive you right now
But nothing can connect us somehow
So sad to see a frown cover up your face
Oh my smile it waits a minute
When I see you fail to see it
We've been losing days, been losing days

Oh my love, save all this time we have
I've been losing it, I've been losing it
