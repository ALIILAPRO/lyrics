		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You (you), you are (you are) my universe
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe, and I

In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes

매일 밤 네게 날아가 (가)
꿈이란 것도 잊은 채, 나
웃으며 너를 만나 (나)
Never-ending forever, baby

You (you), you are (you are) my universe
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

어둠이 내겐 더 편했었지
길어진 그림자 속에서 (eyes)
And they said that we can't be together
Because, because we come from different sides

You (you), you are (you are) my universe
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo) (I)
You make my world light up inside
You make my world light up inside

나를 밝혀주는 건
너란 사랑으로 수 놓아진 별 (별)
내 우주의 넌
또 다른 세상을 만들어 주는 걸

너는 내 별이자 나의 우주니까
지금 이 시련도 결국엔 잠시니까
너는 언제까지나 지금처럼 밝게만 빛나줘
우리는 너를 따라 이 긴 밤을 수놓을 거야

너와 함께 날아가 (가)
When I'm without you, I'm crazy 자
어서 내 손을 잡아 (아)
We are made of each other, baby

You (you), you are (you are) my universe
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
You, you are (you are)
My universe (doo-doo, doo-doo)
I just want (just want)
My universe
You, you are (you are) my universe, and I
