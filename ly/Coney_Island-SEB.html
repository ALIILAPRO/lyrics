		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Back when we used to rock the bases
Phone calls about how we would make it
We were sneaking out our parents' bases
We had to be back by the day's end

Looking up to Chancelor Bennett
He taught us all how to fit in
Then we started bumping Sosa
He met Kanye, he sold out

I've been stacking dollar bills
I've been skipping meals
Tryna reach a mil'
So unhealthy

Growing up is getting real
I've been in my feels
Therapists and pills
If it's helping

I've been trapped inside my past so long
I don't even know where I belong
I've been talking to my therapist
He said, "Move on"
But I'm stuck in my ways
Stuck in my ways, yeah

I'm only 23
So give me time
Only the last few years
Were really mine

I've been catching up to heroes
Who's in they prime
I'm so self-centered
So self-centered

I've been stacking dollar bills
I've been skipping meals
Tryna reach a mil'
So unhealthy

Growing up is getting real
I've been in my feels
Therapists and pills
If it's helping

You ever been trapped in your head, darling?
Trapped in your head
You ever been trapped in your head, darling?
Trapped in your head
