		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next
Didn't know until I saw your face
I was missin' out on every moment
You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?
(I'm into you)

So if it's real
Then darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show

You and I, we go together
You're the sky, I'll be the weather
A pretty thing, the sun and rain, who knew
Oh, yeah
Summer night, perfect occasion
Where am i? You know I'll be waitin' for you
Oh, for you

So if it's real
Then darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show
So if it's real
Then darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show

You shine, you shine
Like forever lasts forever
You shine, you shine
And steal the show

So if it's real
Then darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show
(Started out on a one-way train)
(Always knew where I was gonna go next)
So if it's real (didn't know until I saw your face)
Then darlin', let me know (I was missing out on every moment)
(You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two)
(Would you mind it if I said I'm into you)
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show
