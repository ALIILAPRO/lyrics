		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said she tired of lil' money, need a big boy
Pull up twenty inch blades like I'm Lil' Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixin' up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon
All the housewives pullin' up (up, up, up)
I got a lot of toys
720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (mmh-mmh)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (more forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (see me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin' (I be grinnin'), yeah

Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hundred deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (wow, wow)
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (on me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (know me)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (wow, wow)

Everywhere I go (hey)
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo (wow)
750 Lambo in the Utah snow (skrrt)
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club
Me and Dre came for the
When I got guap, all of y'all disappeared (wow)
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared (cared)
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid (kid)
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit (yeah)
Used to have a lot, but I got more now (yup)
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now (yup)
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy (yeah)

Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (on me)
Hundred deep when I roll like the army (hey)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (wow, wow, wow)
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (goddamn)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (goddamn)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (wow, wow, wow, wow, wow)

(When I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow")
(Ayy, ayy, wow)
Sayin', "Wow"
(Wow)
(Wow)
