		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it
Yeah I can feel it, I can feel it
Yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it
Oh yeah I can feel it, I can feel it
I don't know, I don't know yeah, I don't know

Used to drive a car that ain't running right
Overheats in the day, so I drive at night
And I know it sounds funny but it's real life
Yeah, I know it sounds funny but it's real life
I pulled over cause I died at a red light
I thank God for the hard times 'cause they guaranteed
Without him, I wouldn't be here, let's be clear
I was given 2 cars, I ain't really outta money
Tryna rap, making 9 thousand a year
I don't say things, feel for me, I say cause it's real to me
I go to my grandma's, hoping she can make a meal for me
Now I got some labels on the tables
Saying that they got a deal for me

I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh yeah, yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh yeah, yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it, you know, you know, you know
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it, yeah

In Michigan, them winters cold
We wouldn't wanna turn on the heat, keep the bills low
We sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Yeah, we sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Me in my room mate, we like they don't know
Driving around town in the Grand Prix
People telling me that I should get a plan B
Snow on the windshield, can't see, trying to work
6 in the morning, that's me
Sometimes I miss all those memories
They pop up back in my mind like, "Remember me"
Records stop selling, these people won't care for me
The older you get, the more family is everything

I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it, I said I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it

I can feel it, I can feel it
I said I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it
I said I can feel it, I can feel it

Yeah, I can feel it, I can feel it, yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it, been a long time coming
I can feel it, I can feel it, been a long time coming yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it, yeah I said here we go
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it
I said I can feel it, I can feel it, yeah
