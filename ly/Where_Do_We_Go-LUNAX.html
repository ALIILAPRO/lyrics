		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
What do we know about feeling at home?
Where will we go now?
Shaking the floor down
Out of control but we can’t let it go


Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
All that we know is taking it all
So now we shout loud
Shaking the crowd down
Out of control but we can’t let it go
We can’t let it go


We can’t be stuck in a little world


We’re out of time we won’t let it go
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
What do we know about feeling at home?
Where will we go now?
Shaking the floor down
Out of control but we can’t let it go


Tear up
Clap, clap


All around is catching fire
Our surroundings fall apart
We just walked another mile
We just follow pre-made paths
And I know that we can shine a way
But the old feel that we can’t hold it back
We’re too young to think this sided today
Let us know, where do we go?


Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
What do we know about feeling at home?
Where will we go now?
Shaking the floor down
Out of control but we can’t let it go


Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
All that we know is taking it all
So now we shout loud
Shaking the crowd down
Out of control but we can’t let it go


We can’t let it go
We can’t let it go
We can’t let it go
We can’t let it go
We can’t let it go


Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
We can’t let it go


Turn it up now
Clap, clap
