		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dollars all around
Oh, there's dollars all around
Dolla, dolla bills, yeah
Dolla, dolla bills
You're on my frequency
You've been staring at me
Since you walked in the bar
I don't really know how long though

I don't need no fake love
No, I don't need no favor
I know my time go come
Just me and my maker (da-da-da, da-da)
I'm gonna make the paper (da-da-da, da-da)
I'm gonna make the paper (da-da-da, da-da)
I'm gonna make dollar bills (da-da-da, da-da)
I'm gonna get paid, yeah

Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I wanna get paid yeah
Just gimme my mula-la-la

Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
Just gimme my mula-la-la

I really like to party
I really like to party
I really like to party
I cannot control my body
So when this song is starting
Just cancel all your plans o
It's evident in my dancing
Moonwalk like Michael Jackson

To the left, to the right
To the front with it go ye ye ye
To the left, to the right
To the front with it go ye ye ye
I already know just how it goes
I already know just how it goes
For the night, I'm riding solo
Don't want no odo just leave me alone
I been waiting, oh, all night long
For the DJ to play my song
I dey whine and grind on your booboo
Somebody please don't call on the po-po
Turn it up and then drop it low low
All this lockdown it done make me kolo
I been waiting, oh, all night long o
Tonight I no go pick my phone
'Cause I'm so gone, oh

Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I wanna get paid, yeah
Just gimme my mula-la-la

Get the fuck outta my way (da-da-da, da-da)
I'm gonna get paid, yeah (da-da-da, da-da)
I'm gonna get paid, yeah (da-da-da, da-da)
Just gimme my mula-la-la (da-da-da, da-da)

I really like to party
I really like to party
I really like to party
I cannot control my body
So when this song is starting
Just cancel all your plans o
It's evident in my dancing
Moonwalk like Michael Jackson

I feel nice, there's nothing in my way
Shawty wanna fuck, but I just want my space
In a Lambo truck, I'm racing
Rims still spinnin', I'm pacing
I don't wanna talk, I'm dancing, dancing
Straight to the bank
Count Benji to Frank
Walk out like I'm that bitch
Put the braids back
Movin' like Kelz
Bad hoes in the back
Singin', "That's that shit"
Yeah, I really do talk like I walk
Uh, I really been about that life
Uh, shawty askin' me for advice
And I told lil' baby, "All I got is the spice for ya"

Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I wanna get paid yeah

Two time knockin'
Ten man down
You say you the king
Where the crown at nigga?
I've been muggin' since the first day
And you couldn't see a nigga on my worst day, no
Put Moliy on the record for the flex
I was feeling kinda reckless
Young lil' mama's a finesser, mmh
