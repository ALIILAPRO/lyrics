		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Communitas, c'est un temps pour repenser à notre moralité)

(Ooh, ooh, ah, ah)

I want to hear you call my name
I want to feel your touch on me again
When you're gone I can't go on
Nothing feels the same

No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you

(Ooh, ooh, ah, ah)

I wanna hold you in my arms
I want to feel our bodies moving as one
When you're gone I can't go on
Without you, I am done

No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you

(Ooh, ooh)
(I need your love, I need your love)
(Ah, ah)

No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
I will never let you go

I will never let you go

(Ooh)
I will never let you go

(Ooh, ooh, ah, ah) (never let)

No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
I will never let you go
