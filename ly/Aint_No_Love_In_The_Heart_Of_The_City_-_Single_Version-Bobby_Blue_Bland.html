		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, and it's sure 'nuff a pity
Ain't no love, 'cause you ain't around

When you were mine
Oh, I was feeling so good
'Cause your love lit up this old neighborhood
And now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line
That's why I said

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, and it sure is a pity
Ain't no love, 'cause you ain't around

Every place that I go
Oh, it seems so strange
Without you there
Things have changed
The night time calls
There's a blanket of gloom
Another teardrop falls
In my lonely room

I said ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, ain't any pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

And now that you're gone
Oh, the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line, I said

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, it sure is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
'Cause you ain't around

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in this great big old town
Ain't no love, and ain't it a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of this town
