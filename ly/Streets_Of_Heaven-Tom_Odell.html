		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two, three, four

Trouble in little town
People all gathered 'round
Abandoned bag on a step
This is what happened next

I was only tryna hear what the teacher said
Then I heard a gunshot ringing in my head
I could see it on the evening news, there's twenty three dead
In two-by-twos, with our shirts stained red

We walk these streets of heaven
We walk these streets of heaven now

It's hard to get through the days
Knowing they're miles away
Knowing what could've been
I look on down and I see

My brother on the stand, tryna make a case
My mother in the hallway, with tears upon her face
The lawyers say these cruel machines, they keep us safe
But you and me, know the price to pay

Is we walk these streets of heaven
Walk these streets of heaven
Is to we walk these streets of heaven

Another shot, wasted life
Another friend to walk beside
I know it hurts, but wipe your eyes
And we'll sing until the old men cry

It's just the way it is, I don't know why
It's just the way it is, I don't know why
It's just the way it is, I don't know why
We're just a bunch of kids, we didn't have to die

As we walk these streets of heaven
We walk these streets of heaven
We walk these streets of heaven
We walk these streets of heaven now
