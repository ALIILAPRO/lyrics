		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run up
I feel like I’m jeremy wade
Get hit with the gauge
And catch this fuckin fade
Run up
I feel like I’m jeremy wade
Get hit with the gauge
And catch this fuckin fade
I’m the hottest on the river
I feel like a monster
The drip gon make me shiver
Spin like a helicopter
I got a bad bitch choppin up my percocet uh
She be tellin me my music leave her pussy wet
I don’t fuck with anyone talking sideways out they neck
Motherfuckers better figure out that I’m a fucking threat
Let me end this quickly
I pull up and I shoot 50
Mf actin friendly
But I know that they pretending
You can’t fool me
Pull up with the toolie
In the 2 seat
Who’s he
Hit him
And I watch his fuckin nose bleed
Ba ba black sheep
Pull up with the laser beams
Run him out his pockets
Now I’m stakin up the gween
Make a southside sacrifice in the fucking james boy
Leave me outta sight lemme rot up in the lake boy
Fake boy, hate boy, run up catch a fade boy
Shame boy, shake boy, why you throwing shade boy
Run up I spray that sali-
-va do not fuck w you guys
You want that beef then we slide
Come w that cheese and a fry
Bout to get hit with fire
Waco we burning it down
Now I say Fucka religion I pillaging temples and killing the rest of the gods
And imma solo dead man staring down my .44
Face down chained up feeling like I’m Kronos
Lost soul i can’t float upon the land tho
Sosa loco put that shit on lamron uhhh
Show up crack a skull crack a skull
Haters whack a mole whack a mole
Show up crack a skull crack a skull
Haters whack a mole whack a mole
Wassuppp
Run up
I feel like I’m jeremy wade
Get hit with the gauge
And catch this fuckin fade
Run up
I feel like I’m jeremy wade
Get hit with the gauge
And catch this fuckin fade
