		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Focus?
We didn't even notice
We awake in a place
We can barely recognize, yeah
Hypnosis

And you can justify it all
Your back is up against the wall again

Shut up, silence
Add a little violence
And offend and pretend
And defend and demand my compliance

And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

So what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Go and look what you gone done
Come on welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?

Needful
Too many fucking people
You'll have to take care of yourselves
You know I've got my hands full

And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

Come on, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
And look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?

So what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than? (Are you less than? Less than?)
And look what you gone done
Well, welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?
