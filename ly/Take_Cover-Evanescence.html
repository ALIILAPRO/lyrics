		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By the way that you talk to me
I can see the lie you're dreaming I'll believe
By the way, don't you forget who you are now
'Cause that's not your name

Oh, you better take cover
'Cause I'm on my way now
I'm coming back to take your world down
Move over, if you can
'Cause I never lost my crown

Slave to your insecurity
That's what drove you down in the first place
But you haven't learned a thing
Caught in your thick web of lies
Gonna be the bitch you make me out to be

Oh, you better take cover
Nothing you can say now
You underestimated my wrath
Move over, if you can
I'm gonna give the love back

So you want to play with me?
After it all, your ego, your greed
You dug your grave so come on inside and rest in peace

Take cover
'Cause I'm on my way now
I'm gonna have to take you all down
Move over, if you can
'Cause I never lost my crown
