		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am a seabird you are the arctic ocean
I know your seasons and your sanctuaries
And when I'm wheeling over your wild white horses I know
There's nowhere else that I belong

I am a small town you are a tornado
And down the high street you tear into me
Bring down the power lines a
And you twist the heart right out of me
Leaving my outskirts devastated

And as you're going tears are flowing
'Cause while you're leaving I'm still believing

You are a memory I am the mind you enter
A single moment in a single bed
This is the feeling you are bringing back to me of when
I was on the cold harbor road

And now you're going tears are flowing
'Cause while you're leaving I'm still believing
All in the morning and my ears are ringing 
As I lie wide awake on the living room floor
