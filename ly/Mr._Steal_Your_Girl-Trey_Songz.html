		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I'ma be straight up
Don't waste no time
I know you ain't my, you ain't my baby
Do you think about us
Do I cross your mind anytime
I know that you, you're taken
It'll never change
'Cause it's always been that way
But you know that you (you)
Can't fake it (ah-ah)
He can't give you what I got here right now

Girl, I know what you want
No phones, we ain't even gotta talk (uh)
Next time that he leave you all alone
I'm gon' come through, replace him
I'm gon' watch you, get naked (I'm gon' watch you, get naked)
I'm gon' tell you, girl take it (I'ma tell you to take it)
Next time that he leave you all alone
I'll give you all the love he not
I'm about to take his spot

(Let your man know that)
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
(So let your man know that)
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back, back (oh)

Baby, let me tell you what's up
I don't trust that nigga, fuck that nigga
Stop bringing him up (oh)
Baby, I ain't never gave no fucks
One fuck's too much, unless you're talking about us
But I know that you taken (han-han)
It'll never change
'Cause it's always been that way
But you know that you, can't fake it (you, you, you)
He can't give you what I got here right now

Girl, I know what you want (what you want babe)
No phones, we ain't even gotta talk (we ain't gotta talk, nah-nah)
Next time that he leave you all alone
I'm gon' come through, replace him
I'm gon' watch you, get naked (I'm gon' watch you, get naked)
I'm gon' tell you, girl take it (I'ma tell you to take it)
Next time that he leave you all alone
I'll give you all the love he not
I'm about to take his spot

Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back, I'm back 

I'ma watch you get naked 
I'ma tell you to take it
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back, I'm back
