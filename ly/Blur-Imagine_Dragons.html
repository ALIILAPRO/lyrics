		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm always looking for
Something I can't afford
Something to work for
I don't know if it's healthy
Oh God, help me
I wanna be satisfied with what I have
I'm always chasing higher placement
This bump is not enough
And when I (hoo) hit the pavement
Don't save me
I'm such a waste of space

I'm always waiting for the weekend
I'm always hoping for a reset
I will be happy when I'm older
Why is everything never good enough for me?
Why is everything never

I'm never satisfied, I'm
Starting to blur
Waiting for the tide to wash me out
Clean me up
'Cause I am starting to blur
Yeah, I'm starting to blur

I'm always waking up
Looking to fill my cup
I'm such a loser
'Cause I got it all right in front of me
Everything I could need
I want to be satisfied with what I have
If I put that smile on
I turn my light on
Maybe I believe it too
But I don't know if my head's right
I'm waking all night
(You should give up the fight)

I'm always waiting for the weekend
I'm always hoping for a reset
I will be happy when I'm older
Why is everything never good enough for me?
Why is everything never

I'm never satisfied, I'm
Starting to blur
Waiting for the tide to wash me out
Clean me up
'Cause I am starting to blur
I'm never satisfied, I'm
Starting to blur
Waiting for the tide to wash me out
Clean me up
'Cause I am starting to blur (woo)
