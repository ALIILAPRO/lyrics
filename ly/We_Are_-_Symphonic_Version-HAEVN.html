		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strange fear I ain't felt for years
The boy's coming and I'm close to tears
I can't let go of you now
Imagination's playing round for free
In my world I take him out for tea
Oh my God, can't say no
Skipping school, go walk for air
I just had to get out of bed
I'm on overload in my head
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Life is a dream, time does come true
And in my sleep I think of you
Feather bed by myself
Basically probability
Says that fate's come side with me
It's been so long on my shelf
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
The tension is incredible, boy I'm in charge
You know how I feel for you,
Will you stop, or will you just keep going
Please don't say no, no, no, no
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
