		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You cut so deep but I’ve always loved you deeper
Those voices in your hallway, if you let her in,
You’ve gotta keep her who’ve you been talking to? 
What do they want you to do?
Baby, I’m afraid you’ve been reckless with my heart
While i was sleeping you slipped in and burst apart 
God knows i love you so, but i won’t be your ghost
You’re the one who’s in my body ripping at the seams
You’re the one who’s crashing on the highways 
In my dreams maybe i won’t, maybe i will
I haven’t slept so easy since you left me in the wild
I wish i could have loved you right
 but i was just a child maybe I won’t, maybe I will
Run back to you
There’s something dark inside me and i can’t get it out
Your thoughts ring in my voice now and i can’t make a sound
You loved me holy with your cross and your disease
Did you feel that close to god when you had me on my knees? 
If you don’t love me now, well then we all go down
I’m your sweetest parasite, you fill me up with pesticide bleed me
Baby, gemini, hurt me til you feel all right and i won’t, no, i won’t
You got into my head and now i’ll never be the same 
My trigger finger twitches every time i hear your name 
And maybe I won’t, maybe I will
Run back to you
