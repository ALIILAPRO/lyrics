		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Clean the filth
Exterminate pests that we don't need
We rebuild
From the concrete and then proceed
Six days done on the seventh went to recite another sermon
People like me don't go to heaven not when that course was predetermined

Time to resort to brutality
Picking a team cause there ain't no neutrality
Here on my side or against me now
So I put em in the dirt so they can't rebound
Reason has gone on sabbatical
Way to compete incompatible
Pit in arranging an open ditch
You and I we cannot coexist
Prosecution of a racket yeah
They don't act? Matter of fact they can
They're mocking you what does it gotta do
With how they operate sending their profit to
Offshore accounts and the fucking money done no good
To a dark ring they had made intend and wanna put
Onto the global scale and conspire
And they don't go to jail with the helping they hire
Talking bout life and the realest shit
Go with the flow and embark on a pilgrimage
Spiritual journeys when it's my turn he's
Calling upon me eternally burning
Lucifer Lucifer gathering juniper
Linger and hope for the miracle to occur
Sheltering evil like you are the harbinger
Bringing the violence the castle will guard under

Clean the filth
Exterminate pests that we don't need
We rebuild
From the concrete and then proceed
Six days done on the seventh went to recite another sermon
People like me don't go to heaven not when that course was predetermined

Sat in the chasm for centuries
Wondering will the civility ever cease
Already has with the way we act
When the first impulse here is to react
Cultivate injustice
Figured I would be above this
Manufacturing and feeding intolerance
Picking a side a division dichotomous
Our systems ain't so durable
When a pipe bomb slipped through the terminal
No nuances between you two
Had intention to make indiscernible
That's that thing nobody likes
And you ain't no friend there to study lines
I've already fucking written but you won't admit
Then you ought to be forbidden from posting shit
Hole in my thoracic cavity
He will not be granting me amnesty
He can bend light and gravity
But don't show himself what a strategy
You would think somebody omniscient
Would have made himself heard to oblivious
Non-believers who had ought to be saved
The insidious keeping until their graves

Clean the filth
Exterminate pests that we don't need
We rebuild
From the concrete and then proceed
Six days done on the seventh went to recite another sermon
People like me don't go to heaven not when that course was predetermined
