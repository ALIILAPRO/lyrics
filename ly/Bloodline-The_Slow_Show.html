		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm looking down on the bloodline
Just to see your name
I'm looking down on the bloodline
Hoping that you, do the same
And no one's there to see me
No one at all
I'm looking down on the bloodline
Hoping that you call
I'm standing here this evening
Every page has a name
And yours is a page that I know so well?

Don't you know me
Don't you know me
Can you hear me now
Cause I'm calling
Again, again, again, again, again
Can you hear me now
Cause I'm calling
Again, again, again, again, again

This is the last time, the last time I call
This is the last time, the last I call
I won't let you get me down no more
Tired of hoping that you call
I won't let you get me down no more
Tired of bracing every fall
I won't let you get me down no more
Tired of hoping that you call
I won't let you get me down no more
Tired of bracing every fall

And this is the last time, the last time I'll call
This is the last time, the last time I call
Won't let you get me down no more
Tired of hoping that you call
I won't let you get me down no more
Tired of bracing every fall

This the last time, the last time I'll call
This is the last time, the last time I'll call
This is the last time, the last time I'll call
This is the last time, the last time I'll call
