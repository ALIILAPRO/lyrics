		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I shut it out, just let it go
I'll drown in it when it overflows
I get so low and it fucking shows
So, hold me close, I overthink
My mind takes me over the rain
We built a home, don't let it sink

Hold me close when my voice gets shaky
Be patient with me
Feelings flow, you'll bring me to safety
Try to save me
These thoughts fill my mind
Bring me down one more time
In my head and it drives me crazy
I'm hostage, baby

Silence my thoughts, you reassure
Start to believe what I've been told
You keep me warm, my mind is cold
When you're next to me and I take your hands
The fears let me go
When my mind feels less and you shelter me
Oh, it sets me free

Hold me close when my voice gets shaky
Be patient with me
Feelings flow, you'll bring me to safety
Try to save me
These thoughts fill my mind
Bring me down one more time
In my head and it drives me crazy
I'm hostage, baby
