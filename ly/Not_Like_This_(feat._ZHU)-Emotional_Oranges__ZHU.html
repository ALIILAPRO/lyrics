		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been in love but not like this (yeah)
I've been in clubs but not like this before (uh)
I've felt a rush but not like this (yeah)
I've seen some things but not like this for sure (uh)
I've been in love but not like this
I've been in clubs but not like this before
I've felt a rush but not like this
I've seen some things but not like this for sure

You don't ask for nothin', you just need my touch
Showing out in public, every time I pick you up
Cruising in that old school, you know I come in clutch
Always make you blush, 'cause I give you what you want

Baby, do we have the same agenda?
I don't want no one to hear us shout
Give me one more night I can remember
Really you can show yourself out
Don't be loud, loud, loud
Keep it down, down, low
While I ride, ride, ride
How long can you take it?

I've been in love but not like this (yeah)
I've been in clubs but not like this before (uh)
I've felt a rush but not like this (yeah)
I've seen some things but not like this for sure (uh)
I've been in love but not like this
I've been in clubs but not like this before
I've felt a rush but not like this
I've seen some things but not like this for sure

Skating through town and I swear I saw you
Turned a corner if you need to know the truth
Too many times did I lose control
You know that feeling well (feeling well)

Baby, do we have the same agenda?
I don't want no one to hear us shout
Give me one more night I can remember
Really you can show yourself out
Don't be loud, loud, loud
Keep it down, down, low
While I ride, ride, ride
How long can you take it?

I've been in love but not like this (yeah)
I've been in clubs but not like this before (uh)
I've felt a rush but not like this (yeah)
I've seen some things but not like this for sure (uh)
I've been in love but not like this
I've been in clubs but not like this before
I've felt a rush but not like this
I've seen some things but not like this for sure (for sure)
