		  (Like that, like that)
(Do it like that, do it like that, that)

Step up in the building killing it, they thought I wouldn't
Zero to a hundred, baby, I'm dripping in diamonds
Discos in my eyes, it's special, climb up to my level
Wanna see the view? Can you

Do it like that, kiss it like that
Making it last, fast
Bring it right back, wear it like that
Move it like that, like it like 
Do it like that, kiss it like that
Making it last, fast
Bring it right back, wear it like that
Move it like that, like it like 
Do it like that, kiss it like that
Making it last, fast
Bring it right back, wear it like that
Move it like that, like it like that

Like that, like that
Do it like that, do it like that, that
Like that, like that
Do it like that, do it like that, that

Tell me you're a winner without telling me your name
I'm the pieces, players, and the fans, baby, I'm the game (game)
I'm stunning under the lights, yeah
I'm taking all of my time, yeah 
Baby, can you handle it, handle me?

Do it like that, kiss it like that
Making it last, fast
Bring it right back, wear it like that
Move it like that, like it like 
Do it like that, kiss it like that
Making it last, fast
Bring it right back, wear it like that
Move it like that, like it like 
Do it like that, kiss it like that
Making it last, fast
Bring it right back, wear it like that
Move it like that, like it like
Do it like that, kiss it like that
Making it last, fast
Bring it right back, wear it like that
Move it like that, like it like that

Like that, like that
Do it like that, do it like that, that
Like that, like that
Do it like that, do it like that, that
