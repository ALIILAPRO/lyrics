		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been posing with red skies
Retweeting picket signs
Put my name on petitions, but I won't change my mind
I'm keeping up appearances
The dark side of my privilege
Damn, thank God I've got my vice
The dopamine tuition will keep me wrong from right
But I don't like when my bitter side takes hold of me
I didn't want you to know

Man, I guess I was scared
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground
I know I'm down for trying
I am better in denial
So I hush, don't make a sound
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground
I know I'm down for trying
I am better in denial

I, I cry like crocodile
Then drink opinions out
I've always got an answer, the sun shines out my mouth
There ain't a rule I'd wanna break (there ain't a rule I'd wanna break)
I'd rather kill than show my face

Man, I guess I was scared
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground
I know I'm down for trying
I am better in denial
So I hush, don't make a sound
Feet, don't fail me now (feet, don't fail me now)
I got to stand my ground (gotta stand my ground)
I know I was down for trying

I was scared
But no blames worth buying
Am I better hiding?
Why? Oh, why?
Didn't I try?

I was scared
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground (gotta stand my ground)
I know I'm down for trying
I am better in denial
So I hush, don't make a sound
Feet, don't fail me now
I got to stand my ground, my ground
I know I'm down for trying

My feet, don't fail me now
