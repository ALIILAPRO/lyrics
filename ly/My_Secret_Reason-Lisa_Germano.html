		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know much about science
My interests don't take me there
But I know this, as dumb as I am
When I was young, and it was winter
In our yard there use to be snow there
I don't know much about Jesus
But I feel the need for a prayer
And my secret reason

I don't know much about power, I never learned that
But dumb as I am, I know this
In power rules the world and it's people who die, ache
Who die, ache

I don't know much about saviors
But I hope that we share a prayer
In my secret reason, my secret reasons
If no one's right and no one's wrong
In between this we are learning much about evil, it's just evil
I don't know much about praying, but I feel the need for a prayer
And my secret reasons, my secret reason
Face among disbelievers, face among disbelievers
