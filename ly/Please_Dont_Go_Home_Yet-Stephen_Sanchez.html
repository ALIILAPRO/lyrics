		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could cut my hands on your edges
But, I won't pull away
You could shake your head back and forth
And still fall down in beautiful refrain

I couldn't help but try to hold
The hands wrapped around my face
It isn't hard to see with eyes closed
The love we made

I spun around you like the world
You danced around me like heaven
I don't want to go home yet

When you asked I got quiet
I know, I should've just said it
Please, don't go home yet

I stumbled up and down on my folly
But, maybe I was just falling
Drawing every detail of your face
Calligraphy I could trace

So, help me God I'll try to hold
The hands wrapped around my face
It isn't hard to see with eyes closed
The love we made

Oh, I spun around you like the world
You danced around me like heaven
I don't want to go home yet

And when you asked I got quiet
I know, I should've just said it
Please, don't go home yet
Please, don't go home yet, yet

I spun around you like the world
You danced around me like heaven
I don't want to go home yet

When you asked I got quiet
I know, I should've just said it
Please, don't go home
