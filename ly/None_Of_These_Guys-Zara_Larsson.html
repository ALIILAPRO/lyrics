		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  None of these guys (nothing on mine)
None of these, none of these, none of these, none of these-

None of these guys got nothing on mine
They're either too short, they're either too high
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine (nothing on mine)
None of these guys got nothing on mine
They don't have his cool, they don't have his style
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine (nothing on mine)

Gettin' sweaty and crowded
Drippin' down to my knees
They walk up, but I doubt they
Got the right energy
Hundred bodies touchin' all around
But I'm only lookin' at one
All these guys look alive but
They're just NPCs

None of these guys got nothing on mine
They're either too short, they're either too high
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine (nothing on mine)
They got nothing, they got nothing
None of these guys got nothing on mine
They don't have his cool, they don't have his style
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine (nothing on mine)

He's been workin' his way up
Only studyin' me
And I give him straight As but
I deserve only Ds
Slow-mo, time is frozen
We got lost in the commotion
When he hold me, I feel chosen
Eh-eh-eh

Through the night
Nobody can read the signs (eh-eh-eh)
You stand out from all these guys
Way you make me feel so right
Babe, I hate but I can't lie
I-I

None of these guys got nothing on mine
They're either too short, they're either too high
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine (none of these guy got nothing on mine)
None of these guys got nothing on mine
They don't have his cool, they don't have his style
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine, mine, mine, mine

Through the night (none of these guys)
Nobody can read the signs (none of these guys)
You stand out from all these guys (none of these guys)
Way you make me feel so right (none of these guys)
Babe, I hate but I can't lie

None of these guys got nothing on mine
They're either too short, they're either too high
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine 
(None of these guy got nothing on mine)
None of these guys got nothing on mine
They don't have his cool, they don't have his style
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine
(None of these, none of these, none of these, none of these)

None of these guys got nothing on mine
They're either too short, they're either too high
Yeah, none of these guy got nothing on mine
