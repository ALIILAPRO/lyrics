		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a girl's girl, I'm a boss in a man's world
Yeah, I can pick and roll, pass, ballerina twirl
Skating through the city with my snapback on
Still be looking pretty with no makeup on
Hit Sephora quick, get a red lip
But meet me on the court, I'll ball you up right quick (Quick)
They be like, "Baby, baby, how you get so fine?"
But I don't do no favors for the studio time

My mama said, "Marry a rich man" (Oh, no)
And I was like, "Mama, I am that rich man" (Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo)

Oh my me, oh my God
How'd this girl get so fly?
I do what you doin', boy
Doin' it like a tomboy
Oh my me, oh my God (Skrrt, skrrt)
How'd this girl get so fly? (Skrrt, skrrt)
I do what you doin', boy (Yeah)
Doin' it like a tomboy (Yeah)

Solo ridin', barely tryin'
They know to call me when they wanna get it poppin'
Sweet like some honey but I always go hard (Yeah)
I don't like the drama but I'll finish what you start
I'm makin' sure you get the memo, yeah
I'll meet you up on any level, yeah (Yeah)
Independent don't need help (Nah)
Underestimate me, you'll be playing yourself

My mama said, "Marry a rich man" (Oh, no)
And I was like, "Mama, I am that rich man" (Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo)

Oh my me, oh my God (Oh, no, no, no)
How'd this girl get so fly? (How'd she get so fly?)
I do what you doin', boy (Yeah, yeah)
Doin' it like a tomboy (Like a tomboy)
Oh my me, oh my God (Skrrt, skrrt)
How'd this girl get so fly? (Oh, oh, oh)
I do what you doin', boy (Yeah, yeah)
Doin' it like a tomboy

I'll make a jealous girl my friend
I'll make an ex want me again
I got the best of both worlds (Yes, I do)
I can hang with the dudes, get pretty with the girls

Oh my me, oh my God (Oh, no, no, no)
How'd this girl get so fly? (How'd she get so fly?)
I do what you doin', boy (Yeah, yeah)
Doin' it like a tomboy (Like a tomboy)
Oh my me, oh my God (Skrrt, skrrt)
How'd this girl get so fly? (Skrrt, skrrt)
I do what you doin', boy (Yeah, yeah)
Doin' it like a tomboy (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do it, do it
Like a tomboy
