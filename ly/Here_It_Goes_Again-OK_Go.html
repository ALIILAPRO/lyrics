		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It could be ten, but then again
I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor

Just when you think (think) you're in control
Just when you think (think) you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known, should have known, should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again

It starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Something inching past the edge of reserve
Now through the lines of the cheap venetian blinds 
Your car is pulling off of the curb

Just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh, here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known, should have known, should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh, here it goes 
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again

I guess there's gotta be a break in the monotony
But Jesus, when it rains, how it pours
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me, yeah, you leave me

Oh, here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known, should have known, should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh, here it goes 
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
I should have known
But here it goes again
Oh here it, oh here it, oh here it, oh here it
Oh, here it goes again
I should have, I should have, I should have, I should have 
I should have known
I should have known
Oh, here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
