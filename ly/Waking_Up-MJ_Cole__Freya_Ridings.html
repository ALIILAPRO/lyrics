		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you with all that I am
I need you now to understand
I'm trying it's the only way
I told you I can not be saved

I'm waking up
I can see it all
I'm waking up
Can I breath in the love from you?
'Cause I know you and I we're through
Let me breath
Let me breath

You know me
You know what I've done
You told me, sleep beautiful one
When only the moonlight shined
It hold me 'till my heart was numb

I'm waking up
I can feel it all
I'm waking up
I can breathe, I can love for you
And I know that you and I we're through
I am the burn
I feel it burn

Is it in the air in to you, to love me like you do?
Is it in the air to me, to stay asleep
Is it in the air in to you, to love me like you do?
Is it in the air to me, to stay asleep

I can see it all, I'm waking up
Can I breath in the love from you?
But I know that you want me too
And I know that you want me too
