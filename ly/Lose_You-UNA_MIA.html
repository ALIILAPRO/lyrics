		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tend to get in my head, making mountains out of sand 
Hoping that you climb them for me
Nightmares of you leaving me for something I couldn't see
Waking me up out of my sleep

Would you give me a sign 
That it's gonna be alright, alright 
Are the stars still aligned 
Or are we running out time 

I don't wanna lose you 
I don't wanna lose you
The harder I hold you, the more you slip away 
I know I can't keep living this way 
I don't wanna lose you 

What a surprise
There you go overlooking my concerns again 
But at the same time 
Never been good at speaking my mind 
Got a million things that I want to say 
If I say them wrong you might walk away 
So I keep quiet, can't solve the problem so I'm laying beside it, yeah

Would you give me a sign 
That's it gonna be alright, alright 
Are the stars still aligned 
Or are we running out a time 

I don't wanna lose you 
I don't wanna lose you
The harder I hold you, the more you slip away 
I know I can't keep living this way 
I don't wanna lose you
