		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on (lose yourself to dance)

Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on (lose yourself to dance)

Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore (lose yourself to dance)
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on (lose yourself to dance)

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore (lose yourself to dance)
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on (lose yourself to dance)

Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore (lose yourself to dance)
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on (lose yourself to dance)

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
