		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hand on the Bible, I'm a decent man
No, I ain't perfect
But I'm learning how to be the best I can
But I've got demons collecting dust
And I buried them so damn far down
So they can't find their way back up

So don't mistake my kindness for weakness
'Cause I can flip that switch
And you can find out quick (you can find out quick)

There's a hell on the other side
That you ain't met yet, tread real light
Dare you to light that fuse 'cause I can be a loose cannon
Cross the line, I'll call your bluff
Promise when push come to shove
That you don't want that smoke
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't

Go on, pull the trigger, try your luck
If you shoot your shot better pray to God
That I don't get my ass back up
'Cause you won't get your ass back up

There's a hell on the other side
That you ain't met yet, tread real light
Dare you to light that fuse 'cause I can be a loose cannon
Cross the line, I'll call your bluff
Promise when push come to shove
That you don't want that smoke
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
You don't wanna know the devil you don't

So don't mistake my kindness for weakness
'Cause I can flip that switch
And you can find out quick (you can find out quick)

There's a hell on the other side
That you ain't met yet, tread real light
Dare you to light that fuse 'cause I can be a loose cannon
Cross the line, I'll call your bluff
Promise when push come to shove
That you don't want that smoke
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
You don't wanna know the devil you don't
You don't wanna know the devil you don't

(You don't wanna know the devil you don't)
(You don't wanna know the devil you don't)
