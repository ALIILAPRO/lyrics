		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You picked me up
When nobody else would
You done things for me, oh, darling
That nobody else would
Oh, yes, you did

Gave me your heart
But I couldn't be true
Yet I still got the same sweet feeling for you
Baby

We had a love
Beyond compare
I know we did
When I needed you, oh, darling
You were always there
Oh, yes, you were

I had my chance
But I couldn't come through
But I still got the same sweet feeling for you
Baby, yeah

I got that feeling
Every time I hear your name
That old lonesome feeling
Coming back again

I get that feeling
In the middle of the night
That's when I need you
Tell me everything is all right

Won't you come on home?
Come on where you belong
I hope you will
Please forgive me
For doing you wrong
Oh, I hope you will

I'm so sorry 
For all the pain I put you through
But I still got the same sweet feeling for you
Baby, yeah

I got that feeling
Every time I hear your name
That old sweet feeling
Keeps coming back again

I get that feeling
In the middle of the night
That's when I need you
Need you, darling
Tell me everything is all right

Come on home
Come on where you belong
I hope you will
Please forgive me
Forgive me for doing you wrong

Baby, I'm so sorry 
For all the pain I put you through
But I still got the same sweet feeling for you
Baby, yes

I got that feeling
In the middle, middle of the night
Oh, yes
I need you, baby
I need you, baby
