		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish you went behind my back
And told me lies and stuff like that
I wish you kissed someone I know
And did the unforgivable

Maybe hatin' you's the only way it doesn't hurt

So I'm gonna hate you
I'm gonna hate you
Paint you like the villain that you never were
I'm gonna blame you
For things that you don't do
Hating you's the only way it doesn't hurt

We weren't perfect, but we came close
Until I put all of our pain under the microscope
And I still can't face it
I'm still in love, for what it's worth

Maybe hatin' you's the only way it doesn't hurt

So I'm gonna hate you
I'm gonna hate you
Paint you like the villain that you never were
I'm gonna blame you
For things that you don't do
Hatin' you's the only way it doesn't hurt

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

It's not the truth
It's not the cure
But hatin' you's the only way it doesn't hurt
