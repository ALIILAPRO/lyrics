		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go on

Innocence sunk the glow and drowned in covers
Send for all your absent lovers things

Sheepish wolves
Looking lived in eating buttons
Wink, just don't put your teeth on me
Go on

Accidents, let the evening in the back door
Filled the room ceiling to the floor

Beat backbones
Grazed the poem and made it strange
I wasn't born to be a skeleton
Go on

Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens (go on)

Jealous orchard
The sky is falling off the ceiling
While I'm tucking fibs into a cookie jar

Reverie
It's useless searching in the cupboards
When everything you have is on your back
Go on

Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera (go on)
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens (go on)

Film the world before it happens
Film the world before it happens
Film the world before it happens
