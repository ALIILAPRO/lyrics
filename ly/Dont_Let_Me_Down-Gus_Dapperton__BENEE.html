		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't let me down, down
Don't let me down again
I'm just gonna burn out
And fall out of my head

I let myself slip away
I've fallen to your arms again
Wrapped in your warm embrace
Stay this way for me
Kinda funny how you thought I'd wait
Even tell me that I've changed
I don't wanna make it worse
There's nothin' I can say

If you took a walk in my shoes
You'd know why I don't wanna be with you
And now you're askin' if I'll take you back
But, boy, I'm sorry, but I can't do that

Don't let me down, down
Don't let me down again
I'm just gonna burn out
And fall out of my head
D-d-d-don't let me down, down
Don't let me down again
I'm just gonna burn out
And fall out of my head

I let myself ride the wave
I've fallen to my childish ways
And put our lives on display
For everyone to judge
I can't believe I drove our time away
At the speed of an ultraviolet ray
Though I try my hand at wakin' up
You know I'll never budge

If you took a walk in my shoes (if you took a walk in my)
You'd know why I don't wanna be with you (I don't wanna be with you)
And now you're askin' if I'll take you back (you're askin' if I'll take you)
But, boy, I'm sorry, but I can't do that

Don't let me down, down
Don't let me down again
I'm just gonna burn out
And fall out of my head
D-d-d-don't let me down, down
Don't let me down again
I'm just gonna burn out
And fall out of my head
