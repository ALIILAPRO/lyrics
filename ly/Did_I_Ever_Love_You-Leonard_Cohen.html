		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did I ever love you?
Did I ever need you?
Did I ever fight you?
Did I ever want to?

Did I ever leave you?
Was I ever able?
Or are we still leaning
Across the old table?

(Did I ever love you?
Did I ever need you?
Did I ever fight you?
Did I ever want to?)

(Did I ever leave you?
Was I ever able?
Or are we still leaning
Across the old table?)

Was it ever settled?
Was it ever over?
And is it still raining 
Back in November?

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees whither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever?

(Was it ever settled?
Was it ever over?
And is it still raining 
Back in November?)

(The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees whither)
(It's Spring and it's Summer) It's Spring and it's Summer
And it's Winter forever?)

Did I ever love you?
Does it really matter?
Did I ever fight you?
You don't need to answer

Did I ever leave you?
Was I ever able?
And are we still leaning
Across the old table?

(Did I ever love you?
Did I ever need you?
Did I ever fight you?
Did I ever want to?)

(Did I ever leave you?) Did I ever leave you?
(Was I ever able?) Was I ever able?
(And are we still leaning) And are we still leaning
(Across the old table?) Across the old table?

(Did I ever love you?
Did I ever need you?
Did I ever fight you?
Did I ever want to?)

(Did I ever leave you?
Was I ever able?
And are we still leaning
Across the old table?)
