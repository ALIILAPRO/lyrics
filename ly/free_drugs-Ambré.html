		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I took a trip to the moon, I circled back just for you
I got higher learnin', I'm way too classic for school
Turns out I got all the juice
I'ma meet you down the hall
Could I focus hell nah, ooh
Hidin' in this bathroom stall
My heart beat me to the door
Try to keep my cool as I make my way to you
My lungs took hiatus, face first to the pavement
That's how I fall into you, yeah
Every time we talk it feel like a interlude
We was on the quest young like it was an interview, yeah (ah)
This the last time I'ma look like a fool to you

Say this ain't no juvenile thing
Ain't no puppy love, but we're just teenagers, what do we know?
This ain't no juvenile thing
Ain't no puppy love but we're just, we're just (yeah)

She got a boost (chirp), I need a boost
Three stories, trampoline jump from the roof
Fuck her lil' coupe, I got a rocket that look like a '64 Chevy
Doors butterfly, and it's candy paint
I know you wanna fly (yeah)
Wonder where them blue birds come from
This the kinda love that make your head go numb
Wonder where them blue birds come from
This the kinda love that make your head go numb
(Wonder where them blue birds come from)

Say this ain't no juvenile thing
Ain't no puppy love, but we're just teenagers, what do we know?
Say this ain't no juvenile thing
Ain't no puppy love, but we're just teenagers, what do we know?
This ain't no juvenile thing
Ain't no puppy love but we're just, we're just

Ain't fuckin' get there yet?
Careful lettin' your guard down in the garden, ha
Might get yo' ass bit

Back at it again
Back at it again startin' things that I can't finish
I want it to work this time
Wish I got to you first this time, oh
I know you got somebody else
Got somebody else
But this ain't no over the counter fix
I provide you with, yeah
Could've went so far too
That night on the sofa, ooh
Nice with the head, take this weight off my shoulders
Make me weak in the knees, you clean it with your nose
But that's just the OCD, I'm down in the dumps
Road trip with the LSD, see visions of better me
Two versions of everything, yeah
I put the moves on you like you was a GIF
Like motion picture, when I'm with ya, yeah
