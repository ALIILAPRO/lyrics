		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Sal, we must've been through this 50 times already
And we'll go through it another 50  if thats what it takes
9:30, lights out guard begins his routes
"How we doin' tonight Ferguson? Fairly Good"
"Eh, doin' great Mr. Deluga. My boy, Tommy, he's almost 6 now"

She say she wanna top me but she prolly not in Tommy
I said girl bop me but she prolly can't be sloppy
so I fuck her in the rover and I bend that bitch over
She spilled my fuckin lean cup and flooded my cup holder
Purple dream, sippin lean, never felt the same without Codeine,
In my spiral dream, make the fuckin dream team, ream and glean and be fucking mean to the whole scene.

Soda going on a muhfuckin rampage
Killin pussy fools like a damn ape (AYE AYE)
Runnin petty jewels for some damn pape (AYE AYE)
Robbin pretty bitches for some grape vape (AYE AYE)
Bobbin and ill have your fuckin body slack
Poppin hella pills just to maintain (AYE AYE)
Droppin hella songs just to vacate (AYE AYE)
But soda can't evacuate
He's hung from the neck
Won't see another check
The Devil claims his best

Hell-bound, on my way down body swayin
Motion got me shakin
Potion got me wakin
Slow motion way too faded
Soda so unpatient
Poppin pills,
The walls rotate adjacent

I just wish I wasn't crazy
Never developed no self esteem
Use an ego jus day to day
Never think just pay, pay, pay
