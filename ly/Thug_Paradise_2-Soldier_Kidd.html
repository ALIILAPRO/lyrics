		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it's like, I know I'm a good person (Egonbeup)
But I'm so fucked up in my head (I don't be thinking straight)
And I be crying out for help in these songs but nobody helpin' shit (come on, come on)

I swear I be talkin', but nobody wanna hear me
Mama, I'm so heartless 'cause the way these people did me
V-A-D Apartments, we was thuggin' with that glizzy
I'm steady catchin' charges, wonder when they finna get me
It's a thug paradise, swear I been here for a while
You know I cry 'cause it's so hard to smile
And I can't lie, I got that fire on me now
Say, why my life been so hard since a child?

Bitch, pass the Black & Mild, bitch, lay the pussy down
Why these niggas steady dissin' when they know they out of town?
Mama, why I never listen? I burn all these bridges down
Nigga, why I'm always trippin'? Tryna kill a nigga now
It's a thug paradise, it's where I live
And they gon' have to give me all the love that I done give
I'm sick and tired of always totin' guns, I wanna live
Sometimes, baby, I just need a hug for being real
Society tryna make the judge give me some years
And I'ma want some blood every time I shed a tear
Try to play me like a duck and then I flew up outta there
I be lying like a fuck, I say I never have no fear
'Cause girl I scared, I know I'm wrong
But life ain't fair, put it in a song
My head ain't heal, but I still remain strong
I see it clear, I gotta pay for all my wrongs

I swear I be talkin', but nobody wanna hear me
Mama, I'm so heartless 'cause the way these people did me
V-A-D Apartments, we was thuggin' with that glizzy
I'm steady catchin' charges, wonder when they finna get me
It's a thug paradise, swear I been here for a while
You know I cry 'cause it's so hard to smile
And I can't lie, I got that fire on me now
Say, why my life been so hard since a child?

They gon' want to see us dead before they ever see us up
And I'm livin' by that lead, I said I'm dead, I give it up
You don't love me like you said, what the fuck happened to love?
I say my nigga doin' fed, he still ain't give nobody up
'Cause all we see is red, we got no home
I done laid this bed and I don't wanna sleep alone
I ain't got no friends, why the fuck I'm all alone?
Ride to the end, they know I'm comin' with that chrome
And I don't want to die, Lord
But they gon' have to give me what I strive for
I know them niggas come for me, but what's the high for?
Triple X, you and me, it's what I die for, come on

I swear I be talkin', but nobody wanna hear me
Mama, I'm so heartless 'cause the way these people did me
V-A-D Apartments, we was thuggin' with that glizzy
I'm steady catchin' charges, wonder when they finna get me
It's a thug paradise, swear I been here for a while
You know I cry 'cause it's so hard to smile
And I can't lie, I got that fire on me now
Say, why my life been so hard since a child?
