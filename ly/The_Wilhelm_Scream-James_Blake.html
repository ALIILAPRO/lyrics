		  I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreamin anymore
All that I know is
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Might as well fall in

I don't know about my love
I don't know about my lovin' anymore
All that I know is
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Might as well fall in

I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreamin anymore
All that I know is
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Fallin'

I don't know about my love
I don't know about my lovin' anymore
All that I know is
I'm lovin, fallin', lovin', lovin'
Might as well love you

I don't know about my love
I don't know about my lovin' anymore
All that I know is
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin',
Might as well turn in

I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreamin' anymore
All that I know is
