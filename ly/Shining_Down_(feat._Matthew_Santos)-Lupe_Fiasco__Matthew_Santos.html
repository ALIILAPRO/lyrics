		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look Up in the Sky.
Look Up in the Sky.
Look Up in the Sky
Thought I was down.
Thought I was gone.
Thought I was around.
I left you alone.
Look Up in the Sky.
Just look Up in the Sky.
See that I'm everywhere
Everywhere
Shining Down on You.

[Verse 1:]
Well, well
Is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns a little altered
Your attention, Put back on the flow like the department of water
Taken off of the door like little Walter
Chess? Yes. Baby I'm Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause; Outlaw with the lawyer
Judge jury like a loop, Rap name Lupe, but my daddy named me Warrior
This is his memorial.

[Hook:]
Thought I was down.
Thought I was gone.
Thought I was around.
I left you alone.
Look Up in the Sky.
Just look Up in the Sky.
See that I'm everywhere
Everywhere
Shining Down on You.

[Verse 2:]
No, I ain't the nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scriptin lines, Won't this petition sign
It says I'm sick of dimes, Sick of this prison time
I really love my people. I'm sick of pimping mine.
Now if we autotune that shit,
We can hear the songs from that opera room fat bitch
Tell em' it's not to pursue it, just shoe it like a blacksmith
We're trapped, and movin round in circles like it's chap stick
And that's the semi-circle way of thinking that we're chapped with
We'll rap is arounded ya head like the bandana's fabulous
used to wrap his hats with
Rather being feds instead of National Geographic's
Well I'm not having it, naw.

[Hook:]
Thought I was down.
Thought I was gone.
Thought I was around.
I left you alone.
Look Up in the Sky.
Just look Up in the Sky.
See that I'm everywhere
Everywhere
Shining Down on You.

[Verse 3:]
So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain't never heard mine
And if you haven't you know you ain't never heard line
Lu don't MOO. No COW WORDS (cowards(cow-herds)],
you only heard LIONS (lines)
Not a facade cherisher, I'd rather have the scars
I don't idolize America, I'm dancing with the stars
Uh huh. All of them? Yeah, they are, too.
You look up and you see us Shining Down on you.

[Hook:]
Thought I was down.
Thought I was gone.
Thought I was around.
I left you alone.
Look Up in the Sky.
Just look Up in the Sky.
See that I'm everywhere
Everywhere
Shining Down on You.

Shining Down on You
Shining Down on You
Shining Down on You
