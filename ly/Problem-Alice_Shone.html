		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe that's the problem
You lied to me one too many times
Always wondered why
Maybe that's the problem
You went so far I didn't know where to draw the line
Now in my mind
I'm way too underground to see it
Fell too hard I get the feeling
I'm never coming up
(Never coming up)
You took my hand
You left me speechless
My mind's a thousand pieces
I know you've given up
(Know you've given up)
I shoulda seen the warning signs
Shoulda seen the flashing lights
Surrounded, but I never found it
Shoulda never looked in your eyes
Had me so hypnotised
Surrounded, but I never found it
Maybe that's the problem
I love too hard, I trust too much
I trusted us
Maybe that's the problem
You wanted to fall
But never in love
(Never in love)
Ooooh
Ooooh
Maybe that's the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Shoulda seen the warning signs
Shoulda seen the flashing lights
Surrounded, but I never found it
(Maybe I'm the problem)
Shoulda never looked in your eyes
Had me so hypnotised
Surrounded, but I never found it
