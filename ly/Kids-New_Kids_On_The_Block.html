		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We been up since day one
We been chasing the sun
On the ceiling
What a feeling

When we touch we stop time
We were dancing skylines
It's amazing
What a feeling

Follow, anywhere you go I follow
Don't make me wait 'til tomorrow
Don't make me wait without you, ooh-ooh

Jump in the drop-top cause we're taking it up
Got time on lock and it's all that we got
We're free, and we got nowhere to be
And we're still just kids from a nobody town
Still just kids that are messing around
Making the most of the things that we found (hey), whoa
Jump in the drop-top cause we're taking it up
Got time on lock and it's all that we got
We're free and we got nowhere to be

Every night we're spending
Like the world is ending
'Cause we're dreaming
Oh, what a feeling

Dancing every heartbeat
Light up every dark street
In starlight
We got all night

Follow, anywhere you go I follow
Don't make me wait 'til tomorrow
Don't make me wait without you, ooh-ooh

Jump in the drop-top cause we're taking it up
Got time on lock and it's all that we got
We're free and we got nowhere to be
And we're still just kids from a nobody town
Still just kids that are messing around
Making the most of the things that we found (hey), whoa
Jump in the drop-top cause we're taking it up
Got time on lock and it's all that we got
We're free and we got nowhere to be

Follow, anywhere you go I follow
Don't make me wait 'til tomorrow
Don't make me wait without you, ooh-ooh

And we're still just kids from a nobody town
Still just kids that are messing around
Making the most of the things that we found (hey), whoa
Jump in the drop-top cause we're taking it up
Got time on lock and it's all that we got
We're free and we got nowhere to be
