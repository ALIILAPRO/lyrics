		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel you under my skin 
I feel helpless, I'm addicted
I've never felt anything like this
I inhale you, I am weightless
And no matter what I thought
All I want is you
All I want is you

And no matter what I say
I will not be thrown away
I'd risk it all for you

I'd die for you
There's nothing I won't do
I beg and plead for you
I'd do it all for you
I'd kill for you
It's simple yes, it's true
There's nothing I won't do
I would die for you (for you)

You can feel me under your eyes
You are breathless, I'm contagious
You've never felt anything like me
It's consuming, you're suffocating
And no matter what you do
All I see is you, all I see is you

And no matter what I see
I will not be thrown away
I'd lose you all for you
I'd die for you
There's nothing I won't do
I beg and plead for you
I'd do it all for you
I'd kill for you
It's simple, yes, it's true
There's nothing I won't do, I would die

You can have it all
You can take my everything
Anything for you
'Cause I'd die for you
'Cause I would die for you
I would break

No matter what I say, no matter what we say
All I want is you 
No matter what I see, no matter what I do
All I need is you (all I need is you)
No matter what they see, no matter what they say
All I need is you (all I need is you)
No matter what they say, no matter what they say
All I want is you
No matter what they see, no matter what they say
I would die for you

I'd die for you
There's nothing I won't do
I beg and plead for you
I'd do it all for you
I'd kill for you
It's simple, yes, it's true
There's nothing I won't do, I would die

You can have it all
You can take my everything
Anything for you
'Cause I'd die for you
'Cause I would die for you
I would die
