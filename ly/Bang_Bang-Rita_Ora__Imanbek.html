		  Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble

Ooh, you showed up and made me wonder
Looking fun but kinda dangerous too
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, I got lifted off the ground
I don't know what you done but it's just too good
Oh yeah

Ooh, you got something, think I want it
Guess I never felt the way that I do, yeah
When I'm with you, you
It's so hard to see through you
And that's why I want it

Bang bang
Look what you started
Bang bang
Straight through my heart, it
Skipped a beat
You feel like trouble, ooh
Bang bang
Baby, I got it
Bad bad
Look what you started
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble

Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble

Ooh, what's the core of our connection?
Is it just that I know I'm bound to lose?
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, you're a fire, my obsession
And want all of your devotion for good
Yeah

Ooh, you got something, think I want it
Guess I never felt the way that I do, yeah
When I'm with you, you
It's so hard to see through you
And that's why I want it

Bang bang
Look what you started
Bang bang
Straight through my heart, it
Skipped a beat
You feel like trouble, ooh
Bang bang
Baby, I got it
Bad bad
Look what you started
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble

Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble

Ooh
Ooh

Ooh, you got something, think I want it
Guess I never felt the way that I do, yeah
When I'm with you, you
It's so hard to see through you
And that's why I want it

Bang bang
Look what you started
Bang bang
Straight through my heart, it
Skipped a beat
You feel like trouble, ooh
Bang bang
Baby, I got it
Bad bad
Look what you started
Oh my god
Think I'm in trouble

Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
Bang bang
Na-na-na-na-na
