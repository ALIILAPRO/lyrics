		<p>
		  Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man (yo)

Yes, I'll be your woman, yes, I'll be your, baby
Yes, I'll be whatever that you tell me when you're ready
Yes, I'll be your girl, forever your lady
You ain't ever gotta worry, I'm down for you, baby (uh)

Best believe that, when you need that
I'll provide that, you will always have it (ha-have it)
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it

Beating my drum like, dum-di-di-day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, "Hey, mama, mama, hey, mama, ma"
Banging the drum like, dum-di-di-day (hey)
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, "Hey, mama, mama, hey, mama, ma" (hey)

Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man

Yes, I do the cooking, yes, I do the cleaning
Plus, I keep the na-na real sweet for your eating
Yes, you be the boss, and yes, I be respecting
Whatever that you tell me, 'cause it's game you be spitting, oh

Best believe that (oh-oh), when you need that (oh-oh)
I'll provide that, you will always have it (ha-have it)
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it

Beating my drum like, dum-di-di-day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, "Hey, mama, mama, hey, mama, ma" (hey)
Banging the drum like, dum-di-di-day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, "Hey, mama, mama, hey, mama, ma" (hey)

Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man (yeah, yeah)

Whole crew got the juice, yo' d- game the truth
My screams is the proof, them other dudes get the deuce
When I speed in the coupe, leaving this interview
It ain't nothin' new, I been f- with you
None of them ain't n- taking you, just tell them to make a "U"
Huh, that's how it be, I come first like debuts, huh
So, baby, when you need that
Give me the word, I'm no good, I'll be bad for my baby

(So I) make sure that he's getting his share 
(So I) make sure that his baby take care 
(So I) make sure I'm on my toes, on my knees 
Keep him pleased, rub him down, be a lady and a freak, oh

Beating my drum like, dum-di-di-day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, "Hey, mama, mama, hey, mama, ma" (hey)
Banging the drum like dum-di-di-day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like, "Hey, mama, mama, hey, mama, ma" (hey)

Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man
Be my woman, girl
I'll be your man
