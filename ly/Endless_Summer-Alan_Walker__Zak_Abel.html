		  Endless summer

Lost love, now it's back again
I've been right here waiting
One touch and something's in the air
Got my heartbeat racing

I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer
I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer
No time for regret, no time for sleep, yeah
Not fucking leaving, when you're with me, yeah
I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer

I got that feeling again
I got that feeling again

Hands up, raise 'em to the sky (to the sky)
'Cause I got you by my side
It's bold love, every single time (single time)
And it takes me higher

I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer
I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer
No time for regret, no time for sleep, yeah
Not fucking leaving, when you're with me, yeah
I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer

I got that feeling again
Oh, I got that feeling again

Rain rain, go away
Summer's here to stay
Cheers to better days (endless summer)
Rain rain, go away
Summer's here to stay
Cheers to better days (ooh)

I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer
I got that feeling again
Like it's an endless summer
No time for regret (no, no)
No time for sleep, yeah (don't sleep, yeah)
Not fucking leaving
When you're with me, yeah
I got that feeling again (that feeling again)
Like it's an endless summer
