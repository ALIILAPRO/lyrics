		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get goin'
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.

Little shoeshine boy never get slowed down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of a dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.

Get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get goin'
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

Get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe
It does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm, when you get the blues
