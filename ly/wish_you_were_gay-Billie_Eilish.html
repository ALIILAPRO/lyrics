		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I don't feel so good
Six words you never understood
I'll never let you go
Five words you'll never say (aw)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong
Four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us
One slipped away

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a twelve step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
Eleven, "Heys" (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at seven, you were six minutes away (yay)

How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way? Uh
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay, uh
I just kinda wish you were gay

To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay, uh
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
