Ohema doh doh doh

My ting too long
She want to taste my kokoro 

My dear make I tell you

She thought I was lazy 
She said baby don't play me 
When I hit it she be screaming my name 
I'm driving her crazy 

She want it on a daily 
She call me on the phone 
Say she wan know if I'll come back again
If I'll come back again

I know its late but I've been needing ya
Got me in cuffs girl 
Your something like a drug that I've been feinding 

Please keep the lights on don't like those off
We could vibe with our clothes off
And make love till we doze off yeah
Early morning you're my coffee
Hope you don't think I'm finessing you 
I love you cause you're so simple
Yeah you classy but still freaky
Always come when I'm calling

She thought I was lazy (yeah-yeah)
She said "baby, don't play me" 
When I hit it, she be screaming my name (yeah-yeah)
I'm driving her crazy (uh-uh, oh)
She want it on a daily yeah
She call me on the phone
Said she wan know if I'll come back again (yeah-yeah)
If I'll come back again (and do it like)

Ta ta ta ta (lo lo lo)

Ah ah ah ah (lo lo lo)

She make I go 
Ta ta ta ta (lo lo lo)

Omo ye n kigbe 
Ah ah ah ah (lo lo lo)
