		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is where it ends
I've been down a few broken roads that I'm tryin' to mend
But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down

Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all of your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends

Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I should've walked out that door (out that door)

Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all of your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends, ends, ends
Yeah, this is where it ends

You're the best thing that ever happened to me
You showed me what true love shouldn't be
I found myself the second I gave up on us (on us)

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance (a second chance)
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all of your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends
