		  (Mingo)
Woo, woo (woo, woo)
Woo (yeah)

I just pulled up in a tank 
(Yeah, I just pulled up in a tank)
I been geekin' like crank 
(Yeah, I'm geeked like crank)
Man, this crank got insane ('sane)
Yeah, ten cranks in the brain (ten crank in the brain)
Bitch, I don't know when I'ma land
Yeah, I just pulled up on a plane (just pulled up on a plane)
I just pulled up out a jet (yeah)
But y'all think I went insane (y'all think I went insane insane)
Rolls Royce in the rain
We got guns, no range
Constantly taking these Percs'
Man, these shit just be fuckin' my brain
It's not lie, who be realer than this?
It's not lie, who gon' take it, this shit?
Man, y'all look like y'all taking a shit
I don't worry, get money, that's it
Man, my money do double, it flipped
I used to be shakin' the zips (yeah)
My money gon' blow me a kiss, like
Might pour me a three of some Tris
How the hell you gon' make you some money?
And you don't be takin' no risks (okay)
Man, y'all just be crying 'bout anything and everything
And y'all look at my wrist

The AP and Rollie my wrist, lil' bitch
You know that I'm keepin' my blick, lil' bitch
I'm fuckin' on top of the mil'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' the bitch from the Six, uh
They already know how I am lil' bitch
Yeah, I'm man of the year
Hm, I went and bought me the Urus lil' bitch
You don't know how to steer
Look at my face, yeah, you don't see no fear
I already touched like fifteen mil' this year
Do I look like I care? (Phew, phew)
I only go up like a stair
Huh, suck on the bottom of my balls, said
"Bitch, do it look like I care?"
Always knew I was gon' win, yeah
Bitch, do it look like I care?
Yeah, I'm on the side of the street
Lil' bitch, I don't give no fucks if it's fair
Big Rolls Royce, parked out outside
Bitch, you don't know I was there
I had to sacrifice everything
You don't know life not fair?

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

I just pulled up in a tank 
(Yeah, I just pulled up in a tank)
I been geekin' like crank 
(Yeah, I'm geeked like crank)
Man, this crank got insane ('sane)
Yeah, ten cranks, get the brain (ten crank in the brain)
Bitch, I don't know when I'ma land
Yeah, I just pulled up on a plane (just pulled up on a plane)
I just pulled up out a jet (yeah)
But y'all think I went insane (y'all think I went insane insane)
Rolls Royce in the rain
We got guns, no range
Constantly taking these Percs'
Man, these shit just be fuckin' my brain
It's not lie, who be realer than this?
It's not lie, who gon' take it, this shit?

You know that I'm keepin' my blick, lil' bitch
I'm fuckin' on top of the mil'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' the bitch overseas
They already know how I am lil' bitch
Yeah, I'm man of the year

You don't know how to steer
