		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up is hard to do when no one loves you
Years pass by, that's something you have gotten used to
Some of us are dumb and blind and out of our minds
Walking passed each day through fields of land mines

Let the weak say I am strong
Let yourself say I was wrong
Let your heart move on
Let your heart move on

Wipe the drool up off your face and make your plans
The prison where you hang your head missed your demands
It's highly time, throw down your wine, put foolish things away
Don't forget, prepare your set, be true to your own way

Let the weak say I am strong
Let yourself say I was wrong
Let your heart move on
Let your heart move on

Do you find yourself from day to day?
Staring at a stranger's face?
As you find yourself to your dismay
Looking into your own face

Let the weak say I am strong
Let yourself say I was wrong
Let your heart move on and on
Let your heart move on
