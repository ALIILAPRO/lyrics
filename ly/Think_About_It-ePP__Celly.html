		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear me out as I vent,

cir it out of my sense

cll expense paid, audience played, adios, I'm remised 

Lemme make an attempt, as I lower my tents

Take it this way, made a mistake, now I'm all on the fence

No, we can't walk around it,

Leeway, automatic, briefcase, fill it up with all the things you ever doubt

These games, should've ended

Please thanks, no pretending

Re-play, how it's been and if worth the run around


Well

Lemme think

Working to the bone, I couldn't call it, though it seems

I can't go a day without a thought of being weak

But I'm at it for a reason, cause the devil never sleeps

So who am I

So who am I


If you read me wrong, I do apologize

Leave a happy home whenever scrutinized

Finally you able to let go of how you feel inside

Everything was in a drought, I don't ever think about it

Don't think about it

No you don't, no you don't


Tryna lose ya, I ain't tryna lose

I'm way too determined to be falling in a mood

Box em out, they don't exist when the circle of the groove

I'ma call it quits before you catch me calling out to you

Stay out my way, don't hit me up

Get on my case, won't live it up

Now you alone, and sit by the phone

Stop wasting ya time, just move it along

Could it live on, wait, lemme take a step back

Went at this the wrong way, I hope you can accept that


Living double lives ain't everything they made it out to be

You Stepping on my rug now, I'm checking twice the active feet

 Reconcile the thievery, I over see, Who loaded up, you know it's me?

I seen enough to tap in every angle, pair the disbelief

You asked me if it's worth it, much above it on the surface

But the funny thing about it, is knowing you don't deserve it

Plus we more than here to live, inside a factory of fears

Still redacted, but it's actually been happening for years

Gone
