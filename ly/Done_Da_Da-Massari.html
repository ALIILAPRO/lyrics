		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Miss fatty batty call me murdah
Best believe what you heard-ah
Dem a know we coming back to put the word out
Eh-eh-eh
Miss fatty batty call me murdah
Best believe what you heard-ah
Dem a know we coming back to put the word out
Eh-eh-eh

Your body criminal just like a killer
Keep her undercover while she lying on a pillow
Says she wanna do it in the ocean by the villa
I know what you want, baby, I'mma get it done
Get it, get it, get it

Shots of Martinis, says I want it
Champagne by the case, that Ace of Spade is what we pourin'
Y'all know what you're workin' with when you drop it on the floor
I'mma hit it one time then you gon' be done da da

Miss fatty batty call me murdah
Best believe what you heard-ah
Dem a know we coming back to put the word out
Eh-eh-eh
Miss fatty batty call me murdah
Best believe what you heard-ah
Dem a know we coming back to put the word out
Eh-eh-eh

Shakin' shakin' body shots of that Tequila
Shawty got that milkshake, got me tastin' like vanilla
Looking around the world and you won't find nobody illa
I know what you want, baby, I'mma get it done
Get it, get it, get it

Shots of martinis, says I want it
Champagne by the case, that Ace of Spade is what we pourin'
Y'all know what you're workin' with when you drop it on the floor
I'mma hit it one time then you will be done da da

Miss fatty batty call me murdah
Best believe what you heard-ah
Dem a know we coming back to put the word out
Eh-eh-eh

Miss fatty batty killin' it, you never heard-ah
Takin' all the money when she twist and she turn
Killin' with that body, make you hot 'til you burn-ah
Come put the word out, they call her murdah
Let me try to cuff her body, hit it one time
She call me Mr. Lover when we do it all night
'Cause I get it done da da, I give you no lie
Give you no lie, give you, give you no lie-ay

Miss fatty batty call me murdah
Best believe what you heard-ah
Dem a know we coming back to put the word out
I'mma hit it one time, one time, done da da
Miss fatty batty call me murdah
Best believe what you heard-ah
Dem a know we coming back to put the word out
I'mma hit it one time, one time, done da da

Done da da
Baby one time get it ready 'til you done da da
