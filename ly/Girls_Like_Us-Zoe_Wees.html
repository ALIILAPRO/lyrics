		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard for girls like us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
'Cause they don't know

Stuck here
Stuck here in these waters
So sick to my stomach
Is anybody there?
Red lights
Red lights in the darkness
Everyone's so heartless
Does anybody care?

It's so hard to explain
With your heart in a cage
Only whisper but you wanna shout
'Cause the second you wake
Too much pressure to take
Every part of you wants to cry out

It's hard for girls like us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
'Cause they don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

Mirror, mirror on the wall
I don't see beautiful
Staring back at me
Watching, watching my heart bleed out
Trying not to freak out

It's hard for girls like us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
'Cause they don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

It's hard for us
For girls like us
Girls like us
They don't know
It's hard for us
For girls like us
Girls like us
They don't know

So, oh
And the worst part is
When I smile like this
And it hits me hard
Hits me hard
Tryna play it cool
But inside I'm bruised
And it breaks my heart
Breaks my heart

It's hard for all of us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
They don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

It's hard for us
For girls like us (girls like us)
Girls like us
They don't know
It's hard for us (oh no)
For girls like us (girls like us)
Girls like us
They don't know
