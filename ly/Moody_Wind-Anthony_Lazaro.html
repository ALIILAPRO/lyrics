		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moody wind that once made us meet
Is blowing furiously down the street
The friendly breeze at our back
Has lately been swaying
And I don't know if you're looking for
Somebody better or something more
Cause even when you're with me
Your eyes are still straying
So if you wanna go
Make it very quiet
Leave the door half-open
Don't turn on the light
I will see the note
Lying on the nightstand
See the empty space
And I will understand
If you wanna leave
Take good care of you
Maybe it's about time
We try something new
Maybe for a while
Maybe it's just a fluke
The wind will just give back
The same way that he took
But then the house just won't be the same
Trees will be moaning and crying your name
And I will hear your voice
Resound in the silence
I'm gonna browse through my old scrapbook
Have a dry laugh at the way we looked
Hope for a hint that the wind
It's sending you back
But if you wanna go
Make it very quiet
Leave the door half-open
Don't turn on the light
I will see the note
Lying on the nightstand
See the empty space
And I will understand
If you wanna leave
Take good care of you
Maybe it's about time
That we try something new
Maybe for a while
Maybe it's just a fluke
The wind will just give back
The same way that he took
