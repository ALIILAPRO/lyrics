		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went down to the river
Flowing out onto the sea
On my way to the ocean
Let the spirit swallow me

I got low down in the water
I let the current guide my bones
I got nine kinds of trouble
I'm just trying to find my way home

Over twenty some years of living
And a thousand wasted days
I have loved a lot of women
Many times I've gone wrong ways
And I came down to the water
For a dip to cleanse my soul
They keep telling me that I'm just a babe
But baby why do I feel so old?

This is the verge of a breakthrough
It's a fine line that cannot be bent
And I felt like a river run dry
But I don't know where all of the rainwater went

And I believe we were all dead or dying
But I see different in the blue light
There is no such thing as a dawn or a dusk
It's daylight until it is night

You gotta fight through the dimming
You gotta run into the winds
You gotta rage against the dying of the light
Live for the moment that's left

You gotta fight against the dimming
You gotta run into the winds
You gotta rage against the dying of the light
Live for the moment that's left

'Cause there is no such thing as a dying man
We are alive 'til the moment we're dead
And a drowning man is just a living man
Who hasn't run out of his last bit of breath

I went down to the river
Flowing out onto the sea
On my way to the ocean
Let the spirit swallow me

I got low down in the water
I let the current guide my bones
I got nine kinds of trouble
I'm just trying to find my way home

Find my way home
Find my way home
Find my way home
