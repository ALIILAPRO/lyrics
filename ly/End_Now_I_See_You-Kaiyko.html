		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And now I love you
A little more than I thought I did
Wakin' up on the floor
I wanna reach out to you a bit

I'm wide awake but I'm dreaming about you
Faded away to counting the days till
I pick you up on a sunny day
And when you get in the car
I never know what to say

Oh I know you're not real
But I can feel you here
As if it wasn't clear darlin'
Oh we're stayin' up till the morning comes
Goin on and on yea you know you're the only one

I wish you'd stay by my side
I feel, I feel forever
Fallin' right from my eyes
So do you feel how I feel?
With a blood rush to my head
Heartbeat fast
When we lay here together
I know, you feel forever
And ever and ever and ever

End Now I See You
A little more than I thought I did
Pictures on the floor
I wanna reach out to you a bit

I fell asleep when I daydreamed about you
Faded away to counting the days till
You pick me up on a rainy day
And when I get in the car I know just what to say

Oh I know you're not real
But I can feel you here
As if it wasn't clear darlin'
Oh we're stayin' up till the morning comes
Goin on and on yea you know you're the only one

I wish you'd stay by my side
I feel, I feel forever
Fallin' right from my eyes
So do you feel how I feel?
With a blood rush to my head
Heartbeat fast
When we lay here together
I know, you feel forever
And ever and ever and ever

I wish you'd stay by my side
I feel, I feel forever
Fallin' right from my eyes
So do you feel how I feel?
