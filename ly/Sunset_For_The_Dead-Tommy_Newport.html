		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sky is turning red
The night has been so dim
The souls have all been fed
I can feel it from within 
My heart 

It's a sunset for the dead
In the middle of my heart 
In the middle of my head
Well the walls are moving in 
And your house its burning down 
To the ground 
In the middle of my heart 
In the middle of my head
It's a sunset 
Sunset for the dead
Shed some love 
Shed some blood 
Shed some emotion 

Cause all the bloods been shed 
The walls are moving in 
The sky is turning red
The night has been so dim 

It's a sunset for the dead
In the middle of my heart 
In the middle of my head
Well the walls are moving in 
And your house its burning down 
To the ground 
In the middle of my heart 
In the middle of my head
It's a sunset 
Sunset for the dead
Shed some love 
Shed some blood 
Shed some emotion
