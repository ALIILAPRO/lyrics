		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
Now nothing can change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way

And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven, yeah

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along
But now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you, oh

And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven, heaven, whoa
You're all that I want
You're all that I need

We're in heaven
We're in heaven
We're in heaven
