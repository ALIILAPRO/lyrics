		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day by day 
I will follow Your ways
I'll do what You say 
I no send anybody
If they turn away 
Me I go follow Your ways
Don't care what people say
I no send anybody

This love I found is so beautiful
And everyday is sweeter than the day before
They can try to take me away from You Jesus
As long as I'm breathing
I'm never ever turning away

Day by day 
I will follow Your ways
I'll do what you say 
I no send anybody
If they turn away 
Me I go follow Your ways
Don't care what people say
I no send anybody (Anybody o)

Day by day 
I will follow Your ways (Follow You)
I'll do what you say 
I no send anybody
If they turn away 
Me I go follow Your ways
Don't care what people say
I no send anybody


This love I found is so beautiful
And everyday is sweeter than the day before
They can try to take me away from You Jesus
As long as I'm breathing
I'm never ever turning away

Day by day 
I will follow Your ways (Follow Your ways)
I'll do what you say 
I no send anybody
If they turn away 
Me I go follow Your ways
Don't care what people say
I no send anybody (Anybody o)

Day by day 
I will follow Your ways 
I'll do what you say 
I no send anybody
If they turn away 
Me I go follow Your ways
Don't care what people say
I no send anybody
