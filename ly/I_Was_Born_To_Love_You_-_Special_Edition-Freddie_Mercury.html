		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An amazing feeling coming through...
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me, I am the man for you
You were made for me, you're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity I'd kill for your love
So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream, and my dreams come true
It's so hard to believe this is happening to me
An amazing feeling coming through...

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

I want to love you, I love every little thing about you
I want to love you, love you, love you
Born to love you, born to love you, yes I was born to love you
Born to love you, born to love you every single day of my life
I was born to take care of you every single day of my life

My life, hey hey, every single day of my life
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life
