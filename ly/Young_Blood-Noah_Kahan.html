		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three, four)

Oh dear, oh dear, I'm sorry
That you grew up so soon
A cold year with no high school parties
I've been drinking alone
Oh, I've been drinking alone

So, don't fear, just don't fear their warnings
They're bitterer than most
Four years of driving across the country
For empty seats at their shows
And they've been drinking alone
So

Keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You
Young blood

Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You
Young blood
You
Young blood
Young blood

So when you're mad for no reason
At everything at once
And when you start overthinking
I'll be drinking at home
Oh, I'll be drinking at home, so

Keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You
Young blood

Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You
Young blood
You
Young blood
Young blood

And if you want I could tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads of my soul
And in the morning I'm bullet proof

And if you want I could tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads of my soul
And in the morning I'm bullet proof
In the morning I'm bullet proof, so

Keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You
Young blood

Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You
Young blood
You
Young blood
You
Young blood
Young blood
