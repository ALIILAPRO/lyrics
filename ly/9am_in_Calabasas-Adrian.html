		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swerving I fade off a bean
Only got love for my team
Craziest thing that seen
Hollywood lights with the gleam
Rolley shine bright with a beam
Hoping that you never leave
Moving too quick for radar like Vader I saved her
And that's why she fucking with me
She said Savvy what it be
I said baby what you mean
I gotta know if you bless or a mess like the rest
Cause I do not need all that stress
Shawty ain't nice, she a bitch but I look after her like a vet
She keep her heart in her chest
I keep that ice on me, wearing roley or patek
Run a mission for no press
You keep on running away from your rents
Ain't looking for love, you looking for sex
Don't got love for these hoes
Don't got time for a thot yeah
Gotta stay on the road
Cause we doing a lot yeah
No I'm never alone
Only got time for my bros yeah yeah
Don't hit up my phone
Don't be ringing my tone yeah yeah
Don't got love for these hoes
Don't got time for a thot yeah
Gotta stay on the road
Cause we doing a lot yeah
No I'm never alone
Only got time for my bros yeah yeah
Don't hit up my phone
Don't be ringing my tone yeah yeah
