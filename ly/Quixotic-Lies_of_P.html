		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I would shed my tears, in this daunting fantasy,
Many of them call reality

If I would lose my name to this senselessness,
I'd seek truth in reverse side, or insanity

Unleash the giants, loosen the horse,
fill up the seas, set the serpents alive
Define the heights, behold your sight for those windmills,
let them run again

'Cause I would fight
Let it be the cold rain, be it battle I cannot survive,
Or another cursed spirit come from the tide
Every morning every night my fate confined
Beyond the hills, upon the bridge, across this strange life,
those devils never break out of their great disguise

So I would fight another song, another falsely refined
Those rambling words they pressed upon my soul
Every inch I march towards the fatal sight
Against the winds, against the lights, I shall conquer thine
'Cause when you stop to dream,
Your whole heart too gives in to life
