		  She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away (oh, I), run, run away, run away (oh, I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (well, all right)
Run, run away, run, run away (oh, I), run away (oh, I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (well, all right)

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man, what you want, what you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love trickin'
On some BMX shit, but not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club, gettin' dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, alright

Damned if I do, shit, damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Tryna be the man that she want, what she want
What she- what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just wanna sing on it, uh
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thang that I chose
And she could be doing the same thing, I suppose

And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, alright

My niggas say, "Turn up," hoes say "Turn up"
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say, "Turn up," hoes say "Turn up"
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)

Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie

Well, all right, oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, all right
Oh, I, oh, I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well, alright

Run away, run away, back
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Run away, run away, back
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Run away, run away, back
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Run away, run away, back
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
