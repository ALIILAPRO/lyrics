		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People. All us fucked-up people,
What are we gonna do
With ourselves
And our addictions
And our desire to kill each other?
And special things, your own dreams? 

People. All us fucked-up people,
Can't we see behind the pain of losing?
I had a dream of love and colors,
And all the while it seemed real,
And in this dream, we were unique.
Couldn't it be? I wasn't cryin' Before he died,
He died so young
And I can't see you anymore,
'Cause there's no answers here,
There's no feeling. 

People. All us fucked-up people,
Can't we see beyond the pain of losing one another?
I had this dream of trust and beauty,
And all the while, it seemed real,
And in this dream, we were not fighting.
Couldn't it be? You gave it up,
You lost your reason. You never saw
You are unique. You spread your wings
And cut 'em off. You're only hurting. 

People, all our fucked-up smiles
We quit dreaming long ago and our
Distrust and our addictions and our desire
To kill each other makes all the sense in the world
You just fucked up for a moment. You're only hurting
That's just like me
That's just like me
That's just like me
I had this dream of love and colors.
