		  Haan
Must be me
(Ask how I know it's a hit, because J. White produced it)
Who else could it be?
Uh

Lookin' at the mirror like, "It must be me" (must)
'Cause everybody seein' somethin' that I don't see (I don't see)
I was drinkin' lean like my name was Pimp C (R.I.P. to Pimp)
I gotta thank God that I never OD'd (thank the Big God)
I should've kept it clean and probably just did weed
I thought it was a downer but it must be speed (it must be)
Remember homeboy who had the Jeep Cherokee?
Dropped out in elementary he still can't read (well, damn)
I sign a artist, if they get locked they blame me (me)
They want me to get the pot, resort to plan B (skrrt)
I thank the Lord Vicky G didn't take the Plan B (mama)
She tried really hard but she couldn't tame me
I had a good family with real good genes
But fuck makin' the team, we trap for brand new jeans
I don't fuck with what's-her-name and, yeah, they still green
I'd rather be heard nowadays and not seen
Ten figure nigga, still might catch me in the ghetto
My house so big I can hear myself echo (hello, hello)
It must be me why my bitch stay preggo
'Cause I love the way she put the shit together like Legos

I was sellin' dope same time Crime Mob had made "Stilletos"
And niggas still can't get on my mothafuckin' level
You just signed to 1017, they say you with the devil
The next chain I'ma get is a iced out shovel

Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me (go)

Hit a lick for eighty Ps I wish it was eighty keys (keys)
In my band we all keep cuttas and we rollin' eighty deep
No one shadier than me, no one get shiestier than me (shiesty)
Heard the old sayin', "Apples don't fall far from the tree"
Yeah, my left wrist is on freeze (burr), is it cold or is it me? (Or is it me?)
Boy you ain't no lil' Gucci Mane, your ass a wannabe (a wannabe)
Heard them niggas play with you, niggas don't never play with me (nah)
In the streets no one is safe no more, no one not even me (not even me)
If you never took one for the team you can't get MVP (no)
Stressin' 'bout a court day, it got me losin' sleep
I see niggas postin' niggas that they never ever met (what?)
But never post me and they know me from up the street (what the fuck?)

I was sellin' dope same time Crime Mob had made "Stilletos"
And niggas still can't get on my mothafuckin' level
You just signed to 1017, they say you with the devil
The next chain I'ma get is a iced out shovel
