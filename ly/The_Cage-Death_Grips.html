		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I say kill it like ya
You say hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
Kill it like ya hate it
I say arrrgghh you say can't take it
I can't take it I can't take it)

Fuck you starin' at, didn't know I'd be so quick ta flash, 
Terrified by da way a bassilisk come out him skin so fast
Not the first won't be the last
Barrel of my gun down the hatch 187 deep throat chokin' eat dis fourty-four magnum dic

Murder the bar raiser, inverted cross fader, ash lung blastin' bum rush balls to da wall
Bitch slayer
Rainin' blood, burnin' paper
A Jackson's catchin' vapors
Fuck this cage
I'll thrash you later

(I say kill it like ya, you say hate it)

Step to me wit dat bullshit
Like I don't know
What you're doin'
Talkin' fast lookin' shady
You can't fade me keep it movin'

Hopes that
Mo cash will help you cope
Sorry ta tell ya but it won't
How do I get out then? you dont

Can't keep this locked down
Fuck that
Watch me now, fit da crush that
Hit it once knock it down and I'm done can't
Stop this break out get it come back underground railroad
Gunclaps ta sound
Of sirens screamin'
Count on it I'm leavin'

(I say kill it like ya, you say hate it)

Yeah I got that man fa show but tell em why you had ta get em though
(Get 'em)
'Cause the beat bangs, 'cause we came
Ta flip da oz out
Your sleep train
When the smoke clears
Who remains
This right here, why we claim
Outtanowhere, for keeps game
Don't go there
This tha real thing
(Get 'em)
Bord the plane
They're watchin' me
Bullshit stains
What they want from me
Fuck that man, my philosophy
Don't take a goddamn thing
Voice in my head
Kill everything
Startin' wit dis asshole
Right next to me
Get 'em, get 'em, 'cause I had to get 'em though
