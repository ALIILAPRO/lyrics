		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it-do it, baby, do what I could think
Do it-do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it-do it, baby, do what I could think
Do it-do it-do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it-do it baby, do what I could think
Do it-do it-do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it-do it baby, do what I could think

I ain't never rep a set, baby (tsk, tsk)
I ain't do no wrong
I could clean up good for you
Oh, I know right from wrong
'Cause I want make it, so badly (mm, mm, mm)
A million dollar baby (mm, mm, mm)
Don't at me, yeah, hell nah (yeah, yeah)

You rep my city for so damn long (ah, ah)
But you still don't notice me, my sound next (mhm)
Va next (yeah, yeah), I'm at they neck (yeah, yeah)
I'm runnin' up a check (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I see a bad lil' mama, she a diva (mm)
No matter what happens, he cannot come between us again (mm, mm, mm)
I know we're better than friends (better than friends)
I took her to Queen's Gambit (yeah, yeah), showed around my friends (right now)
Tried to pick some energy up, it don't matter 
I know you never moved on if you tried (oh, no)
I don't believe it, baby, I know you lied (oh, no)
All night long, what you mean, "I changed"?
Haven't stayed the same
I've been losin' my mind (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I said, "The city is mine" (ooh, ooh, ooh)

I ain't never rep a set, baby (mm, mm-mm)
I ain't do no wrong
I could clean up good for you (mm, mm-mm)
Oh, I know right from wrong
'Cause I want make it, so badly (mm, mm, mm)
A million dollar baby (mm, mm, mm)
Don't at me
I ain't never rep a set, baby (mm, mm-mm)
I ain't do no wrong
I could clean up good for you (mm, mm-mm)
Oh, I know right from wrong
'Cause I want make it, so badly (mm, mm, mm)
A million dollar baby (mm, mm, mm)
Don't at me

Hell-hell nah
Yeah, hell-hell nah
Hell-hell nah
Do it-do it, baby, do what I could think
Do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it-do it, baby, do what I could think
Hell-hell nah
Yeah, hell-hell nah
Hell-hell nah
