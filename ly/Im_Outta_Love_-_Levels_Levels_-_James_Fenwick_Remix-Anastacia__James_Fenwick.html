		<p>
		  Now, baby, come on
Don't claim that love you never let me feel
I shoulda known
'Cause you brought nothin' real
Come on be a man about it, you won't die
I ain't got no more tears to cry and I can't take this no more
You now I gotta let it go 
And you know

I'm outta love, set me free
And let me out this misery
Just show me the way to get my life again
'Cause you can't handle me
Said, I'm outta love, can't you see
Baby, that you've gotta set me free? 
I'm outta love, yeah

Said, how many times
Have I tried to turn this love around?
But every time you just let me down
Come on be a man about it, you'll survive
Sure that you can work it out alright
Tell me, yesterday did you know
I'd be the one to let you go? 
And you know

I'm outta love, set me free (set me free, yeah)
And let me out this misery (go, let me out this misery, yeah)
Show me the way to get my life again
You can't handle me
Said, I'm outta love, can't you see (I'm outta love)
Baby, that you gotta set me free?
I'm outta 

Let me get over you (over you)
The way you gotten over me too, yeah (yeah)
Seems like my time has come and now I'm movin' on
I'll be stronger

I'm outta love, set me free (set me free)
And let me out this misery (yeah)
Show me the way (show me the way) to get my life again (my life again)
You can't handle me (no no, no no)
Said, I'm outta love (I'm outta love), set me free (set me free)
And let me out this misery (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Show me the way to get my life again
You can't handle me
Said, I'm outta love, can't you see (can't you see)
Baby, that you gotta set me free?
I'm outta love, yeah
I'm outta love, set me free (no, no-no-no, yeah)
And let me out this misery (out this misery)
Show me the way to get my life again
And you can't handle me (no, no, no, no, yeah)
Said, I'm outta love, set me free (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Let me out this misery
