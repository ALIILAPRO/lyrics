		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stepping so hard to show off
Feeling you must want me to see you
Do you still know what your point was
Or was it just fuck off?

Trying so hard to show off
Do you even have a reason?
Do you feel better telling me something
Be in part it's pissing me off, pissin me off

Going so hard that you're stuck
Feeling you must want me to feel you
It's not me that you're down for
So would you please, shut up?
