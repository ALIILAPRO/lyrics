		  Ha

Never have I seen someone so pretty, wow
It's pretty wild, crazy
Caught me lookin', such a vision, oh
So pretty, wow
It's pretty wild, crazy
You look at me
Hope you can't see, no
As my heart beats I'm the lonely man 
The lonely man, baby

Mmh-mmh (ay-ay)
Mmh-mmh (ay-ay)
Mmh-mmh (ay-ay)
Mmh-mmh

Rollin' through my days and all my nights
Speedin' by, hopin' I don't hit the walls
There she stands and we share a stare
She is all I've been wantin', y'all
I can't explain what I'm feelin' so
I will wait and I'll wait for you
I will wait and I'll wait for you

In love
Now I know, now I know there's a truth I can't hide
In love
Can't believe what I'm seein', unreal to my eyes (yeah)
In love
And you find me, I find you whatever the life (yeah)
In love (ooh, ay-ooh)

You swim all through my mind
Just give me one more sign
Flyin' with me through the clouds, we goin' sky high
Take my hand and close your eyes and take the ride, ride

Mmh-mmh (ooh-ooh, ay-ay)
Mmh-mmh (ooh-ooh, ay-ay)
Mmh-mmh
(I'll just let you know, I'll just let you know) (ay-ay)
Mmh-mmh
(Gotta let you know, gotta let you know)

Rollin' through my days and all my nights
Speedin' by, hopin' I don't hit the walls
There she stands and we share a stare
She is all I've been wantin', y'all
I can't explain what I'm feelin' so
I will wait and I'll wait for you
I will wait and I'll wait for you

In love
Now I know, now I know there's a truth I can't hide
In love
Can't believe what I'm seein', unreal to my eyes (yeah)
In love
And you find me, I find you whatever the life (yeah)
In love (ooh, ay-ooh)
