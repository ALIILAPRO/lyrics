		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, baby, what you wishin' for? (Wishin' for?)
Maybe you should wish it more (wish it more)
Maybe the world is yours (world is yours)
Maybe when it rains, it pours (keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (I don't know how to wish anymore) 
Or do I? 

Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA
Might just blow my brain, I'd be Kurt Cobain 
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face

I wish you would find your chill
'Cause Lord knows this shit get real
And for this price, you know you'd kill
Man, it's big brack, you know the deal
Man, it's big slatt, you know the deal
Draco a big dragon, fire, hell
Can't save me, man, save yourself
'Cause I do not need no help

Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
(Ooh-oh, oh-ah)

Ooh, baby, what you wishin' for? (Wishin' for?)
Maybe you should wish it more (wish it more)
Maybe the world is yours (world is yours)
Maybe when it rains, it pours (keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (I don't know how to wish anymore)
Or do I? 

Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA
Might just blow my brain, I'd be Kurt Cobain 
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
