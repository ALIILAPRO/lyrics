		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweetheart, you look a little tired
When did you last eat?
Come in and make yourself right at home
Stay as long as you need
Tell me, is something wrong?
If something's wrong, you can count on me
You know I'll take my heart clean apart
If it helps yours beat

It's okay if you can't find the words
Let me take your coat
And this weight off of your shoulders


Like a force to be reckoned with
A mighty ocean or a gentle kiss
I will love you with every
Single thing I have
Like a tidal wave, we'll make a mess
Or calm waters, if that serves you best
I will love you without any strings attached

It's okay if you can't catch your breath
You can take the oxygen straight
Out of my own chest

I know exactly how the rule goes:
Put my mask on first
No, I don't want to talk about myself
Tell me where it hurts
I just want to build you up, build you up
'Til you're good as new
And maybe one day I will get
Around to fixing myself too

I don't even know where to start
Already tired of trying to recall
When it all fell apart
I just want to love you, to love you
To love you well
I just want to learn how, somehow
To be loved myself

Like a force to be reckoned with
A mighty ocean or a gentle kiss
I will love you without any strings attached
And what a privilege it is to love
A great honor to hold you up
Like a force to be reckoned with
A mighty ocean or a gentle kiss
I will love you with every
Single thing I have
Like a tidal wave, I'll make a mess
Or calm waters if that serves you best
I will love you without any strings attached
I will love you without
A single string attached
