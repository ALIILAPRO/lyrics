		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A moment to change it all
Had life before been so slow?
Urgency takes hold
But to live in fear isn't to live at all

So how can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important as that to me
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important as that to me
Oh

How do we sell you the world
Let it in, embrace and uncurl
So fit, so bold
Someone like you
Should not be left unsold

So how can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important as that to me
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important as that to me

Okay
Okay

We've got a moment to change it all
Had life before been so slow?
Urgency takes hold
But to live in fear isn't to live at all

So how can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important as that to me
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important as that to me

Okay
Okay
