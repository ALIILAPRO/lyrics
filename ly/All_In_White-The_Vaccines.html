		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break me on the thirty-seventh hour
Tout me, doubt me, show me all of your power
I will watch you rise on my back from the ground
Friend or foe? I don't know, do you like what you've found?

Because I will one day shine with you
I'll shine on a faithful few
Ah
Ah

Oh, show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white

Brush my cause aside with little trouble
Oh my God, I think I'm hearing double
I will watch you rise on my back from afar
Friend or foe? I don't know, now you're up in the stars

But I will one day shine with you
I'll shine on a faithful few
Ah
Ah

Oh, show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white

Oh, show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white

Oh, show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white
