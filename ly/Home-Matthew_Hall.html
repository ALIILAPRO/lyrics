		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Not that way that I do love you

Well, holy moly, me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you

Man, oh man, you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need

Well, hoy and heavy, pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La, la, la, la, take me home
Mother, I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you

Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and pay phone calls
I've been everywhere with you

We'll laught until we think we'll die
Barefoot on a summer night
Nothing could be sweeter than with you

And in the streets you run a-free
Like it's only you and me
Geez, you're something to see

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La, la, la, la, take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home
