		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you fall into despair
I got your back this time
Tell me when you're coming home
Don't you see how much I care
Just the stars align
No, I can't face the storm alone

Hold on, never let go
We're higher than we've ever been
Can't you feel how we grow?

So won't you tell me
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
Now that I'm ready
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
So won't you tell me
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
Now that I'm ready
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?

Don't you leave without a trace
I got my eyes on you
You've been off for way too long
You will leave an empty space
Into the sky of blue
Just to help yourself along

Hold on, never let go
We're higher than we've ever been
Can't you feel how we grow?

So won't you tell me
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
Now that I'm ready
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
So won't you tell me
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
Now that I'm ready
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?

For so long I've been
Waiting for your love
Keep longing for the time
For so long I've been
Aching for your love
Keep longing for the time

So won't you tell me
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
Now that I'm ready
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
So won't you tell me
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
Now that I'm ready
When will I see you?
When will I see you again?
