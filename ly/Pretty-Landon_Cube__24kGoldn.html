		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, my bitch like girls
Think I might die young
Yeah, my bitch like girls
Think I might die young
Uh

Yeah, my bitch like girls, but she like me 'cause I'm pretty
Think I might die young, but I don't wanna, it's a pity
Been a long damn night in a city that ain't with me
With a bad lil' bitch, she like Britney, sniffin' Whitney
Yeah, my bitch like girls, but she like me 'cause I'm pretty
Think I might die young, but I don't wanna, it's a pity
Been a long damn night in a city that ain't with me
With a bad lil' bitch, she like Britney, sniffin' Whitney

Well, my bitch like girls and that's a blessing
Can you rock my world, I gotta test it
Need it all right now, but I ain't stressin', no
I leave 'em guessin', lethal weapon 
Smith & Wesson, woah
Let's get drunk, have some fun
Tell your friends to come, get it on
I think I might die young
And I don't want to, baby
But I been wildin' lately
I know it drive you crazy
Yeah, I got somethin' to prove
I said I'm good on my own
I don't need nothin' from you
But we could still get it on
If you bring a friend or two
Know I ain't known you for long
But I know

Yeah, my bitch like girls, but she like me 'cause I'm pretty
Think I might die young, but I don't wanna, it's a pity
Been a long damn night in a city that ain't with me
With a bad lil' bitch, she like Britney, sniffin' Whitney
Yeah, my bitch like girls, but she like me 'cause I'm pretty
Think I might die young, but I don't wanna, it's a pity
Been a long damn night in a city that ain't with me
With a bad lil' bitch, she like Britney, sniffin' Whitney

How I'm livin', no religion
No forgiveness, Lord forgive me
I've been sinnin' all damn weekend
I've been sippin' through the evenin'
No forgiveness, they don't feel me
Say they miss the fuckin' real me
Shakin' hands with all my demons
Did some shit, you wouldn't believe it
Me and shawty off them drugs, we can't see shit
We been actin' wild as fuck for no reason
Shawty roll the blunts and call some friends
She don't front, she confident
I'm destructive with no shame
I might go and tat' her name
Know I love them crazy bitches
Oh, I love the way she lick it
She been drippin' all damn evenin'
We been winnin' all damn season 
Like it's, like it's all star weekend (uh)

Yeah, my bitch like girls, but she like me 'cause I'm pretty
Think I might die young, but I don't wanna, it's a pity
Been a long damn night in a city that ain't with me
With a bad lil' bitch, she like Britney, sniffin' Whitney
Yeah, my bitch like girls, but she like me 'cause I'm pretty
Think I might die young, but I don't wanna, it's a pity
Been a long damn night in a city that ain't with me
With a bad lil' bitch, she like Britney, sniffin' Whitney

Yeah, my bitch like girls
Think I might die young
Yeah, my bitch like girls
Think I might die young
