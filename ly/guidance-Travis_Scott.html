		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I found out that you're bad for me
I found out that you had someone
Every time I get this drunk
I hope I wake up in another place

I roll up behind it, I wanna try it
Grip on your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin'
You're from the islands, you stay wildin'
I guide, I guide you, like a pilot

Haven't been around this year
I like to see you change your gears
To a motion that's more faster, babe
I'm grippin' like I'm tryna catch up, babe

Come through, follow me
Rumble, follow me
Rollin', follow me
Opt to, follow me
Do you like that? Follow me
Nicest, follow me
Backwoods, follow me
Practice, follow me, yeah
Hop up, it's time for a switch
Lightskinned girls like the hair, man, it come with a twist
Badmon, badmon, yeah you know it come with a risk
Ain't a bouncer, but the way you bouncin'
I might just frisk

I roll up behind it, I wanna try it
Grip up your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin'
You need some guidance, you stay wildin'
I'ma guide you like a pilot

Haven't been around this year
I like to see you change your gears
To a motion that's more faster, babe
I'm grippin' like I'm tryna catch up, babe

I found out that you're bad for me
I found out that you had someone
Every time I get this drunk
I hope I wake up in another place
(Roll up, roll up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oh, oh

You silent, you quiet
What happened to the loud talkin'?
All that noise, you done?
Are you finished? Or are you done?
How you been wit your workout business?
Got my subscription
Got my attention
You know my intentions
You know that nobody know our business
God's our witness
Lit like my wrist is
Only like it when you're at your littest

I roll up behind it, I wanna try it
Grip up your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin'
You need some guidance, you stay wildin'
I'ma guide you like a pilot

Haven't been around this year
I like to see you change your gears
To a motion that's more faster, babe
I'm grippin' like I'm tryna catch up, babe

Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop!
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrah!
I roll up, I roll up
