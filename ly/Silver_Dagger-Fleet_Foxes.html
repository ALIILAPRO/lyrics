		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sing love songs
You'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She said, that I can't be your bride

All men are false, said my mother
They'll tell you wicked, lovin' lies
And the very next evening, they'll court another
Leave you alone to pine and sigh

My daddy, he's a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link, a heart does dangle
Of another maid, he's loved and wronged

So court another tender maiden
And hope that she will be your wife
For I've been warned and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life

Don't sing love songs
You'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says, that I can't be your bride
