		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in the dark, I can't forget
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again
I can't go back again

But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away, I only got so far
The other me is dead
I hear his voice inside my head

We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

You told me to love you, and I did
Tied my soul into a knot
And got me to submit
So when I got away,
I only kept my scars
The other me is gone
Now I don't know where I belong

We were never alive,
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

Dead visions in your name
Dead fingers in my veins
Dead memories in my heart

Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
