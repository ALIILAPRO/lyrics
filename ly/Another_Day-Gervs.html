		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's another day to love you
I won't skip a day I swear
Like coffee in the morning
I'll always be supporting
Yeah
It's another day to love you
I wrote you many letters
(I did, yeah)
I'm wishing you were here I woulda spoke it
(Face to face)
Girl everyday I'm craving you
A place with me is home for you
You're flowers to my garden
I stay running on a mission
Tryna write a fiction for ya
Open your imagination
Girl I'm tryna make it for ya
And you keep me motivated
Girl I always say this to ya
(I love you)
Just stick around with me
I'll do the rest
(I'll do the rest)
It's another day to love you
I won't skip a day I swear
Like coffee in the morning
I'll always be supporting
Yeah
It's another day to love you
With you anywhere is a vacation
I don't mind if we don't go out
If you do baby tell me the location
But you said no
I'd rather stay home
It's the simple things we're always doing more of
All I want is you around every tomorrow
I'll do the rest
Oh
(I'll do the rest)
I'll do the rest
Oh
(I'll do the rest)
Ooh
