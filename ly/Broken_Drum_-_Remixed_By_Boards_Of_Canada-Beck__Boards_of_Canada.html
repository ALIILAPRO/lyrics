		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you there 
Your long black hair 
Your eyes just stare 
Your mind is turning 

You know I'll laugh 
And I won't take it back 
I've seen your eyes I know 
What your thinking 

And one by one 
We'll shoot our guns 
We'll have fun 
Don't ever doubt it 

And when I say 
Fare thee well 
My only friend 
Oh how the days go 

Your setting sun 
Your broken drum 
Your little drugs 

I'll never forget you 
Never 
Forget 
You
