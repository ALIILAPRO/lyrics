		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been on molly for weeks
Got a bitch, gon' come that way
Need me a Patek Philippe
Just so I know that I made it
I'm happy, I'm falling asleep
'Cause of the- 'Cause of the money I'm makin'
Fuck it, crash the whip
(yeah, yeah) , crash the whip
Big body Benz, it beep (Beep)
Fuck it, now I'm gettin' you wet
I don't want criticism, don't need a peer
Eatin' that pussy, I go for a year
Sip on the lean, sip on no beer
And the gas that I'm smokin', it's from Mars
It's not here
I'm so high, how could I steer?
Shootin' a deer like Johnny, yeah (yeah)
In the red house, trap dirt, yeah
I hit track, bae
The money, it's fast, it's faster
I know that she hate me (Hate me)
She call me, she wanna have my babies
Got some hoes, you can't ever play me (No no)

Guns with thirties, I needa sleep
Drop 'til my money on me
They say "Boy, you be singin' like Lee"
(yeah, yeah)
I'm mixed up the C with double G
Got a bitch named Gawk, I don't know
I ain't see (Bitch)
And I'm sippin' Adderall
I don't know what I see
All my demons on go mode, don't test me
Big body Benz take off, go vroom
In this bitch with two baddies, gimme a room
Fuck on that bitch, when she jump
It go broom i been flexin' on niggas
Got nothin' to prove
I stay with a figure, we sippin' on juice
I been high for way too many days
And money on the line, bitches on the line
Man, I got too many plays (yeah)
I get that money like four ways (Uh)
She gon' eat on the dick for a play
Got my wrist in the pot, stir it
Pour an eight no cap, got a plug named Horay
Niggas scrapin' that pot crack, gourmet (Dub)
I got Tech in my cup, ain't no Chardonnay
Mixin' molly with Addy, been up for days
And I ain't tryna wait (yeah)

I've been on molly for weeks
Got a bitch, gon' come that way
Need me a Patek Philippe
Just so I know that I made it
I'm happy, I'm falling asleep
'Cause of the- 'Cause of the money I'm makin'
Fuck it, crash the whip
(yeah, yeah) , crash the whip
Big body Benz, it beep (Beep)
Fuck it, now I'm gettin' you wet
I don't want criticism, don't need a peer
Eatin' that pussy, I go for a year
Sip on the lean, sip on no beer
And the gas that I'm smokin', it's from Mars
It's not here
I'm so high, how could I steer?
Shootin' a deer like Johnny, yeah (yeah)
In the red house, trap dirt, yeah
I hit track, bae
The money, it's fast, it's faster
I know that she hate me (Hate me)
She call me, she wanna have my babies
Got some hoes, you can't ever play me (No no)

Rudin' 'round, 'round in that bih', yeah
Foreign designer my feet, yeah
I been fed up 'cause I'm weak
Too many sandy cheeks at the beach (yeah)
On the road, she on littering
I just went double cup the smithereens
Yeah, I'm fresh, I feel like Listerine
With a Palm Angels jacket
Baguette on my ring, yeah
Vroom, run it- run it up like
I play for the Bucks (Skrrt)
I'm goin' up, I don't really need no love
(No)
Be on my team, my ring, my mothafuckin' scene
(It's a scene, it's a scene, yeah)
Take an Oxy and I go in, a million years
(yeah) i done just hopped in the coupe
I'm goin' fast (Skrrt, skrrt)
It's a language, it's fluent
I'm talkin' 'bout cash (Oh, yeah)
I just spent like seven on some RAFs
(God damn)
I'm fuckin' your lil' bitty bitch and
I gave her a rash (Skrrt, skrrt)

I've been on molly for weeks
Got a bitch, gon' come that way
Need me a Patek Philippe
Just so I know that I made it
I'm happy, I'm falling asleep
'Cause of the- 'Cause of the money I'm makin'
Fuck it, crash the whip
(yeah, yeah) , crash the whip
Big body Benz, it beep (Beep)
Fuck it, now I'm gettin' you wet
I don't want criticism, don't need a peer
Eatin' that pussy, I go for a year
Sip on the lean, sip on no beer
And the gas that I'm smokin', it's from Mars
It's not here
I'm so high, how could I steer?
Shootin' a deer like Johnny, yeah (yeah)
In the red house, trap dirt, yeah
I hit track, bae
The money, it's fast, it's faster
I know that she hate me (Hate me)
She call me, she wanna have my babies
Got some hoes, you can't ever play me (No no)
