		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the face of my city
Cosigned by Diddy
Hard liquor, I'm shitty
Hotel with some bitty
Got her doing my bidding
You changed, no kidding
Wasn't always this pretty (mmm)

Runway me, I'm fitting
Fourth-quarter, ninth inning
Ain't no way we ain't winning
Back home for a week, ain't no way we ain't sinning (woo)
If she came to stay with me, ain't no way she ain't pretty
Got the 808 hitting
Y'all some internet thugs, won't come face to face with me
Y'all would hate to play with me
Tummy tuck it one time, she'll pay to stay skinny
I done been on that road, I done ate some great Denny's
And (and), and some Cracker Barrel
Little brother with me selling Jack apparel
She a rich girl, she done had Camaros
Cheaper to keep her, Willy Caballero
White boy with a little habanero
I just hit a hundred, I was at a zero
I'm a big boss, you just at a bureau
Hometown hero, tell 'em at a mural

I'm the face of my city (city)
Cosigned by Diddy (facts)
Hard liquor, I'm shitty
Hotel with some bitty (woo)
Got her doing my bidding
You changed, no kidding
Wasn't always this pretty (pretty)

I'm the man in my city (yeah)
Niggas can't fuck with me (nah)
Bookbag three fifty (cash)
Got my hand on my blicky
Might swag, I don't dance for real
First come then I'm paying her bills
Niggas bums, they got nowhere to live
I ain't chasing nothing but me some M's
I ain't beefing with them niggas, they kids
I should put 'em over my knee and spank 'em
I was thinking that they would've been thankful
Pretty bitch and she be killing them angles
We turn a killer right into an angel
I start demolishing shit when I'm angry
Boy, don't be following me, that shit dangerous
Still in the 'partments, my lil' hitters banging
I repped my projects before I was famous
Straight from the bottom, you know I ain't changing
Everything cash, you know how I play
Fuck like I love her, she know I ain't staying
Pass her to dog and you know how I'm playing
Act like I'm dumb but you know I ain't crazy
Big Baby

I'm the face of my city (yeah)
Cosigned by Diddy
Hard liquor, I'm shitty
Hotel with some bitty
Got her doing my bidding
You changed, no kidding
Wasn't always this pretty (pretty)
