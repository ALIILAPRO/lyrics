		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, holding back
Yeah, I've always been good at that, unattached (yeah)
Waiting for what's coming next, things I know I should address
I feel more together when I am a mess (whoa)
That's for moments that just came and went
Made amends with you, then you overstepped
That's a line you never shoulda crossed, you got no respect
Stop with all the threats
Like the more I get know you, I just know you less (yeah)
'Nother city I don't know well
Feeling too much like my old self
Backsliding, backsliding
Got me in the sad feels, got me at a standstill
Too much time alone is when it gets real (ah)
Future doesn't pop up, then the past will
Outside, that's the rear view
Now I'm going downhill (yeah)
Don't know who I'm close with
Going through the motions
Don't know who to trust when I (yeah)

I lie to myself and I, I can't handle it
Why do I waste so much time on things that I can't fix?
All these things I hold inside I just can't forget
Thought that I could let this go

But I ain't know that it would be like this, yeah
Like this (like this)
I ain't know that it would be like this
Yeah, like this
I ain't know that it would be like this

Yeah, baby I'm impossible to be with
I know that you got a thousand reasons
You prolly wanna leave, but don't know how, yeah
I don't hear a thing when you yell
Guess you like to hear your own voice, yeah
Got me standing here with no choice
I see they tryna gas, they got me all wrong
Look, I'm doing my best to try to stay calm
But I can't deal
Feeling too much like my old self
Backsliding, backsliding
I just let the phone ring
We ain't even close, please
Throwing out opinions from the nosebleeds (ay, yeah)
Lot of issues that you don't see
Texts that I just won't read
Play it off, it cuts deep though
When I don't know who I'm close with
Going through the motions
Don't know who to trust when I (yeah)

I lie to myself and I can't handle it
Why do I waste so much time on things that I can't fix? (yeah)
All these things I hold inside I just can't forget (nah)
Thought that I could let this go (yeah)

But I ain't know that it would be like this, yeah (woo, yeah)
Like this (ay)
I ain't know that it would be like this
(I ain't know that it would be like this, woo)
Yeah, like this (like this)
I ain't know that it would be like this (like this), yeah (yeah)
Like this (like this)
I ain't know that it would be like this
Yeah, like this (like this)
I ain't know that it would be like this
