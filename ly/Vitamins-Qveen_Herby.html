		  Here we go

Extra, extra, read all about it
Queen comin' back with the brand new style
Been focused on my shit, makin' moves in silence
Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins
Ooh, I've been wakin' up smilin'
Bitch, now they're callin' me Your Highness
Ooh, I've been wakin' up smilin'
Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins

Aim high and I swing low
Open mind, anything goes
TLC to these silly hoes
They ain't listenin' to Queen and it really shows
I baptize bitches with my holy flows
I don't fuck with no chickens, only goats
Out here lookin' like a vegan, oh, she glows
Want to know my secrets and my antidotes

Self care, good livin'
Vision, born on a mission
Eat my greens, nutrition
You ain't on my vibe, then I don't got to listen

Extra, extra, read all about it
Queen comin' back with the brand new style
Been focused on my shit, makin' moves in silence
Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins
Ooh, I've been wakin' up smilin'
Bitch, now they're callin' me Your Highness
Ooh, I've been wakin' up smilin'
Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins

Vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C
Vitamin D, vitamin, bitch, vitamin please
I went bullshit free for weeks
It snatched my physique
And put the colour back on my cheeks
I found peace, now my influence is catastrophic
The beat break down soon as I get on it
Soon as Louis dropped the season, bitch, I copped it
Be like SOS, you can't stop it
No smoke, marijuana, no show for the drama
Go vogue like Madonna, no cones when I want 'em
Meditate in my sauna, levitate, countin' commas
She's a real one, yeah, she's a stunner

Extra, extra, read all about it
Queen comin' back with the brand new style
Been focused on my shit, makin' moves in silence
Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins
Ooh, I've been wakin' up smilin'
Bitch, now they callin' me Your Highness
Ooh, I've been wakin' up smilin'
Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins

Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins
(Don't take it personal)
Workin' out, sleepin' in, takin' vitamins

It's a full-time job, baby
Self-care
It's true
