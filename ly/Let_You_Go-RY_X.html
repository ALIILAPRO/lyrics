		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go

Hold the light
Feel my sign here
Toe the line
Feel my warm tears

Does anybody really know me?
Throw my name into the fire
Lead me down into the cold
Lead me down into the night

I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go

(Let you go)
I don't wanna let you go
(Let you go)

(Let you go)

(Let you go)

(Let you go)
(Let you)

Does anybody really know
Where they go when they die?
You're the one I want this close
You're the one I can't deny
