		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No-one cares about the things that you do, 
Were you hoping it was the last time?
All alone at sea with somebody new, 
Did you think that you could change their mind?

It's been a long time since the warning
There's no-one here to share the morning
Another day and still I'm falling
It's been a long time since the warning


I can't stop myself from running to you, 
I don't want to be alone no more
Turn your back and walk as the devil comes to you, 
There's a mirror right behind your door

It's been a long time since the warning
There's no-one here to share the morning
Another day and still I'm falling
It's been a long time since the warning

Nothing's changed and every idea feels the same
Come on over let me hold you once again
Nothing's changed and every idea feels the same

All alone at sea with somebody new, 
Did you think that you could change their mind?

It's been a long time since the warning
There's no-one here to share the morning
Another day and still I'm falling
It's been a long time since the warning
