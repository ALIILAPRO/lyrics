		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Called to the devil and the devil did come
Said to the devil, "Devil do you like drums?
Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?"
He said only, "Sundown, Sundays, Christmas"

Some day's end when I need a few friends
Now and again I could never hope to keep them
Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been

Don't get me venting on friends who resent you 
'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
They thought was a necklace and reckless they fell into hell 
Where you both hang with nothing to do but

Scratch, kick, let gravity win like
Fuck this, let gravity win like
You could leave it all behind, even the devil need time alone sometimes
You could let it all go, you could let it all go
It's called freefall
It's called freefall

Called to the devil and the devil said quit
Can't be bothered better handle your shit
Keep about your wits man, keep about your wits
Know yourself and who you came in with
Can I sit down I've been hustling all day
I can't even count how many souls I've made
Off the same deal you on
Remember the devil ain't a friend to no one
But fine, true

Well, you could let it all go, you could let it all go
It's called freefall
It's called freefall

Called to the devil and the devil said, "Hey, why you been calling this late? 
It's like 2 A.M. and the bars all close at ten in hell, that's a rule I made"
Anyway, you say you're too busy saving everybody else to save yourself
And you don't want no help, oh well
That's the story to tell

You could let it all go, you could let it all go
It's called freefall
It's called freefall
You could let it all go, you could let it all go
'Cause ain't shit free but falling out
That shit's easy let me show you how, it's like

Ain't shit free but falling out
That shit's easy let me show you how, it's like
