		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we love until there's nothing left
And we're collecting dust?
Use the halo of our golden souls
Until we're flecks of rust

A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart, that I'll die for you
Cross my heart, that I'll always keep you
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo
And we go

Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let it intertwine
Your hand in mine
And fill the empty space
All the demons cry
'Cause you and I
Found love in a broken place

A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart, that I'll die for you
Cross my heart, that I'll always keep you
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo
And we go

Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah

Gather around, now I'm back from my holiday
Long live the queen what the people say
And that be me, I got a king in my calvary
Them other knights, say goodnight, they get apathy
You'll never catch an Adam without Eve
You'll never catch a bloom without seeds
See what I mean you're my Caesar upon my chariot
You know family matters what'as Carl without Harriot?
Inseparable like Mary Kate and Ashley?
Incredible, I'm ready if you ask me
To ride on them feminine chicks, you feel me?
I break 'em down, it's a sport, I should win an Espy
Royalty, another level, boy you don't shine
Legendary, leatherr nation needs a paradigm
Call all the king's horses and all the king's men
We're ruling 'til the end, kingdom come

Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah

You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah
You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
