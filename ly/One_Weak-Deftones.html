		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nerve, here I burned feeding on his lung
Verve, is his curse because he wanted to meet Christ alone?

Bitch, you're no good
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
We could be
You're God

There in my bones
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
Because we wanted it to be alone

But you will

No, you will never find me, breach unborn
Never come here watch me burn
Never bitch because your scars show
Never will I burn under and beneath the floor

Before, face it
'Cause you're no good
We could have been like one

Beg, don't even try
And you will never
Beg
