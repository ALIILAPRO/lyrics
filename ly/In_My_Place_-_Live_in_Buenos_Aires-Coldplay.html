		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh for it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I wait for it, for it
If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you 

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

Please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out, to me, yeah to me
Come back and sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah
