		  Race
Life's a race
That I am gonna win
Yes, I am gonna win
And I'll light the fuse
And I'll never lose
And I choose to survive
Whatever it takes

You won't pull ahead
I'll keep up the pace
And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race
Yes I am prepared
To stay alive
And I won't forgive
Vengeance is mine
And I won't give in
Because I choose to thrive

Yeah, I'm gonna win

Race
It's a race
But I'm gonna win
Yes, I'm gonna win

And I will light the fuse
And I'll never lose
And I choose to survive
Whatever it takes

You won't pull ahead
'Cause I'll keep up the pace
And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race

Yes I'm gonna win

Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Win
Win
Win
Win, yes I'm gonna win
