		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been away too long
Way too long, but I'm home again
Long after I had done
What I'd done, what's become of them?
I thought their souls were gone, something's wrong
So I need to put an end to everyone
Everyone (two, three, four)

Five nights
Five innocent lives, I took before their time (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine
Even though they died, a part of them survived
I'll make them unalive (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine (safe inside)

When you hide remains, what remains?
Just a remnant of a soul inside a shell
I can tell by destroying them
But this time, there's no gore 
Like before
Wasn't pretty
But it needed to be done for my son (two, three)

Five lives
Thought that they were mine, I can't believe my eyes (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine
Running out of time
I think that I can find a place where I can hide (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine (safe inside)

He is here, he is here
I'd recognize him anywhere
That purplish figure was bigger and quicker than me
And then I thought I was dreaming
He looked like a demon
And I remember bleeding and screaming
And thinking nobody could hear me
For what he did to me, he's gonna die (die)
The others agree, he needs to die (die)
We'll never be free until he dies (dies)

Five lives
Gone before their time, now they're sustaining mine (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine, not sure I survived
I don't think that I died, I'm only half alive (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine, stuck inside

Fa-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine
La-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la (yikes)
It's alright, I'll be fine, stuck inside
Stuck in my own trap
Bones are cracked
As my lungs collapse
Remember that I always come back
