		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

I am the one thing in life I can control

Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

I am inimitable
I am an original

Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

I'm not falling behind or running late

Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

Wait
Wait
Wait

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

Climb
Climb
Climb

He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

Time
Time
Time

What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit

I'm willing to wait for it

I'm willing to wait for it

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise and we fall
He play and he raises the stakes

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to

Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it 
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it 
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait
