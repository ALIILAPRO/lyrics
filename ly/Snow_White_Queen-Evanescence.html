		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop light, lock the door
Don't look back
Undress in the dark
And hide from you, all of you

You'll never know
The way your words have haunted me
I can't believe you'd ask these things of me
You don't know me now or never

You belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over

Soon my love, you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you

Wake up in a dream
Frozen fear
All your hands on me
I can't scream, I can't scream

I can't escape
The twisted way you think of me
I feel you in my dreams And I don't sleep (ever and ever)
I don't sleep 

See you belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over

Soon my love, you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you

Can't save your life
Though nothing I bleed for
Is more tormenting

I'm losing my mind
And you just stand there
And stare as my world divides

You belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over

Soon my love, you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you

All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
Forever and ever, ever and ever
