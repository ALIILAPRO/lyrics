		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you) yo

Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain (we ridin')
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on the Coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that's a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

Four-door Maybach, I drive anything
Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
(Oh my Lord, praise him be) DJ EscoMoe City

Uh
I got a halo
I level up every time God says so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Run these streets like Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say grow
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no Kenny that I don't touch
All my enemies bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell
Half of y'all might need help
I might fall in Rodeo (bitch)
I might ball in Austria (say no more)
I might call her for real (say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows
And I snuck in with a velcro
She copy like 10-4
Know it's sinful
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a create-a-player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay your debt
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold your breath
I mean, I'm floatin'
I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions
And emotions, I put the career in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when
My nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin'
It's deep (It's deep)
I done fucked so much I can't sleep
I done fucked so much I'm retired (swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (it's alright)
Bitch my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (how many?)
Take the mask off so you can see

Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
Ten, ten tears
Mine, said the Lord
