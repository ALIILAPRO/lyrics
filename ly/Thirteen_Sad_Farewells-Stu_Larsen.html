		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been seeing me, through your grown up eyes and your sweet disguise
cnd you've been running free with your lullabies and those same old lines

Darling I should have said goodbye
Before you even caught my eye
Now I can't bare to see this die

13 sad farewells my darling
13 sad farewells
I will see you no more darling, I've used all my farewells

You've been seeing her, with her pretty eyes and her lovely lies
cnd I've been waiting here, I've been killing time hoping you will be mine

Darling I should have said goodbye
Before you even caught my eye
Now I can't bare to see this die

13 sad farewells my darling
13 sad farewells
I will see you no more darling, I've used all my farewells

13 sad farewells my darling
13 sad farewells
You will see me no more darling, you've used all your farewells
