		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ow-ow-ow-ow! Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care
That you care?
When every time I look around,
The people suffer in the suffering
In every way, in everywhere

Say, na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!)
We're the survivors 
Yes, the Black survivors!
I tell you what some people got everything
Some people got nothing
Some people got hopes and dreams
Some people got ways and means

Na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!)
We're the survivors 
Yes, the Black survivors!
Yes, we're the survivors, like Daniel out of the lions' den
(Black survivors) Survivors, survivors!
So I Idren, I sistren,
A-which way will we choose?
We better hurry oh, hurry oh, hurry wo, now!
'Cause we got no time to lose
Some people got facts and claims
Some people got pride and shame
Some people got the plots and schemes
Some people got no aim it seems

Na-na-na-na-na, (na-na, na-na!)
We're the survivors, 
Yes, the Black survivors!
Tell you what, we're the survivors 
Yeah! the Black survivors 
Yeah! we're the survivors, like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
(Black survivors), thrown in the fire, but never get burn
So I Idren, I sistren,
The preaching and talkin' is done
We've gotta live up, wo now, wo now!
'Cause the Father's time has come
Some people put the best outside
Some people keep the best inside
Some people can't stand up strong
Some people won't wait for long

(Na-na-na-na-na!) Na-na-na, na-na-na na!
We're the survivors
In this age of technological inhumanity (Black survival)
Scientific atrocity (survivors)
Atomic misphilosophy (Black survival)
Nuclear misenergy (survivors)
It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity (Black survival)

Together now
(Na-na-na-na-na!) Na na-na na na! (Na na-na na na!)
We're the survivors, yeah!
We're the survivors!
Yes, the Black survivors!
We're the survivors
A good man is never honored (survivors)
in his own country (Black survival)
Nothing change, nothing strange (survivors)
Nothing change, nothing strange (Black survivors)
We got to survive, y'all! (survivors)
