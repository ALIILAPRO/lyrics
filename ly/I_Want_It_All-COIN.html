		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, you're taking your time in every way
If you feel the same, well, why would we wait?
There's words I can't say
But my love's not simple, I'm fragile

And you don't even know
No, you don't even know it all

I want it all
I've got this lovesick feeling
But there's nothing like it, nothing at all
I know your heart's still beating
And I want it all, I want it all
Or nothing at all

Babe, we push and we pull, we give and we take
But we've got a lifetime to kill, a second to waste
Oh, what a shame
But my love's not simple, it's fragile

And you don't even know
No, you don't know the half of it

I want it all
I've got this lovesick feeling
But there's nothing like it, nothing at all
I know your heart's still beating
And I want it all, I want it all
Or nothing at all

So make up your mind
Quit wasting your time
I'm losing my mind, mind, mind
All or nothing, all or nothing
All or nothing, all or nothing

And I want it all, I want it all
Or nothing at all
I've got this lovesick feeling
But there's nothing like it, nothing at all
I know your heart's still beating
And I want it all, I want it all
Or nothing at all
Or nothing at all
