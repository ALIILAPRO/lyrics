		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up in a holy haze
Don't know how I found my way home, yeah, my way home
And I think I drank my body weight
Called my ex up on the payphone, a payphone

I never tried to pick, they're crawling on me
Twisting on me, out of control, control
And when you shimmy, shimmy
Touch my body, hit me with a ghetto
On my bones, my bones

About last night, I was undone
God, it feels right being so wrong
And I realized
All the blurry nights are when I feel alive
About last night, I was so gone
Out of my mind, falling in love
And I realized
All the blurry nights are when I feel alive
About last night

Woke up, couldn't feel my face
Help, my brain's in outer space, oh, oh, oh
Looking for a heart to break
I know I should probably stay home, stay home

I never tried to pick, they're crawling on me
Twisting on me, out of control, control
And when you shimmy, shimmy
Touch my body, hit me with a ghetto
On my bones, my bones

About last night, I was undone
God, it feels right being so wrong
And I realized
All the blurry nights are when I feel alive
About last night, I was so gone
Out of my mind, falling in love
And I realized
All the blurry nights are when I feel alive
About last night
