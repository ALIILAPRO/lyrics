		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow

We out in Italy on the water
Me and Strick recordin', smokin' weed, smokin' dope (die slow, die slow)
Drinkin' a lil' lean, I actually did good, I ain't drink but a pint this whole tour
Yeah, on tour, I done missed my son's birthday, it's on July the 15th
Nah, I lowkey, like, really see people ridin' past on boats 
Right now out the window (die slow, die slow)
It's just the, just the penthouse suite, know it's nothin' major, yeah

Told the lawyer that my brother ain't goin' back to prison
I don't give a fuck if I gotta turn that nigga Jehovah's Witness
I'm just seekin' for God's soul 'cause I know something's missin'
Comme des Gar√ßons boxers, and I came from penny-pinchin'
Came out the struggle, nigga, I really had lost a brother, nigga
Got to fightin' with the Deputy sheriff, I almost lost my mother, nigga

And that's funny, that's funny, like
My mama had broke up with my dad for having another kid on her, and um
He had came home one day and saw a car in the driveway
It was an off-duty sheriff, a Deputy sheriff that my mom was fuckin' with, and um
They had a few words, and it ended with, um, my dad shooting
He ended up in the hospital in a coma, yeah, so
Fast forward like eight years later, my sisters had got to fighting, and um
And they, and they, and they had a family member that was a Deputy sheriff, and um
My mom came outside to goddamn stop the fighting
And the lady got in the car and just pulled off doing like sixty miles per hour, ran my mom over
She had a stroke and shit, but she alright, yeah

Always knew I wasn't gon' be gay
I had her sendin' pictures to my mom's phone when I was like eight
I always knew that I'd be great
'Cause my coach told me I was slow, but I was runnin' at a fast pace, huh
They tryna divide us and conquer the world with it
They got a couple of the guys and all of the girls with it
But I'm a mastermind, I see right through it
I see that they got couple of diamonds but the rest of 'em pearls in it
They say you poor 'cause you black right to your face (yeah)
They say where you live, you'll never be able to own that place
My father said that you can change it all with your performance
And by the way, your life is a VV stone charm
They take the land and then detect who all can come
But I tell you with a long sleeve, I bear arms
I'm high enough to be on a Milky Way 'til morning
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than anyone
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than anyone
Put on my socks, grab my Glock, the stick under the couch
Tie all my shoes, you wearin' flip flops, and it's top of the top
R.I.P. Nipsey, know what I'm sayin'

(If you were the one in my shoes, would you love?)
Would you love, would you love, would you love, would you love?
If you were the one in, if you were the one in
They prejudiced, so why first of the day, yeah
Would you run away or would you come back nightly? (Woo)

I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow, die slow

Slime, what's going on? It's feeling like they won
Gotta get back up, you Black Panther's son
I gotta tell you that you'll die slow, die slow, die slow
You gon' die slow, die slow, die slow
Mom, what's going on? It's feeling like the Devil won
Die slow, die slow
