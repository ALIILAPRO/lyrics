		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be, inside your heart
That's the place, the place for me
But I could understand, it won't be easy
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me

Like I say it ain't easy
To let your heart run wild
So if you want to please me baby
Then don't act like a child
But I can understand, it won't be easy
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me

It doesn't matter if you're far away
Or right here by my side
That's the way I feel about it
We can't let the whole thing slide

So if you can't see me
Right where you are
Then why don't you send for me baby?
By the nearest star
It won't be easy, and you've got to prove
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
