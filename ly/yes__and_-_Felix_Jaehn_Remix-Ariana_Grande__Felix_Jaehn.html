		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right

Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?"

Now, I'm so done with caring
What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life

Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

"Yes (yes), and?"
Say that shit with your chest (chest), and
Be your own fuckin' best (best) friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?" (Yeah)

My tongue is sacred, I speak upon what I like
Protected, sexy, discerning with my time (my time)
Your energy is yours and mine is mine (mine is mine)
What's mine is mine
My face is sitting, I don't need no disguise (I don't need no disguise)
Don't comment on my body, do not reply
Your business is yours and mine is mine
Why do you care so much whose- I ride?
Why?

"Yes (yes), and?" (Yes, and?)
Say that shit with your chest (chest), and (say that shit with your chest)
Be your own fuckin' best (best) friend (oh, be your own, be your own)
Say that shit with your chest (say that shit with your chest, baby)
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?"
"Yes (yes), and?"
Say that shit with your chest (chest), and
Be your own fuckin' best (be your own) friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?" (Yeah)
