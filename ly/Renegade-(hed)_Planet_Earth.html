		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a renegade
Back out, motherfucker
You better tap out
Boo-hoo, you crying baby
Where you at now?
'Cause I be lookin' for you
Me and my people lookin' ready
And we're lookin' for truth
So come and get this

Make it hurt, you know I love it
When you test this
Put me up into a corner
Be a witness
Yeah, this is critical mass
We invite the revolution
We ignite the past

See me
I'm still standing
I might be bleeding
But I'm still breathing

I'll never surrender
'Cause I'm a renegade
What, what you want some
Come and get some
Pussy motherfucker
I got you where you live nigga
Me, you will never control, no
Genocidal maniacal

Devil, the party's over
I'm a renegade
A runaway slave
I've been dreaming about my freedom
On the underground train
It's Armageddon you're getting, just what you wanted
Critical mass, freedom at last, freedom at last

See me
I'm still standing
I might be bleeding
But I'm still breathing

You might hate me
But you can't break me
I might be bleeding
But I'm still breathing

This dog will turn around and bite you
Turn around and (WHAT) bite you
This dog will turn around and bite you
This dog will (WHAT)
(Growl)

How long do you think I'm just gonna let you
Fuck with me and not do something about it?
You think I'm just gonna turn the other cheek?

You push me, so I'll push you right back
You push me, so I'll push you right back
You push me, so I'll push you right back
You push me, so I'll push you right back

See me
I'm still standing
I might be bleeding
But I'm still breathing

You might hate me
But you can't break me
I might be bleeding
But I'm still breathing

I'll never surrender 'cause I'm a renegade
