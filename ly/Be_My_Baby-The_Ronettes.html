		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me?
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go

So won't you, please (be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby? (My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin' (be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now (my one and only baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see
For every kiss you give me, I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you 'til eternity

So won't you, please (be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby? (My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin' (be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now (my one and only baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

So come on and, please (be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby? (My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin' (be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now (my one and only baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby? (My one and only baby)
Oh-oh-oh (be my, be my baby)
Oh (my one and only baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (be my, be my baby)
Oh-oh-oh (My one and only baby)
Oh (be my, be my baby)
