		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shadow, shadow what a show
Every other step, there's a cross-eyed crow
Half return, half return
Minneapolis soft white snow
Thirty five bridge, hometown
Half return, half return
Standing in the yard, dressed like a kid
The house is white and the lawn is dead
The lawn is dead, the lawn is dead

Illinois toll road, Indiana plain
Roll the windows down, shoot out the change
Half return, half return
Honey in your mouth when you gave me my name
Tears in your eyes when you pull it like a chain
Half return, half return
Standing in the yard, dressed like a kid
The house is white and the lawn is dead
The lawn is dead, the lawn is dead

Half return, half return
Dusty swing set, plastic slide
Push me up and down, take me for a ride
Standing in the yard, dressed like a kid
The house is white and the lawn is dead
The lawn is dead, the lawn is dead
