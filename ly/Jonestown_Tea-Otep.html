		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it sounds like... Armageddon
Sounds like... Armageddon
Sounds like... Come & drink with me 

Come & drink with me 

And I remember him fucking me. 
And I remember liking it 
I didn't know any better, 

And I remember the smell, and the pain, & the shame 
And I remember being afraid and thinking everyday...
Every single day that it was my fault. 

Oh but what happened to that little girl, 
Who used to dream of one day ruling the world, 
Who used to draw pretty pictures, 

In my room beneath the moon
Destroying to create
Softly praying to god, 

What do I do now? 
What do I do now? 

As I secretly masturbate... 
But then I'd hear his hooves coming down the floor
With a bible in his hand... 

softly opening my door and he'd say... 

Daughter! the day of your atonement is due! 
Well there's 3 million sinners out there... 
And that includes you! 

No daddy don't!
Leave me alone! 
No I don't want to be free!
So take your dick out of me!
Please take your dick out of me!

I'm bleeding, it's not fair 
You see there's this little place I like to go, 

I like to run and hide deep inside, 
Where all the nightmares are real,and all the monsters come alive, 

Oh, but the things I've seen in soft, soft visions and terrifying prophecies, 
Like serpents on the take & gods coming in all sizes & shapes
Nothing seems fulfilling anymore 

Well your temples are swollen in deceit & the body of your missionary

He's rotting... 
Rotting in defeat mama? 

Mama! 
Are the aliens coming to take us away? [mama?] 
Is Armageddon gonna happen again today? 

Look what you did to me! Why did you do it to me? 
How could you do it to me! Why did you do it to me? 

I will not cry. I will not cry 
I prefer to die than live this life of lies! 

Kill what you can... Challenge everything. 
Vengeance is mine. 

Hey...I'm sorry... baby...
Please come back inside... we can laugh a little... 
Live & die
No wait. see, eye got this hot pot of Jonestown tea & 
Its been brewing for you & me
Oh, it only takes one sip 

Come one baby
Surrender your lips
I can take you someplace nice

I can take u...someplace NICE. 

Breed my disease be my disease and vengeance will be mine 
Its closer than you think... 

So I entered his room at 32 past noon
With my little ritual knife... 
I cut out his tongue
Liberated his wife
She loved me for it other world woman,

Well, that's what she called me [destroyer] the one who sets yo free 
[Cum & drink with me] 

We all die like cartoons, surrender your children, 
Kids who like to kill, lies
