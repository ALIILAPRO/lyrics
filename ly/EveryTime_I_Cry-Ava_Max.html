		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I had a dream that I was sinkin', slow motion
(Every superficial moment)
I get overwhelmed in all the messy emotions
(Before that I never noticed)
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, I know, I know that
Angel used to be the devil on my shoulder
Shoulder, oh, not anymore

When the voices get loud, I'm turnin' them down
Feel good in my body forever and ever
When the tears start to fall, I'm catchin' them all
And I know the future is better, 'cause

Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger

I, I used to spend the nights inside my head, thinkin'
(Where the hell you think you're goin'?)
I, I used to count the days inside my bed, drinkin'
(Up the fear but now I know that)

When the voices get loud, I'm turnin' them down
Feel good in my body forever and ever
When the tears start to fall, I'm catchin' them all
And I know the future is better, 'cause

Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger

(Stronger)
(Stronger)

When the voices get loud, I'm turnin' them down
Feel good in my body forever and ever
When the tears start to fall, I'm catchin' them all
And I know the future is better, 'cause

Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger (stronger)
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger
Stronger, little bit stronger (oh)
Every time I cry, I get a little bit stronger (oh)
Stronger, little bit stronger
