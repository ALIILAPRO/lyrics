		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe this now
This isn't what I planned
I lived and died and now
I just can't understand
With all the love I feel
I could never leave her
No matter what the cost
My soul's the price to see her

Oh, how I love you
The pain won't go away
Oh, when I need you
You're always so far away
I cry for you
Leaving myself to blame
I died for you
I gave up everything

The pain was just too much
When I finally saw her
She's happy and in love
In love with my best friend
What makes it hurt so bad
Is that I love them both
And they will never know
For love I sold my soul

Oh, how I love you
The pain won't go away
Oh, when I need you
You're always so far away
I cry for you
Leaving myself to blame
I died for you
I gave up everything

Oh, how I love you
The pain won't go away
Oh, when I need you (I need you)
You're always so far away
And I cry, I cry for you, for you
Leaving myself to blame
I died for you (I died for you)
I gave up everything

Oh, how I love you
The pain won't go away
Oh, when I need you
You're always so far away
