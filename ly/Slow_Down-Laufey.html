		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow down give me just a moment
I'm so grown now in my own apartment
Cooking my own dinner spaghetti for one
Though, I'm gettin' older
My life has just begun

I wish it would slow down, even for a second
I'm so old now, left my adolescence
Going out to parties and
Getting way too drunk think I found somebody
But don't think that it's love

I wish it would slow down slow down, mm-mm

Someday, I won't be in my twenties
In a new state, maybe even married
I'll have my own children
They're tired of being young
They'll ask me about their futures
I'll tell my little ones

Baby, slow down slow down
Slow down
