		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All along I was feeling nothing
'Til you came along, I started feeling something
Man, I'm just glad you put me amongst it
This feels like good news

I can't lie, man I thought I lost it
Then you came along, made it feel like justice
This feels like good news
Just to be with you
All this to just be with you
Just to be with you

I wanted you to make time
How hard is it to make time?
All this to just be with you
Just to be with you

Last night you was in the crowd
You was mad I tried, mad I lied
It was white like a powdered nose
Like a dial-up, hold your tone

When the sun goes down
And you can't be found
I heard you need a new challenge
You moved out of town
I heard through the grapevine
And not from your mouth

Either way I hope it's good news
Good news, good news
This feels like good news
Just to be with you
All this to just be with you
Just to be with you

I wanted you to make time
How hard is it to make time?
All this to just be with you
Just to be with you

How am I to blame you, or make time?
How am I supposed to just FaceTime?
How am I to blame you, or make time?
How am I supposed to just FaceTime?
How?

Girl, don't waste your time
Ooh, I just want now
Girl, don't waste your time

This feels like good news
Just to be with you
All this to just be with you
Just to be with you
