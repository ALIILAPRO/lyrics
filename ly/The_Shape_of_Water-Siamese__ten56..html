		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me down through the water 
Beneath the surface
Drag me down to the bottom
And give me purpose

and like air I'll always find my way up and like air
i'm never ending
Face me
Im the top, I'm the bottom
Face me
You thought me lost and forgotten
Can't be chained
Never Tamed
Everchanging
I'm The shape of water

From a drop
To a wave
Everchanging
I'm The shape of water

Take me down through the fire
and burn the surface
Leave me here to the lions
ignite the purpose
and like air I'll always find my way up and like air
i'm never ending
Face me
Im the top, I'm the bottom
Face me
You thought me lost and forgotten
Can't be chained
Never Tamed
Everchanging
I'm The shape of water

From a drop
To a wave
Everchanging
I'm The shape of water

From the bottom i emerge
I am the blood of the earth
I am blessed by my curse
get the best from the worst
In a place of adversity

From a drop to a wave
I will never stay the same
Can't be tamed - Can't be chained
I'm a flood - I'm a wave
I never bend - never break
From the bottom I emerge
Im the blood of the earth
I'm a flood I'm a wave
I never bend I never break
Can't be chained
Never Tamed
Everchanging
I'm The shape of water

From a drop
To a wave
Everchanging
I'm The shape of water
