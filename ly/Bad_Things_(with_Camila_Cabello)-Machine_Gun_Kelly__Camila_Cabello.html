		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good (so good), that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated (ayy)

Nothing's that bad (that bad)
If it feels good (feels good)
So you come back (come back)
Like I knew you would (knew you would)
And we're both wild (both wild)
And the night's young (night's young)
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream 'bout
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips (yeah)
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever (ayy)
Even when we're not together (ayy)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (ayy)
I want you forever (ayy)
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (yeah)

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated (damn)

I can't explain it (ayy ayy, can't explain it)
I love the pain (love the pain)
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like Novocaine
And we are (ooh)
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture, uh (yeah)
Couch by the kitchen, ayy (yeah)
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion (mmh)
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever (ayy)
Even when we're not together (ayy, we're not together, yeah)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (ayy)
I want you forever (ayy)
Even when we're not together (oh, whoa)
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (yeah)

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do (yeah)
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated

The way we love is so unique (ayy, ayy)
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me (right)
'Cause we're just living
Between the sheets (you said)

I want you forever (ayy)
Even when we're not together (ayy, yeah)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like
I want you forever (ayy)
Even when we're not together (real talk) (oh, whoa)
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (yeah, oh, baby)

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind? (Am I?)
If you only knew the bad things I like (if you only knew)
Don't think that I can explain it (yeah)
What can I say? It's complicated (yeah)
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do (do, do)
I only wanna do bad things to you (yeah)
So good, that you can't explain it (so good, oh, baby)
What can I say? It's complicated
