		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had a mind to
I wouldn't want to think like you
And if I had time to
I wouldn't want to talk to you, oho-oh

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you, yeah

If I was high class
I wouldn't need a buck to pass
And if I was a fall guy
I wouldn't need no alibi

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you, oh, oh, oh

Back on the bottom line
Diggin' for a lousy dime, yeah
If I hit a mother lode
I'd cover anything that showed, oh-oh

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you, oho-oh
I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't wanna
I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you
Yeah, uh, yeah, oh
