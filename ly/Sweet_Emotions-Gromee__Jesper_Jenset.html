		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found you before the stroke of midnight 
Slapped my face and grabbed me by the hand 
How your body's glowing in the moonlight
Makes this boy wanna to be a man

Tryna figure out, tryna figure out 
What's the secret behind those eyes 
Tryna figure out, tryna figure out 
Why you're dancing alone, dancing alone
Tryna figure out, tryna figure out 
What's the secret behind those eyes 
Tryna figure out, tryna figure out 
Why you're dancing alone, dancing alone tonight

Sweet emotions, sweet emotions taking over me (oh, you're giving me) 
Sweet emotions, sweet emotions taking over me (oh)

(Oh, oh)

I asked you for your name and how you got here (how you got here)
You put two fingers up to shut my mouth (ah)
You said, "I don't have no time for conversation (for this conversation)
I don't care what you're all about"
Tryna figure out, tryna figure out
What's the secret behind those eyes 
Tryna figure out, tryna figure out
Why you dancing alone, dancing alone tonight

Sweet emotions, sweet emotions taking over me (oh, you're giving me) 
Sweet emotions, sweet emotions taking over me (oh)

(Oh, oh)

Baby, I need what you got
Moving like you don't give a fuck 
While you're giving me feels 
Swallow you like a pill 
Damn, you're hitting me hard
Slithering into my heart
Promise me that you will 
Keep on making me feel

Sweet emotions, sweet emotions taking over me (oh, you're giving me) 
Sweet emotions, sweet emotions taking over me (oh)

(You're giving me)
Sweet emotions, sweet emotions taking over me (oh)
