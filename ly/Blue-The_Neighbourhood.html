		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Read my mind, got me at a stop light
Start me up, then you make a stop like
Why you gotta put me in the spotlight?
But you don't even ever hit the spot right
You're always riding my wave (riding, riding, riding, riding)
But never riding through

You get me up to let me down
Way too many times to count
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that
Make it tough but get it loud
You're done but I'm ready now
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that

Every time you come you do
Every time you come you do

Call me up to comfort you and now I'm like
"Baby, it's already been a long night"
Keep playing it cool but it's time to change the mood
Get to moving or you can move along
Stuck inside of your cage (I'm stuck right now)
I play your game to lose over and over

You get me up to let me down
Way too many times to count
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that
Make it tough but get it loud
You're done but I'm ready now
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that

I really thought you knew
Every time you come you leave me blue

Something inside me is swimming
Thought you did something you didn't
Soon as I hit the beginning
Is when you reached the end
Something inside me is swimming
Thought you did something you didn't
Soon as I hit the beginning
Is when you reached the end

You get me up to let me down
Way too many times to count
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that
Make it tough but get it loud
You're done but I'm ready now
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that

I really thought you knew
Every time you come you leave me blue
I really thought you knew
Every time you come you leave me blue
