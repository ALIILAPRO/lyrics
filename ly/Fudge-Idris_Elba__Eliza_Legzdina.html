		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eliza Verse 1
Yeah they heard of how I move
They want my style and that’s the truth
Champagne spilling in the booth
While I dance to my own tunes
I got karats on my tooth
And I look good so he got news yeah
My baby thinks he’s bullet proof
But he sends me nudes.
Self-esteem is through the roof
- he’s in a mood
Forgive his attitude
We fill the cup, know how we do
Give him that mm
Gimme me that ooh
Little bit wild, live at the zoo
I’m not his wife, but he still approves
You know I’ll be rude, cause I got the groove -oooh

Chorus 1
Who the F is that?
Who the F is that?
Who the Fudge is you?
That’s all that they ask
When I’m rolling through
Who the F is that?
Who the Fudge are you?
Want to know my name
Yeah they wish they new
Who the F is that?
Yeah they wish they new
Who the F is that?
Who the Fudge is you?
That’s all that they ask
When I’m rolling through
Who the F is, who the Fudge is that?

Idris Verse 2
On my own lane
Hamilton with the 500 hundred miles per hour in the rain
And I ain't slowing down no time soon
Man cus I can’t find the breaks
Championships with the big gold cups and six audacious rings
spraying champagne from a bottle with my name engraved on the side like a king
Me and my girl in the back of the PJ heading for the weekend fling
That’s that Boasty rap but I can boast and back this ting
Return of the Mack like Morrison
Mark my words when I do this thing
See them scan my moves and they keep asking like

Chorus 2
Who the F is that?
Who the F is that?
Who the Fudge is you?
That’s all that they ask
When I’m rolling through
Who the F is that?
Who the Fudge are you?
Want to know my name
Yeah they wish they new
Who the F is that?
Yeah they wish they new
Who the F is that?
Who the Fudge is you?
That’s all that they ask
When I’m rolling through
Who the F is, who the Fudge is that?
