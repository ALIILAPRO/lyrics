		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's crazy how manipulation feels like
A soft blanket holding you tight
And every night, sleeping next to someone's
Just as warm as the gaslight

It's funny how jealousy sounds like
Somebody's worried 'bout you
And all that control takes on different roles
Don't realize the toll it takes on you

I've been to pretty dark places
Stuck in toxic situations
But you taste like stability and
That's new for me

Yeah, this feels like homemade cooking
Like backyard kissing
Like hold the door open and I laugh
But it's nice like Sunday sleepin' in
Baby, I'm leaning in
Conversations, I can tell that you're listening
I thought I knew what
I knew what love was
Guess I didn't know at all
'Cause I don't know what this is
But I think love's supposed to feel like this

(Ooh, ooh)

It's funny how I used to make excuses
Excuses as often as I breathe
Defending him, trying to defuse it
And it would only blow up on me

Yeah, I've been to pretty dark places
Stuck in toxic situations
But you taste like security and
That's new for me

Yeah, this feels like homemade cooking
Like backyard kissing
Like hold the door open and I laugh
But it's nice like Sunday sleepin' in
Baby, I'm leaning in
Conversations, I can tell that you're listening
I thought I knew what
I knew what love was
Guess I didn't know at all
'Cause I don't know what this is
But I think love's supposed to feel like this

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Yeah, this feels like not just for tonight
Not some quick goodbye
Tell me that you want me
And I know that you mean it like
Sunday sleepin' in
Baby, 'm leaning in
Conversations, I can tell that you're listening
I thought I knew what
I knew what love was
Guess I didn't know at all
'Cause I don't know what this is
But I think love's supposed to feel like this
