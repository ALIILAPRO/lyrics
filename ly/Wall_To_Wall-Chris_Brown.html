		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Great Scott (woo)
Ladies
I'm gon' need you all to back away from the door (woo)
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
Ladies
You are not listening (woo)
I need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown (I'm back)

(Pull up, pull up) can't believe the girls' club packed
(What up, what up?) shawty wanna lead me to the back (to the back)
Ain't been in here fifteen minutes, got a pocket full of digits
And she just won't take no
(Hold up, hold up) now lil' mama wanna get mad
(Slow up, slow up) saying she doesn't wanna share what she have (she have)
Ain't no particular one that's getting the water gun
So many that I want

They packed up in here wall to wall and (hey)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (woah-ooh)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

They packed up in here wall to wall and (woah, yeah)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (hey)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

Another two just came up and said they love me on the radio (on the radio)
Two twins, that's a cool little scenario
They talking leaving right now
Wanna put in some time 'cause you know what they are ready for
(One talking) about she like the way that I pop
(And the other one, and the other one) 
Said she just wanna watch (just watch, woo)
I'm game for any damn thing, but there's more than two hundred dames
That's ready to go

They packed up in here wall to wall and (hey)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (ladies calling)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

They packed up in here wall to wall and (woah, woah, woah)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

They packed up in here wall to wall and (I can't believe)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (there's so many of 'em claiming me)
I'm tryna give one of them all this (hey, hey, hey)
But they keep coming from wall to wall (wall to wall)

They packed up in here wall to wall and (there so many ladies)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (in here)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

So many look good in here (so good)
I just don't know which one I want (I want)
If I had to choose you all know (you know)
I would take all you all with me
Who wanna try me on the floor? (The floor)
Who ready to come and get this? (Get this)
All I know I'm feeling this party
And you can see I'm so with it

They packed up in here wall to wall and (ow)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (ladies calling)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall (woah, woah, woah)

They packed up in here wall to wall and (in here wall to wall)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (oh woah)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall (hey, hey)

They packed up in here wall to wall and (I'm tryina give something)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (to shawty now, hey)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling

Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown)
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown)
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown, Brown)
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown)
