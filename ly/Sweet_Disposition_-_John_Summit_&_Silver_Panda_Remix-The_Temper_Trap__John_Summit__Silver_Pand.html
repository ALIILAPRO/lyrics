		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A moment, a love
A dream, aloud

So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A moment, a love
A dream aloud

Stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

(A moment, a love)
(A dream aloud)
(A kiss, a cry)
(Our rights, our wrongs) won't stop 'til it's over
(A moment, a love)
(A dream aloud)
(A kiss, a cry)
(Our rights, our wrongs) won't stop 'til it's over
(A moment, a love)
(A dream aloud)
(A kiss, a cry)
(Our rights, our wrongs) won't stop 'til it's over
(A moment, a love)
(A dream aloud)
(A kiss, a cry)
(Our rights, our wrongs) won't stop to surrender
