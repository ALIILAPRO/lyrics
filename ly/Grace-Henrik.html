		  Grace
How are you ok?
I can't believe the hell you're living in
Oh Grace, you don't have to stay
You could leave and find your self again

And oh oh oh oh if you have to go
I hope you find the world you owe it to you dear
And oh oh oh oh if you can't bare the winter cold
Then grace my heart will be a home for you right here
And oh oh
I know you'll find the strength
When you're falling on your face
And oh oh oh oh you'll never be alone you know as long as your name is
As long as your name is

Grace
I know the night is long
But all that alcohol
Is messing with your mind my friend

Grace
If you could burn the cup
Then maybe you could learn to love
Yourself and live your life again
And one day you'll fly from this town that we're trapped in
And I'll pass the time looking down from the mountains

oh Grace
These New York mountain skies
Don't hold a candle to your eyes
No I don't want this night to end

And oh oh oh oh if you have to go
I hope you find the world you owe it to you dear
And oh oh oh oh if you can't bare the winter cold
Then grace my heart will be a home for you right here
And oh oh
I know you'll find the strength
When you're falling on your face
And oh oh oh oh you'll never be alone you know as long as your name is
As long as your name is

Grace
I know that your brave
You don't have to fake that smiling
Oh Grace
Freedom has a name
And he'll hold you when your crumbling

And oh oh oh oh if you have to go
I hope you find the world you owe it to you dear
And oh oh oh oh if you can't bare the winter cold
Then grace my heart will be a home for you right here
And oh oh
I know you'll find the strength
When you're falling on your face
And oh oh oh oh you'll never be alone you know as long as your name is
As long as your name is
