		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight 
On a bed of California stars 
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight 
On a bed of California stars 

I'd love to feel 
Your hand touching mine 
And tell me why 
I must keep working on 

Yes, I'd give my life 
To lay my head tonight on a bed 
Of California stars 

I'd like to dream 
My troubles all away 
On a bed of California stars 

Jump up from my star bed 
Make another day 
Underneath my California stars 
They hang like grapes 
On vines that shine 
And warm the lovers' glass 
Like friendly wine 

So I'd give this world 
Just to dream a dream with you 
On our bed of California stars 

I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight 
On a bed of California stars 
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight 
On a bed of California stars 

I'd love to feel 
Your hand touching mine 
And tell me why 
I must keep working on 

Yes, I'd give my life 
To lay my head tonight on a bed 
Of California stars 

I'd like to dream 
My troubles all away 
On a bed of California stars 

Jump up from my star bed 
Make another day 
Underneath my California stars 

They hang like grapes 
On vines that shine 
And warm the lovers' glass 
Like friendly wine 

So I'd give this world 
Just to dream a dream with you 
On our bed of California stars 

So I'd give this world 
Just to dream a dream with you 
On our bed of California stars 

(Dream a dream with you)
