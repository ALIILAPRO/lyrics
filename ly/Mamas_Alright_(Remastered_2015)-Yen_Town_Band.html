		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama's alright
She's got the taste you need
Mama's alright
She's got that smile
But if you're in doubt
Pick up the telephone
Another reason for you to cry
Another reason that mama lied to you

That little black skirt she wears
And with her thick pink lips she swears
She may not be a lady but she's alright

She's got the walk men love
She's got the voice that makes men melt
She may not be calling you tonight

But mama knows her wrong from right
And she will say "So what"
And mama knows to be herself
So she can be with me and now

Mama's alright
She's got the taste you need
Mama's alright
She's got that smile
But if you're in doubt
Pick up the telephone
Another reason for you to cry
Another reason that mama lied to you

I never felt the real her
I never touched the real her
She may not be alive but she's alright

But mama knows her wrong from right
And she will say "So what"
And mama knows to be herself
So she can be with me and now

Mama's alright
She's got the taste you need
Mama's alright
She's got that smile
But if you're in doubt
Pick up the telephone
Another reason for you to cry
Another reason that mama lied to you

And you should know your wrong from right
So you can say "So what"
And you should know to be yourself
So you can be with me and now

Saw you last night
You had the taste I need
I saw you last night
But you didn't smile
If you're in doubt
Pick up the telephone
Now I'm alright
'Cause I got the smile, yeah

Mama's alright
She's got the taste you need
Mama's alright
She's got that smile
Mama's alright
She's got the taste you need
Mama's alright
She's got that smile
