		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you heard
What has happened?
I'm okay
It doesn't matter
'Cause I am strong
I have always been too tough
I'll be fine
It was just a waste of time

Tell him it's alright, I'm doing good
And there's no need to worry
Tell him I've moved on
And barely think of him at all
Tell him that he's wrong
'Cause I just never had those kinds of feelings
Even though you say I'm broken
I'm not hurt at all

Oh, my God
I forgot to throw his photos
'Cause what's the point
To be pondering the past
When I know there is nothing there at all?

Well, if you see him, tell him I moved on
I'm doing great and he should disregard me
Tell him he should find someone he really, truly loves
Tell him they can laugh at all the times
I made a joke by saying
"Baby, I will love you always 'til the end of time"
