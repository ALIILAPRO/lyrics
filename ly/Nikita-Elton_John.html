		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you (hold you)
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side 
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you (hold you)
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side 
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Never know anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side 
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

(Nikita) 
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) 
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row, woo-ooh-hoo-ooh
(Nikita) 
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita)
