		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Women of a certain age 
They learn to rely and judge all his responses 
Having played the mating game 
She doesn't waste time 'cause all that she wants is 
Really honest emotions 
Ones he can't help but show 
Though I hardly know your name 
I know about love and I know 

I don't wanna lose you 
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh no
I just wanna hold on 
To this true love, true love 

Women who have made mistakes 
Are a little afraid, they don't like taking chances 
She will play the waiting game 
She's never impressed by those manly advances 
I know I've only just met you 
Maybe I should know better 
But when you look at me that way 
There's something inside that's so right 

I don't wanna lose you 
And I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh no
I just wanna hold on 
To this true love, true love 
I don't wanna lose you 
And I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
'Cause every time I'm with you 
I feel true love, true love, true love

Tell me you're real and you're not pretending 
Let's make a deal 'cause my heart's depending on you
Oh, babe

I don't wanna lose you 
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh no
I just wanna hold on 
To this true love, true love
Oh, don't wanna lose you 
And I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
'Cause every time I'm with you 
I feel true love, true love, true love
I don't wanna lose you 
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh no
I just wanna hold on 
To this true love, true love 
I don't wanna lose you 
And I always wanna feel this way
'Cause every time I'm with you 
I feel true love, true love, true love
