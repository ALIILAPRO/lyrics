		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you thought all things would fall apart
You been running through my mind
I fought, we'd talk, you stopped, it's all your fault

Guess we can't be happy when we're running out of time
No, we can't be friends 'cause you been acting out of line
Choose another girl and I'ma leave the past behind
Two C and the rest is finna take me on a ride
Running out of time, yeah we're running out of

Running out of time (yeah!)
Running out of time (yeah!)
Running through my mind, yeah
You don't give a fuck, I don't need you to be fine
I don't give a fuck, I guess you were never my type

You be on your drugs screaming high life
I don't do no talk, wasting my time (ah)
I don't got trust on the wrong side (eh)
I fill up this cup for a good time

Yeah, yeah, I'm in paradise
Please don't hit my phone, yeah, you heard me right
I'll be on my own, all this shit alright

I saw you thought all things would fall apart
You been running through mind
I fought, we'd talk, you stopped, it's all your fault
Guess we can't be happy when we're running out of time
No, we can't be friends 'cause you been acting out of line
Choose another girl and I'ma leave the past behind
Two C and the rest is finna take me on a ride
Running out of time, yeah, we're running out of
