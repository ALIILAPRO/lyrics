		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody save us please somebody save us Please somebody save us
Please somebody save us
I seen a dead man walking
It was something that I seen before
There's a song he was singing
About a life that he wanted to live
I was never superstitious
Walk under ladders leaning on a wall
But I could see he would crash burn and fall
They go low
low low low
They go low low low
They go low low low till they break you down (2x)
I seen a little boy soldier
With tattoos all over his face
A gang bangers dream mascot
I'm too old so I couldn't relate
There's a song he was singing
About his momma she was digging his grave With cracked dry hands
Screaming Jesus name
They go low
They go low low low
They go low low low
They go low low low till they break you down (2x)
Till they break you down (2x)
The Elvis Presley of the ghetto
Baked chicken n a side of greens
He sat staring out the window Pointing fingers at the devils he seen But some were just his own reflection
He knew the storm was coming soon
That evening he was found dead in his room
They go low
Low low low
They go low low low
They go low low low till they break you down (2x)
