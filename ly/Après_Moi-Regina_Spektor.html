		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must go on standing
You can't break that which isn't yours
I must go on standing
I'm not my own, it's not my choice

Be afraid of the lame, they'll inherit your legs
Be afraid of the old, they'll inherit your souls
Be afraid of the cold, they'll inherit your blood
Après moi, le déluge
After me comes the flood

I must go on standing
You can't break that which isn't, isn't yours, yours
I must go on standing
I'm not my own, it's not my choice

Be afraid of the lame, they'll inherit your legs
Be afraid of the old, they'll inherit your souls
Be afraid of the cold, they'll inherit your blood
Après moi, le déluge
After me comes the flood
Be afraid of the lame, they'll inherit your legs
Be afraid of the old, they'll inherit your souls
Be afraid of the cold, they'll inherit your blood
Après moi, le déluge
After me, flood

Февраль. Достать чернил и плакать
Писать о феврале навзрыд
Пока грохочущая слякоть
Весною черною горит
Февраль. Достать чернил и плакать
Писать о феврале навзрыд
Пока грохочущая слякоть
Весною черною горит

Be afraid of the lame, they'll inherit your legs
Be afraid of the old, they'll inherit your souls
Be afraid of the cold, they'll inherit your blood
Après moi, le déluge
After me comes the flood

I must go on standing
You can't break that which isn't yours
I must go on standing
I'm not my own, it's not my choice

I, I must go on stan-stan-ding-dong
You can't, can't break that, that
Which isn't, isn't yours, yours
I, I must go on stan-stan-ding-dong
I'm not, not my own, own
It's not, not my choice
