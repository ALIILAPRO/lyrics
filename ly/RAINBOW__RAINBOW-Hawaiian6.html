		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is short so many things
you want to do
Time is fast so many things
that you should do
However
Sorrow and hesitation
catches us like a spider web
and we can't escape
How about you?
So many things are hard and sad
But it's proof
that you are alive
Think, worry, suffer
Thus if you can't get away
from there
Smile!
I don't care about the answer
If you live like yourself
Ring your bell!
Sound your heart!
Let yourself resound
to the world!
Believe in yourself and
the impossible turns possible
Live honest!
Walk straight ahead!
Never hate yourself!
Your love and kindness gathers
to make a huge rainbow
in the sky

Uhh uhh
If you're sad and feel lost
It's okay to
let yourself cry a bit
Ohh ohhh
If your tears just will not stop
Please smile again
Things happen over
but we get ahead
Alright!
Fly to the rainbow!
Go ahead!
Ring your bell!
Sound your heart!
Let yourself resound
to the world!
Believe in yourself and
the impossible turns possible
Live honest!
Walk straight ahead!
Never hate yourself!
Your love and kindness gathers
to make a huge rainbow,
rainbow in the sky
Believe in yourself and
the impossible turns possible
Your love and kindness gathers
to make a huge rainbow,
rainbow rainbow in the sky
