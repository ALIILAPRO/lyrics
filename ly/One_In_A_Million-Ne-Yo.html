		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jet setter (jet setter)
Go getter (go getter)
Nothing better (nothing better), uh
Call me Mr. Been There Done That
Top model chick to your every day hood rat
Less than all but more than a few
But I've never met one like you

Been all over the world
Done a little bit of everythin'
Little bit of everywhere
With a little bit of everyone
But all the girls I've been with
Things I've seen and it takes much to impress
But 'sho 'nuff your glow, it makes your soul stand out from the rest, baby

I can be in love (I)
But I just don't know, I (don't know girl)
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's workin'
Other girls don't matter
In your presence can't do what you do
There's a million girls around
But I don't see no one but you

Girl, you're so one in a million
You are
Baby, you're the best I ever had (ooh)
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothin' better (hey)
No, there ain't nothin' better than this (oh)

You're not a regular girl
You don't give a damn about the loot
Talkin' about I can't do it for you
But you can do it for yourself
Even though that ain't so
Baby 'cause my dough don't know how to end
But that independent thang I'm wit' it
All we do is win, baby

I could be in love (hey)
But I just don't know (I don't know, girl)
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's workin'
Other girls don't matter
In your presence can't do what you do
There's a million girls around
But I don't see no one but you, baby

Baby you're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had (hey)
Best I ever had (hey)
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothin' better (hey)
No, there ain't nothin' better than this (oh)
Baby, you're so one in a million
You are (say you are)
Baby you're the best I ever had (hey)
Best I ever had (hey)
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothin' better (hey)
No, there ain't nothin' better than this (oh)

Diamond girl
Only one in the world
Just one of a kind
She mine

Ooh, all that I can think
About is what this thang could be
A future, baby
Baby, you're one of a kind
That means that you're the only one for me
Only one for me

Baby girl, you're so one in a million (hey)
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had (ooh)
Best I ever had (hey)
And I'm certain that (ooh-ooh)
There ain't nothing better (hey)
No, there ain't nothing better than this
Girl, you're so one in a million (one in a million, ooh)
You are
Baby, you're the best I ever had (you're the best I ever had)
Best I ever had (hey)
And I'm certain that (oh-ooh)
There ain't nothing better (hey)
No, there ain't nothing better than this (oh)
