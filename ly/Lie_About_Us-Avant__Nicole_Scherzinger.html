		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, whoa
Yeah, yeah

Baby, I know
When we started out there was things you didn't know
But baby girl, we got a lot of things we need to discuss
I know I'm asking for a lot, but just trust
You say that things getting old
Sneakin' 'round, creepin', in love on the low
Now baby girl, I can't wait 'til it's officially us
I can't wait to let them know about us

At first I thought that I could take it boy, but I don't know (I don't know)
You told me you were gonna leave her for me long ago (long ago)
Eventually I will, but I just gotta take it slow
Don't wanna break her heart, although I gotta let her go, so baby

So please don't say you wanna give up
How do I tell her that I'm falling in love?
And I know you're waiting patiently for that day
When we no longer have to lie about us
When I'm with her, all I want is your touch
And when you call me, I don't wanna hang up
And I know I say it often but I can't wait
'Til we no longer have to lie about us

Baby, I know
The situation don't seem fair to us both
But baby girl, she's an issue that I'm 'bout to adjust
Don't mistake the love we make for just lust
You are my soul (mind, body, spirit)
All that I know
But baby girl, I can't wait 'til it's officially us
I can't wait to tell the world about us

At first I thought that I could take it boy, but I don't know (I don't know)
You told me you were gonna leave her for me long ago (long ago)
Eventually I will, but I just gotta take it slow
Don't wanna break her heart, although I've gotta let her go, so baby

So please don't say you wanna give up (please don't say)
How do I tell her that I'm falling in love? (Ooh whoa)
And I know you're waiting patiently for that day
When we no longer have to lie about us (no longer have to lie)
When I'm with her, all I want is your touch (ooh whoa oh)
And when you call me, I don't wanna hang up (baby, you don't)
And I know I say it often but I can't wait
'Til we no longer have to lie about us

Baby, won't you wait (just a little bit)
For (just a little bit)
Me (just a little bit longer, longer)
Wait (just a little bit)
For (just a little bit)
Me (just a little bit longer, longer)
I want you to wait (just a little bit)
For (baby, just a little) (just a little bit)
Me (just a little bit) (just a little bit longer, longer)
Wait (oh) (just a little bit)
For (yeah) (just a little bit)
Me (just a little bit longer, longer)

Baby, so please don't say you wanna give up
How do I tell her that I'm falling in love? (How do I tell my baby?)
And I know you're waiting patiently for that day
When we no longer have to lie about us (no longer have to lie about us)
When I'm with her, all I want is your touch (ooh baby)
And when you call me, I don't wanna hang up (ooh-ooh whoa oh)
And I know I say it often, but I can't wait 
'Til we no longer have to lie about us (no longer have to lie)

So please don't say you wanna give up (don't say it)
How do I tell her that I'm falling in love? (How do I tell my baby?)
And I know you're waiting patiently for that day
When we no longer have to lie about us (whoa)
When I'm with her, all I want is your touch (ooh)
And when you call me, I don't wanna hang up (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I know I say it often but I can't wait 'til we no longer have to lie about us

Baby won't you wait (just a little bit)
(Just a little bit)
Baby, baby, oh, oh, whoa (just a little bit longer)
(Just a little bit)
(Just a little bit)
(Just a little bit longer) baby, I'ma wait a bit
(Just a little bit) ooh, whoa
(Just a little bit)
I'm waiting just a little bit longer
Will you wait, yeah (just a little bit)
(Just a little bit)
(Just a little bit longer)

Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit
