		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't ball
But I sleep at night
Demons in it for the wrong and they're lying
I don't want a jewel or a Diamond
Give me something more
I need rocks if we're mining
Don't ball
But I sleep at night
Something wakes me up in the morning
Ou I need the sweet sweet smell of marijuana leaves
Miss me with the money bags not the trees

Sorry to my mom sorry to my dad
Wish I could come home with the money bags
I know I'm the only one here not at work
I don't get paid every week but I work
Sorry to my mom sorry to my dad
Wish I could come home with the money bags
EDOG in the building, imma break the ceilings
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?

Don't ball
But I sleep at night
Demons in it for the wrong and they're lying
I don't want a watch or a Diamond
Give me something more
if we're dying
Don't ball
But I sleep at night
Something wakes me up in the morning
Something bout the sweet sweet smell of marijuana leaves
Miss me with the money bags not the trees

Maserati, no speed race
No thotties up this way
That bitch, she fake
That bitch, erase
No bull, this my fourth flow
I want a Minaj on my torso
I don't want no broads in my court hoe
You need something more than your asshole
You ain't nothing more than back door whore
You ain't nothing more than your pills on the floor

Dont ball
But I sleep at night
Demons in it for the wrong and they're lying
I don't want a jewel or a Diamond
Give me something more
if we're dying
Don't ball
But I sleep at night
Something wakes me up in the morning
Something bout the sweet sweet smell of marijuana leaves
Miss me with the money bags not the treesx3
