		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I wear my chain to the game
But for the game I sip champagne from the world cup
Oh yeah, I'm here to stir shit up
I pray on a hill in Brazil
To Christ the Redeemer
But most kids worship us
(Ah!)
I'm just warming up
I'm almost ready
Turn it up a bit more in the headphones
Check me out though, look

It's cops to dodge in the city of God
To reach the goals of these soccer stars
There's records to break, medals to take
Flags to wave, the city is ours
There's ceilings to climb, the road winds
Only lights is those from a Beamer
It's nice to pray in front of Christ the Redeemer
If your God is bigger than my God up there
My God bigger than your God down here
Whom shall I fear?
It's foretold by Calogero, most Bronx tales don't end well
Especially when your own country treats you like an infidel
There's odds against it ends well
Don't box me into the corner, I
Float like a butterfly, sting like Muhammad A
On training day I go too hard, ask Antoine Fuqua
I am Godzilla of these favelas, new God flow

Won't you follow me into the jungle? (Yeah)
Ain't no God on these streets in the heart of the jungle (oh, Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle? (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle

I lost my mind, in the city of lights (Yeah)
In the backstreets buildings and the neon lights (Yeah)
When I heard the thunder, I could feel the rain (Yeah)
It's the same to me, just a different name

Won't you follow me into the jungle? (Yeah)
Ain't no God on these streets in the heart of the jungle (oh, Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle? (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle

Won't you follow me into the jungle? (Yeah)
Ain't no God on these streets in the heart of the jungle (oh, Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle? (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle
