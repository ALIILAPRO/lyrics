		  Oh

Damn
I mean
I just keep thinking about you (oh baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know (oh oh oh)
But I'm a go head and talk about it
Listen

I'm sitting looking out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on yo mind and I'm knowing that it couldn't be

Cause you ain't call and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain I ain't dealt wit it all
I been running 'round with other chicks
I'm single and they lovin' it
I'm liking it but I just want the one that was in love with
That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know
You got a hold or some kind of control of me
I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better just
Tryna be like yeah, forget it, whatever
Instead of staring out this glass looking at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together 'cause

When I'm with somebody all I think 'bout is you (yeah)
When I'm all alone that's all I wanna do (yeah)
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits,
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system (oh oh oh)

I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad, that's what you could call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets, that's the worse for me
Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you on my pager
Know what you doing, where you at
Can I see you later? (can I see you lata?)
The fellas telling me 'just let her go Bow'
Believe me, I'm tryin' man, I just don't know how
I be in all the top spots, leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me cause I'm in the top spot
That's not poppin' and my brain ain't stoppin'
Thinkin' who she with, or where she goin', is she club hoppin'?
I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight
Damn this ain't even right, 'cause

When I'm with somebody all I think 'bout is you (yeah)
When I'm all alone that's all I wanna do (yeah)
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you out of my system (oh ohh ohhhh)

Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day
(can you feel me?)
I been tryna get you off my mind, but I can't after all this time
(that's what kills me)
Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day
(can you feel me?)
I been tryna get you (off my mind)
(But I can't after all this time)

When I'm with somebody all I think 'bout is you (yeah)
When I'm all alone that's all I wanna do (yeah)
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits,
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system (oh oh oh)

I remember everything that me 'n you talked about
Me 'n you had a whole life planned out together (oh ohh ohh)
And if I could, I would,
Turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But now I guess I gotta move on, right?
It's still hard
And I still love you till this day

Peace
