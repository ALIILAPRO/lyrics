		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I'll take a nicotine, caffeine, sugar fix
Jesus, don't you get tired of turnin' tricks?
But when your innocence dies, you'll find the blues
Seems all our heroes were born to lose
Just walkin' through time, you believe this heat?
Another empty house, another dead end street
Gonna rest my bones, sit for a spell
This side of heaven is close to hell

Right next door to hell
Why don't you write a letter to me?
I said, "I'm right next door to hell"
And so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
I got nowhere else to be
Right next door to hell
Feels like the walls are closin' in on me

My mama never really said much to me
She was much too young and scared to be
Hell, Freud might say that's what I need
But all I really ever get is greed
And most my friends, they feel the same
Hell, we don't even have ourselves to blame
But times are hard, and thrills are cheaper
As your arms get shorter, your pockets get deeper

Right next door to hell
Why don't you write a letter to me?
'Cause, I'm right next door to hell
And so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
I never thought this is where I'd be
But I'm right next door to hell
Thinking time 'ill stand still for me

Fuck you, bitch!

Not bad kids, just stupid ones, yeah
Thought we'd own the world an' getting used was havin' fun
I said we're not sad kids, but lucid ones, yeah
Flowin' through life, not collecting anyone
So much out there, still so much to see
Time's too much to handle, time's too much for me
It drove me up the wall and drove me out of my mind
Can you tell me what this means, huh?
