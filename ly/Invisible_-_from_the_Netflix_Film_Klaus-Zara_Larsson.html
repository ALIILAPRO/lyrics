		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many nights do you lie awake
In the darkest place? (Eh ya eh oh, oh eh oh)
How many days 'til you shed the pain
Of your darker days? (Eh ya eh oh, oh eh oh)
 
All I know is
If happy lives a mile away
A couple steps is all it takes
If kindness lives in everyone
Then all it takes is standing up
 
Can't touch it, see it (oh oh oh)
But you can always feel it (oh oh oh)
The greatest things you'll ever know
Are invisible (are invisible)
 
How many words does it really take
To make a change? (Eh ya eh oh, oh eh oh)
How many fights is it gonna take
To convince what joy could bring? (Eh ya eh oh, oh eh oh)

All I know is
If happy lives a mile away
A couple steps is all it takes
If kindness lives in everyone
Then all it takes is standing up
 
Can't touch it, see it (oh oh oh)
But you can always feel it (oh oh oh)
The greatest things you'll ever know
Are invisible (are invisible)
 
You can't take it, steal it (oh oh oh)
But you can always be it (oh oh oh)
The greatest things you'll ever know
Are invisible (the greatest things you'll ever know)
 
They are invisible (oh oh oh)
They are invisible (oh oh oh)
They are invisible (oh oh oh)
They are invisible
