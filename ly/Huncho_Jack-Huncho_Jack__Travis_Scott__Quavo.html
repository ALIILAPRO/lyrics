Huncho farm (Huncho), got your bitch on porn (smash, smash)
Whip's too foreign (skrrt), iced my arm (ice, shine)
Cactus Jack, yeah, got plaques on plaques, yeah
Hits on hits, yeah, in the mix
Huncho farm (Huncho), got your bitch on porn (yeah, smash)
Whip's too foreign (skrrt, skrrt) ice on arms (ice, ice)
Shit go bad, like it's L.A. traffic, yeah
Crushin' down Addy, yeah, bustin' out plastic (yeah!)

Huncho
Basic, basic, basic, basic, I can't fuck, she basic (no)
Keep my squad upgraded (Max), number one shooter like Tracy (shoot)
Tonka truck Mercedes (Tonka), drivin' and I'm faded (skrrt)
I'm on your block, invadin' (block)
All my guns updated

It's 5 A.M. lookin' like noon (yeah)
I took her right out of saloon (it's lit)
Put 5 in the back, I got room
Can't fit no more chicks, ain't got room (straight up)
Yeah, new crib, I'll put that on the moon
Upstairs and we blowin' up fumes (yeah)
Don't panic, can't have no more seizures
Fuck it, I'm cashin' my leisure
I had a lot of these targets and the foes (yeah)
Took it like I stole it (skrt skrt), it got old, shit moldy (ugh)
Money way high as the knees
No way I can fold it (yeah)
She thinkin' I'm golden (aie)
She suck my voltage (alright)

Huncho farm (Huncho), got your bitch on porn (smash, smash)
Whip's too foreign (skrrt), iced my arm (ice, shine)
Cactus Jack (yeah!), got plaques on plaques, yeah (alright!)
Hits on hits, yeah (yeah, yeah), in the mix (it's lit!)
Huncho farm (Huncho,) got your bitch on porn (yeah, smash)
Whip's too foreign (skrrt, skrrt) ice on arms (ice, ice)
Shit go bad, like it's L.A. traffic, yeah
Crushin' down Addy, yeah, bustin' out plastic (yeah!)

Huncho, flood my AP
Make these hoes wanna take me (take me)
The gun off safety (safety)
Shoot a fuck nigga like KD, yeah (bow)
She hit brazy, yeah (brazy)
Made my left eye lazy, yeah
Goin' up lately, yeah
Dock in the back Old Navy, yeah (alright!)
We gonna get it in (get it)
My trap house look innocent (innocent)
Private residence (private)
Leavin' no evidence (evidence, yeah, yeah)
Codeine, it's medicine, yeah
Somethin' is evident, yeah
They tease the hell with it, yeah
What's next, ain't no tellin' it (ye)
Closet filled in designer (designer)
Take a knee like the 'Niners (Kaepernick)
Join the team, don't divide us (join them)
Then watch your money go higher
Yeah, lil' help, lil' guidance (yah)
Run it back, do the title (yah)
Get the sack, move in silence (yeah!)
Bring that trophy back to my place

Huncho farm (Huncho), got your bitch on porn (smash, smash)
Whip's too foreign (skrrt) iced my arm (ice, shine)
Cactus Jack, yeah (yeah!), got plaques on plaques, yeah (alright!)
Hits on hits, yeah (yeah, yeah), in the mix (it's lit!)
Huncho farm (Huncho), got your bitch on porn (yeah, smash)
Whip's too foreign (skrrt, skrrt) ice on arms (ice, ice)
Shit go bad, like it's L.A. traffic, yeah
Crushin' down Addy, yeah, bustin' out plastic (yeah!)
Huncho, Jack
