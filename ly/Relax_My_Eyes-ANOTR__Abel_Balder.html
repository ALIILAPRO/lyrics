		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Relax my eyes, I see flashing lights and we're not alone
Are you alright on the other side? I can feel you close
I feel alive, hear the drums get high and the bass down low
Open your mind, we could dance all night, I don't wanna go

Lets take our minds off society's lies, back in control
I feel the rise in the brother's eyes but we're not alone
We'll see the signs when the kingdom dies and we'll all be free

Relax my eyes, I see flashing lights and we're not alone
Are you alright on the other side? I can feel you close
I feel alive, hear the drums get high and the bass down low
Open your mind, we could dance all night, I don't wanna go

Relax my eyes, I see flashing lights and we're not alone
Are you alright on the other side? I can feel you close
I feel alive, hear the drums get high and the bass down low
Open your mind, we could dance all night, I don't wanna go
