		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you want me, took a lot to make you want me now
Now you want me, took a lot to make you want me now
Now you want me, took a lot to make you want me now
Now you want me now

She don't love me, she just love how I feel
I'ma fuck her 'til I know that she real
I don't love her but I love how I feel
When I fuck her and she make me a meal, for real

Told her, "Baby, I'm the type to get faded"
And I know that she like that I'm famous (she love it)
I ain't trying to make this shit complicated (nah)
We only came because we both getting naked

White girl on me, I got cocaine
Do it in the bathroom, I can feel my bones break
Same clique with me at the night show
I was in the back then, now I got a light show
White girl on me, I got cocaine
Do it in the bathroom, I can feel my bones break
Same clique with me at the night show
I was in the back then, now I got a light show

She don't love me, she just love how I feel
I'ma fuck her 'til I know that she real
I don't love her but I love how I feel
When I fuck her and she make me a meal, for real

Told her, "Baby, I'm the type to get faded"
And I know that she like that I'm famous (she love it)
I ain't trying to make this shit complicated (nah)
We only came because we both getting naked
Told her, "Baby, I'm the type to get faded"
And I know that she like that I'm famous
I don't love her but I love how I feel
When I fuck her and she make me a meal

White girl on me, I got cocaine
Do it in the bathroom, I can feel my bones break
Same clique with me at the night show
I was in the back then, now I got a light show
White girl on me, I got cocaine
Do it in the bathroom, I can feel my bones break
Same clique with me at the night show
I was in the back then, now I got a light show
