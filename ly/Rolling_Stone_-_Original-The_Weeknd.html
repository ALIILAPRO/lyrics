		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl, you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognized
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home
So this recognition's not enough
And I don't care about nobody else
'Cause I've been on these streets for too long
Too long, too long
Baby, I've been on this too long

'Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing 'bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

Ooh, but until then
I got you, ooh
Baby, I got you, ooh
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you, ooh

So, baby, love me, oh
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh
I'll be different, oh
I think I'll be different, ooh
I hope I'm not different, oh
And I hope you'll still listen

But until then
Baby, I got you, ooh
I got you, oh, ohh
Girl, I still got you, oh-woah
And I got you, ooh, whoa
