		  (What do you want?)
(What do you want?)

Zooropa vorsprung durch technik
Zooropa be all that you can be
Be a winner
Eat to get slimmer

Zooropa bluer kind of white
Zooropa it could be yours tonight
We're mild and green
And squeaky clean

(What do you want?)
(What do you want?)
(What do you want?)
(What do you want?)

Zooropa better by design
Zooropa fly the friendly skies
Through appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence

And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I have no reasons
No reasons to get back

And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we've got

Don't worry baby, it'll be alright
You got the right shoes
To get you through the night
It's cold outside, but brightly lit
Skip the subway
Let's go to the overground
Get your head out of the mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby
Overground

No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from

Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright
Uncertainty can be a guiding light
I hear voices, ridiculous voices
Out in the slipstream
Let's go, let's go overground
Take your head out of the mud baby

She's gonna dream up
The world she wants to live in
She's gonna dream out loud
She's gonna dream out loud
Dream out loud
