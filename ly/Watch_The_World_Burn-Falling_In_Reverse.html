		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I got voices in my head again, tread carefully
And I don't medicate, it helps me temporarily
I got problems, I got issues, yeah, apparently
Trauma that I'm burying, I think I need some therapy
I battle depression, I'm back with a message
I'm asking the question that if you hate me
Why you acting obsessive?
I'm past the point of no return, fuck being passive aggressive
I'll brandish a weapon, teach all you motherfuckers a lesson, yeah
I actually battle my demons and shadows
They swim in the deep and they creep in the shallows, I'm lost
I gotta admit that I'm living the life
That I've always wanted but it comes at a cost (yeah)
They're licking their chops, they're fixing to rip me a part
I'm swimming with sharks, I'm lifting the bar
I'm lifting it into the stars
I'm like a shot of adrenaline mixed with some Ritalin
Started a battle, but bitch, I'ma finish it
You think you can stop me, not even a little bit
Nowadays everybody's so sensitive
Taking my words and you pick it apart
Tripping on nothing, just get in the car
Gripping and ripping I'm sticking the mark
I'm tipping the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-charts
'Cause I got enemies trying to get rid of me
Evil tendencies are fucking with me mentally
I got people that don't like me in the industry
I can feel your energy, you are not a friend to me
'Cause I have been to places that you never wanna go, yeah
I got dirt on people but they act like I don't know, yeah
I could do some damage but I'll never rock the boat 
All it takes is one post, watch 'em fall like dominoes
You'll never get rid of me, too many mini-me's ripping my imagery
You know my history, it ain't a mystery
Put every enemy outta they misery
Somebody send me some positive energy
About to go Darth, I'm 'bout to go Disney
Into the darkness, into infinity
And shut you motherfuckers up, you listening?
Stacking every little pretty penny that I'm getting
And I'm never giving in to anybody, always winning
Never kidding when I die, I'm taking everybody with me 'cause
You're never gonna get me, 'cause you'll never see it simply
I'm a motherfucking god, you're a light yawn
I'm a time bomb and the vibes wrong, is this mic on?
I'm killing the syllables with a loaded refillable
I'm a lyrical typical supervillain, I'm venomous
And I'm never gonna stop until they put me on top of the list

I can't control the monster any longer that's inside

The pain and sorrow left us hollow
No tomorrows, hard to swallow
Death is calling, so appalling
Tightrope walking, now I'm falling down
Like missiles falling from the sky
Come and save us
The pain and sorrow left us hollow
Here today but gone tomorrow

The pain inside is the fuel that drives
This flesh and bone through blood red skies (hahaha)
The death defying, hypnotizing
One day you're gonna figure out
That everything they taught you was a lie
Watch the world burn

The fear keeps you alive
Break the fucking chains, take back your life
The fear is what keeps you insane
Break the fucking chains, take away the pain
