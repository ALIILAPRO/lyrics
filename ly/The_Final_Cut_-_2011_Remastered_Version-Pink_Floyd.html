		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes 
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time 
And far from flying high in clear blue skies 
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide 

If you negotiate the minefield in the drive 
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes 
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall 
Dial the combination, open the priest hole 
And if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)

There's a kid who had a big hallucination 
Making love to girls in magazines 
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith 
Could anybody love him 
Or is it just a crazy dream? 

And if I show you my dark side 
Will you still hold me tonight? 
And if I open my heart to you 
And show you my weak side 
What would you do? 
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone? 
Would you take the children away 
And leave me alone? 
And smile in reassurance 
As you whisper down the phone? 
Would you send me packing? 
Or would you take me home? 

Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands 
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang 
I never had the nerve to make the final cut
