		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
And it's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, an one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins, that do you in
Ooh ooh ooh

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough
Never enough 

You and tequila (mm)
You and tequila make me crazy
Ooh-ooh
