		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
See you walking out that door
Wonder why it took you so long

Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you were the girl of my dreams
But we could never be

You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song

We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up

You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
You need someone you adore
Find a place where you might belong

Ever since the day that I met you
My world's been spinning out of control
I just need you to hold

We knew it'd come around
This thing called love comes crashing down, ah
Pieces all on the ground
What once was lost cannot be found, ah
We knew it'd come around (we find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ah (we get up)
Pieces all on the ground (then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ah (we give up)
We knew it'd come around (we find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ah (we get up)
Pieces all on the ground (then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ah (we give up)

Heaven help us, heaven help us, yeah
We're on our own

We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up, yeah
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, yeah, we get up
We fall down, we give up
