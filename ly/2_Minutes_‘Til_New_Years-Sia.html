		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whether you're partying out
Whether you're partying at home
Partying together or partying alone
It's gonna be a happy new year, not too long
Come with me, this is my New Year's song
Let's count, baby, I'll tell you when
I'll tell you when and
Then we're gonna scream

Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
(Oh) Balloons to burst
(yeah) Balloons to burst balloons to burst

If you've had a happy year or a sad year
It's a nеw year, now there's nothing to fеar
No, nothing to fear, now, no
Oh, there's nothing to fear it's a new year
We got balloons to burst

Grab a boy now or kiss a girl, wow
Grab a dog or a cat or yourself right now
It's gonna be a happy new year, no doubt
Yeah, it's New Year's Eve and
We're gonna count down
One, two, three, I want you, baby
I want you and we are gonna scream

Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
(Oh) Balloons to burst
(yeah) Balloons to burst balloons to burst

Okay, are you ready now? It's time
Ten nine
Eight seven
Six five
Four, three, two, one

Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
A kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
A kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Yeah, let's kiss, kiss, kiss (Ah ah)
(Let's kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Kiss) kiss, kiss, kiss

If you've had a happy year or a sad year
It's a new year, now there's nothing to fear
No, nothing to fear, now, no
No, there's nothing to fear it's a new year
We got balloons to burst
