		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the hanging man
I hang, I never land
I steal the space between
The filthy and the clean
Healer, come here soon
Come to fill my spoon
Healer, heal my wound
I am a dog: I eat the moon
Healer, heal my lust
Fill my mouth with rust
Healer, hold my hand
Fill my mouth with sand
Healer, kill this lamb
Healer, hang this man

I am the hanging man
I am the hanging man
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am not I am not
I am not, n-n-not

Here I lie, abject
Healer teeth are red
Force my legs apart
Healer, hold my heart
Healer cut my spine
Healer, eat my mind
Write it on the sky
These stars reveal the lie
Hold the glowing sphere
There is no there or here
Healer, hold my hand
Healer, hang this man

I am the hanging man
I am the hanging man
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am not
I am not what I just thought
I am not what I just thought
I am not, I am not
We are not, not
Not, not
N-n-not

Who is the watcher who is watching this thought
Whose thought is a thought that is not what he thought
Not, shot
Not, thought
Knot, not
