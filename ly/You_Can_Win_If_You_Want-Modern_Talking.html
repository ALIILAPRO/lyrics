		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You packed your things in a carpetbag
Left and never looking back
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
Music where ever you go
You don't fit in a smalltown world
But I feel you're the girl for me
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
You're leaving town where nobody knows

You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy
Take my hand, follow me
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life

You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right, hold me tight

Oh, darkness finds you on your own
Endless highways keep on rolling on
You're miles and miles from your home
But you never want to phone your home
A steady job and a nice young man
Your parents had your future planned
Rings on your finger, paint on your toes
That's the way your story goes

You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy
Take my hand, follow me
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life

You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right, hold me tight

You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right
