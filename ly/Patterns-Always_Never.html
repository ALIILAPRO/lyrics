		<p>
		  I'm not even sure what it is we're after
We've been on it 8 months
3 days
Same pattern
Sorry I'm not fine
Damn near lost my mind

I keep my distance, you call
Whenever liquor's involved
Like we ain't been here before
You know better babe
You know better babe
I keep my distance, you call
Whenever liquor's involved
Like we ain't been here before
You know better babe
You know better babe

It's been a long year
There's changes I've gone through
I don't wanna hear
A word about nothing
From you
It's always from you
I got none to lose
Push me I'll prove

I keep my distance, you call
Whenever liquor's involved
Like we ain't been here before
You know better babe
You know better babe
I keep my distance, you call
Whenever liquor's involved
Like we ain't been here before
You know better babe
You know better babe

I keep my distance, you call
Whenever liquor's involved
Like we ain't been here before
You know better babe
You know better babe

I keep my distance, you call
Whenever liquor's involved
Like we ain't been here before
You know better babe
You know better babe
I keep my distance, you call
Whenever liquor's involved
Like we ain't been here before
You know better babe
You know better babe
