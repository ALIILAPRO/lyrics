		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darkchild, oh yeah
Toni Braxton, oh
Ha ha, uh huh
Yeah, uh uh
Darkchild, yeah

Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first?

What you thinkin'?
Stop blamin' me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's the chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
Not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then, why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

What you thinkin'?
Stop blamin' me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's the chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
Not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

Oh yeah
So many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game, oh yeah

What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?

He wasn't man enough for me

What are you thinking?

Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
