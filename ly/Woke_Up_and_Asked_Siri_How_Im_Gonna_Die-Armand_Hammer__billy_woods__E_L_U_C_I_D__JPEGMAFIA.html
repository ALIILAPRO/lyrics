		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Because I like JPEGs
Um, for the resolution, the color, the size of them
Everything about JPEGs I like
Siri
One trillion raised to the tenth power is one, zero, zero, zero

Woke up and asked Siri how I'm gonna die
She replied, she replied
Woke up and asked Siri how I'm gonna die
She replied, she replied, she replied

I ain't seen the bottom yet
I ain't seen the bottom yet
Drag the whip on her collared neck
Euphoria, boomerang side effect
I be lying like I'm just a man
I be lying like I'm just a man
I ain't know I be meaning it
Pouring thick, I'm a sticky bun
Planted in when I should've run
I was filled from an empty pot
Magdalene miracles
I'm just a image, a fetish, I fantasize
I be a fool for me first
Keep it close, it be cheaper
The first lie the warmest, my pistol smokin'

Mumbled through the brain fog
Tinnitus like a chainsaw
Cookies crumble
I know that's what you came for
Fake humble with a head full of case law
Marbled steak, put it back in the case so it can age more
Patient carnivore
Ate 'til my jaw ached, wait for her to say I can have it raw
Wild dogs, fresh wounds and old scars
Wild cards pulled out the deck as if the game weren't already hard
Wild thick
Quit therapy, she's fixed
Healing factor with the claws
Weapon X decolletage
You haven't lived 'til you're pulled over in your baby mother's car with a grip (Siri)
I came, I saw, flipped a couple mitts and dipped like W.D. Fard
Left a tip in the room with the keycards
Life's a trip, if you live long enough you gon' see it all
Life's a blip, I flew in under the radar
Beat up spaceships, sliding under the light of a dead star
Still made my shift, appropriately lit for the graveyard
