		<p>
		  Dreamland
Nothing's ever what it seems
You stumble around and you fall down
You think
It's everybody else's dream
Here in dreamland, everything's a broken line
You think it's you who's falling apart and everybody else is fine

But I, I'm not afraid to dream
Even when I can't stop shaking
Even when my heart is breaking
And I, I'm not afraid to dream
Even when I can't stop falling
Even when the light is calling

Dreamland
Faces without their eyes
Trying to hypnotize me
Trying to advertise me
Into dreamland
Sleep walking into walls
When I feel it tearing me down
That's when I hear my angel's calls

But I, I'm not afraid to dream
Even when I can't stop shaking
Even when my heart is breaking
And I, I'm not afraid to dream
Even when I can't stop falling
Even when the light is calling

Dreamland, here we go again
Feeling like a story doesn't have an end
I can't wake up even when I'm falling through the deepest blue
I keep on reaching out for you but you just listen to me scream

I'm not afraid to dream
Even when I can't stop shaking
Even when my heart is breaking
And I, I'm not afraid to dream
Even when I can't stop falling
Even when the light is calling

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
