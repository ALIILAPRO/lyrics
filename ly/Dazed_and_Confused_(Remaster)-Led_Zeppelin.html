		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

You hurt and abuse tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round sweet baby, Lord how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you baby, here I come again

Every day I work so hard
Bringin' home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're goin'
Only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ah
(Ahh)

Oh, yeah, alright, alright
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh don't leave me so confused, no
Oh, baby

Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I sent you the bill
Oh, yeah, alright

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
