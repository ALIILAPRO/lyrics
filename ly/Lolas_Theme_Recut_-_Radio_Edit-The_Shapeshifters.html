		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oooh yeah
Looking back
I know I was walking around in disguise
In disguise
I was just a lost soul I needed a guide
And the moment that you came to change my life
(Looking back together yeah)
You fired up my heart and made me smile

And you and I know that
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around (world around)

Fears I had
All fading away by the minute and I
Feel alive
You untwisted all of my troubles inside
Like a little piece of heaven finally found
(Looking back together yeah)
You rebuilt my heart up from the ground

And you and I know baby
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around (oh yeah yeah)
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around (yeah you turn my world around)
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around (world around, oh yeah yeah)

I'm yeah
I'm yeah

Oh you fired up my heart and made me smile
And you and I know baby

Turn my world around
Oh yeah yeah
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around (yeah you turn my world around)
I'm a different person (oh yeah yeah)
Yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person
Yeah
Turn my world around (world around, oh yeah yeah)
