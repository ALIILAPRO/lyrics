		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard look now in the mirror what have I become 
Caught out by expectation that's the real villain 
Holding on but what to? This cocktail of anger and blame it don't taste nice 
Easier to hate you 
But I don't even though that I try 

Only regret the chances we didn't take 
Leave with a story that you can tell 
Might take a minute but hearts will unbreak 
Wounds turn to wisdom I wish you well 

People said we were stupid and now they gloat 
But somehow if we could rewind I'd still have hope 
Cos I'd know better what to do 
I could use all of this new strength I've grown 
But in the end it takes two 
And so I'm happy that we let go 
And so we're happy that we let go 

Only regret the chances we didn't take 
Leave with a story that you can tell 
Might take a minute but hearts will unbreak 
Wounds turn to wisdom I wish you well
