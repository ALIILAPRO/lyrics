		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell by your eyes
That you've probably been cryin' forever
And the stars in the sky
Don't mean nothin' to you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, whoa, heart

If I stand all alone
Will the shadow hide the color of my heart?
Blue for the tears, black for the night's 
Fears the stars in the sky
Don't mean nothin' to you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke this old heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart
My heart
Oh, my heart
