		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up to the sun on my face
Map out my day
Try my best to stay awake
Need me some coffee

Open up my windows and breathe
Everybody's doing the same thing
It's always been like that, yeah, I know it
Then the days flew by without me counting 'em
Suddenly, I've made my way around the sun

Spring is on my mind
This cold don't feel right
Need you by my side, baby (baby)
Today turns into night
Don't wanna waste our time
Please keep me warm, alright, baby (baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

One day I met somebody special
Not to get all sentimental
But he has a way of making me forget outside of us
Don't know where this is gonna end up
He might not even be the right one
But I like him
Think I wanna get to know him

When we're together, days go by
Stopped counting 'em (stopped counting 'em)
Hand in hand, we'll make our way around the sun

Spring is on my mind
This cold don't feel right
Need you by my side, baby (baby)
Today turns into night
Don't wanna waste our time
Please keep me warm, alright, baby (baby) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Seasons go changing, I guess so am I
Lately I'm thinking if time's on my side
People around me are hardly the same (hardly the same)
Hope I'm not too far behind

Spring is on my mind
This cold don't feel right (don't feel right)
Need you by my side, baby (baby)
Today turns into night
Don't wanna waste our time
Please keep me warm, alright, baby (baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
