		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day here you come walking 
I hold my tongue,
I don't' do much talking
You say you're happy and you're doin' fine
Well go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time
Because sad eyes never lie
Because sad eyes never lie
Well for a while I've been watching you steady
Ain't gonna move 'til you're good and ready
You show up and then you shy away
But I know pretty soon you'll be walking this way
Because sad eyes never lie
Because sad eyes never lie

Baby don't you know I don't care
Don't you know that I've been there
Well if something in the air feels a little unkind
Don't worry darling, it'll slip your mind
I know you think you'd never be mine
Well that's okay, baby, I don't mind
That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact
Go ahead, I don't mind the act
Here you come all dressed up for a date 
Well one more step and it'll be too late
Blue blue ribbon in you hair
Like you're so sure I'll be standin' there 

I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
Never lie, never lie
Never lie
Never lie 
Sad eyes, sad eyes, sad eyes
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes, sad eyes never lie
Never lie, never, never
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie
