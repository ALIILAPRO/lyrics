		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mama, she used to say
God is a woman, she won't let sinners away
My sister she used to cry
Thinking of people who know the day she dies

I think the writing's on the wall
I see it all, tell me

Who's gonna hit the red button?
Who's gonna hit the red button? 
Knock us down, wipe us out
Who's gonna save us? Tell me

Who's gonna hit the red button?
Who's gonna hit the red button? 
Knock us down, wipe us out
Who's gonna save us now?

I see faces, in the night
They tell me not to worry, I can fight the fight
I ain't losing, all I got
I'm close to the end but it's a new day we have

I think the writing's on the wall
I see it all, tell me

Who's gonna hit the red button?
Who's gonna hit the red button?
Knock us down, wipe us out
Who's gonna save us? Tell me

Who's gonna hit the red button?
Who's gonna hit the red button? 
Knock us down, wipe us out
Who's gonna save us now?

(Do I wanna see the end?)
I can feel it in my bones
(Darkness comes to take your hand)
Fire burning in a storm
(Do I wanna see the end?)
Think my judgement day will come
Looking for an ever after I can't find

Who's gonna hit the red button?
Who's gonna hit the red button?
Knock us down, wipe us out
Who's gonna save us? Tell me

Who's gonna hit the red button?
Who's gonna hit the red button?
Knock us down, wipe us out
Who's gonna save us now?

Who's gonna hit the red button?
Who's gonna hit the red button?
(Who's gonna save us now?)
Who's gonna hit the red button
Who's gonna save us now?
