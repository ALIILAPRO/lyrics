		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was watching Syria
Blinded by the sunshine strip
You, you were in the kitchen
Oh, your mariner's mouth
The wounded with the wounder's whip

And that's how summer passed away
The great dividing range, the green, green grass
And oh, maybe it was peace at last
Who knew?

Hello love, my invincible friend
Oh, hello love, the thistle and the burr
Oh, hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were, no

Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual
You were skipping and laughing
Eyes at the bedroom door
"Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see!"
Maybe you're right, babe
Maybe

Oh, Lord
And that's how summer passed
Oh, the great dividing range, the green, green grass
And oh, maybe I'll hold on fast
To you

Then hello love, my invincible friend
Oh, hello love, the thistle and the burr
Oh, hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were

Oh, Lord
And that's how summer passed
Oh, the great dividing range, the green, green grass
And oh, maybe it was peace at last
Who knew?
