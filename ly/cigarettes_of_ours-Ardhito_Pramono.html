		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sitting by the door
And ready to explore
The feelings I have when you passed that store
Watch you look older
Sitting down with cigarettes of ours

Why'd you given all your money?
For such a precious story
But life is treated you so good
Then goodbye to our memories
Sitting down with cigarettes of ours

Take it easy for a little while
You know we did everything good so far
Our fragmented love and cry
We suddenly turn into dust and die
I said it, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

If you're my only friend
Can you stay out of my pain?
The memories and the smell of she remains
In my memories
Sitting down with cigarettes of ours

Take it easy for a little while
You know we did everything good so far
Our fragmented love and cry
We suddenly turn into dust and die
I said it, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't make it rain, it might for a little while
I said it, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Take it easy for a little while
You know we did everything good so far
Our fragmented love and cry
We suddenly turn into dust and die
I said it, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't make it rain, it might for a little while
I said, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
