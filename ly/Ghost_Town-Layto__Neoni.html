		  Ghost Town
Intro
Come on come around
I’ve been feeling down
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
Come on come around
Lost and never found
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
Verse
I cannot sleep
I cannot see
It’s getting harder and harder to breathe
Six feet buried beneath
And all the dust is following me
And the lights go out
Grit my teeth shut my mouth
When the night come around
I become a ghost now
Pre Chorus
Can anybody hear me
Scream into the empty
Somebody come and get me
Get me
Chorus
Come on come around
I’ve been feeling down
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
Come on come around
Lost and never found
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
Living in a ghost town
Verse
It’s like I was haunted
Not what I wanted
I’m hearing sounds
Nails in my coffin
This is exhausting
Leave me for dead
And look what it’s costing me
And the lights go out
Grit my teeth shut my mouth
When the night come around
I become a ghost now
Pre Chorus
Can anybody hear me
Scream into the empty
Somebody come and get me
Get me
Chorus
Come on come around
I’ve been feeling down
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
Come on come around
Lost and never found
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
Living in a ghost town
Ghost town
Chorus
Come on come around
I’ve been feeling down
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
Come on come around
Lost and never found
Sick and tired of feeling like I’m living in a ghost town
