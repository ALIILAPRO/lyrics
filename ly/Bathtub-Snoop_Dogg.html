		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That felt good
(Does it baby?)
Yeah, rub my back for me
(Where you want me to rub it baby?)
Right here
(Okay) Oh
(Turn around) Alright
Check it out though
Why don't you put me on some music?
(What you want to hear baby?)
I wanna hear some of that old gangsta shit
(Alright then)
Damn, the fuck is that? 
Every time I'm chilling somebody ringing my motherfucking doorbell
(You want me to get that for you?)
Yeah, handle that shit for me
(Alright, I'll be right back)
(What the fuck?)
 
(Hey, hey motherfucker)
(Hey Snoopy)
(Yo, what's up Snoop Dogg?)
(What's up my man?)

Hey, hey, hey Snoop, what's going down?
What's up G-Dogg?
Oh, nothing, trying to live between the sky and Earth
And ain't touching dirt nowhere, man
Right, right (what's up with that pure water? What's up?)
Man, I'm fucked up right about now, dawg
'Bout ready to get up out this game (let's get our game on)
I'm ready to give this shit up, man with motherfucking law after me
Punk-ass bitches, sucker-ass niggas
I can't take this shit no more, dawg

What? Man, you want to get out of the game? (Get up, motherfucker)
Come on man, you can smoke a pound of bud everyday (party)
You got a big screen TV, man, you want to give all this up?
You got the dopest shit out on the streets
Nigga, is you crazy? That's the American dream nigga (ay, let's get high)
Well ain't it? (Where the weed at?)
Fool, you better come on in
Wait, wait, wait, wait hold up Snoop
Hey nigga, I put five dollars on the weed
You better quit fucking with me
 
It's time to get busy in this motherfucker
Like we always do about this time
