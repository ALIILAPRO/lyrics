		  1-2-3-4! 

Don't just stand there, let's get loose. I am Ray, I've got the juice. 

Straight to your heart and back again, I 

Tell you I am just your friend. Nice and slow, that's how we'll go. My 

love 

to you, I'll let it flow. You want 

Me? Come on think again, because the magic friend, that's what I am! 

'Course the magic friend is what I am! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

'Course the magic friend is what I am! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

Yo yo yo yo taste that music. Real loose, you've got to use it. Don't 

be 

afraid for magic friends, 'cause that 

Magic friend is what I am! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

'Course the magic friend is what I am! 

Don't just stand there, let's get loose. I am Ray, I've got the juice. 

Straight to your heart, and back again, I 

Tell you I am just your friend. Nice and slow, that's how we'll go. My 

love 

to you, I'll let it flow. You want 

Me? Come on think again, 'cause the magic friend is what I am! 

'Course the magic friend is what I am! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

The magic friend is what he is! 

Don't be afraid, he's just the magic friend!
