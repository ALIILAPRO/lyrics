		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody once told me
Don’t let your heart break now
I should’ve listened then
Right now it kills me to think about you
I wish that I didn’t care

I tried my very best
But I can’t seem to forget
Didn’t know it would be this hard cos I know
I miss you now and I wish that you were still here (here)

Do you think that there is possibility?
That we go back pretend that we’re just meeting
Cos I think maybe we should
Try to figure it out
So can we start over now?

I wish I didn’t love you, it’d be easier
I wish you didn’t turn around and say that you were done
I wish I knew what I know now
Cos if I had known
I would never let you go

It’s killing me to leave
But it’ll hurt to stay
That’s what you said when you threw it all away
I know I wasn’t perfect but I was trying

Do you think that there is possibility?
That we go back pretend that we’re just meeting
Cos I think maybe we should
Try to figure it out
So can we start over now?

I wish I didn’t love you, it’d be easier
I wish you didn’t turn around and say that you were done
I wish I knew what I know now
Cos if I had known
I would never let you go

I wish that I could take back everything that I said
I wish that I could forget about you in my head
I wish I knew what I know now
Cos if I had known
I would never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go

I wish I didn’t love you, it’d be easier
I wish you didn’t turn around and say that you were done
I wish I knew what I know now
Cos if I had known
I would never let you go
Never let you go

Should’ve never let you go
