		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Purple, pink and white
Fragrant and alive
Just like you are

You say you’ve had enough
And your heart has hardened
But you should know that you are loved
So I'll start with a garden

You say you’ve had enough
And your heart has hardened
But you should know that you are loved
So l’ll start with a garden

Start with a garden

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

Purple, pink and white
Fragrant and alive
Just like you are

You say you’ve had enough
And your heart has hardened
But you should know that you are loved
So l’ll start with a garden

You say you’ve had enough
And your heart has hardened
But you should know that you are loved
So l’ll start with a garden

Start with a garden

You say you’ve had enough
And your heart has hardened
But you should know that you are loved
So l'll start with a garden

You say you’ve had enough
And your heart has hardened
But you should know that you are loved
So l’ll start with a garden

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

You say you’ve had enough

Heart is hardened
Heart is hardened

Start with a garden (Heart is)

Start with a garden (Heart is)
Start with (Heart is)

Start with a garden
