		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Midnight, snakebite got me in the back of my neck
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?

Yes, course you do
Bleached blonde hair and big blue eyes
Lives her life on the forty five
Likes you better dead

She's a killer, yes
She's a killer
Likes you better dead than alive
(Oh dear)

Some kids cry and some kids laugh
And if they're really naughty
Give 'em an acid bath, right!
Right!

When she comes round looking for you
Her gun's empty nothing you can do
Thirteen floors high
And the town still alive
Are you?

She's a killer
Likes you better dead than alive, oh.

Some kids cry and some kids laugh (ha ha)
If they're really naughty
Give 'em an acid bath, right!

I see the papers and letters have arrived
Anyway, I wasn't, I wasn't anywhere last night
This is the truth

Someone knocking on the window
Someone's knocking on my door

I'm not normal, I'm not quite right, right!
Can hear bells ringing, must be Sunday
Can see the sun, must be Sunday
Can hear cars, must be Monday
Nothing doing!

When she comes round looking for you
Her gun's empty, there's nothing you can do.

Well I've lived on rice long enough
And I ain't you, no
The sun is shining, it must be Sunday
The bells are ringing for me and my girl

Some kids cry and some kids laugh (ha ha)
If they're really naughty
Give 'em an acid bath, right!

Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride young lady?
Wanna take a ride?
Do you wanna take a ride on the end of this?
