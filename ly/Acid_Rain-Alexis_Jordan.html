		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Get up)

Wake up with the fear of
Livin' for another day
Tell myself that it's nothing
That I can't take
Your strengths was the sickness I can't hide
I tried to be invisible to him
Make no noise, tip toe through everything
Hell's fury feeds the fear inside

It's like acid rain in a hurricane
But here you come to bring me cover
It's a crown of thorns, leaving me torn
But here you come to bring me cover

Oh ooh oh ooh

I made choices that I cannot livе with
I regret not choosing you over him
I'm suffocating in this lifе
Don't know if I can survive this weather
And your turn up with your arms and umbrella
I sent a flare up tonight

It's like acid rain in a hurricane
But here you come to bring me cover
It's a crown of thorns, leaving me torn
But here you come to bring me cover

(Get up, Get up)
(Get up)

And though the gray skies come
I know I can run into your arms
I know that you will come
To save me from harm, from harm

It's like acid rain in a hurricane
But here you come to bring me cover
(Oh ooh oh ooh)
It's a crown of thorns, leaving me torn
But here you come to bring me cover

To bring me cover
