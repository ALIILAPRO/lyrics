		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the days stop hurting and the rain has dried
I know you're the person I want by my side
Scared to let my heart go free and dive in blind
'Cause love and heartbreak, they walk a thin line

Yeah, nobody can love me like you
But that means you got the power to hurt me too

When I fall in deep
Say you'll follow me
'Cause I really need
To know that you'll stick around
When my walls come down
Won't be phased by what's underneath
Yeah, you know I've been hurt
But I'm learning what love's like with you
Like with you
Oh, when I fall in deep
Say you'll follow me
Show me how far we can go

Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me

I have my reasons for taking it slow
'Cause we all got demons, yeah, we all got ghosts
But every time I've broken down, you've picked me up
Yeah, you put back all the pieces I thought that I'd lost

Yeah, nobody can love me like you
But that means you got the power to hurt me too

When I fall in deep
Say you'll follow me
'Cause I really need
To know that you'll stick around
When my walls come down
Won't be phased by what's underneath (what's underneath)
Yeah, you know I've been hurt
But I'm learning what love's like with you (like with you) 
Like with you (like with you)
Oh, when I fall in deep
Say you'll follow me
Show me how far we can go

Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Show me how far we can go

Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me
