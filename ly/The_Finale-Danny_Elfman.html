		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  [CHORUS]
La, la, la (etc)
Jack's OK, and he's back, OK

[CORPSE KID & CHORUS]
He's all right

[MAYOR & CHORUS]
Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, wheee

[CHORUS]
Jack is back now, everyone sing
In our town of Halloween

[CORPSE KID]
What's this?

[MUMMY]
What's this?

[HARLEQUIN DEMON]
I haven't got a clue

[MR. HYDE]
What's this?

[CLOWN]
What it's completely new

[OFF-SCREEN VOICE]
What's this?

[WEREWOLF]
Must be a Christmas thing

[OFF-SCREEN VOICE]
What's this?

[MAYOR]
It's really very strange

[CHORUS]
This is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!

What's this?
What's this?
[Repeat]

[JACK]
My dearest friend, if you don't mind
I'd like to join you by your side
Where we can gaze into the stars

[JACK & SALLY]
And sit together, now and forever
For it is plain as anyone can see
We're simply meant to be
