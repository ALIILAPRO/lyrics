		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna go to a party and only talk
To you
Or stay at home on our phones maybe for an hour
Or two
When I'm kinda sick of everyone
Everyone but you
Let's go to Sheryl Crow karaoke it's all I wanna wo (hey

If I was ever gonna get a tattoo
I'd wanna get a half a heart to match you
It's you you and me till the end
Wrote a best friend song for my best friend

If you say you wanna do some mushrooms
I'd take what you give me cause I trust you
It's you, you and me till the end
Wrote a best friend song for my best friend

You were there when I cried over what's his name
Again
You picked me up I was drunk still a mess at three AM
Hit me with your tough love
It was kinda mean but true
That's why I call you my sister it's not just cause I look like you
There's no one else I'd rather waste my time with

If I was ever gonna get a tattoo (tattoo)
I'd wanna get a half a heart to match you (match you)
It's you you and me till the end
Wrote a best friend song for my best friend

If you say you wanna do some mushrooms
I'd take what you give me cause I trust you
It's you you and me till the end
Wrote a best friend song for my best friend
You
You will always be, yeah
(You) wrote a best friend song for my best friend

There's no one else I'd rather waste my time with
There's no one else I'd rather waste my time with, oh

If I was ever gonna get a tattoo
I'd wanna get a half a heart to match you
It's you you and me till the end
Wrote a best friend song for my best friend

If you say you wanna do some mushrooms (mushrooms)
Yeah, I'd take what you give me cause I trust you (trust you)
It's you you and me till the end
Wrote a best friend song for my best friend
It's you, yeah
Ye- yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah
It's you, ye-yeah
Wrote a best friend song for my best friend (uh, say)
You're my best friend
Hey girl (wrote a best friend song for my best friend)

Yeah know it yeah, you know it, you're my best friend, ooh
