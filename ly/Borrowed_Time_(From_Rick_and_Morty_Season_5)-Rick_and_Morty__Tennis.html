		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought that the sun burned brighter
With you by my side
And that we'd go on forever
Together you and I

Now I'm waking from a dream
I've been following you foolishly
Leaving you is hard for me
But I gotta do what's right for me

Thought we'd go on, you by my side
Forever, you and I
We raised hell, every night
Together, you and I

I thought the world stopped turning
Without you by my side
How we burned it down together
Every single night

Now I'm waking from a dream
I've been following you foolishly
You were playing God with me
And I bought it all completely, yeah

Honestly, I
Sometimes I've been good for you
I'm not dreaming
You're already leaving me

Thought we'd go on, you by my side
Forever, you and I
We raised hell, every night
Together, you and I
Running on borrowed time
Forever, you and I
Thought we'd go on, you by my side
Together, you and I
