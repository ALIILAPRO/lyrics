		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chain my soul
My demons inside
I swear they be proud of me
Eyes ice cold, my soul full of holes
The darkness surrounding me
Took too long, I cannot be saved
The old me is dead and gone
Ripped my heart, right out my chest
My brain feeling cloudy

I feel like I'm drowning
Can't tell what's around me
This rage is astounding
Adrenaline pounding
I'm piling on pounds
Of the pressure
I'm panicking
Panicked a-fuck
Pandering fuck
Can't stand around me
Can't stand them
An allergy

Yeah

I got to be real
I thought I'd be dead, my g
The things that I feel, I know they're not normally
Sometimes I can't feel, what the fuck wrong with me

I don't know why I'm still here, no
I don't know how I'm still here, no
I don't know how I'm still here, no
I don't know how I'm still here, no

Chain my soul
My demons inside
I swear they be proud of me
Eyes ice cold, my soul full of holes
The darkness surrounding me
Took too long, I cannot be saved
The old me is dead and gone
Ripped my heart, right out my chest
My brain feeling cloudy I
Chain my soul
My demons inside
I swear they be proud of me
Eyes ice cold, my soul full of holes
The darkness surrounding me
Took too long, I cannot be saved
The old me is dead and gone
Ripped my heart, right out my chest
My brain feeling cloudy I
