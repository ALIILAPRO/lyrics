		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo
It's go, go, go, go, go, go, go time
Tick, tick, boom

We're bringin' the noise
Oh, baby, we bringin' out toys
Separate men from the boys
Chopper be singin', should be on The Voice
Bang, bang, we gon' ride out
Gang, gang, we don't die out
When it like this, ain't no timeouts
Tell me who really gon' find out?

Rowdy
We gettin' rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy
We gettin' rowdy, rowdy (ooh)

We be disturbin' the peace (ooh)
Workin', we servin' the streets (ooh)
'Bout to go in, goin' beast (ooh)
Bang, bang, leave you asleep
Tick, tick, boom

Hard body, body
You're not scarin' nobody
You make me resort to wildin'
You must be blinded by the diamonds
I didn't want it to be this way
But y'all want me to try this
So it's no way around it
You the loudest one, it's gettin' crowded

Rowdy
We gettin' rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy
We gettin' rowdy, rowdy (ooh)

We be disturbin' the peace (ooh)
Workin', we servin' the streets (ooh)
'Bout to go in, goin' beast (ooh)
Bang, bang, leave you asleep

Woo
It's go, go, go, go, go, go, go time
Tick, tick, boom

You can't stop me
So who gon' stop me?
You can't stop me
So who gon' stop me?
You can't stop me
So who gon' stop me?
You can't stop me
So who gon' stop me?

We be disturbin' the peace (ooh)
Workin', we servin' the streets (ooh)
'Bout to go in, goin' beast (ooh)
Bang, bang, leave you asleep

Woo
It's go, go, go, go, go, go, go time
Tick, tick, boom
