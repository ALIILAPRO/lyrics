		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk, she knew
How to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down

Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that?
"Do you really want to know," she said
It would seem she's on her way
It's more, more than just a dream
She put on her stockings and shoes
Had nothing to lose, she said it was worth it

Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
"Every winter was a war", she said
"I want to get what's mine"

Jezebel, Jezebel
Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try show her a better way
She'll say, "you don't know what you've been missing"
By the time she blinks, you know she won't be listening

"Reach for the top," she said
"And the sun is gonna shine"
"Every winter was a war," she said
"I want to get what's mine"
