		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not done fightin', I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
Got me feeling like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fightin' (Metro), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
Got me feelin' like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up

Uh, wakin' up, feelin' like the thankful one
Count up my ones, lacin' up my favorite 1's
One of a kind, one of one, the only one
Got one shot and one chance to take it once 
Kiss my mama on the forehead, 'fore I get the code red
'Cause I was born, bred to go in, toast red
And swing by four-ten, beef patty, cornbread
In the concrete jungle, where my home is (no way)
All get focused, all range of toast is
The nickname, Mr. Keen-To-Do-the-Mostest
I was livin' down bad in my folks crib
Now I'm laughin' to the bank and the joke is (no way)
Did more things than folks did or folks get
We've been gettin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends co-exist
They love to mix and we know what it is

Not done fightin' (no way), I don't fear I've lost
Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
Got me feeling (no way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fighting (no way), I don't fear I've lost
Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
Got me feelin' (no way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (no way), but I can't give up

I can't find it in myself to just walk away
I can't find it in myself to lose everything
Feel everyone's against me, don't want me to be great
Things might look bad, I'm afraid to look death in the face
I'm good now (now, now, no way), who's really bad?
I choose me now (now, now) what's wrong with that?
Wish you could see me (no way)
Now, now, mm, who had my back, baby?
Know no love lost, good always will win

Not done fightin' (no way, fightin'), I don't fear I've lost (feel I-)
Am I dreamin' (dreamin'), is there more like us? (More like)
Got me feeling (no way, feelin'), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (beaten), but I can't give up (can't give-)
I'm still fighting (no way), I don't fear I've lost
Am I dreamin', is there more like us?
Got me feelin' (no way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (no way), but I can't give up

Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up
