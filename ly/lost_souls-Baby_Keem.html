		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a lot of hoes in here, lot of lost souls
Whole group of dime bitches and they in Vogue
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I'm tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
You see that bitch right there, she fucked OVO
You see that bitch right there, she fucked Romeo
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I'm tryna find me a bitch that no one knows

Jumpin' out the coupe, pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose, I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
When I put you in the latest, make sure he know

I'm quick to book a flight, I'm not new to the game
That pussy gettin' tame, go public on the lames
I bought it, say that name, Alexander McQueen
Rolex, whoa, whoa, heart on froze
Tip my toes, it's hard out here, I've hit my lows
You're leveragin' the bag
Your best friend was trash, trash, trash
Get gone like The Flash, Flash, Flash
Let's add and subtract, math
I see that you look at these VV-VVs
Let's get you a piece for me

I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real nigga in your life
I come in like a thief in the night
Two phones, I'm the stereotype
Mama know me, I'm picky who I like
There's not a fake bitch in sight
Come in like a thief in the night

(Hold up, where my phone?)
Sixteen missed calls
Sorry, I was busy, but I missed you (text me when I'm coming home)
If you see me ballin' then my bitch ball
All my niggas ballin' like I'm Rich Paul
Skrrt off in the Audi, I'ma lift off
All your bitches do pilates when you're rich, dawg
So if she can't pop a squat then that's a rip-off
Keep the CDG, y'all niggas ripped off (off, off)
And your nigga better not think that he the only one (only one, only one)
That nigga match his fitted with some Jordan 1s (yeah, yeah)
If it ain't Issey then miss me
NUWO with Hublots
Got a bad bitch with Chrome toes
And we shoot movies, not photos
She not in it for the fame
Nobody know her name

Jumpin' out the coupe, pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose
I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
When I put you in the latest, make sure he know

Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Yeah, I know it's hard, babe
But I'm still on your side, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe
I know it's hard, babe
I stay by your side babe

Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Please show me a sign, babe, wish I had more time, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe
Busy all the time, babe, too late to reply, babe
Put me to the test, we young but we pay bills
Please don't make a mess, I don't do good with spills
Lately, I been stressed (been deep in a drill)
No regrets when it's real

Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Yeah, I know it's hard, babe
But I'm still on your side, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe
I know it's hard, babe
It's alright
