		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (ayy)
I got layers to me
I got plans, I got goals, I got tricks up my sleeve
I got calls, I got deals, I got people to meet
I got drive, I got soul, I got everything
I got scars, I got heart, I got family to feed
I got people mad I ain't who they want me to be
I got people I don't know tellin' me what I need
Yeah, I got loved ones sayin' that they prayin' for me

I'm thankful for the prayers, I need more of those
Put my hands together, bow my head and thank the Lord for
Everything he's done, yeah, ain't none of us immortal
So while I'm still alive I got so much to look forward to
Addicted to the craft (whoa), got no time to chat (whoa)
Just a little something to hold 'em over for what's next (whoa)
Even when I guess (whoa), I get it correct (whoa)
Question my work ethic, that's a question you don't ask (no, no, no, ayy)
Yeah
Don't ever question if I hustle, work a double
Drop a bomb on me I climb right out the rubble
Not a struggle, tossin' me under the bus will get you muzzled
Pop your bubble (pop), throw your compliments right out the window
So unique with this, I could flip the script and change the schedule
You'd still think that it happened how it should've, keep it subtle
Bunch of geniuses, put they heads together try to huddle up
But still they sit, confused about how I learn to juggle, ayy
Toss around some concepts 'til I pick one
Usually I don't alter my traditions
Foreign to me hit 'em with the switch up
I just had to get this out my system
Been a handful even with a mouth full of hand soap, I still say what I want to
Getting passed? No, better chance beatin' Usain Bolt in my sandals
To be candid, that's like puttin' minivans in NASCAR with a grandma
In the driver seat with her hands up
Show goes on even after the show's over
To get past me you would have to kill me (kill me, kill me, kill, me)

Ayy (kill me, kill me, kill, me)
Tossin' what you want aside for longevity, ain't meant to be
If it causes everything to collapse and affects your heart heavily
What's worth it and what's not?
What's certain and which side will the coin flip to and land on?
When you guess wrong do you stand up or stand down
Even with a man down I man up, well rounded
Held out for the right outlet
Nine houses couldn't make me feel home, childish
Me left, see, the outcome every ounce of my childhood
Played a role in how I wound up with an outlook so crowded
No knowledge, couldn't see through the piles of my problems
Still piled up, past tense, man, I wish it was
But I've come so far so quickly
In it for the long haul, it's routine
Only thing I'm cool with losing is losing sleep
And it's only cool with me
If it means I get to watch my dreams
Come true if I kept it brief
Still you think it was a long story
Recording half of the things I think would
Take six years, prepare, 'cause the chance that you asked for
Might show up at your door one night like, "I'm here
Gonna let me in or just stare?"
It's clear, yeah, six ain't enough
That wouldn't come close to the content between my ears
My layers have got layers
My layers have got layers
