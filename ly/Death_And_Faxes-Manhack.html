		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never more worthy a head to sever
Think you're so, so fucking clever
But fear the drop of a grey feather
Stuck in your own head forever
Service with a motherfucking smile
Sick and pile, over with denial
Rigging your own conviction and trial
All the while
So vile
Fear radiating at any advent of tranquility
Abhor the silence and the glances within that it brings
Arguing symmetry
Tormented over some hypothetical key
Only get off for misery
Hear not and speak not thee
Speak not and be not free
This smells of heresy
Heresy heresy
Meticulously repeating exactly the same motions
Expecting the unexpected break in the paternal aftermath
Hear not and speak not thee
Speak not and be not free
This smells of heresy
Heresy heresy
Endlessly lost in a loop of minuscule victories and self adulation
Least resistance your chosen path
To each his own, and you care not, so get exactly what you want
To each his own, and you care not, so get exactly what you want
To each his own, and you care not, so get exactly what you want
You want, what you want
To each his own, and you care not, so get exactly what you want
It's your choice, but you get off on misery
Get what you want, it's what you wanted, get what you want
Get what you want, it's what you wanted, get what you want
Get what you want, it's what you wanted, get what you want
Get what you want, it's what you wanted, get what you want
Get what you want, it's what you wanted, get what you want
Get what you want, it's what you wanted, get what you want
Get what you want, it's what you wanted, get what you want
Get what you want, it's what you want
