Ah
(And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it)

Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (mwah)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah ah)
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (mwah)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody

Look at how I bodied that, ate it up and gave it back (ugh)
Yeah, you look good, but they still wanna know where Megan at (where Megan at?)
Saucy like a barbecue but you won't get your baby back
See me in that dress and he feel like he almost tasted that (ah, ah, ah)
Num, num, num, num, eat it up, foreplay, okay, three, two, one
You know I'm the hottest, you ain't ever gotta heat me up
I'm present when I'm absent, speakin' when I'm not there
All them bitches scary cats, I call 'em Carole Baskins, ah

Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah)
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (baow, baow, baow)
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah)
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah, ah)

I'm a hot ebony, they gon' click it if it's me (if it's me)
All my bitches been gettin' these niggas through the quarantine (yeah)
Bitch, I'm very well, on my shit as you could tell
Any ho got beef from years ago is beefing by herself, ah, ah
If we took a trip on the real creep tip (yeah)
Bitch, rule number one is don't repeat that shit (don't repeat that shit)
Rule number two, if they all came with you
They better know exactly what the fuck they came to do (yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa)

Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (yeah)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah)
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (whoa, whoa)
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah)

The category is body, look at the way it's sittin' (yeah)
That ratio so out of control
That waist, that ass, them titties (that waist, that ass, them titties)
If I wasn't me and I would've see myself, I would have bought me a drink (hey)
Took me home, did me long, ate it with the panties on (ugh, ugh, ugh)
I could build a house with all the brick I got (yeah)
Bitches spend a lifetime tryna get this hot (tryna get this hot)
And if her head too big, I could make that pop
I'm not the one to play with like a touch-me-not, ah

Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah)
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah, whoa)
Body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (whoa, whoa)
Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (hey, hey, hey, ah)

Ody-ody-ody-ody
