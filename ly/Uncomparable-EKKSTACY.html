		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I did all this for you, but you don't know)
You're uncompara-, you're irreplaceable
You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable
You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable

You're uncomparable, I'm fuckin' terrible
I cut my wrists and cry alone
I swear that I don't got no place to go
The pain's unbearable, you're irreplaceable
I'll never love you, like I said
I'll end up on my own

I've been actin' crazy
She don't want me lately
I know that I'm alone(you're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable)
Xanny make me crazy (you're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable)
I think that they hate me (you're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable)
But I fell on my own (you're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable)

You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable
You're uncompara-, you're irreplaceable
You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable
You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable

You're uncomparable, I'm fuckin' terrible
I cut my wrists and cry alone
I swear that I don't got no place to go
The pain's unbearable, you're irreplaceable
I'll never love you, like I said
I'll end up on my own

You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable
You're uncompara-, you're irreplaceable
You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable
You're uncomparable, you're irreplaceable
