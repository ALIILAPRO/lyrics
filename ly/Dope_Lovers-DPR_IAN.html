		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling 
You fall in

You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling
You fall in

A dope lover
You'd say
No number
I like your face
I'm just here for two
Lying next to you

So gone
To the point I can't believe 
This was all from a kiss
You stayed for this (you stayed for this)
You'd live for this
'Cause I just need you now

You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling
You fall in

You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling
You fall in

You don't think we don't know love
We can't leave the question untouched
How many times we laugh through this moment
Just to hold back
'Cause I think

I know that you compromised this ('cause I think)
You got everything to feel bliss ('cause I think)
I thought you would fall
I would've missed
You'd live for this 
'Cause I just need you now

You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling
You fall in

You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass 
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling
You fall in

A dope lover you are
A broke lover he was
And he doesn't know
She's tired, she's tired

A dope lover you are
A broke lover he was
And he doesn't know
She's tired
And you're tired

When you smile (you smile)
She smiles (she smiles)
You tried (you tried)
To build fires (because I don't want you to know)
No time (because I don't want you to go)
To go higher 
She's tired 
Because it hurts every time

You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling
You fall in

You're smiling
I'm sorry
She's vibin'
No compass
When I live
You're dying
When I'm falling
You fall in
