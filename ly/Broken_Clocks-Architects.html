		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Falling into stringencies I never thought that I would be here Dependence on the evenings I'm out of touch  It's too late to hide what you kept hid What explains with words were crooks I'm falling out I'm falling out Of touch with myself  I felt like this since forever This is killing me I felt like this since forever This is killing me  What escaped Was what I dreamt then blurry eyes said the stories I'm broke apart fading hours empty dreams Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends I wore the same routines over every fucking night I'm beginning to lose faith in friendships I  I felt like this since forever This is killing me I felt like this since forever This is killing me  Lift me up from this never ending fear of myself Dependence on the evenings to get me through Show me the line I can't just walk away  How much longer can I break the same routines? Blurry eyes broken clocks fading hours How much longer can I break the same routines? Blurry eyes broken clocks fading hours  Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends""
