		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pressure on my body
When she dance
Oh she don't understand

Say you'll lay your hands on me
You don't see how that could change a man

You don't wanna wait till we get out the party
So go ahead and mouth the words that you want me

Don't I like the madness in her wings
The state she gets me in

Hands off
This diamond
In my hand
I can't hand off
She's the only one
That wants real love
And I'm the only man
With my hands on

Pressure as I dance around
Her skin
How could she understand

As you lay your hands on me
I'm helpless everywhere you land

So you don't gotta wait till we get out the party
So go ahead and mouth the words that you want me

The beauty and the madness in her wings
The state she gets me in

She got high hopes
And she wanna do it all night
And there she goes
Stood on my toes
Saying this feels right

Hands off
This diamond
In my hand
I can't hand off
She's the only one
That wants real love
And I'm the only man
With my hands on
