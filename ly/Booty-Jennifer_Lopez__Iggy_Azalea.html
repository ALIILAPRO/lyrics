		  Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty

Have you seen her
On the dance-floor
She got the boom, shake the room
That's the lightning in the thunder
You wanna meet her
You wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes
And it starts to make you wonder

All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man
Bring him to the dance-floor
Go and light them jeans,
Don't you worry you're dancing
It's his birthday
Give him what he ask for
Let me show you how to do it

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Work
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Shake that
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Work
Big, big booty
What you

The way she moves
I know you want her
She like the fire, get you right
That's the lightning in the thunder
You wanna meet her
You gotta touch her
Hold on tight for the ride
'Cause you know you're gonna love her

All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man
Bring him to the dance-floor
Go and light them jeans,
Don't you worry you're dancing
It's his birthday
Give him what he ask for
Let me show you how to do it

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Work
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Shake that
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Go work
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty

They begging me to drop down on it
But right now Iggy on the top
The last time the world seen a booty this good
It was on Jenny from the block
I got 'em going crazy lately
But baby knowin' that only make me
Wanna tell all of my ladies
To get up on the floor and just shake it, shake it
Ya'll know what I've been on, ya'll know that I've been on
I'm queen big booty Iggy, now find me a bone to sit on
Girls with the cheeks, put 'em hands in the air
Then pop that, pop that, let 'em know that you there
See everybody wanna get a taste
You know that we've got enough to share
But fact we girls with the big fat booty too fancy to ever play fair

Mesmerized by the size of it
You can find it if you like take your time
I can guarantee you'll have the time of your life
Throw up your hands if you love a big booty

Big big big big big big booty (what you)
Big big big big big big booty (what you)
Big

Let me show you how to do it
Work
Shake that
Go to work
(Let's go to work)

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Shake that
