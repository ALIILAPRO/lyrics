		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not good enough for me, since I been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me, I know
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for twenty-four
I peeped you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like go-go, ayy

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Ooh, why not?
A fuckin' good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Ooh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie (Boosie)
If they want the drama, got the Uzi (Uzi)
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship (cruise)
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies (movies)
Ride with me
Ride with me, boss (boss)
I got a hard head but her ass soft (soft)
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just popped bubbly in the 'cuzi

It's not good enough for me, since I been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for twenty-four
I peeped you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like go-go, ayy

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Ooh, why not?
A fuckin' good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

You ain't enough for me
Too much for you
Alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you
You know, so pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for twenty-four hours
When you stand next to twenty-four karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So you don't never hurt nobody (ayy)
Baby girl, work your body
Work your body

And you are unforgettable
I need get you alone
Now you wanna choose (ooh)
Just popped bubbly in the 'cuzi

Why not?
Ooh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
