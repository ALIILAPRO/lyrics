		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was way past midnight
And she still couldn't fall asleep.
This night the dream was leaving
She tried so hard to keep.
And with the new day's dawning
She felt it drift away.
Not only for a cruise
Not only for a day
Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart.
As the day came up, she made a stop.
She stopped waiting another day for
The captain of her heart.
