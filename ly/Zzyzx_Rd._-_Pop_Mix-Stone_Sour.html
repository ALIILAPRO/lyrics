		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how else to put this
It's taken me so long to do this
I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight
My muscles feel like a melee
My body's curled in a U-shape
I put on my best but I'm still afraid

Propped up by lies and promises
Saving my place as life forgets
Maybe it's time I saw the world

I'm only here for a while
But patience is not my style
And I'm so tired that I gotta go

What am I supposed to hide now?
What am I suppose to do?
Did you really think I wouldn't see this through?

Tell me I should stick around for you
Tell me I could have it all
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go

I get to go home in one week
But I'm leaving home in three weeks
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry

I'm following suit and directions
I crawl up inside for protection
I'm told what to do and I don't know why

I'm over existing in limbo
I'm over the myths and placebos
I don't really mind if I just fade away

I'm ready to live with my family
I'm ready to die in obscurity
'Cause I'm so tired that I got to go

Oh, where am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
You still don't think I'm going see this through

Tell me I'm a part of history
Tell me I can have it all
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go

Oh yeah
Oh, where am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
You still don't think I'm going see this through

Tell me I'm a part of history
Tell me I can have it all
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go


I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
