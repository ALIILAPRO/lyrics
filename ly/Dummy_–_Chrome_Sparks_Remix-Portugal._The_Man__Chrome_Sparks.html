		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 AM and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take

My religion is
A piano hanging over 
Am I about to break free?
And I see it moving
Gotta pick up the groove and let go
Everyone I know
Is running from the afterlife

These days they make it sound sweet
If this is the last dance, you can count on me

One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 AM and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take

One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 AM and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take

Way my phone is ringing
Paint a tunnel on the wall
Escape before the anvil falls
Gotta keep it moving
Gotta pick up the groove and let go
Everyone I know
Is running from the afterlife

These days they make it sound sweet
If this is the last dance, you can count on me

One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 AM and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take

One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 AM and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take

The light is going out
The light in my life is going out
The light is going out
The light in my life is going out

One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 AM and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take

One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 AM and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take

One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
