		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cry out all who care to know
I've been hollow way too long
I know where I'm going wrong
There's nothing I can do
I believe you can get me through
Nothing else will do
I believe you can get me through
So can you stop the bleeding?
Get me through…

Color blind I paint your blue sky grey
But this time you'll shed some light on me
Just before I fade away
There's nothing I can do
I believe you can get me through
Nothing else will do
I believe you can get me through
So can you stop the bleeding?
Get me through…

All the chances that you're takin'
The promises that I keep breaking down
Writings on the wall
Can't make out all the letters
But I know it's getting better now
The writings on the wall

Get me through…

There's nothing I can do
I believe you can get me through
Nothing else will do
I believe you can get me through
So can you stop the bleeding?
Get me through…
