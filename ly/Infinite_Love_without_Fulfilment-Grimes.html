		  I will wait for you (it's all upon my own way) 
If you want me to (it's all upon my own, babe)
I will wait for you if you want me to (it's all upon, it's all I can do)

I will wait for you (it's all upon my own way) 
If you want me to (it's all upon my own, babe)
I will wait for you if you want me to (it's all upon, it's all I can do)

I will wait for you (it's all upon my own way) 
If you want me to (it's all upon my own, babe)
I will wait for you if you want me to (it's all upon, it's all I can do)

I will wait for you (it's all upon my own way) 
If you want me to (it's all upon my own, babe)
I will wait for you if you want me to (it's all upon, it's all I can do)

I will wait for you if you want me to
I will wait for you if you want me to

I will wait wait wait (if you want me to)
And I'll go go go, go at night oh (I will wait for you)
If you want me to

I will wait wait wait (if you want me to)
And I'll go go go, go at night oh (I will wait for you)
If you want me to

I will wait wait wait (if you want me to)
And I'll go go go, go at night oh (I will wait for you)
If you want me to

I will leave leave leave (if you want me to)
And I'll go go go, go at night oh (I will wait for you)
If you want me to

I will wait wait wait wait wait 
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, oh
