		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you find what you're looking for
I'm trying to find a reason for the back and forth
Right now, I'll die on the tennis court
As long as you're still breathing, I know I'll be sore

I died when I met you
I died when I left you
And now I'm stuck in the middle

Why can't you lie like you did before?
I got to know your demons, do they still want more?

Yeah, I'll set fire to the tennis court
As long as I'm still bleeding, you know I'll be yours

I died when I met you
I died when I left you
And now I'm stuck in the middle

I died when I met you
I died when I left you
And now I'm stuck in the middle

You're messier than my bedroom
Sleeping when the darkness comes to get you
You were so close to me, now just a ghost to me
Turn out the light, yeah

I died when I met you
I died when I left you
And now I'm stuck in the middle (and now I'm stuck in the middle)
Stuck in the middle
I died when I met you
I died when I left you (fall)
And now I'm stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
Stuck in the middle
And now I'm stuck in the middle

(And now I'm stuck in the middle) I'm stuck in the middle
(Stuck in the middle) and now I'm stuck in the middle
