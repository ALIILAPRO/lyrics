		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Childish Gambino got that swagger
All these pussy niggas 'round here don't matter
All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya
Move in closer before I'm gon' kiss ya
Know that you know me, don't act stupid
You seem different, tired of these groupies
I'm on fire, won't find bigger
Got big shots sayin', "That's that nigga"
Hovy with glasses, Weezy but geeky
Girls in the lobby tryin' to meet me
I ain't afraid to say it, yeah, I love these hoes
With their glasses, and their jacket, and their hipster clothes
Yes, I'm always on tour, what you mad at that for?
I'm slammin' that thing like a Cadillac door
I love fast women, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Have your cake and eat it, baby, it's your birthday

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

It ain't trickin' if, you know, baby, I, you know
Mama, you are with the right man, Juno
Tell me what you wanna do, I will make it happen
I just wanna get you home and uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yes, I'm drinking whiskey, baby, I am gone tonight
Nbc is not the only thing I'm comin' on tonight
Gross, why the fuck I say these things?
It isn't over, haven't heard the chubby lady sing
Everybody love me, call a nigga Raymond
These weak niggas always in your face like Ray-Bans
Yes, I bring the heat, girl, fire, f-fireman
Baby, I'm your hero, Donald for Spiderman
I'm in love with you but this is not tennis
And baby stay stacked like she bad at Tetris
Rude boy, I Rihanna that vagina
Tell your boy, good luck tryin' to find ya (find ya)

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
