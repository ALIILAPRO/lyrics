		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get high like Colorado
We had it all, but what do I know?
I tried to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late, I'll try tomorrow
(Today, yeah, day, yeah)

I think you are kinda mean (kinda mean, kinda mean)
You just replaced me in the scene (in the scene, in the scene)
I thought that we were evergreen (evergreen, evergreen)
Like a never-ending dream

Never been on the TV
Scratched me off in your CV
Out of your mind, out of your mind
Never been so uneasy
Jealousy got me freaky
Out of my mind

So I get high like Colorado
We had it all, but what do I know?
I tried to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late, I'll try tomorrow
(Today, yeah, day, yeah)
I'm losing sleep all by myself
I'm wide awake, and I just wonder how
You put my heart back on the shelf (back on the shelf)
Well, I'ma be a loner now

Never been on the TV
Scratched me off in your CV
Out of your mind, out of your mind
Never been so uneasy
Jealousy got me freaky
Out of my mind

So I get high like Colorado
We had it all, but what do I know?
I tried to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late, I'll try tomorrow
(Today, yeah, day, yeah)

Drownin' in my sofa with my blood shot red eyes
Ride the rollercoaster 'til I see the sunrise

I get high like Colorado
We had it all, but what do I know?
I tried to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late, I'll try tomorrow
(Today, yeah)

I get high like Colorado
(Colorado, Colorado, Colorado)
I get high like Colorado
(Colorado, Colorado, Colorado)
