		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I learned the hard way
That what you dream for
Comes from the pain you hold inside
I'm on a long road
There is no answer
You have to hold the love you find
I'd wait so helpless
But love was waiting
Just like an angel in the dark

Heavy is the crown of horns that rests upon this head
Heavy is the crown of horns from all the blood he shed

The days seemed endless
No sense of calling
Until the daylight came to be
I thought of rapture
To end this capture
Then something grew inside of me
I found my way now
And I am soaring
Almost touching every star

Heavy is the crown of horns that rests upon this head
Heavy is the crown of horns from all the blood he shed
Heavy is the crown of horns that kept the faith so bright
Heavy is the crown of horns that gave me all this life

I'll call out to the world tonight
To raise your horns up high
I'm calling to the world tonight
To let your voices fly
I'll call out to the world tonight
Give thanks for we are saved
I'm calling to the world tonight
To never be afraid

The end of longing
A place to rest now
I found the answer to my prayer
I'm on my way now
And I am soaring
I'm almost touching every star

Heavy is the crown of horns that rests upon this head
Heavy is the crown of horns from all the blood he shed
Heavy is the crown of horns that kept the faith so bright
Heavy is the crown of horns that gave me all this life

Heavy is the crown of horns that rests upon this head
Heavy is the crown of horns from all the blood he shed
Heavy is the crown of horns that kept the faith so bright
Heavy is the crown of horns that gave me all this life
