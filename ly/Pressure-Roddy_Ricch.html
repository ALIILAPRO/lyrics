		  (Mustard on the beat, ho)

Get too much money, I ain't even tryna take no advice
I got some baguetties, you know I'm buried in the ice
I'm in an igloo and my bitch live in a glacier
Came from the bottom, now I'm countin' up this paper (ayy)
I get my racks and I shut up
I get get get racks, get cheddar
I'm pressure, she pressure
Got a ticket in my dresser

Bitch, I came straight up out the pressure
Nipsey Hussle, blue rag on my necklace
We mobbin' in the Tesla
I'm a certified Eliantte investor
I promise I'm goin' in like the privates I'm boardin' in
Lot of out-of-town bitches, we knowin' they coordinates
I was broke, now I'm twenty-two and I made Forbes again
I been all about some racks, fuck a bitch, get some racks

Get too much money, I ain't even tryna take no advice
I got some baguetties, you know I'm buried in the ice
I'm in an igloo and my bitch live in a glacier
Came from the bottom, now I'm countin' up this paper (ayy)
I get my racks and I shut up
I get get get racks, get cheddar
I'm pressure, she pressure
Got a ticket in my dresser

Ayy, you know a nigga been livin' life
I been gettin' factory diamonds, tryna get the Jigga ice
We been on a different time
I damn wear don't wear Margiela, I got Louis V Vanilla
I got my bitch that came from the trap pushin' Porsche pedal 
V12 engines got me kickin' a horse better
You like the local bitches, I like the importers better
I hang with killers, none of my nigga don't know no better
Shorty, what you want, your rent paid?
And your bust down Rollie with a big face
Wanna meet Rihanna, get some Fenty
Can you count up all my president? Ayy

Get too much money, I ain't even tryna take no advice
I got some baguetties, you know I'm buried in the ice
I'm in an igloo and my bitch live in a glacier
Came from the bottom, now I'm countin' up this paper (ayy)
I get my racks and I shut up
I get get get racks, get cheddar
I'm pressure, she pressure
Got a ticket in my dresser
