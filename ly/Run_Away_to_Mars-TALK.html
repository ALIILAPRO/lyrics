		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your color's fading
'Cause I kept you waiting
It's a wild, wild world
And you're a wild, wild girl

Our sun's still shining
But it seems half the size
And it's a wild, wild world out here

Before my time runs out

What If I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end
If I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars

I can't tell which way is home
I've been gone for so long
It's an empty world up here
I skip stones and wonder
How long 'til I'm discovered
It's a quiet life up here

Before my time runs out

What If I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end
If I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars

Three, two, one, I miss you
I'm sorry, I got issues

What If I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end
If I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars
