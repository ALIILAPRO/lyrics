		<p>
		  Oooahh
Did I do everyone wrong
Then why I feel so lone?
I found comfort in the cold
Why my confidence so low?
And why can't I just feel like I am here
These 30 minutes have felt like a year
Can someone tell me if it's all real
Can someone-
Why can't I just feel like I am here?
These 30 minutes have felt like a year
Someone tell me if it's all real
Can someone tell me if it's all real
Why can't I just feel like I am here
These 30 minutes have felt like a year
Am I the only one that feels like me?
Am I the only one that feels like me?
