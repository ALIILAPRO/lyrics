		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cut you into pieces
Searching for your imperfections
I had plans to make you whole
But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way to bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Breathe back life into your veins
But I can't start your cold heart beating
You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way to bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

And you left me more dead than you'll ever know
When you left me alone

I've been looking for a way to bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

Let it die
Let it die
Let it die

(The doppler effect shows up as an apparent change in frequency)
(And is caused by relative motion between the satellite transmitter)
(And the receiving antenna on Earth)
(While the satellite is approaching, the received frequency)
(Is higher than the one actually transmitted)
(The wavelengths are compressed by the velocity of the approaching satellite)
(As the intervening system now)
(As the satellite nears the point of closest approach)
(The received frequency descends rapidly to match the one we know to be transmitted)
(As the satellite goes away the received frequency continues to drop)
