		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe this, is, real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe this, is, real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight

Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

You make me
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight

Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
