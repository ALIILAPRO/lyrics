		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My idle hands lead to evil thoughts
That's what I was told
I see a devil tryna' creep on up
Ain't gon' get inside my soul
So let the demons go and hang me up
Cos motherfucker, I ain't dead til I say so
Cos I been fighting all my fuckin' life
So I'ma sin til the motherfuckin' end
Oh no, oh

Oh no, no, don't you understand that I've been going around this world
Don't you understand that I've lost time and I can't lose more
All I got is money on my mind
So just miss me with these motherfuckin' fifty million problems
Every single day I wake up and I try to solve them
Dreaming of a future with some motherfuckin' options

My idle hands lead to evil thoughts
That's what I was told
I see a devil tryna creep on up
Ain't gon' get inside my soul
So let the demons go and hang me up
Cos motherfucker, I ain't dead til I say so
Cos I been fighting all my fuckin' life
So I'ma sin til the motherfuckin' end

Oh no, no, don't you understand that I've been going round this road
Don't you understand that I've lost time and I can't lose more
All I got is money on my mind
So just miss me with these motherfuckin' fifty million problems
Every single day I wake up and I try to solve them
Dreaming of a future with some motherfuckin' options

Option, options, damn I got them options
Fifty million, hunnid million, living like a boss shit
Catch me in the crowd smoking loud up in the mosh pits
Screaming obnoxious, til I'm fucking nauseous
I be going crazy til I'm motherfuckin' dead
I got angels on my shoulders with the devil in my head
I don't know where I'm going but I know where I've been
You can find me in the future where my money never ends

Oh no, no, don't you understand that I've been going round this road
Don't you understand that I've lost time and I can't lose more
All I got is money on my mind
So just miss me with these motherfuckin' fifty million problems
Every single day I wake up and I try to solve them
Dreaming of a future with some motherfuckin' options
