		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was never shown how to love, so I did my best to guess
Everything a man ever wants, a tiny girl in a dress
A trophy for his friends
That I didn't even like, so
Try to learn from mistakes, I haven't made one in months 
But it's gettin' harder to take pushin' away everyone
You just had to show up
And yeah, I'm not mad about it

Swear to God I'ma change, but I'm agnostic
All this loneliness is gettin' so exhaustin'
Sick to my stomach, yeah, I'm feelin' kinda nauseous
And I can't tell if it's you

I'm so love starved
Knowin' if I'm ready to trust you is goddamn hard
You're pickin' at skin and bones
I feel my lips, they're turnin' blue
Are you great or somethin' new?
I'm so love starved
Are you actually my type or do I just need a bite?

Is it the fact that you're there? Do I actually care?
The potential of the latter's got me pullin' my hair out
I'm a skeleton of the love I once had
Yeah, it was so bad, but you're nothin' like that, yeah

Swear to God I'ma change, but I'm agnostic
All this loneliness is gettin' so exhaustin'
Sick to my stomach, yeah, I'm feelin' kinda nauseous
And I can't tell if it's you

I'm so love starved
Knowin' if I'm ready to trust you is goddamn hard
You're pickin' at skin and bones
I feel my lips, they're turnin' blue
Are you great or somethin' new?
I'm so love starved
Are you actually my type or do I just need a bite? Yeah

(Oh, oh)
Sick of being taken advantage by shitty guys
(Oh, oh)
Tell me if you're one of them, I'm losin' my mind
(Oh, oh)
Are you feedin' me affection or just a bunch of lies?
Is it me? Is it you? I don't really got a clue
I don't got much love but I might give it all to you

I'm so love starved
Knowin' if I'm ready to trust you is goddamn hard
You're pickin' at skin and bones
I feel my lips, they're turnin' blue
Are you great or somethin' new?
I'm so love starved
