		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Taurus)

Hopscotchin' through the street, I'm tryin' not to fall
She pray to God I make it home before tomorrow mornin'
I'm tryna tell her to pick a Rollie but she don't care at all
I'm carin' 'bout my drank, my portion's what I'm comin' for
I been keepin' up with my city
High performance on my jacket, Rolls-Royce truck for extra fifty
Just incase I run into her, I'm tryin' my best to stay spiffy, yeah

See the pussies on the sideline wishin' that I fall
Pull the skeletons out the closet, I'm 'bout to tell it all
Just want my money, my hoes and all my kids to ball
I'm road ragin' to the millions if I have to crawl
Yeah, I'm road ragin' to the millions if I have to crawl, oh yeah
I'm road ragin' to the millions if I have to crawl

Every time they call in, young nigga ballin'
I went from tellin' them to try me, to callin' shots
And I wanna know what's on your mind, what you're thinkin' 'bout
And I wanna know if I can change it, let's take you out
Private flight to France, such a change in trends
I bought her a Richard, now she dance like ants in her pants
Red and white diamonds on my mans, he an ambulance
Half a million to my dad, salad dressing, bought a ranch
He said his last two weeks been busy, I'm movin' in
I told my mom look out her window to another Benz
She took nine shots of Patron, 50 Cent
I bent the corner and seen my bros gettin' rich
Signed another check for a couple million on a jet
Swear to God, 2006, my sickest dream was buyin' a 'Vette
Bought that shit and then I wrecked and then I copped another one
Smoked forty-one, this your last batch and I got more to come
Gettin' them bales up by the metric ton, hit up feds or somethin'
Bought a Bentley with a credit card, it's the blackened one
I got shows way in Hong Kong, I'm the chosen one
You frozen tongue, you won't say it twice, I'll great you with a gun, nigga

See the pussies on the sideline wishin' that I fall
Pull the skeletons out the closet, I'm 'bout to tell it all
Just want my money, my hoes and all my kids to ball
I'm road ragin' to the millions if I have to crawl
Yeah, I'm road ragin' to the millions if I have to crawl, oh yeah
I'm road ragin' to the millions if I have to crawl
