		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love that's all around me
And so the feeling grows

It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go, oh yes it is
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show, oh

You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend

I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking
Of all the things you said, oh yes I do

You gave your promise to me and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do
Oh, yes I do

You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend

I gotta keep it moving

Ooh, it's written in the wind
Oh, everywhere I go, yeah, ooh yeah
So if you really love me, love me, love me
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it
Come on and let it
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it
Come on and let it 
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show, baby
Come on and let it show
