		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in love with a girl from the internet
Stole my heart and I knew before we even met
I-I fell in love with a girl from the internet, the internet (From the internet)

I fell in love with a girl from the internet
I can't shake the thought of how I see us in my head
Somehow I don't even understand
Feels like I know you
Late-night, I'm staring at my screen again
Do you feel me too?

I fell in love with a girl from the internet
Stole my heart and I knew before we even met
I-I fell in love with a girl from the internet, the internet (From the internet)

Where you wanna go? I can take you there
I can tell for sure something's in the air
I would drive all night, I don't even care
I haven't even met you yet, this game ain't fair, yeah
You can have it all 
Ima make you mine
Baby, be my ride or die, yeah
I don't know what's taking over me
But I know that I'm feeling ya (Feeling ya)

I fell in love with a girl from the internet
Stole my heart and I knew before we even met
I-I fell in love with a girl from the internet, the internet (From the internet)
I fell in love with a girl from the internet
Stole my heart and I knew before we even met
I-I fell in love with a girl from the internet, the internet (From the internet)

(From the internet)
(From the internet)
From the internet
I fell in love, yeah
I fell in love
With a girl
With a girl from the internet
I fell in love with a girl from the internet
