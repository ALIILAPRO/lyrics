		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  10 P.M., most folks are sleeping
But it's the weekend
So we ain't, and we know where the cops don't go
These 40 inch tires seen enough pavement
So we're taking them on red dirt place somewhere offroad
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are

No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Round here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire

Girls showing up late as always
Now it's a party
Cut off sun dresses, they're ready to go
Don't need no dance road tonight
Just country music and good times

No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)

You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are

No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Yeah
Setting the night on fire

On fire
