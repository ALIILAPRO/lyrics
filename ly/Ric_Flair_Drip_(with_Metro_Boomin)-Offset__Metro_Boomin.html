		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bijan 4 The 1 Time)
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga (hey)

Goin' to the jeweler, bust the AP, yeah (bust it)
Slidin' on the water like a jet-ski, yeah (woo, slide)
I'm tryna fuck you and your bestie, yeah (hey)
Chopper with the scope, so do not test me, yeah (brrt, brrt)
Ric Flair drip, go "woo" on a bitch (woo)
Fifty-seven ninety, spent a coupe on my wrist (ice)
Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits (ayy)
Hop up in the Lamb and drop the roof, show the tits (skrrt)

Poppin', but you really not gon' shoot (poppin')
Ninety pointers down my diamonds look like hula hoops (ninety)
Hop in my Bentayga and the seat is a masseuse (hey)
Balenciaga, check my posture, Valentino boots (ooh-ooh)
It's the Boominati way, a lotta Lambs, a lotta Wraiths (Boominati)
Never hesitate to give a nigga yellow tape (grrt)
Ain't worried 'bout the bag 'cause the cash accumulatin' (bags)
Soon as we came in the game, all these niggas they imitated (hey)
Put my mind on it, then I put my grind on it (grind)
Put that iron on him if a nigga my opponent (iron)
My car five-hundred and I don't put no miles on it (whoa)
I was runnin' 'round homie, with five-hundred thou' on me (hey)

Goin' to the jeweler, bust the AP, yeah (bust it)
Slidin' on the water like a jet-ski, yeah (woo, slide)
I'm tryna fuck you and your bestie, yeah (hey)
Chopper with the scope, so do not test me, yeah (brrt, brrt)
Ric Flair drip, go "woo" on a bitch (woo)
Fifty-seven ninety, spent a coupe on my wrist (ice)
Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits (ayy)
Hop up in the Lamb and drop the roof, show the tits (skrrt)

Twist my fingers, got the gang with me (gang with me)
Bought my first Patek, it got some rain on it (Patek)
Nigga, we used to kick it, how you hatin' on me? (Ha-ha)
Hop in the Bentley coupe and blow the brains out it (skrrt)
We not the same, my nigga
My nigga, we from the north division (north, north)
Aim at your brain, yeah, we bought ya like it's an auction, ain't it (hey)
Beat the chopper, hundred round total, like it's car collision (brrt, brrt)
I made that shit mandatory, that means I had to get it (hey)
My shooter be begging "please," he ready to whack a nigga (please, please)
I gave a nigga a diamond, I had to cap a nigga (woo)
I'm giving your ho away like she a raffle, nigga (here, here)
We get at it, then we 'gon pray with the pastor's scriptures (hey)

Goin' to the jeweler, bust the AP, yeah (bust it)
Slidin' on the water like a jet-ski, yeah (woo, slide)
I'm tryna fuck you and your bestie, yeah (hey)
Chopper with the scope, so do not test me, yeah (brrt, brrt)
Ric Flair drip, go "woo" on a bitch (woo)
Fifty-seven ninety, spent a coupe on my wrist (ice)
Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits (ayy)
Hop up in the Lamb and drop the roof, show the tits (skrrt)

Goin' to the jeweler, bust the AP, yeah (bust it)
Slidin' on the water like a jet-ski, yeah (woo, slide)
I'm tryna fuck you and your bestie, yeah (hey)
Chopper with the scope so do not test me, yeah (brrt, brrt)
Ric Flair drip, go "woo" on a bitch (woo)
Fifty-seven ninety, spent a coupe on my wrist (ice)
Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits (ayy)
Hop up in the Lamb and drop the roof, show the tits (skrrt)
