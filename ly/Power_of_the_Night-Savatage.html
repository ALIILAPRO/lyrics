		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out there coming closer quicker
Moving with a swiftness
Closing in on me
Children of the metal movement
The legions growing stronger
Stronger than they believe

It's a power I'm drawing
From a light that's glowing
Power of the Night
The call of the wild
Power of the Night
Raise the fist of the metal child

Thrashing
Screaming, twisting, banging
Heads upon the platform
The witch has been conceived
Children of the metal movement
The armies growing stronger
Crack my cranium

It's a power I'm drawing
From a light that's glowing
Power of the Night
The call of the wild
Power of the Night
Raise the fist of the metal child

Out there coming closer quicker
Moving with a swiftness
Closing in on me
Children of the metal movement
The legions growing stronger
Stronger than they believe

Thrashing
Screaming, twisting, banging
Heads upon the platform
The witch has been conceived

Power of the Night
The call of the wild
Power of the Night
Raise the fist of the metal child

Power of the Night
The call from the wild
Power of the Night
Power of the Night
