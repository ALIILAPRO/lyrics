		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we have all gone, to the silence of eternity 
To first be forgotten, and lost in, the records of the earth
Could I still miss you, then, in the time and space after life
When no one is searching anymore, and where we are nowhere to be found 

We didn't spend our life together
And I will miss you forever

The choice was mine, to long for a time, that will never come
Though we leave the world apart, i, still went peacefully, quietly 
With you, still, firmly in my heart

I will wait forever I wait
