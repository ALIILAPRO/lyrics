		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They were laughin' at me
All the songs that I sing
Saying they don't believe me
And I don't mean anything
There is somethin' inside me
That has never been said
Since this crowd of emotions
Came to live in my head

There's a crowd of emotions
Can't get out of my head

And I've been waiting for a chance to
Free them, free them
Let them fly
I just want a chance to
Free them
Let them out of my mind
Let them out of my mind

Always goin' full speed 
I was runnin' so hard (oh oh)
Couldn't hear myself breathin' (hear myself breathin')
Just the drums in my heart
I can tell that you notice
All the things I keep down
Can I leave myself open (open, open)
And let them all out (oh)

And I've been waiting for a chance to
Free them, free them
Let them fly
I just want a chance to
Free them
Let them out of my mind
Let them out of my mind (let them out of my mind)
Let them out of my mind, yeah

Take this crowd of emotions
Let them out of my head

And I've been waiting for this chance to
Free them, free them
Let them fly
I just want a chance to
Free them
Let them out of my mind (let them out of my mind)
Let them out of my mind (let them out of my mind)
Let them out of my mind (let them out of my mind)
Let them out of my mind
