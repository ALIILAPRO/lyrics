		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A hundred miles an hour thinkin' of you
A hundred miles an hour with my heart racin' on a thought
I'll still be up tomorrow, same déjà vu
A hundred miles an hour thinkin' of you

Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Oh, mi amor
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Oh, mi amor
Thinkin' of you

Twenty-four, three sixty-five
From the dawn 'til the night
Don't make noise, heartbreakin' got nothin' on the way you go 'round my mind
Got me feelin' like I'm losing it, yeah
'Cause I'm on you like a light with no off switch
Upset, lovesick
But wanna, wanna spend my life with my drugs with

A hundred miles an hour thinkin' of you
(And around and around we go)
A hundred miles an hour with my heart racin' on a thought
(No red lights)
I'll still be up tomorrow, same déjà vu
(And around and around we go)
A hundred miles an hour thinkin' of you

Thinkin' of you (hit the gas on the highway)
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you (only I could have it my way)
Oh, mi amor
Thinkin' of you (hit the gas for the speed chase)
Thinkin' of you ('til my heart turn over, lower, lower)
Thinkin' of you (hit the gas on the highway)
Oh, mi amor (yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of you
