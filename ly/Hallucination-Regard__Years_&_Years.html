		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must be single, that must be why
You sent me some poem the other night
That shit's confusin', I have to say
Oh, you have got some nerve talkin' that way, yeah
Turning up to let me know, you would still give us a go
I'm sorry but we've done this all before
It's just another show, 'nother story to be told
I'm foolish, I believed you but now I know

Don't try to impress me
I know you're intending to hurt me again
You look like a vision
But now I'm beginnin' to see through the haze

Don't be so fake, oh
Your love is a hallucination
Don't be so fake, oh
Your love is a hallucination

(Your love is a hallucination)
(Your love is a hallucination)

Romeo, baby, he's not the king
Although nobody knows me quite like him
Now that I'm older, I expect to be wise
The truth is out there somewhere in between the lines, yeah
It's just another show, 'nother story to be told
I'm foolish, I believed you but now I know

Don't try to impress me
I know you're intending to hurt me again
You look like a vision
But now I'm beginnin' to see through the haze

Don't be so fake, oh (oh)
Your love is a hallucination
Don't be so fake (oh, no), oh (oh, no)
Your love is a hallucination

Don't be so fake
You're not foolin' anyone
(Your love is a hallucination, oh, oh)
Don't be so fake
You're not foolin' anyone (oh, no)
(Your love is a hallucination, oh)

Don't be so fake, oh 
Your love is a hallucination (oh)
Don't be so fake, oh
Your love is a hallucination
