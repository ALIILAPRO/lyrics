		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to
Gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark

If Heaven and Hell decide that
They both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love
" so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that
They both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the
Soles of your shoes
Are all worn down the time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about 'cause
We'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

And if Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "No"s on
Their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Then I'll follow you into the dark
