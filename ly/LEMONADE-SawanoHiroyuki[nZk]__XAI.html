		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't shy away from no ﬁght
So don't push us now 'cause baby, maybe we bite
Back it up! Back it up!
You seem to have quite the bone to pick with all of us
A chip on your shoulder big as a rhinoceros

On a crusade
Get stuck so make lemonade

Time to shine in the dark
Tonight, I'll be the light, I'm crusading
Don't you even worry
Time for spells in the dark
Tonight, I'll bring the ﬁght, I been saving
Don't you even worry

Stand together, we brave any weather
Time's never on our side
Go hell for leather
Stand together, we brave any weather
Houses of the holy
Don't you even worry

イビツな世界が lo-ﬁに霞むなら
Baby, maybe we glide
Back it up! Back it up!
未来永劫のシナリオなんてナンセンスだって?
Kick off the new era of us now
唸らせろ

On a crusade
Get stuck so make lemonade

Time to shine in the dark
トラウマ描き換えるほど grooving
Don't you even worry
Time for spells in the dark
まだコントロールできない自制心
Don't you even worry

Stand together we
グレーゾーンにしたって
Time's never on our side
賽は投げられた
Stand together we
奇想天外なスリルに下るより
Don't you even worry
Mm, even worry, eh, eh, oh
Don't you even worry
One, two, three

Time to shine in the dark
Tonight, I'll be the light, I'm crusading
Don't you even worry
Time for spells in the dark
Tonight, I'll bring the fight, I been saving
Don't you even worry

Stand together we
Brave any weather
Time's never on our side
Go hell for leather
Stand together we
Brave any weather
Houses of the holy
Don't you even worry
