		  Wake me up
Wake me up

I'm walking through a dream
I'm walking through the finest place I've ever seen
Hey man, won't you wake me up?
Said "Hey man, won't you wake me up?"
I'm walking through the fire
Defiant on the wire, burning up my desire
Hey man, won't you come, come give me a gun?
Help me blow the lights right out of the sun

So won't you tell me if I'm dreamin' it? (Oh no)
I need to know just where I stand (oh no)
But it turns out my hands are useless (oh no)
But maybe I'm a better man (oh no)
Said "Wake me up"
Said "Wake me up"
Said "Wake me up"

I'm dancing on the screens
I'm dancing in the mountains where I've always been
Hey man, won't you wake me up?
Said "Hey man, won't you wake me up?"
I'm kicking down the doors
I'm climbing up the walls of the house that's yours
Hey man, won't you come, come give me a gun?
Help me blow the lights right out of the sun

So won't you tell me if I'm dreamin' it? (Oh no)
I need to know just where I stand (oh no)
But it turns out my hands are useless (oh no)
But maybe I'm a better man? (Oh no)
Said "Wake me up"
Said "Wake me up"
Said "Wake me up"

We're dancin' on the serpents
I'm dancin' on the coals
Deny your own expression, you deny the things you know
I'm livin' through the ages
I'm dancing on the tiles
Commit to any handshakes
Or believe a Duchenne smile
I'm burning all my bridges
I'm pulling up the ropes
Deleting all the codes
No, I'm not that man you know
You walk into a trap
Then you walk into your youth
You're living all that life with a pair of dusty boots

So won't you tell me I'm dreamin' it? (Oh no)
I need to know just where I stand (oh no)
Well it turns out my hands are useless (oh no)
But maybe I'm a better man (oh no)
So won't you tell me if I'm dreamin' it? (Oh no)
I need to know just where I stand (oh no)
But it turns out my hands are useless (oh no)
Well maybe I'm a better man (oh no)
So won't you tell me if I'm dreamin' it? (Oh no)
I need to know just where I stand (oh no)
But it turns out my hands are useless (oh no)
Well maybe I'm a better man (oh no)

Said "Wake me up" (oh no)
Said "Wake me up" (oh no)
Said "Wake me up" (oh no)
(Oh no)
