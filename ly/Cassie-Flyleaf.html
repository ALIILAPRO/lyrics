		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The question asked in order
To save her life or take it
The answer no to avoid death
The answer yes would make it, make it

Do you believe in God?
Written on the bullet
Say yes to pull the trigger
Do you believe in God?
Written on the bullet
And Cassie pulled the trigger

All heads are bowed in silence
To remember her last sentence
She answered him knowing what would happen
Her last words still hanging in the air
(In the air)

Do you believe in God?
Written on the bullet
Say yes to pull the trigger
Do you believe in God?
Written on the bullet
And Cassie pulled the trigger

How many will die?
I will die
I, I will say yes

Do you believe in God?
Written on the bullet
Say yes or pull the trigger
Do you believe in God?
Written on the bullet
And Cassie pulled the trigger
Do you believe in God?
Do you believe in God?
Do you believe in God?
And I will pull the trigger
