		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time
When I worshipped the ground you walked on
There was a time
When I'd cut off my ear for you
There was a time
When I worshipped the towel you dried on
There was a time
When I'd kill all my friends for you

You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna eat up inside
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one
Makes me wanna go home and curl up and die
Curl up and die 

There was a time
When there was only you and no one
There was a time
When I'd take any pity shag

You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna move to Versailles
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one 
Makes me wanna go home and curl up and die
Curl up and die

I was just the dirt on your shoes
And I liked being that
I was just the germs in your flu
And I liked being that
I was just the chip on your tooth
And I liked being that
I was just the me to your you
And I liked being that
