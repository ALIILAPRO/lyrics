		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
It's Casper Slide part three, featuring
The platinum band, myself, My confidant
And we're keeping it a hundred, you know?
Yeah (Ayy)

Tell me how you feel this morning?
Did you take a pill this morning?
You can get your heels this morning
Left 'em at my crib this morning
You was in a rush to get gone
Did you have a good time last night?
The W was jumping til dawnin'
Never even dawned on a nigga who you was
'til I seen you on my timeline scrolling
Why you keep it low? Be open
I ain't here to use your likeness
Do whatever you like, don't fight it
You should come back here tonight then
Parking kinda sick past ninе-ish
Why don't you just park on Highland?
You ain't gotta walk, I'm driving
Tell me how you feel this morning?
(Morning, morning, morning)
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
(Yeah) Tеll me how you feel, for real, yeah

Tell that motherfucker I got

We threw a party at the W
Text me when you and yours are coming through
That light hit different on your melanin
I'm sure I'll never meet another you
('Nother you)
I come in peace so don't be scared of me
(Don't be scared of me)
I know they told you to beware of me
('Ware of me)
Don't be afraid to come and ride the wave
(The wave)
I know you wanna come and ride the wave
(Ride the wave)

Pull up on you wit' my S550 (My S5)
Doing donuts until 12 come get me (Yeah)
Hype your bestie up, she throwin' that shit
Uh blowin' gas until we all get lit
Pull up on you wit' my S550 (S5)
Doing donuts in my S550 (Skrrt, skrrt)
Driving reckless in my S550 (Ooh ooh)
Blowing Grabba in my S550 (Ayy, ayy)

She asked me, "Why it's not reciprocal?"
(Reciprocal, ayy)
It wasn't me but there's a turn in you
(There's a turn in you, ayy)
Just take a look at what's in front of you
(What's in front of you)
She think my confidence is through the roof
In a coupe S550, ayy, and she with me
(And she with me) and her friends too
These hoes in the front seat (In the front)
And they fit too, ride it like a 10-speed
It ain't shit new when
You're rollin' with me (Yeah)

@ Me phabo
Jelly phabo
LNF phabo

Pull up on you wit' my S550
Pull up on you wit' my S550
(Pull up, pull up, yeah)
Blowin' gas 'til a nigga get dizzy
Pull up on you wit' my S550
I pull up on you wit' my S550 (Oh yeah, ayy)
MIA (MIA, oh yeah)
Pull up on you wit' my S550 (Yeah! Yeah)
MIA (MIA)

Ten on two
Just won't do where we 'bout to go

Turn your location on if you have to
Let 'em know that it's good when I have you
Shouldn't have sent your own man to rush ya
The one that got it bad like I'm Usher
These are my confessions (Oh yeah)
Tell me if you ready (Oh yeah)
I'ma get you wetter
Let's do more than lay up
Let's explore LA, uh
Show you how I'm livin'
Welcome to the city in the drop linen

Pull up on you wit' my S550
Doing donuts until 12 come get me
Hype your bestie up, she throwin' that shit
(Throwin' that)
Blowin' gas until we all get lit
(Gettin' lit)
Pull up on you wit' my S550 (S5)
Doing donuts in my S550 (Skrrt, skrrt)
Driving reckless in my S550 (Ooh ooh)
Blowing Grabba in my S550
