		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm working overtime
Tired of my 9 to 5
Tonight I'll lose myself in the lights
A quarter to midnight
Got nothing on mind
Dressed up so dynamite
Dynamite

Ooh
I'll take you to my paradise
Ooh
I'll take you to my paradise

I'm gonna kiss somebody
Drink that honey
Gonna move my body tonight
I'm gonna lose composure
Night's not over
'Til it's raining glitter, alright
Sliding through the silhouettes
Doing things that we'll forget
Screaming out, "I will survive"
I'm gonna kiss somebody
Drink that honey
Move my body tonight

I'm technicolor dreaming
I dance in the spotlight
I know you wanna get closer
Underneath the neon lights
Don't stop 'til I say it's over
Just want a touch of emotion
Let me get lost in the moment

Ooh
I'll take you to my paradise
Ooh
I'll take you to my paradise

I'm gonna kiss somebody
Drink that honey
Gonna move my body tonight
I'm gonna lose composure
Night's not over
'Til it's raining glitter, alright
Sliding through the silhouettes
Doing things that we'll forget
Screaming out, "I will survive"
I'm gonna kiss somebody
Drink that honey
Move my body tonight

Ooh
I'll take you to my paradise
Ooh
I'll take you to my paradise

I'm gonna kiss somebody
Drink that honey
Gonna move my body tonight
I'm gonna lose composure
Night's not over
'Til it's raining glitter, alright
Sliding through the silhouettes
Doing things that we'll forget
Screaming out, "I will survive"
I'm gonna kiss somebody
Drink that honey
Move my body tonight

(Move my body, move my body)
Move my body tonight
Move my body tonight
