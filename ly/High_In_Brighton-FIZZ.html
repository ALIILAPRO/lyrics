		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (High, high)

I wanna get out my room, it's so boring
Crushed under the weight of things that I'm ignoring (she's ignoring)
Talk to the hand, not to my face
Talk to the losers in my place
Fuck it, I'm leaving, I'm out of here
I got a one way ticket to heaven

I wanna be high in Brighton
I wanna be high in Brighton
I wanna be high
I wanna be high in Brighton
I wanna be high in Brighton
I wanna be high

I'm on the marine parade and it's still boring (boring, boring)
Thought there'd be a marching band, I guess they're touring
Even when it's grey, it's a holiday (holiday)
Seven hundred ice creams in my face
So if you wanna escape, come and get

High in Brighton
High in Brighton
Wanna be high

I wanna be high in Brighton
High in Brighton
I wanna be high

I want to escape my real life (li-li-li-life, I want to escape, want to escape)
(Want to escape) I want to escape my real life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) 

This could be perfect timing
Tickets are cheap, so buy them
We can get

High in Brighton
We can get
High in Brighton
I wanna be high
So come and say
Hi in Brighton
Hi in Brighton
I wanna be high
I'm so high
