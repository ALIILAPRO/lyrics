		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the land of money
It's an honor that your meeting me
Holy matrimony got me gripping on my Jesus piece
Daily stressing about my money when it's leaving me
This beat is kinda plain let me add a bit of seasoning
Hot and Cold that's on my body you ain't telling what the season is
And If you want some Benjamin's just tell me what the reason is
Welcome to the money land
Where you got the freedom and your feet up in the sand
Bust them rubber bands
Where yo bitch would never cheat on you
With another man
Where you gotta keep that heat on you
And get a Hunnid bands
We ain't ever doing loans
We just send it in advance
Go and buy a car instead spending on some weed and pants
If I gotta play you best get up and leave ya plans
You can come and make the play or you can watch it from the stands
Make the way and pave the path using every bit of chance
Asking for some help but don't get mad ya running out of hands
Introduction man the rules are always simple
Go and get ya bag or they going pop you like a pimple
You can tell it's money when I'm stepping cause I'm always stepping nimble
Way you playing with those needles you should probably get a thimble
If the beats was just some cloth
Then they knowing I'm the seams
If you talking MoneyTeam
You best be talking about them greens
I ain't even hit the gym
But they know I'm feeling lean
Double up the stack and get to splitting for the whole team
And yes we talking cash and how we need it fast
But all the presidents we spending shit and now they in the passed
Feeling inconspicuous I ain't need a mask
Take a fifth a henny in while we shopping out of Saks
