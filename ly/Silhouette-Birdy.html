		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are shadows in my dreams
Storms that send me out to reach
And you just wait on my defeat

So I built an army underneath
And now they got me while I sleep
And this worn-out frame will carry me

Don't go holding your breath
You know that I'm not done yet
There's still a fight in me left
Don't go shouting out loud
That you're claiming the crown
I'm done but not out

And the bittersweet of every new defeat
Is I'm stronger than before
Baby, on my knees, but I still believe
These broken wings will soar

Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks
Through oceans dark

In the dust I wrote my name
And from the ruins, hopes were praised
'Cause all that's messed can be replaced in time

Don't go holding your breath
You know that I'm not done yet
There's still a fight in me left
Don't go shouting out loud
That you're claiming the crown
I'm done but not out

And the bittersweet of every new defeat
Is I'm stronger than before
Baby, on my knees, but I still believe
These broken wings will soar

Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks
Through oceans dark

Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks
Through oceans dark
