		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't you see? Everything
Is a mess when you hide
All the lies that you thought
You could bury

You kept rolling snake eyes
You kept rolling snake eyes
One too many times one too many times

And all you see are the
Cards that you can play
And you thought you'd get
Away with these games
And all you see are the
Cards there in your hand
And you thought that you
Had everything planned

Can't you see? Everything
Is a mess when you hide
All the lies that you thought
You could bury

You kept rolling snake eyes

And all you see are the
Cards that you can play
And you thought you'd get
Away with these games
And all you see are the
Cards there in your hand
And you thought that you
Had everything planned

You kept rolling snake eyes
You kept rolling snake eyes
You kept rolling snake eyes
You kept rolling snake eyes
One too many times
