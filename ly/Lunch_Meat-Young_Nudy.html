		  Rollin' pressure, startin' pressure, blowin', applyin' pressure (applyin' pressure)
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
I'm a stepper, he's a stepper, big 4L forever (forever)
Know these bitch niggas regret goin' against the fuckin' devil (the devil)
Must forgot I send them shots, I been a shooter, bitch, I'm stretchin'

Ooh-wee, we still on the Front Street (Front Street) 
Still put niggas on plate, turn 'em to some lunch meat (lunch meat)
Yeah, and I got them racks these hoes still wanna hunch me (wanna hunch me, phew) 
Said they love my lingo, gangster, and I'm country (and I'm what? Yeah)
Ooh, trick a country boy, sell that pussy nothin' (sell 'em nothin') 
East Atlanta, man, we take shit, we make this money (we make this money, nigga)
Niggas trap, niggas rob (yeah), niggas doin' somethin' (doin' somethin') 
Can't be broke, they gon' laugh, you not gettin' no money (you not gettin' no money)

Ooh, and you know I'm havin' cash money, this shit forever (forever)
And your ho gon' scream, might yell (yell) 
While we swerve 'round in that Tesla (that Tesla)
Let that car drive while I fuck your ho, man, I'm so extra (so extra)
Talkin' gangster to me, pussy boy must got some pressure (some pressure)
Boy, you better pray to God, he'll tell you I'm too extra (too extra)
Always tryna keep it cool, but they wanna test me (they wanna test me)
Guess my lifestyle don't seem real to 'em, must think I'm flexin' (must think I'm flexin')
Guess these niggas wanna be another fuckin' question (question, damn)
'Nother gas pack I can roll up (yeah) 
Jump in the field, I'll show ya (yeah)
Built for this shit, you not a soldier (nah)
I thought I told ya (yeah) 
Clap with the stick, sound like magnolia (magnolia)
I had to show 'em (I showed 'em) 
This killin' shit part of my culture (my culture)
Yeah, EA-ski (I'm just tellin' y'all my side of this shit, man)
(Yo, Pierre, you wanna come out here?)
We got it out the bricks 
Hahahahaha, yeah

Ooh-wee, we still on the Front Street (Front Street) 
Still put niggas on plate, turn 'em to some lunch meat (lunch meat)
Yeah, and I got them racks these hoes still wanna hunch me (wanna hunch me, phew) 
Said they love my lingo, gangster, and I'm country (and I'm what? Yeah)
Ooh, trick a country boy, sell that pussy nothin' (sell 'em nothin') 
East Atlanta, man, we take shit, we make this money (we make this money, nigga)
Niggas trap, niggas rob (yeah), niggas doin' somethin' (doin' somethin') 
Can't be broke, they gon' laugh, you not gettin' no money (you not gettin' no money)

Stack your cash, you gon' last 
Ain't no ho you can't smash (ain't no ho you can't smash)
And your opps, you know they broke 
They not gettin' no cash (they not gettin' no cash, nigga)
And them opps, they know they broke 
They not gettin' no cash (they not gettin' no cash)
They be scared, nigga, stay in the house 
'Fore I drop some on your ass ('fore I drop some on your ass)
I got them young niggas poppin' out
They ready to toe-tag (they ready to toe-tag)
We in the club, we stomp shit out
That's how we on they ass (that's how we on they ass)
They see me in person, they hush they mouth 
With they lil' scary ass (with they lil' scary ass) 
(Yo, Pierre, you wanna come out here?)
Fuck, hahahahaha, yeah

Ooh-wee, we still on the Front Street (Front Street) 
Still put niggas on plate, turn 'em to some lunch meat (lunch meat)
Yeah, and I got them racks these hoes still wanna hunch me (wanna hunch me, phew) 
Said they love my lingo, gangster, and I'm country (and I'm what? Yeah)
Ooh, trick a country boy, sell that pussy nothin' (sell 'em nothin') 
East Atlanta, man, we take shit, we make this money (we make this money, nigga)
Niggas trap, niggas rob (yeah), niggas doin' somethin' (doin' somethin') 
Can't be broke, they gon' laugh, you not gettin' no money (you not gettin' no money)
