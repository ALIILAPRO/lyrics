		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Water gray
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere
Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothin' to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothin' to you
The little things give you away
But there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under ground now
Now I
Now I do

(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
(Oh)

Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away

All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)
