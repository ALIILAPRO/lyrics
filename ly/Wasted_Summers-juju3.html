		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm spending my summertime
Half the time crying again
Had the blues over you
I didn't hang with my friends
You fake cry, that's a lie
Tell me, was it all pretend?
In my head, in my head

You're needing all the time again
Our time again
Needing the time again
Our time again
Wasting our time again
Our time again
We don't have nothing to say
So we have nothing left

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la

I wasted like half of my summer
Tryna hold on your hand
You're the leech, I'm the man
I guess you don't understand
Holding hands, say I can't
You're telling me yes I can
Yes I can, yes I can
I wasted like half of my summer
Tryna hold on your hand
You're the leech, I'm the man
I guess you don't understand
Holding hands, say I can't
You're telling me yes I can
Yes I can, yes I can

You're needing all the time again
Our time again
Needing the time again
Our time again
Wasting our time again
Our time again
We don't have nothing to say
So we have nothing left
