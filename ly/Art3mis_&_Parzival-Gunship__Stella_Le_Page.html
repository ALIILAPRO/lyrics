		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lights go out over my town
Back to the midnight oasis with you
Saving the world, that's tough but let's give it a shot
'Til you tell me game over
Feel this chaotic connection with you
The world outside is overrated
Better hanging with you all night

When we're fighting the same fight
Dreaming the same dreams tonight
You know I won't go letting you down

There's a mountain of fire
I will meet you there
Into the dark, I'm coming home
Through the mountain of fire
With glass eyes and digital water
Through the shadows, I'm coming home

We're all gonna die that's just how it is
There's no escaping the future
Nobody gets what they want in this world
Even for you and me
Never felt at home in reality
Always hide behind avatars

But we're fighting the same fight
Dreaming the same dreams tonight
And you see I won't be letting you down

There's a mountain of fire
I will meet you there
Into the dark, I'm coming home
Through the mountain of fire
With glass eyes and digital water
Through the shadows, I'm coming home

Where did the time go?
It's light at my window
What we did with it, who knows
Guess the time flies when we spend each night together
Guess the time flies when we spend each night together

There's a mountain of fire
I will meet you there
Into the dark, I'm coming home
Through the mountain of fire
With glass eyes and digital water
Through the shadows, I'm coming home

We'll float all the way
We'll burn it all the way
We'll float all the way
Through the shadows, I'm coming home
