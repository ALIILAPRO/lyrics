		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize
The joke is on me, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (trouble) 
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
So shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh)
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (trouble)
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
