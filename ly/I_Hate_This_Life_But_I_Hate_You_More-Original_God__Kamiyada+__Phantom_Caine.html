		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end

I hate this life, oh, no, no, no
I hate this life
But I hate you more
Nothing leads to nothing
Let it it all go
I hate this life, but I hate you more
Nothing
Leads to nothing

Hate me if you dare
Falling and I don't care
I've been far away
From you
For so long so long
I've been trying to find a way
But it's so hard to escape
I've been trying to get to you
But I can't break my way trought

I hate this life
But I hate you more
Nothing leads to nothing
Let it all go, oh
I hate this life
But I hate you more
Nothing leads to nothing

I don't want to live my life
You don't want to pay that price
You don't want to tell me shit
I want to go all night
But I don't want to cut my wrists
Yeah, tell me where you want to go
I can take you to places you know
We can go wherever you want
Diamonds keep on dancing like vro
You don't want to talk like me
They just wanna be like me
They just wanna behave like me
I don't want to be here, you know
I don't want to do this, no
I don't even want my life
Take my soul
Tonight
