		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait another minute 
Can't you see what this pain has fucking done to me 
I'm alive and still kickin' 
What you see I can't see and maybe
You'll think before you speak 

I'm alive for you 
I'm awake because of you 
I'm alive I told you 
I'm awake swallowing you

Take another second 
Turn your back on me and make believe that
You're always happy 
It's safe to say you're never alive 
A big part of you has died
And by the way, I hope you're satisfied 

I'm alive for you 
I'm awake because of you 
I'm alive I told you 
I'm awake swallowing you

I'm alive for you 
I'm awake because of you 
I'm alive I told you 
I'm awake

Tearing it back unveiling me 
Taking a step back so I can breathe 
Hear the silence about to break 
Fear resistance when I'm awake 

Tearing it back unveiling me 
Taking a step back so I can breathe 
Hear the silence about to break 
Fear resistance when I'm awake 

I'm alive for you 
I'm awake because of you 
I'm alive I told you 
I'm awake swallowing you

I'm alive for you 
I'm awake because of you 
I'm alive I told you 
I'm awake swallowing you
