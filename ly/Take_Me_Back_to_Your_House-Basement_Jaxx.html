		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's all alone
Everybody's had enough
It's gettin' ugly
I'm so tired, so tired, so tired
So take me home

It's gettin' late in here
Come in and wait for me
Let's get out of this
Place it never changes
It just stays the same
Take me home

Come on, let's go
I just want to run away
Out of here
I just gotta get out of here
Up out of here
I just want to run away
I'm done with this
Grab your coat
Just take me, take me

Just take me back to your house
Take me back to your house
Your house
Just take me there
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Just take me back to your house
Take me back to your house
Your house
Just take me there

Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Just put a record on
Make it a country song
Come on, make a drink for me
Let's sing along
The song's for vacant hearts

Let's stop all the talk
Let's take it easy now
We don't have to worry 'bout anything at all
Until the dawn
Just take me on
Come on, let's go

I just want to run away
Out of here
I just gotta get out of her
Up out of here
I just want to run away
I'm done with this
Grab your coat
Just take me, take me

Just take me back to your house
Take me back to your house
Your house
Come on
Just take me there
Don't wanna go home al alone
No, no, no, no

Just take me back to your house
Your house, your house
Come on, take me back to your house
Your house
Just take me there
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Take the keys to me car
Let's drive

I'm lonely
So lonely
Can I come home with you?
My head is spinning circles, think I need a rescue
All I know, well, I just feel like chilling with you
I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you

Just take me back to your house
Your house, your house
Come on, take me back to your house
Your house
Just take me there
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Don't you wanna get out, get out, get out

Take the keys to me car
Let's drive

I'm lonely
So lonely
Can I come home with you?
My head is spinning circles, think I need a rescue
All I know, well, I just feel like chilling with you

Like ice melting in the stream
I can't hold on to all I used to be
A better man would understand
With you...
