		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They fall in line, one at a time, ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)
No time to lose, we've got to move, steady your hand
(I am losing sight again)

Fire your guns, it's time to run, blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off, show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

There's nothing left, so save your breath, lying in wait
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown, nowhere to go, holding your fate
(Lonely, I will walk alone)

Fire your guns, it's time to run, blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off, show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

Wanted it back
Don't fight me now
Here it comes
Die

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all
