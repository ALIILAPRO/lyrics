		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who is it?
Some guy
Come to the dark side, we have candy
Yes but do you have coffee?
Sure we have coffee, how do you take it?
Black, like my soul

He likes his coffee black like his soul
He drinks it scorching hot like a fucking psycho
He like coffee a lot
And he like his coffee now
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on

Bang, mother, fucker! Bang!)
Yaa, it's a [?]
(Don't [?])
Kick you in the mother fuckin poes make you blackout
(Celebrity fuck point rap is [?])
Yaa, [?]
(Step the fuck back you whack motherfucker)
Like Kanye Kardashian, yo
I like rats and coffee and weed and sing whatever the fuck I want to the beat
(And I like Yachts and money and speed and drivin' like a poes down the motherfuckin' street 
And all I wanna do is zoom zoom zoom)
Bass pump in the trunk boom boom boom
(Pitch-black windows)
You wanna see me but you can't
Sippin' on champange
(Puffin' on a blunt)

So, how do you feel now that you have your new dark powers?
(Aah, feel pretty good, not eh, not scared at all, that just feel kind of, I feel kind of invincible)

(I non-stop motherfucker
I'm too ill to chill)
Too dope to cope
(Too lit to quit)
You fuck with peanut butter and jelly
She talks shit
My foot kicks your ass
(My fists split your lip)
My mommy she shut me up with duct tape
Now I get paid for talking all day
(Fuck [?])
Aw fucks sakes, who ate my last cupcake?
(I love coffee but not a fuck, when I drink Starbucks, cause Starbucks sucks)
Yaa, daai shit doos is kak
([?])
Fok it, i can't think, I need more coffee
(No more milk or sugar because)

He likes his coffee black like his soul
He drinks it scorching hot like a fucking psycho
He like coffee a lot
And he like his coffee now
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on

But sometimes I get sad and I cut myself...
A piece of cake
(Yeah)

Yo cuz, I get the mother fuckin' munchiessssssss
Oh mother fucker I need some one to eattttttttttttt
Flesh so yummy, bones so nice and crunchyyyyyyyy
Hehehe I dare you to fuck with meeeee
Aah, aren't you just such a cute little lollipop?
*pop* Triple dipped in psycho
