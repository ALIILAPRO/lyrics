		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found some bullets in my pocket
But I ain't got no gun (got no gun)
I wanna use it, but no manual
I ain't even got no target (got no target)
My family doesn't know me deep down
Sometimes I don't need them (I don't need them)
The scar on my face is not that big
So they underrate it (underrate it)

(Wah) kids are laughing outside
But it's not a long time
Usually, it turns into a scream at the night
And breathe out in my bed (bed)
Now, panic is my friend (friend)
Usually, it makes me hear a lotta crying

Hands so light at this night like a vampire
I'm fine, mom, do not knock
Here's a fight, angel versus devil
I don't stand on any side

Bleeding on the floor, I just found a bullet
Why is it here, am I shot?
Here's nobody in this room, then who did?
I mean, did I just shoot myself?
How did I use it, I didn't have a gun
Am I dying now? I was 'bout to have some fun, but
Bleeding on the floor, I just found a bullet
Why is it here, am I shot?

I can make different types of me, I'm a manufacturer
I can close my mouth all day for the people like a statue
I'm a pro killer to me, but disguised as an amateur
I'm a pro actor, my acting skill has a broad spectrum

Oh, hello, little kitty (kitty)
I'm talkin' to the ceiling (ceiling)
Well, do I look like silly? (Silly)
Sometimes I miss Vicky
I'm not sure 'bout this feelin, I hate bedtime
Maybe moonlight has a bad power

Hands so light at this night like a vampire
I'm fine, mom, do not knock
Here's a fight, angel versus devil
I don't stand on any side

Bleeding on the floor, I just found a bullet
Why is it here, am I shot?
Here's nobody in this room, then who did?
I mean, did I just shoot myself?
How did I use it, I didn't have a gun
Am I dying now? I was 'bout to have some fun, but
Bleeding on the floor, I just found a bullet
Why is it here, am I shot?
