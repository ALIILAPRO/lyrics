		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretender, what you are
Mirror in the fog
Watch it wearing off
Talk, all you do is talk
Everything's a front
It's funny 'til it's not

Do do do
Do do do
Do do do

Pretender, what you are
Do you see yourself at all?
Is your heart so out of touch?
You always swear you're gone
Sayin' that you've had enough
But your feet are stuck
Why you always in the mud?
What the fuck is your problem?

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

I microdose my constant need
To give myself false hope
The fake I've come to know, I need
My tears turn into gold
And I'm pretending that it's worth it all
I'm the pretender (I'm the pretender)

Yeah yeah yeah (pretender)
Yeah yeah yeah (pretender)
Yeah yeah yeah (pretender)
Yeah yeah yeah

Pretender, what you are
Do you see yourself at all?
Is your heart so out of touch? (yeah yeah yeah)
You always swear you're gone
Sayin' that you've had enough
But your feet are stuck
Why you always in the mud?
What the fuck is your problem?

Pretender what you are
Mirror in the fog
Watch it wearing off

Do do do
Do do do
Do do do
