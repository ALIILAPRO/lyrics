		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I had to clear up my head 
But tonight, I think I lost the plot instead
I said that I'd be cleared out by three
To the walls, I know they listen to me
The teachers always called it a shame
They say I don't have passion the same
As I did a few years before
They don't see the light there anymore

They call it sad, but they're the outside lookin' in
I mean they can't understand when they all cope with everything
And when I opened my heart, in front of my friends, finally
It was not what I thought, 'cause they're not there anymore

I called my dad, he told me, "There's no room for me"
Down at the house that we had when we were living as a three
Now that my family's gone, almost as far as I can see
I think they love me I'm sure, but they're not there anymore (hey)
(Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah)
Where can I sleep tonight?
(Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah)

I'm breakin' them in half, they always say
I never wanted them to end this way
And now I have to gather all my things
They don't know the problems that I bring

They call it sad, but they're the outside lookin' in
I mean they can't understand when they all cope with everything
And when I opened my heart, in front of my friends, finally
It was not what I thought, 'cause they're not there anymore
