		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got a great car
Yeah, what's wrong with it today?
I used to have one too
Baby, oh, come and have a look
I really love your hairdo, yeah
I'm glad you like mine too
See we're lookin' pretty cool
Look at ya

So, what do you do?
Oh, yeah, I wait tables too
No, I haven't heard your band
'Cause you guys are pretty new
But if you dig
On vegan food
Well, come over to my work
I'll have 'em cook you something 
That you'll really love

'Cause I like you
Yeah, I like you
And I'm feelin' so bohemian like you
Yeah, I like you
Yeah, I like you
And I feel, whoa, woo

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Wait, who's that guy?
Just hangin' at your pad
He's lookin' kinda (bummed)
Yeah, you broke up that's too bad
I guess it's fair
If he always pays the rent
And he doesn't get bent
About sleepin' on the couch when I'm there

'Cause I like you
Yeah, I like you
And I'm feelin' so bohemian like you
Yeah, I like you
Yeah, I like you
And I feel, whoa, woo

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm getting wise and I'm feelin' so bohemian like you
It's you that I want, so please
Just a casual, casual easy thing
Is it? It is for me
And I like you
Yeah, I like you
And I like you, I like you, I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you
And I feel whoa, woo

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
