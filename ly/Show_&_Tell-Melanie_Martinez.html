		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You pull me by my hair so I don't go nowhere
Tell me you love me, but you treat me like I'm never there
You say the cruelest words, and yes, they break my heart
'Cause I'm over here working my ass off

Why is it so hard to see? (Why?)
If I cut myself, I would bleed (ouch)
I'm just like you, you're like me
Imperfect and human are we

Show and tell
I'm on display for all you fuckers to see
Show and tell
Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me
Buy and sell (buy and sell me, baby)
Like I'm a product to society
Art don't sell
Unless you fucked every authority

You beg and cry for more, and yet I'm on the floor
There are strangers takin' pictures of me when I ask "No more"
It's really hard for me to say just how I feel
I'm scared that I'll get thrown away like a banana peel

Why is it so hard to see? (Why?)
If I cut myself, I would bleed (kill me)
I'm just like you, you're like me
Imperfect and human are we

Show and tell (show and tell)
I'm on display for all you fuckers to see (fuckers to see)
Show and tell (show and tell)
Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me
Buy and sell (buy and sell)
Like I'm a product to society
Art don't sell
Unless you fucked every authority

Show and tell, ah-ah-ah-ah
Why can't you fucking hear me?
Show and tell, um
Are you listening yet?

Show and tell (show and tell, baby)
I'm on display for all you fuckers to see (fuckers to see)
Show and tell (oh)
Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me
Buy and sell
Like I'm a product to society
Art don't sell
Unless you fucked every authority
