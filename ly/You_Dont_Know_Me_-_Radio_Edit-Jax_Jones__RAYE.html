		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho-, ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me
(What you, what you gon' do?)

Oh, yeah, time is money so don't fuck with mine
See I'm out with my girls, I'ma have a good time
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, ah

See, I can't get too much of a good thing, mmm
That's why I'm here dressed up in the finest things, whoa
Please hold your tongue, don't say a damn thing, mmm

See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Nah, thanks for askin'"

Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho-, ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho-, ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

I mean, we can throw shapes together
But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah

Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back, uh
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

See, I can't get too much of a good thing, mmm
That's why I'm here dressed up in the finest things, whoa
Please hold your tongue, don't say a damn thing, mmm

See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Nah, thanks for askin'"

Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho-, ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho-, ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

Come 'round here, just know though
Won't get what you want, what you want, what you want, want
Tell you what you don't know
I get what I want, what I want, what I want, want

See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Nah, thanks for askin'"

Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho-, ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

You don't know me, fuck yeah
