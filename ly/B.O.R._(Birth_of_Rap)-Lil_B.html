		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while lil B, Based God

King of rap, I can bet my money on that
Can't face the facts that a
Young guy killin' shit
Give me another shot and I'mma
Come with my mask on
Seen a lot of growth since I
Came with the Vans song
Now it's '09 and I'm runnin'
With the Based God
Fire in my eyes, mix my soul with the napalm
Mix and master, all I need is dro and one mic
One pad, one pen, iPod, dim lights
Feelin' like a plane when it's
Up and it's in flight
Dressing everyday like I'm dead
With the pinstripe
This a few things that show
That I'm the rawest
Spending cash everyday so I'm
Ballin like Spalding want beef
Like six Iâ€™ll have you baldin' like Baldwin
Your favorite rapper out
I'mma lay 'em in a coffin
No talkin' when I'm talkin'
Cause it's legend, pay attention
Only time I sat in class was
When I'm serving a detention
I fuck with Soulja Boy, get money nigga
Everytime I see rappers, all I'm thinking
"I'ma get him"
In the booth or in the streets
I'm known to tear and rip 'em
Fifteen and sixteen
Eyes breaking down the system
Nobody can tell me nothing
I was living off my system head fucked up
I thought it would be cool to go to prison
Watching Hot Boyz on BET
Getting all these women
So I got my gold grill because
I'm thugged out with 'em
B Town, Waterfront, and I put on for my city
We done did it for six years
Just reached twenty a lot of dudes I grew
Up with didn't see twenty
Everytime I have a birthday, I'm thinking
"God love me" everytime I hit the beat, man
I do it for my Mom workin' hard every day
I'mma make it where it's mine
I'mma hustle all the time, like Lil Wayne do
If you up against me
You get ate like grapefruit
My first reaction was like
Just chill and stay cool
The rap game is slow, and it just ain't cool
Always jocking on my style and
It just ain't you
Only time I feel you is if a based boy do
Because I'm a rap god and a based boy, too
I can listen to the hate and
Put the volume on mute
So the only thing I hear is
The horses in the coupe
And when the roof go down
It reminds me of my chick
Getting money off the floor because
I'm trapping like a bitch
Like Gucci Mane said
But it's rich nigga clique
And my name is Lil B
You can call me "king of rap"
I done did a few things
And I'm never going back
Mirror mirror on the wall, shit
I'm askin' who the man is
Lil B for "Lil Boss
" I'm prayin to my canvas
I deserve the crown because I'm
Speakin for the masses and I'm into weed
I'm gettin chiefy like Kansas
Word to the wise
You should fear the competition
Because I'm the only vet that's
A Based God spittin
And you ain't in the game until
You make a thousand songs
And you dyin' for this rap
'cause it's the only thing you love

Birth of Rap birth of Rap
