		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watch you
Across the room
His arms all around you
That black skirt
Your brown hair
Just hiding eyes that don't care
Ooh
And you look at me, and I know
Think about
You think about it girl
And I
There's just one thing that I can't let go
Even though
You're my best friend's girl
We'd be hitting it high
We'd be hitting it low
We'd be hitting it every way
You want me to
I'd be doing you right
I'd be doing you wrong
We'd be doing it every day, love
All night long, all night long
The secrets, for so long
Believe me, I
I know it's wrong
It's stranger than fiction
That my best friend's girl
Is my addiction
Ooh
And then I look at you, and you know
I think about,
Think about it, girl
And you
There's just one thing that I can't let go
Even though
You're my best friend's girl
We'd be hitting it high
We'd be hitting it low
We'd be hitting it every way
You want me to
I'd be doing you right
I'd be doing you wrong
We'd be doing it every day, love
All night long, all night long
We be hitting it high
We be hitting it low
We be hitting it every way
You want me to
I been doing you right, girl
I been doing you wrong
We been doing it every day, love
All night long, all night long
Ooh
We be hitting it every way
You want me to
I been doing you right
I been doing you wrong
Ooh
