		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of them
Dreaming strange inventions in the shade
Thirty mile-an-hour domestic winds
Blow away my nice domestic things
The ground is full of improbable vegetations
Black and heavy branches cut the sky
Mechanisms work behind my eyes

What a mystery (mystery)
That I could want you still
It's a mystery (mystery)
That I would pick you ten out of nine times

The water's cold
All the red fish leave my feet alone
Crush of people walk along the street
The perfume they wear smells good to me

And what a mystery (mystery)
That I could want you still
It's a mystery (mystery)
That I would pick you ten out of nine times
