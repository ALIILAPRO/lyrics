		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I'm driving in the night
Everybody wanna be me
But they ain't doin it right
Yeah they always talk shit
But they ain't goin to fight
Yeah that's right, yeah that's right
Hit that right, hit that right
Yeah, I look at you
You look at me
I ain't been around since like 83
You're in my head, a memory
You go leaving me
Ending up in misery
Yeah I'm looking at the stars
Everything you said
I'm gon keep it in my heart
Why you praying on my life to fall apart?
In my brain?
Yeah I wish I could restart
In my brain?
Yeah I wish I could restart
