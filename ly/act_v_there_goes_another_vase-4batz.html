		  Play that shit

I'm startin' to think that we the same
'Cause each lil' argument we sayin' evil things (the evil things)
I'm startin' to think that you done changed
But you gon' turn around and throw another vase (another vase)
You damn near hit me in my face
But if I punch on you, then I'ma get a case (can't get a case)
But girl, I love you anyway, despite that dumb-ass shit you say
Hopefully, this make you think

Girl, you know that she's so toxic (yeah, yeah)
Thought we was good, why you blocked me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You tell your friends why you love me (yeah, yeah)
They won't understand 'cause you're perfect for me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, you know that she's so toxic (yeah, yeah)
Thought we was good, why you blocked me? (Yeah)
You tell your friends why you love me (yeah, yeah)
They won't understand 'cause you're perfect for me (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm startin' to think that you my baby
I'm startin' to think that that's the reason God had made you ('cause you're my lil' baby)
And I can tell when you are playin'
Because you love to laugh whenever you get angry
(Girl, why you playin'?)
We up and down, but you my angel
And I'ma kill if these lil' niggas try to take you
(I won't let 'em take you)
I'll send a nigga to his maker
If they gon' play with my lil' baby, clutchin' on my lil' .80

Girl, you know that she's so toxic (yeah, yeah)
Thought we was good, why you blocked me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You tell your friends why you love me (yeah, yeah)
They won't understand 'cause you're perfect for me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, you know that she's so toxic (yeah, yeah)
Thought we was good, why you blocked me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You tell your friends why you love me (yeah, yeah)
They won't understand 'cause you're perfect for me (yeah, yeah)

I'm startin' to think that we the same
'Cause each lil' argument we sayin' evil things (the evil things)
I'm startin' to think that you done changed
But you gon' turn around and throw another vase (another vase)
