		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that we're through
the hell with you
We don't mind
We just give it a sigh

We hardly knew
what you were capable 
of doing
But why don't you give it a try

Oh, you learn about it
Oh, you harvest (untill you can make no more)
All that's eating inside
All that's eating inside

We hardly knew
what you were capable 
of doing
But why don't you give it a try

Oh, you learn about it
Oh, you harvest (until you can make no more)
All that's eating inside 
All that's eating inside

Can't take no more..

Oh, you learn about it
Oh, you harvest (untill you can make no more)
All that's eating inside 
All that's eating inside

Can't take no more..
