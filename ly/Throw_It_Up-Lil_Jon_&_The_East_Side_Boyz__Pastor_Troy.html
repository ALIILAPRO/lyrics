		  [Chorus]
Throw it up Mother fucker throw it up [Repeat: x4]
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club [Repeat: x4]

[Lil Jon (Eastside Boyz)]
Back up bitch get the fuck out my way [Repeat: x2]
(Aye move the fuck back bitch, Move the fuck back)

What you looking at nigga, what you looking at nigga [Repeat: x2]
(Not me or my click, we too trill my nigga)

We to deep off in this bitch, we too deep off in this bitch [Repeat: x4]
(Its more of us than it is in the club stupid bitch)

Y'all niggas over there (y'all niggas ain't shit)
Y'all hoes over there (y'all hoes ain't shit)

We run this (what)

[Chorus]

[Pastor Troy]
The last nigga is the pastor
Ready to blast ya
You know, I don't play no mother fucking games
DSGB you know the name
Wood grain in the mother fucking Dooley Truck
Got the black and red seats with the Georgia tuft
And I got my helmet hanging out the winda
Ready to bust the head, of a fucking pretender
Nigga as soon as I enter
You know I'm making noise
Pastor Troy and the Eastside Boyz
AK busting I ride the whole clip
I cock that hoe and let it mother fuckin rip
To sank shit is what I live for
Fuck him, Fuck her
I'm representing 
Put some more Yak in my mug
So I can throw it up

[Chorus]

[Lil Jon]
Ok ok hold the fuck up hold the fuck up
I'm looking round this bitch 
I see a lot of niggas ain't throwin up shit (What)
Ya'll niggas must be scared to represent yo shit (You scared)
You must be scared nigga (Scared)
Fuck that shit
All my real niggas that proud of they hood
All my real ladies that's proud of they hood
And they ain't never been scared 
Say this shit

[Repeat: x4]
Bitch I ain't scared 
Bitch I ain't scared 
Bitch I ain't scared 
I ain't scared mother fucker

[Pastor Troy]
I'm goin' represent where I'm from
In the back of the club my Tommy gun
Though when I chill
Fucking burn one
Leave up out the club it's me little Jon
Balling in the Benzes
Switching up lanes
Talking much shit cause we deep in the game cocaine 
All white fucking S fucking six
Young ass niggas I guess we filthy rich
My whole click ready to bust some heads
I'ma throw it up bitch and I ain't scared
Pastor Troy mother fucker 
You know the routine 
Represent for the home team
Throw it up

[Chorus]
