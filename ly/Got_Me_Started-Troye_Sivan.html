		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's got the personality, not even gravity could ever hold him down
He's got the sexuality of a man who can take a room and drown it out
Yeah

Inching closer to sunrise
Now we're standin' eye to eye
I wanna tell you what's on my
On my mind (let's go)

You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby

Yeah, yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe

We've got that hot chemistry, yeah, you and me won't make it out this house
We should experiment even to the detriment of whoever's on the couch (oh, yeah)

Inchin' closer to sunrise
Now we're layin' side by side
I wanna tell you what's on my-
On my mind

You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby

Yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe
Oh, baby, baby

Boy, can I be honest?
Boy, can I be honest?
Yeah
We got something to give each other
You just, you just, you just, you just (yeah)

You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright? (Alright?)
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby (yeah)

(Oh, baby, baby)
(Oh, baby, baby)
(Oh, baby, baby)
(Oh, baby, baby)
We got something to give each other
