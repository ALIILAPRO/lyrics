		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

It must be more than I need you
More than I love you
Be more than wishes on stars
High above you

If words could just hold you
Tell me you feel me
Oh, just to know you
Tell me you see me
I couldn't have said it
You must have just read it
In my eyes
Darling, please

Let it be more
Be more
Be more

It must be more than I want you
More than I caught you
Be more than dancing in rain drops
Falling to touch you
Oh, just to touch you, oh-oh

If words could just hold you
Tell me you feel me
Oh, just to know you
Tell me you see me, yeah
I couldn't have said it
You must have just read it
In my eyes

Let it be more
Be more
Be more
Darling, be more
Be more
Be more

If words could just hold you
Tell me you feel me
Oh, just to know you
Tell me you see me
I couldn't have said it
You must have just read it
In my eyes
Darling, please

Let it be more
