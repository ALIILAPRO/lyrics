		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't suffer, be broken, get tired, or wasted
Surrender to nothing, I'll give up what I
Started and stop this, from end to beginning
A new day is calling, and I am finally free
Fight!

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away, now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll a, whoa!

I would have kept you, forever, what we had to sever
It ended for both of us, faster than a
Kill off this thinking; it's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now, and without you I can finally see
Fight!

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away, now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll a, whoa!

Your promises, they look like lies
Your honesty, like a back that hides a knife (knife)
I promise you (promise you)
I promise you (promise you)
And I am finally free

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away, now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll attack, I will attack

Run away, I'll attack, I will attack
Run away, I'll attack, I will attack
Run away, I'll attack, I will attack
Run away, I'll attack, I'll attack, I'll a, whoa!

Your promises
(Promises, promises)
I promise you
(Promise you)
I promise you
(Promise you, promise you)
