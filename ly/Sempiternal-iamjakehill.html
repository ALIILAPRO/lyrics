		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya, sometimes I be overthinking
'Bout the future try not to worry about it
Any doubts try set it beside me
I gotta bounce got to get it away
Maybe to the bay in the waves
When I sway what a day it'll be
When I finally make peace with my enemies
When I finally set the
Keys on the centerpiece
Got to calm down a bit i've been down a bit
But I bounce back i like the sound of that
Summer '18, bout to break free
All this up and down that is what made me
Chase safety not under oath
But would never tell a lie
I'm ghost I'm a no-show
When they come to do or die gotta go go
Got a roller by my side yeah I hope so
They say they want me to
Die that's a low blow like oh no nah
Why so many people evil
Why the fuck I even give a shit
About what they say when I'm out
On my day get up out my way
I'm bound to break your face face it
I don't ever want to be basic
Dreams imma chase them
Imma just be patiently waiting aching
Till I fade it's a daze
I won't care bout what they say

I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway
I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway

Imma do just what I want to do
If you rolling with me take it to infinity
Sempiternally we’ve been the affinity
Hit em internally I bet they
Ain’t a concern to me
When I pull up to the city
Put the pedal to the concrete
Hold up wait a minute no one
Ever going to stop me
Come up with the vengeance yeah
I'm feeling kind of cocky
Running from the fences imma pull
Up with an army come in with the heat they
Will never disarm me
I've been putting work in
When the verse ends when we certain that I
Hurt like you sometimes
In the confines of my room no sunshine
I just got to unwind till the sunrise
These days I cope with sentences
I will never lose hope cuz this is it
I just got to stay focused in the mix
Closing in and I've broken in the grips

I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway
I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway

I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway
I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway

I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway
I won't care about what
Nobody else wanna say
Imma do just what I wanna do anyway
