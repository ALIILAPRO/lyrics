		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Perhaps your life before was the bad dream
Who can recall?
Madness is
After all
A fog
Swallow
The blood
Of who you kill
Nauseous
Nauseous
(Nauseous
Nauseous)
How could I be anything but disgusted with myself
How could I breathe with your hands around my throat
Putrid
Putrid
Useless
Useless
I am the same
Of what you were
Of what you are
We are the same
I am the saint
Bringer of fate
We can't help it
We can't help it
I am the blood
(I am the)
Bringer of fate
Light
Light
Light
Like a storm
But like the rain
Only gentle
Like dripping water
