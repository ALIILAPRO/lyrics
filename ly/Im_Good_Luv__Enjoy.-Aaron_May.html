		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy, ayy
Look, ayy, look, okay, look

I ain't got the time for you, oh no, oh no
Get up out my face
I ain't got a dime for you, oh no, oh no
Bitch, I'm getting paid
She say, "I'll ride for you" no no, no no
Stay inside your lane
She say, "I'll die for you" oh no, oh no
Baby, I'm okay
I ain't got the time for you, oh no, oh no
Get up out my face
I ain't got a dime for you, oh no, oh no
Bitch, I'm getting paid
She say, "I'll ride for you" oh no, no no
Stay inside your lane
She say, "I'll die for you"
(yeah, look, okay) baby, I'm okay, I'm okay

I remember last December
None of these bitches was fucking with me
Now I'm the center, shit getting better
Every last one of them fucking for free
I never met her, but I got cheddar
You won't believe what she been telling me
Shawty gon' front like she been feeling me
Shit they be talking, it's been killing me
Like baby don't play no games
We don't hang like that (Like that)
Tell me what is you saying?
With my name like that (Like that)
Said I'm not in your lane
How you change like that? (Like that)
If I lose all this fame
You gon' change right back (Right)
These hoes came so quick ain't on shit
These hoes just ain't on shit
(Y'all ain't)
If I shoot my shot, I ain't gon' miss
I swear I ain't gon' brick
But you can't get in my head, no (Oh no)
You can't get in my bed, no (No no)
Know you heard what I said, ho (I know)
I know you heard what I said

I ain't got the time for you, oh no, oh no
Get up out my face
I ain't got a dime for you, oh no, oh no
Bitch, I'm getting paid
She say, "I'll ride for you" no no, no no
Stay inside your lane
She say, "I'll die for you" oh no, oh no
Baby, I'm okay
I ain't got the time for you, oh no, oh no
Get up out my face
I ain't got a dime for you, oh no, oh no
Bitch, I'm getting paid
She say, "I'll ride for you" oh no, no no
Stay inside your lane
She say, "I'll die for you" (yeah, yeah)
Baby, I'm okay, I'm okay

I'm good, love, enjoy
