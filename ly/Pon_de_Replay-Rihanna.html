		  Come, Mr. DJ, song pon di replay
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?
All di gyal pon di dance floor wantin' some more, what?
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?
Come, Mr. DJ, song pon di replay
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?
All di gyal pon di dance floor wantin' some more, what?
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?

It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on di floor let me show you how we do
Let's go, dip it low, then you bring it up slow
Whine it up one time, whine it back once more

Come run, run, run, run
Everybody move, run
Lemme see you move and rock it 'til di groove done
Shake it 'til di moon becomes di sun (sun)
Everybody in di club, give me a run (run)
If you ready to move, say it (yeah)
One time for your mind, say it (yeah, yeah)
Well, I'm ready for ya
Come let me show ya
You want to groove, I'ma show you how to move
Come, come

Come, Mr. DJ, song pon di replay
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?
All di gyal pon di dance floor wantin' some more, what?
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?
Come, Mr. DJ, song pon di replay
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?
All di gyal pon di dance floor wantin' some more, what?
Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn di music up?

Hey, Mr.

Turn the music up
Hey, Mr.
Hey, Mr.

It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody in di club gon' be rockin' when I'm through
Let di bass from di speakers run through ya sneakers
Move both ya feet and run to di beat 

Come run, run, run, run
Everybody move, run
Lemme see you move and rock it 'til di groove done
Shake it 'til di moon becomes di sun (sun)
Everybody in di club give me a run (run)
If you ready to move, say it (yeah)
One time for your mind, say it (yeah, yeah)
Well, I'm ready for ya
Come let me show ya
You want to groove, I'ma show you how to move
