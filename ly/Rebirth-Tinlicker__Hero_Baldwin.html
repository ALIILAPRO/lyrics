		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ever wonder why the kindest get the roughest ride?
Or how the toughest ones don't share the thing they feel inside?
You laugh the loudest, sink the lowest we don't notice right?
As long as someone's laughing that'll keep keep the joke alive

We had so many dreams, I guess we planned to live a life
Somehow we all ended working up a 9-5
If you don't fight to make it work, you only run away
If you can't face it, man, it hits you like a tidal wave

Those thoughts in your head
Might tell you you're not ready
Is that what you heard?
That life is lonely?
You should know
You've always been ready
The highs and the lows
Are better with somebody

Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love

Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love
Keep falling in love

Those thoughts in your head
Might tell you you're not ready
Is that what you heard?
That life is lonely?
You should know
You've always been ready
The highs and the lows
Are better with somebody
