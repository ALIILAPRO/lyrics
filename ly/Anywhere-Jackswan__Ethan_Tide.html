		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever since you're gone I can't find myself
The streets they leave me lost up in the am
I don't wanna lie, yeah I need a friend
Wonder if you're happy, wherever you are
And if you'd ever go back to how it was
I can't take the thought of you when I'm all alone
Cause I have had a feeling
The universe was on our side
I guess I have been dreaming
Cause whatever it was wasn't
Enough, it keeps me up all night, keeps me wondering
Everything we've lost, all that could've been
Oh, know I would've followed you anywhere
They say that I will heal but this time I can't
We used to be young and wild and free
I used to think it was meant to be
You used up all your air to breathe
And nothing can compare to your energy
No love can fill the void in me
If I'll get out alive we'll see
Cause I've had a feeling
The universe was on our side
I guess I have been dreaming
Cause whatever it was wasn't
Enough, it keeps me up all night, keeps me wondering
Everything we've lost, all that could've been
Oh, know I would've followed you anywhere
They say that I will heal but this time I can't
