		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I know there's been times when I wished I would die
But I swear yeah I swear oh I swear I'm past that
And I'll swear if you will that I will not look back
Yeah I swear if you will that I will not look back

Take a deep breath now, pass the shallows
Stay steady and hold on, through the darkness we all know

And I swear yeah I swear yeah I swear if you will 
To hold onto life, yeah I'll hold on if you will

So on to the ocean and into the sea, so balanced 
And calm now, that's where I will be
So on to the ocean and into the sea wash away 
All my problems wash away memories

Back then always through the shattered glass
I stared at my life, and oh I wished I would die
But I swear yeah I swear oh I swear I'm past that 
Is this all what it seems I can't believe that I made it
Take a deep breath now, pass the shallows
Stay steady and hold on, through the darkness we all know 
And I swear yeah I swear yeah I 
Swear if you will, to hold onto life
Yeah I'll hold on if you will

So on to the ocean and into the sea, so balanced 
And n to the ocean and into the sea wash away 
All calm now, that's where I will be
So omy problems wash away memories

Take a deep breath now, pass the shallows
Stay steady and hold on, through the darkness we all know

And I swear yeah I swear yeah I swear if you will
To hold onto life, yeah I'll hold on if you will

So on to the ocean and into the sea, so balanced 
And calm now, that's where I will be
So on to the ocean and into the sea wash away 
All my problems wash away memories
