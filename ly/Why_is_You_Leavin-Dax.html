		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I tell you that I love you
Promise that I really mean it
Ain't nobody else above you
I don't even know the meanin'
You the only one I'm dreamin'
You the only one I'm fienin'
I don't need nobody else so baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
Baby girl why is u leavin'? Baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
Baby girl why is u leavin'? Baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
I don't want nobody else so baby
Girl why is you leavin'?

Why you leaving me?
Baby girl why did you have
To change the scenery? Why you mean to me?
You a bitch and you done treat me like a dog
So you gon' have to see the G in me, G in me
G-G-G in me
A B C D E F G, I'm out for all that creatine
I remember when you cheated man
I seen it vividly
I'm about to kill your shit
Expose you on the TV screen
I'm talking 'bout that TMZ, you gon' hate me
Can't believe I used to put
Up with your crazy
Almost tricked me into have a couple baby
Just so you could eat off of
My money and go crazy-azy
You like Eminem shady (shady)
You were never my lady (my lady)
I won't let that shit faze, won't faze me

If I tell you that I love you
Promise that I really mean it
Ain't nobody else above you
I don't even know the meanin'
You the only one I'm dreamin'
You the only one I'm fienin'
I don't need nobody else so baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
Baby girl why is you leavin'? Baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
Baby girl why is you leavin'? Baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
I don't want nobody else so baby
Girl why is you leavin'?

Wait, hold up quick
This right here is tragic
Suicidal, I might swerve the lane in traffic
All this pain, swear it is too much
Now I'm in my feelings, I
Be rapping it like Russ, sooo-o
That's my soul, I said no, please don't go
Please don't go away we were supposed to be
Goals for everything, friends and family
Google maps, I be chilling on my trap phone
Tinder swiping, I be tryna find a bad hoe
CP3 I fuck 'em once and then I pass those
Ohhh oh oh

If I tell you that I love you
Promise that I really mean it
Ain't nobody else above you
I don't even know the meanin'
You the only one I'm dreamin'
You the only one I'm fienin'
I don't need nobody else so baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
Baby girl why is you leavin'? Baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
Baby girl why is you leavin'? Baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
I don't want nobody else so baby
Girl why is you leavin'?
