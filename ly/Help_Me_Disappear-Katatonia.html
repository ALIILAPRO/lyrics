		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To completely dissolve
What method is used I cannot sleep
My hands are bruised
There's a hole in the wall
Torn up anew one dead eye
The color of you

To vanish for life
And promise to stay
Away from the knowing, bird in a cage
I'd give so much
For the courage to go
If I ask for your help
Then you will know

So help me disappear
Or to believe in a change
No way out of here that I can see
Or the nightmares that burn
Into my head at night
Make them disappear
So I can breathe

Looked out the window twice
Just to be sure
That none was standing outside the door
But it's just as calm as it was before
They're all gone now, not there anymore

Isolated myself for the sake of freedom
I clenched my fist
For the sake of kindness
I read a book full of strange words
Loneliness is a disease
