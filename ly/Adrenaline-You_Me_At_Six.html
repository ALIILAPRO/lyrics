		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's clouding my energy
My mind's playing tricks on me
It won't stop, no it don't stop
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
(ooh)

I've turned into a spectacle
I'm on the wrong kind of chemicals
It won't stop, no it don't stop
'Til it's over, and I know that
(ooh)

There's something in the water
Can't control it, taking over
Lays me out like I just took a punch

Stop the clocks, it won't stop
Filling up my lungs
Coursing through my blood
The adrenaline is kicking in
Head fuck
Think I lost my touch
Oh my god, it won't stop
Kicking in adrenaline

Oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
It's kicking in adrenaline
Oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
Adrenaline is kicking in

What's the side effects gonna be?
A life of codependency
It won't stop, no it don't stop
'Til it's over ('tll it's over)
(ooh)

When I'm lost, I'm a nightmare
There's a line and I crossed it
A sucker for misery
An expert in infamy
(ooh)

There's something in the water
Can't control it, taking over
Lays me out like I just took a punch

Stop the clocks, it won't stop
Filling up my lungs
Coursing through my blood
The adrenaline is kicking in
Head fuck
Think I lost my touch
Oh my god, it won't stop
It's kicking in adrenaline

Oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
It's kicking in adrenaline
Oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
Adrenaline is kicking in

Adrenaline is kicking

Stop the clocks, it won't stop
Filling up my lungs
Coursing through my blood
The adrenaline is kicking in

Stop the clocks, it won't stop
Filling up my lungs
Coursing through my blood
Adrenaline is kicking in
Head fuck
Think I lost my touch
Oh my god, it won't stop
Won't stop

Oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
Adrenaline is kicking in
Oh (oh), oh, oh
Adrenaline is kicking in
