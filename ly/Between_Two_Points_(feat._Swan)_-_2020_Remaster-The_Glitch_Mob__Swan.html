		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've got forever
Slipping through our hands
We've got more time
To never understand

Falling footsteps
Weighing heavy on me

Behind darkness
Beneath candles
Whispers waltz
Around our dreams

The shortest distance between two points
Is a line from me to you
The shortest distance between two points
Is a line from me to you, me to you, you, you, you, you

Feet turning black
Is this the path we must walk?
No turning back
Wish I could just hear you talk

Can something like this be pulled
From under our feet?
Leaving our skin and burning coals to meet

(Tell me) tell me now

The shortest distance between two points
Is a line from me to you
The shortest distance between two points
Is a line from me to you, me to you, you, you, you, you
