		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum muh
Oh whoa oh oh oh

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read-a my polka face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read-a my polka face
(She's got to love nobody)
P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face (Mum mum mum muh)
P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face, hey

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer baby
You, you, you are 
You, you, you are 
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
(Womanizer)

Boy don't try to front
I,I know just what you are (are are) 
Boy don't try to front
I,I know just what you are (are are) 

You say I'm crazy
I got your crazy
You're nothing but a
Womanizer

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night 
At, at, at night

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

And I was like baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
I thought you'd always be mine

So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what, I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done, I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what, I am a rock star
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight

I kissed a girl and I liked it, 
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it, 
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right, 
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it

And I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay
Stuck on replay
Stuck on replay
Replay
Replay-ay-ay-ay

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Baby are you down?

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break your heart

Don't stop, making pop
DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sun light
Tick tock, on the clock
But the polka don't stop (no)
Yodel-yodel-lady-hoo
Yodel-yodel-lady-hoo

P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face (mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face
Oh no you can't read my p-p-polka face 
Talk about my polka face 
P-p-p-polka face
