		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drifting
I am drifting away
Watching the sunset
as the clouds change

Pulled in
like sand with the tide
like life in slowmotion
When i close my eyes

Its you
everywhere I go Its you
Take my by surprise you do
When I think I its over
You come out of nowhere

Everytime I am fine its you
Put me on the line you do
When I think I am sober
You come out of nowhere

Pouring
Feel the rain on my skin
See our reflection
dance with the wind

Floating
As the waves re getting taller
Try to resist but
Put my head under water

Its you
everywhere I go Its you
Take my by surprise you do
When I think I its over
You come out of nowhere

You
Everytime I am fine its you
Put me on the line you do
When I think I am sober
You come out of nowhere
