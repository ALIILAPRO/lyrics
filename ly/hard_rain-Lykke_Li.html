		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you like the feeling of a hard rain falling
I have a seafull, I can give you an ocean
If you like the feeling of a hard rain falling
I have a sea-full, I can give you an ocean
If you like the feeling of a hard rain falling (love, love is a feeling)
I have a sea-full, I can give you an ocean (if you feel it, you feel it, like it's raining)
If you like the feeling of a hard rain falling (love, love is a feeling)
I have a sea-full, I can give you an ocean (if you feel it, you feel it, like it's raining)

We shouldn't have to work so hard to break this wave in our way
Shouldn't wanna walk away so you won't see the fear I face
Every time I look at you standing still, I wanna wait
But you never tell me no, baby wait, baby stay

We shouldn't have to work so hard to break this wave in our way
Shouldn't wanna walk away so you won't see the fear I face
Every time I look at you standing still, I wanna wait
But you never tell me no, baby wait, baby stay

So I'm trying to get us back together
Though we never been apart
Tryna find a shelter from the weather
Before a rain came down on us
You say it like it's easy but it's not easy, baby
Do you see me? Do you want me?
Do you need me to be near you?
So you got somebody next to your body
Somebody next to your body
Keeping me up, keeping me down, keeping me up
Keeping me down, keeping me up, down, up, down
Keeping me up, keeping me down

Love, love is a feeling (it's not just a feeling)
If you feel it, you feel it (it's not just a feeling)
Like it's raining
If you like the feeling of a hard rain falling (love, love is a feeling)
I have a sea-full, I can give you an ocean (if you feel it, you feel it, like it's raining)

If there's no feeling, no meaning, say something
Did I mean something to you?
You show nothing, was it real?
Did I block it? It's my fault we lost it
And look at us now, us is holding us hostage
