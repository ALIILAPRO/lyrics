		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay
Everybody put they Glocks in the air for me
Put your shit up
You got a stick on your shit 
You got a fifty on your shit 
Put your shit in the air for me
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy (uh)
Grrt (uh, uh-uh)

Last opp we caught was at the store, we had to scrape him (skrrt)
Lil' bro hopped out trippin' with that switchy, he done faced him (grrt)
Face shot, face shot, frrt-frrt, they couldn't save him (frrt-frrt)
We the ones gettin' busy up in the city, that's on my baby (that's on my son)
They block like a drive-thru, ask the opps how much we slide through
Ain't beefin', but you they family, you get caught, then you gon' die too (dumbass)
Hol' on, hol' on, hol' on, hol' on, hol' on, stop the whip
Let me out, this chopstick gon' leave him open like a zip (zzz)
Zip him up, tell buddy 'nem ass to come and pick him up (come pick him up)
Niggas fakin', actin' like they thug life 'til we hit 'em up (hit 'em up)
Lot of niggas don't like me, what? I ain't even did shit (I ain't even did nothin')
Make his bitch take dick to the head, I ain't even hit yet

How you mad she choosin' me? (Umm)
I like what she do to me (umm)
She say she feel safer over here 
This where the shooters be
She say ain't no pape' up over there 
Shit, she barely eatin' (she starvin')
Can barely feed his self 
She told me, "Help, this nigga barely feed me"

How you mad she choosin' me?
You would die if you know what she was doin' to me (ooh)
We been swappin' spit for a lil' while, this shit ain't new to me (shh)
Actin' like I'm chasin' her or somethin', she be pursuin' me
Can't hold you, she be tellin' me all the time she wish that you was me (she bold)
I ain't with that messy shit, I barely'll text a bitch (I'm cold)
I can't even brag about these thots, that shit be effortless (damn)
Red and white Ferrari, I come through fresh as a peppermint
Ain't caught up in that other shit, they trippin', I'm Black excellence (yeah)
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold the jet
Seven-fifty for a show, I gotta go, can't miss this check
Travel all around the globe, doin' what I want with no regrets
She feel safe with us, whenever she with gang, it make her wet, yeah

We don't do the social tweet, these niggas too internet
Goin' live, tryna talk 'bout who got shot, we don't get into that
Can you leave it up in the streets with me? 
I ain't tryna go to jail (I ain't tryna go to jail)
Keep mentionin' my name in all of your posts 
It ain't hard to tell (what the fuck?)
If you get smoked, they gon' come lookin' for me 
Nigga, you dumb as hell
This bitch think I love her, ooh-wee 
She must be drunk as hell
I can't love no slut bitch 
I love how they suck dick (I like how they eat dick)
Once I get my nut off, bitch, I'm skatin' like some Trukfit
