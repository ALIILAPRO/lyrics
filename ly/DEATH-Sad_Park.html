		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  DEATH I'M SCARED OF DYING
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING EVERYBODY THAT I LOVE
LOVE IT'S OVERWHELMING
I TRY TO TELL THEM BUT IT NEVER FEELS ENOUGH

IF I COULD MAKE TIME
I'D MAKE SO MUCH TIME
I'D MAKE THE TIME TO 
SPEND MORE TIME WITH

DARK FOREVER DARKNESS
THE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING 
AND ALSO NOTHING TOO
BREATH ATLEAST I'M BREATHING
MY HEART IS BEATING ON A DRUM KIT JUST FOR YOU

IF I COULD MAKE TIME
I'D MAKE SO MUCH TIME
I'D MAKE THE TIME TO 
SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU
IF I COULD MAKE TIME
I'D MAKE SO MUCH TIME
I'D MAKE THE TIME TO 
SPEND MY TIME WITH
ALL MY TIME WITH YOU

NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
EVEN IF WE'RE SCREWED
I KNOW YOU LOVE ME TOO

IF I COULD MAKE TIME
I'D MAKE SO MUCH TIME
I'D MAKE THE TIME TO 
SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU
IF I COULD MAKE TIME
I'D MAKE SO MUCH TIME
I'D MAKE THE TIME TO 
SPEND MY TIME WITH
ALL MY TIME WITH YOU
