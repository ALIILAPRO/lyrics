		<p>
		  Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

I feel the fire, it burns inside
I hear a choir sing through the night
Don't let it go
Don't ever lose hope

I can feel a change this time
They'll never take away what's mine (ay)
I'm gonna reach even higher, I know

I found the strength I'm looking for
I'll take it to forevermore
Yeah I was scared, but now I know
That I can take it to, that I can take it to forevermore

I've been dreaming of this life (of this life)
Piercing through my darkest night (oh-ohh)
I've been fighting all my life (ooh-ooh)
Reaching for the sky

I can feel a change this time (ahh ahh)
They'll never take away what's mine
I'm gonna reach even higher, I know

I found the strength I'm looking for
I'll take it to forevermore
Yeah I was scared, but now I know
That I can take it to, that I can take it to forevermore

(Forevermore) (yeah yeah)
(Forevermore) (oh yeah yeah)
(Forevermore) (oh yeah yeah)
(Forevermore) (oh yeah yeah)

I feel the fire, it burns inside
I hear a choir sing through the night
Don't let it go
Don't ever lose hope

I can feel a change this time
They'll never take away what's mine
I'm gonna reach even higher, I know

I found the strength I'm looking for
I'll take it to forevermore
Yeah I was scared, but now I know
That I can take it to, that I can take it to forevermore

(Forevermore) (yeah yeah)
(Forevermore) (oh yeah yeah)
(Forevermore) (oh yeah yeah)
(Forevermore) (oh yeah yeah)
