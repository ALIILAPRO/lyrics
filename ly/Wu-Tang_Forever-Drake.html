		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh, ah

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours (it's yours)
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours (it's yours)
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours (it's yours)
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours 
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours (it's yours)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure, yeah
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours) 
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours) 

How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
'Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like, "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be, yeah
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

Ah, I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours (it's yours)
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours (it's yours)
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours (it's yours)
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours 
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours 
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure, yeah
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours) 
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure, that's for sure
(It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours) 

How you feel about?
