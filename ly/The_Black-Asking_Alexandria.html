		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bury me
Just leave me to sleep in the dirt
Finish me
I'm floating away
There's a demon staring straight through your eyes
Am I wasting my time?
Something's turning inside of me
You make me feel like I'm fucking drowning (I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out)
You made my world come crashing down around me
(I need to cut you out)

Oh God I wish you'd just speak to me
Black is all that I see
Speak to me
You used to be all that I needed

I've been crucified and hung out to dry
Yet my heart still beats and I feel so alive
This time I'll fight for myself as you try to fuck me over
I bet you never cared
I knew you never cared
You make me feel like I'm fucking drowning (I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out)
You made my world come crashing down around me
(I need to cut you out)

Speak to me
Black is all that I see
Speak to me
You used to be all that I needed

I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out
I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out
I wish you could save me
There's something lost inside
I'm scared it might kill me
All my life I've needed you with me
You've always let me down
But still I try
Don't leave me here
I need you around (don't turn your back on me, don't turn your back on me)
Lift my feet off the ground (I can't cut you out)
Your tongue like a knife
Your eyes cut like daggers
I don't feel a thing 'cause I'm so dead inside
Lift my feet off the ground
Don't leave me here
I need you around, ah
