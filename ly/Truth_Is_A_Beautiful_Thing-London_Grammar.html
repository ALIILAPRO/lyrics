		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miles and miles on my own
Walk with shame, I follow on
A language to find hard to hear
Not to understand, just disappear

To hold your heart, to hold your hand
Would be to me, the greatest thing
To hold your heart, to hold your hand
Would be to me, the bravest thing

Could you take my place and stand here?
I do not think you'd take this pain
You'll be on your knees and struggle under the weight
Oh, the truth would be a beautiful thing
Oh, the truth is a beautiful thing

I wear another thought of you
There's so much home I give to you
Hide you somewhere they don't know
Deep in my call you know you have a throne

Hold your heart, hold your hand
Would be to me, the greatest thing
To hold your heart, to hold your hand
Would be to me, the bravest thing

Could you take my place and stand here?
I don't think you'd take this pain
You'll be on your knees and struggle under the weight
Oh, the truth would be a beautiful thing
Oh, the truth is a beautiful thing
