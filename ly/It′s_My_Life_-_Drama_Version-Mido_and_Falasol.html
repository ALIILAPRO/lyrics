		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't a song for the brokenhearted
No silent prayer for the faith departed

I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down

Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life)

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break
Baby, don't back down

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life)

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna to live while I'm alive

Ooh, it's just now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life) hey

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
