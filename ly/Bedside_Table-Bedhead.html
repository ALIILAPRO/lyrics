		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You cut your head on the bedside table. 
Your temple bled as you were unable to 
Remember the lines of what you were reading 
About someone deciding to quit speaking.

What I was just reading about someone 
Deciding to quit speaking began to 
Dissolve into my lap as the words 
Gave up their attempts at meaning.
