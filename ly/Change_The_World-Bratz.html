		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I get that overwhelming feeling
So sad the faces on TV
If I tried to make a difference
Would it help anyway?
But then I stop and to myself I say

So you wanna change the world
What are you waiting for?
You say you wanna start right now
What are you waiting for?
It only takes one voice
So come on now and shout it out
Give a little more
What are you waiting for?

Sometimes I feel a little helpless
Seems like I can't do a thing
But anything is possible
Just you wait and see
Good things happen if you just believe

So you wanna change the world
What are you waiting for?
You say you wanna start right now
What are you waiting for?
It only takes one voice
So come on now and shout it out
Give a little more

Before it's too late
Gonna face tomorrow today

So you wanna change the world
What are you waiting for?
You say you wanna start right now
What are you waiting for?
It only takes one voice
So come on now and shout it out
Give a little more
What are you waiting for?
