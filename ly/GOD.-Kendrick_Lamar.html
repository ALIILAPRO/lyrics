		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This what God feel like, yeah
Laughing to the bank like aha, yeah
Flex on swole like aha, yeah
You feel some type of way then, aha, yeah

Ever since a young man
All I want to be was a gunman
Shooting up the charts, better run man
Ya'll gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, running plays like a circuit, JT
I'm selling verses, Jay Z, watch me work it, JT
Look, look, hold up
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young, fucking all the rats
Don't judge me, aiming at your head for a stack
Don't judge me, don't judge me
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me, if I press your line, you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon' see

This what God feel like, yeah
Laughing to the bank like aha, yeah
Flex on swole like aha, yeah
You feel some type of way then, aha, yeah

Fuck is you talking to?
Aye, do you know who you talking to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get your ass killed by the finest
Everything life is a gamble
Nothing in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift, I'm on
I ain't sorry for it, ask for a piece of mine
You charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitate, ducking haters
Oh my, my heart is rich, my heart is famous

This what God feel like, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughing to the bank like aha (this what God feel like)
Yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like aha (this what God feel like)
Yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way then, aha
(This what God feel like)
This what God feel like
Yeah (This what God feel like)
