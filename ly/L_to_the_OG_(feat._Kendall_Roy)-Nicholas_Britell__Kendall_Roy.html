		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good evening, everyone, thank you for being here to honor my dad's life and work
So, when Rhea was planning this thing, she asked me to help out 
With a tribute of a certain flava
Just remember, I'm not a professional

Born on the North Bank, king of the East Side
50 years strong, now he's rolling in a stick ride
Handmade suits, raking in loot
Five-star general, y'all best salute
Yo, bitches be catty, but the King Kong daddy
Rock all the haters while we go roll a fatty
Squiggle on the decks, Kenny on the rhymes
And Logan big ballin' on Hampton's time

L to the OG
Dude be the OG
A-N he playing
Playing like a pro, see
L to the OG
Dude be the OG
A-N he playing
Playing like a pro

A-1 ratings, 80K wine
Never gonna stop, baby, fuck Father Time
Bro, don't get it twisted, I've been through hell
But since I stan Dad, I'm alive and well
Shaper of views, creator of news
Father of many, paid all his dues
So don't try to run your mouth at the king
Just pucker up, bitch, and go kiss the ring

L to the OG
Dude be the OG
A-N he playing
Playing like a pro, see
L to the OG
Dude be the OG
A-N he playing
Playing like a pro
L to the OG
Dude be the OG
A-N he playing
Playing like a pro, see
L to the OG
Dude be the OG
A-N he playing
Playing like a pro

When I say L, you say OG
L to the (OG)
L to the (OG)
L to the (OG)
L to the (OG)
L to the (OG)
L to the motherfuckin' OG
