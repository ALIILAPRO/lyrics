		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't hear a single word you said
My thoughts keep bouncing all around my head
I wonder what's the matter with my mind
I'm sorry could you say that one more ti-ti-ti-ti-time

My baby left me for another man
Ooh I think I get it, yes I think I understand
I can't recall it but think his name was Bill
But fuck it man, I think he's really chill

And so it goes
Man, you can never stop the dominoes
You're never gonna catch me comatose
I'm on my toes this time
Ah

My landlord came round looking for the rent
I don't know how to tell him that the money all got spent
But now I got a brand new pair of jeans
I see a sea of denim in my dreams

My scars they run a little bit too deep
I'm trying and I'm trying and I'm trying to get some sleep
But the fucking rats keep running up and down the wall
Like they're fucking dancing a Dohori in Nepal

And so it goes
Man, you can never stop the dominoes
You're never gonna catch me comatose
I'm on my toes this time

And so it goes
Man, you can never stop the dominoes
You're never gonna catch me comatose
I'm on my toes this time

Ah, la, la, la, la
Ah, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Ah, la, la, la
