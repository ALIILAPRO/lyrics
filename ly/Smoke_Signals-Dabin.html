		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Midnight calls
'Cause you know that I'll be up
Waited all night long
Left me with your smoking gun

You cloud up my vision
A head on collision
You made me into a dead end
Quite the decisions
I'll turn the ignition
And do it all over again

I'm seeing smoke signals
Fog up my rear window, oh, oh
I just can't let you go
No, I just can't let you go
I'm seeing smoke signals
Fog up my rear window
I just can't let you go
No, I just can't let you go

No, I just can't let you go
(Ooh)
All those smoke signals, those smoke signals

I refuse
To admit that I was blind
Then confused
Really thought I knew you

You cloud up my vision
My hazy addiction
But I never want it to end
So I'll keep on wishin'
That this is a fiction
And keep crashing into your bed

I'm seeing smoke signals
Fog up my rear window, oh, oh
I just can't let you go
No, I just can't let you go
I'm seeing smoke signals
Fog up my rear window, oh, oh
I just can't let you go
No, I just can't let you go

No, I just can't let you go
(Ooh)
All those smoke signals, those smoke signals

No, I just can't let you go

No, I just can't let you go
