		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

I don't have happiness, and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then

I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
(You)
