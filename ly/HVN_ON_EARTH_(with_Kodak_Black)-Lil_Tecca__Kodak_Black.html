(We love you, Tecca)

I never had the time to make a way
I only had the time to make a play (oh-oh, oh)
I had to learn nobody savin' me
If you gon' run it up, then why wait? (That's my- that's my-)
They see I got a lot up in my plate
When you been workin', it's not 'bout the faith (oh-oh, oh)
She on my phone and what she 'bout to say?
She let me know (that's my- that's my-)

H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my H.O.E., H.O.E., H.O.E. (oh-oh, oh)
That's my H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my-
Heaven on earth, my- (oh-oh, oh)
That's my- that's my-
H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my H.O.E., H.O.E., H.O.E. (oh-oh, oh)
That's my H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my-
Heaven on earth, my- (oh-oh, oh)
That's my- that's my-

Yeah, nowadays I'm just thinkin' 'bout a bag
Got '85 Undercovers on my ass
That ho, she say, "Yo," 'cause I got money bags
The feds at my door 'cause I got money stashed (that's my-that's my-)
Easy to get it, now go make it last
You gon' turn on me, I'ma watch you crash
Don't give a fuck, no one get a pass
Know if I said it, yeah, I meant that (that's my- that's my-)

You got it goin', hold up now
Say you wanna get high, then roll up now
You say you not gon' fold up now
She hit my line, said (that's my- that's my-)
I never showed them up no love now
I can't say what's on my mind, get dumbed down
Thinkin' too much and my mind get shut down
She hit my line, said (that's my- that's my-)

H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my H.O.E., H.O.E., H.O.E. (oh-oh, oh)
That's my H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my-
Heaven on earth, my- (oh-oh, oh)
That's my- that's my-
H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my H.O.E., H.O.E., H.O.E. (oh-oh, oh)
That's my H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my-
Heaven on earth, my- (oh-oh, oh)
That's my- that's my-

Every time I see her, shawty got on tights
Rain hit my wrist, water turn to ice
What could I say? I'm just cut that way
If you play, you lay, I'ma take your life (that's my- that's my-)
I'm a killer, so don't push me
I don't really care too much for pussy
I ain't cheat the grind, look where it took me
You a stepper? What you want, a cookie? (That's my-that's my-)
It ain't no question, I put the bros before bitches
In four seconds, Beamer go zero to sixty
Ain't no tellin' what do I got on this glizzy
There's no hesitation, I get on her business (that's my- that's my-)
I've been two years out the feds
And I still been gettin' niggas pluckered
Put a bounty on a nigga head
Told him that the quicker picker upper (that's my- that's my-)
The AK made in Romania
Pourin' the drink by the tablespoon (oh-oh, oh)
I feed a bad bitch baby food
They on my macadamia (oh-oh, oh)
Sprite spiked up, thank ya
I'm in the suburbs, I'm servin' my neighbor (oh-oh, oh)
I don't got time to respond to no haters
But I'ma kill all them lil' niggas later (oh-oh, oh)
I promise

I never had the time to make a way
I only had the time to make a play (oh-oh, oh)
I had to learn nobody savin' me
If you gon' run it up, then why wait? (That's my-that's my-)
They see I got a lot up in my plate
When you been workin', it's not 'bout the faith (oh-oh, oh)
She on my phone and what she 'bout to say?
She let me know (that's my- that's my-)

H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my H.O.E., H.O.E., H.O.E. (she let me know, oh-oh, oh)
That's my H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my- (she let me know)
Heaven on earth, my- (oh-oh, oh)
That's my- that's my-
H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my H.O.E., H.O.E., H.O.E. (she let me know, oh-oh, oh)
That's my H.O.E., H.O.E.
Heaven on earth, my- (she let me know)
Heaven on earth, my- (oh-oh, oh)
That's my- that's my-

Yeah, drum stick, pump rock
She like my vibe, uh, yeah (I-I-I)
Get it, slide, ooh, drum stick, let's get it (that's my- that's my-)
Yeah (ooh), drum stick, let's get it (I-I-I)
Yeah (ooh), drum stick, drum stick, rock, let's get it (that's my- that's my-)
Ooh-ooh (I-I-I)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (I-I-I)
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (that's my- that's my-)
