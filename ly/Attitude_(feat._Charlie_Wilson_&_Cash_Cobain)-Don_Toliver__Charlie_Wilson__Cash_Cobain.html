		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh
Fuckin' that bitch and I make her say- (oh, oh, oh-oh)
Oh, oh
Tss, fuckin' that bitch and I make her say- (oh, oh, oh-oh)

I need twenty mil', make it cash for me (run it up)
I need me the Lamb' with the ass on it (ah, ah, ah)
Don't show me that lil' booty, put some pants on it (nah)
But, baby, you get freaky, make her dance on it (yeah)
Ever since I got money, I got attitude
Can't be no broke, bitch, I might get mad at you
Can't be no broke, baby, I might get mad at you (oh)
Can't be no ho, nigga, I might just snatch your boo

All this shit that I got (got), I got it straight out the pot
I gotta complete on her body, I'm makin' it, makin' it hot
Used to rock Polos and Pradas
Used to put grams in my sock
Used to fuck hoes on the corner
Now, me and baby on a yacht

I need twenty mil', make it cash for me (run it up)
I need me the Lamb' with the ass on it (ah, ah, ah)
Don't show me that lil' booty, put some pants on it (nah)
But, baby, you get freaky, make her dance on it (yeah)
Ever since I got money, I got attitude (ooh)
Can't be no broke, bitch, I might get mad at you (ah)
Can't be no broke, baby, I might get mad at you (ha)
Can't be no ho, nigga, I might just snatch your boo

Are you hard to get?
You-you-you know I'll have you cummin' again
I see you on the dance floor
Ooh, I want me some more, and I'm makin' it drop

So, baby, so, baby, so give me good love
So, baby, so, baby, so give me good love

Tss, I got what you need, niggas can't fuck with me
You wanna move slizzy? Then come to me
Wanna have fun with me? Like, I'm a rich nigga, no bum in me
I wanna rump, like, rump with me
I fuck her so good, she gon' cum for me
(Oh, oh-oh)

Orange soda in my lean, I'm Baby Keem
Ring cost a quarter ki', it's five percent when she ride with me (oh, oh-oh)
It's like Tia and Tamera, I can't even compare 'em
Nigga, don't play with the stones, you play, I dare ya

I need twenty mil', make it cash for me (run it up)
I need me the Lamb' with the ass on it (ah, ah, ah)
Don't show me that lil' booty, put some pants on it (nah)
But, baby, you get freaky, make her dance on it (yeah)
Ever since I got money, I got attitude
Can't be no broke, bitch, I might get mad at you (ha)
Can't be no broke, baby, I might get mad at you (ha)
Can't be no ho, nigga, I might just snatch your boo
