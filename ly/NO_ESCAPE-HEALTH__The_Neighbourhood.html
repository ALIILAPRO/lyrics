		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Same thing happens every day
I try to run but they want me to stay
The years fast but the days are slow
Life's hard when you're young
And it's worse as you grow

All the plans we had
Have come to nothing
All the water under the bridge
Is drowning us

Can't fix myself
I'm breaking down
On my own, till I'm underground
Losing light, no way out
Dead inside, all over now

Hard enough to trust someone
Hard enough to lower the gun
Hard enough to trust someone
Hard enough to lower the gun

Every one of us wants to change
We want out, but there's no escape
Years pass but the days are slow
And the curse of the past will never let go

All the plans we had
Have come to nothing
All the water under the bridge
Is drowning us (us, us, us)

I can't fix myself
I'm breaking down
On my own, till I'm underground
Losing light, no way out
Dead inside, all over now

Hard enough to trust someone
Hard enough to lower the gun
Hard enough to trust someone
Hard enough to lower the gun

Hard enough to trust someone
Hard enough to lower the gun
Hard enough to trust someone
Hard enough to lower the gun
