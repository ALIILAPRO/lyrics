		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Among the images of dear departed
Here with memories so closely guarded
There's an old man standing all alone

As he waits among the unforgiven
Here among the souls no longer living
Lost in chains of sin still unatoned

He carves his stone

Well a man's got to do what a man must do
But I'll never give my soul to you
No fallen angel's prophecy
Will ever take hold of the man you see

So here I stand all alone
With chisel in hand I work my stone
And leave a message for all to see
I've lived a life of insanity

And carve that stone

And on that final night
You know I dream of you
And in a flash of light
I carved that stone right through
Yeah I carved that stone right through
