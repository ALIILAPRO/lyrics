		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still hot
I hooked up with yo best friend
I've stole your girlfriend,
I stood you up again,
Guess what I'm still hot
I bummed your last cigarette,
I left your card in the bed,
I maybe be drunk but so what,
I'm still hot
I'm crazy, I'm off the wall
I never check, never call,
I got you by the shiny disco ball
I won't remember your name the next day
But tonight I'll rock your world like a DJ (I'm still hot)
Guess what I'm still hot
Guess what I'm still hot (hot, hot, hot, hot)
Guess what I'm still hot
Sky rocket, I'll make you pop,
I'm hittin' Jack Pot
Packing you stalking you crackin'
I'll make your bed rock,
Harder than hard,
Flashin' the cash in the car,
Je suis a rock star
And guess what I'm still hot
I always come up on top,
I keep on going, don't drop,
I like my jimmys in my beatbox, beatbox
I won't remember your name the next day 
But tonight I'll rock your world like a DJ (I'm still hot)
I don't need your glamour
I don't need your glamour
I can do whatever,
Guess what I'm still hot
I don't need you camara
I am Luciana
I can do whatever,
Guess what I'm still hot
(hot, hot, hot, hot)
Guess what I'm still hot
I'm hot, still hot
Flip it in reverse
Make the beat, beat buzz
Head Spinnin' like a hot track Ready to go,
Spittin wild fire burning outta control
Runnin out the spot like in stereo,
I won't remember your name the next day, 
But tonight I'll rock your world like a DJ, (I'm still hot)
(oh, yeah)
Guess what I'm still hot
(oh, yeah)
Guess what I'm still hot
I'm still hot, yea im still hot
I'm still hot
Guess what I'm still hot
I'm still hot ,I'm still hot, yeah I'm still hot
Guess what I'm still hot
(hot, hot, hot, hot)
I'm still hot
