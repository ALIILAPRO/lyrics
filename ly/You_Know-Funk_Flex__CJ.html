		<p>
		  Huh?
(Flex you know we like to flex, my favorite color's red)
Gang, gang 
Look (roll the camera it's a movie when we)
(This is fire) Huh?
(Flex you know we like to flex, my favorite color's red)
You already know what it is, nigga
(Roll the camera it's a movie when we)
(Flex you know we like to flex, my favorite color's red)
Let's get it
(Roll the camera it's a movie when we) Whoopty, huh?

This ain't no elevator music
I asked your bitch she the first one to do it, uh
I get a check when I do it
I hopped of the jet like a young nigga flew it, uh
All red mink on, drippin' like the sink on
Passing your hoe like ping pong, uh
I put the streets on, bitch I'm a thot get me lit
When I'm gettin' my jugg on (gang, gang)
Look at this water I'm drippin'
I fuck your bitch and that bitch she go missing, uh (I'm drippin')
Me and my dawgs on a mission
The money I get and I flip it (me and my dawgs on a mission)
Look, uh, I call on Flex when I flex (huh? Huh?)
Go ask Khaled niggas know we the best
I fuck that bitch in the back of the jet
Nigga, and that's on the set (that's on the set)

(Flex you know we like to flex, my favorite color's red) Huh?, Huh?
(Roll the camera it's a movie when we)
(Flex you know we like to flex, my favorite color's red)
I ain't even gotta say too much (roll the camera it's a movie when we flex)
Whoopty, huh?

Bitch I'm hot like fever (gang)
I can't stretch no bitch, don't need her (I can't stress no bitch)
I'm in the Wraith with my feet up (huh? Huh? Huh?)
Nigga I've been on my stripes like Adida'
Got a new bitch, she a diva (got a new bitch, got a new bitch)
She give good head, I won't leave her
Uh, bitch I'm off the meter
All this ice on me I'm stuck in the freezer, gang

(Flex you know we like to flex, my favorite color's red) Huh?
(Roll the camera it's a movie when we) Let's get it
(Flex you know we like to flex, my favorite color's red) Huh?
(Roll the camera it's a movie when we flex) And that's on that
