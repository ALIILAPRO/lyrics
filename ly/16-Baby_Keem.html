		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry when you lost, random 
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
Look this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
Look this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide

Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry 'cause you're trust random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
Look this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
Look this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide

My mama mad at me, I know I fucked up big
My girl mad at me, I know I fucked up big
What's love? I guess I'll never understand
Every time I say sorry, I do that shit again
Check, check, check, I made a promise
That I would never leave you stressed, I would be honest
I should have never sent that text, I will be honest
I'm sorry for the things I said, I will be honest

Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
Look this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
Look this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
