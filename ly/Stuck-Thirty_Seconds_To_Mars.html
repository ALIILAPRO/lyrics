		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been lost in your eyes all afternoon
The more I drift, the closer I get to you

She's a ghost
And the truth, it's impossible
But I love her lies
You made sure I don't find somebody new

It's the way you move
It's the way you move
I knew I'd stay with you after just one touch
The way you move has got me 
Stuck
Stuck
Got me stuck
Stuck
Got me stuck

I was lost and the found inside of a dream
Running out of the circle, tryna believe

She's a ghost
And the truth, it's impossible
But I love her lies
You made sure I don't find somebody new

It's the way you move
It's the way you move
I knew I'd stay with you after just one touch
The way you move has got me 
Stuck
Stuck
Got me stuck
Stuck
Got me stuck

It's the way you move
It's the way you move
I knew I'd stay with you after just one touch
The way you move has got me 
Stuck
Got me, got me stuck
Got me stuck
Got me, got me stuck
Got me stuck
