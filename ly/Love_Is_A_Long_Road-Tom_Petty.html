		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a girl I knew
She said she cared about me
She tried to make my world
The way she thought it should be
Yeah, we were desperate then
To have each other to hold
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road

There were so many times
I would wake up at noon
Yeah, with my head spinning 'round
I would wait for the moon
And give her one more chance
To try and save my soul
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road

Yeah, it was hard to give up
Some things are hard to let go
Some things are never enough
I guess I only can hope
For maybe one more chance
To try and save my soul
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road

Love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road
(Oh)
(Love)
Oh, it's a long, long road
(Love)
