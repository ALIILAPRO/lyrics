		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lost and found
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt along time ago
I can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream
Oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

Full fed yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Haunted I tell myself, yet I still wander
Down, inside, its tearing me apart
Oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

I'll never fall in
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never
Never fall
I'll never fall in love again
Never fall
Never fall in
I'll never fall in love again
It's all over now

At last, relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson taste divine
I can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream
Oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

I'll never fall in love
I'll never fall
Fall in love
I-I-I-I'll, ne-ne-ver, fall, in love
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never, I'll never
I'll never, I'll never
I'll never
Fall in love again
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
