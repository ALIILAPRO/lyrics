		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
And not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a given thing
The more I gave, the less I got, oh yeah
What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine, I got rain

And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
And not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine, I got rain

And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
And not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Now I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm a believer
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm a believer
