		  I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
Chuki Beats
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Retnik Beats

Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers

Shadow Realm, brought me to the Shadow Realm
Baby you burn me like hell
Now I'm never feeling well
I don't wanna cry anymore please save me
I don't wanna cry anymore please crave me
Tick tock on the clock
Blood drip down my socks
Red seas at the dock
Baby I can barely walk
Left a hole up in my chest, but you were my best
But you were my best

Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers

Strawberry Strangers, but she's so familiar
I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna marry her
I already found my other half in the darkness
Went through the eclipse, copped a brand, now I'm armless
Now I got a behelit from the black market
I dont even know you, why you think I wanna start shit
Baby can I follow you wherever I go
Have her sing on top of castles like (ooooh)

I don't wanna be a loner no anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
I don't wanna be a loner no anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
I don't wanna fall in love (ooooh)
I don't wanna fall in love (ooooh, strawberry strangers)

Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers
Ice cream angel, why you so dangerous?
Who are you with babe? Strawberry Strangers

I don't wanna be a loner no anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
I don't wanna be a loner no anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

I love Akuma
I love Akuma
