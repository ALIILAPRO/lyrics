		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soon after nine

I'll have to follow you

Crossing your line

But this is your solo

The music inside

Is telling the story

Of distant skyline

You smile when it calls you

We waited so long

And tried to figure it out

Don't underestimate my love

Till I continue the fight

Just stay, hold on

Don't lose yourself to the crowd

You are confusing me,

So hard to let you leave tonight

If I had known

From the beginning

Two lives ago

I wouldn't change a thing, so

Kiss me goodbye

And if that's what you wanted to -

Sail to the dusk

There's nothing more we can do
