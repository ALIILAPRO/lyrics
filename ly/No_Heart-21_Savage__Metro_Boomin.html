		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Southside, Southside on the, Southside on the, hey)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard, huh?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard, huh?
Why you got a twelve car garage, huh?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage, not Boyz N The Hood
But I'll pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin' 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knockin' niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one, Savage, I ain't even hatin'"
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage, I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on, man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard, huh?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard, huh?
Why you got a twelve car garage, huh?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know, they bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard, huh?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard, huh?
Why you got a twelve car garage, huh?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I grew up in the streets without no heart

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
