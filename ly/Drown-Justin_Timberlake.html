		  Drown, drown
Drown

Surface
Should've known your love was nothin' but the surface
I'm in the deep end, I can't fight the current
Tryin' to keep my head above it

And you've been beggin' me to stay, to stay
And I've been tryna be your wave, your wave
But it's about to break 'cause

You showed me exactly who you are and I should've believed it (believed it)
You left me alone out in the dark with all of your demons (demons)
Got caught up in the tide of all the tears you've cried
Yeah, you know I was blinded by my heart, sinking from the start
Should've never followed you this far, now I'm in the deep end
And you let me drown
You didn't even try to save me

Heard about heartbreak with the moonlight
And now the pain just magnifies
I know exactly what it feels like
Yeah, you do it to me every time
And if real love never dies
Why am I barely breathin'?
Here on my own
Out in the deep end
Way down below
Way down below of all of your lies

And you keep beggin' me to stay, to stay (stay)
I'm out here tryna be your wave, your wave
But it's about to break 'cause

You showed me exactly who you are and I should've believed it (should've believed it)
You left me alone out in the dark with all of your demons
Got caught up in the tide of all the tears you've cried
Yeah, you know I was blinded by my heart, sinking from the start
Should've never followed you this far, now I'm in the deep end
And you let me drown
You didn't even try to save me
You let me drown
You didn't even try to save me

But sometimes (sometimes I)
Sometimes I sit and fantasize (fantasize)
Maybe sometime in another life (another life)
We could've got it right, got it right (got it right)
Ooh, yeah (maybe)
Maybe sometimes in another life (another life)
I'll see your face in a new light (new light)
And your eyes say, "I love you"

You've been beggin' me to stay, to stay
And I've been tryna be your wave, your wave

You let me drown
You didn't even try to save me
You let me drown
You didn't even try to save me
You let me drown
You didn't even try to save me
You let me drown
You didn't even try to save me

It's about to break, break
It's about to break
It's about to break (break, break, break, break)
Break, break
It's about to break
(Drown, drown)
(Drown, drown)
