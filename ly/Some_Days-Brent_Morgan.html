		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days I feel I'd make a good sunset
Some days I just don't wanna' give up yet
Some days it's hard to breathe
Some days I'm over being me
Some days, some days, some days

Some days I try my best to seem happy
Some days this place seems better off without me
Some days I'm overwhelmed
Some days I'm lost inside this hell
Some days, some days, some days

Some days I wonder what it's like
To live an ordinary life
Maybe I won't feel this way
Some day

Some days I feel like everyone hates me
Some days I question, "Why would God create me?"
Some days I'm holding strong
Some days I'm barely hanging on
Some days, some days, some days

Some days I wonder what it's like
To live an ordinary life
Maybe I won't feel this way
Some day

Some days I wonder what it's like
To live an ordinary life
Maybe I won't feel this way
Some day
