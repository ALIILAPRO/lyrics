		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
Right now

Lost on a lonely road (do, do, do)
I carried such a heavy load (do, do, do)
Lost on a lonely road (do, do, do)
Carried such a heavy load (do, do, do)

(Do, do, do)
I must've done something wrong (do, do, do)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba), (ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)

Where did I go wrong?
Where did I go wrong?
Can you tell me now?
Did I ever treat you bad?
Or did I ever do you wrong?
Or did I
I'd like to know the answer, girl
Where did I go wrong?
I must've done something
(I must've done something wrong)
To be left here with such a lonely song

Lost on a lonely road (do, do, do)
I carried such a heavy load (do, do, do)
Lost on a lonely road (do, do, do)
Carried such a heavy load (do, do, do)

(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)

Where did I go wrong?
Where did I go wrong?
Can you tell me now?
Did I ever treat you bad?
Or did I ever do you wrong?
Or did I
I'd like to know the answer, girl
Where did I go wrong?
I must've done something
(I must've done something wrong)
To be left here with such a lonely song
