		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oooh

Ev´rybody´s telling you what you wanna hear
So how you gonna know what´s fake and what´s real
Who´s gonna tell you things ain´t so great
When your so-called friends won´t tell it to your face

Fair weather, foul weather ev´ry kind o´mood
I´ll be there for you standing like a tower or truth
Who´s gonna get you through the sum of all fears
When the world is crum´bling around your ears

When the lights go out
Will your face the dark alone
Or will you call my name
´Cos I´ll be there and I´ll be strong

Where are you
Where are you
Even the shadows call your name
Oh I will never be the same
While I keep searching on and on
Living my life
Living my life
Without you

Meet me in the garden come break of day
Reach into the dawn and you can touch my face
Meet me in the morning it´s a beautiful place
Seek me in the shadows where your thoughts all stray

Ev´rybody´s wondering where is the love
It´s the heartbeat beating on the wings of a dove
Seek and you will find me
Never be ashamed
When I wrap my love around you then you´ll know my name

When the lights go out
Will you face the dark alone
Or will you call my name
I´ll be there and I´ll be strong

Where are you
Where are you
Even the shadows call your name
Oh I will never be the same
While I keep searching on and on
Living my life
Living my life
Without you
Where are you

Where are you
Ohh
Where are you
Ohh


I´ll be there and I´ll be strong

Where are you
Where are you
Even the shadows call your name
Oh I will never be the same
while I keep searching on and on
Living my life
Living my life
Without you

Even the shadows call your name
Oh I will never be the same
While I keep searching on and on
Living my life
Living my life
Without you

Where are you
