		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Basically, I bet you'll see
At first, I'm not quite what I seem
Every day is just the same
(Picking names, repeating faces)
Everything is show and tell
And things are played off somewhat well
Holding hands, we're rather bored
Nothing lines up anymore

I could never understand
How first impressions go unplanned
Everybody hides their face
How could I have noticed?
Nonetheless, we're all the same
There's many things from where we came
Show a smile, we're rather bored
Nothing lines up anymore

Turn around about a new view
Bring about the fear inside you
Make a storm of tears and anger
Never mind, don't worry 'bout me
We've disposed of our contention
Do our best, avoid attention
Just accept the things you know
Well, maybe so

Wait

What is going on here?
I'm a little out of sorts
I've been contemplating
Fallacies and things that scare me
Why not try to let go?
I've been feeling out of order
I'm allowing change, so
Take a good look, this is me
This is what I've come to be
(This is what I've come to be)

Look away 'cause we forgot
The apathy that's tied in knots
Hearing our every thought (ha-ha-ha-ha)
Everything is show and tell
And things are played off somewhat well
All because we're rather bored
Nothing matters anymore

Moving along, dancing along, playing along
I am
Waiting for it, preparing it, looking for it
I am
Feeling around, messing around, looking around
I am
Laughing a lot, losing a lot, looking at you
I am

And what the hell should I do?
I've been feeling out of order
I've been sorta noticing
Fallacies and things that see me
Surely, you've always known
I'm a little out of sorts
First impressions reborn
This is what I've come to be
(This is what I shouldn't be)
This is what I wanna be
