		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ooh
Ah
Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh
Ye 
Ooh ooh

I could wait all night and day
To go to a party sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ 'cause my song he's gotta play 
And when I hear that beat 
I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song

Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long 
Just turn it up and turn me on 
Play, come on DJ play that song you know that turns me on 
(Dj just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn me on

Dj just play that song, 'cause I want to be dancing all night long
Just play my, play my, play my, play my, play my favorite song

I don't care if everybody's gone turn it up'cause it turns me on 
Keep dancing all night long, feels so right that it can't be wrong 
I get chills up and down my spine whenever I hear that song of mine 
When it stops better press rewind 
Let me here it one more time!
 
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long 
Just turn it up and turn me on 
Play, come on DJ play that song you know that turns me on 
(Dj just play that song)
'Cause I want to be dancing all night long

Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on DJ play that song you know that it turns me on
(Dj just play that song)
'Cause I want to be dancing all night long

I just want to dance, is that a crime? 
Alright then
(Yeah that's the hotness right here)
Play, come on play that song ,play it all night long, just turn it up and turn me on 
(Now mr. Dj I've asked you 3 times already just play my mother fuckin' song!)

Play, come on DJ play that song you know that it turns me on
(Dj just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn me on

Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on DJ play that song you know that it turns me on
(Dj just play that song)
'Cause I want to be dancing all night long

Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on DJ play that song you know that it turns me on
(Dj just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn me on
