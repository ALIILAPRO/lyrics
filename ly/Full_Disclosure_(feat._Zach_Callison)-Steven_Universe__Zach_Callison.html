		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody told me gem stuff's dangerous
I guess I didn't believe it
Until now
Dad always seemed apprehensive
And now he's really freaking out
What do I do?
I don't want that for you

Everybody tells me life is precious
On the planet earth
And that means you
And I have to protect you
What if somehow you get hurt?
What do I do?
I don't want that for you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

What am I going to tell you?
You're better off not knowing the trouble I'm in
I don't want you to worry
About what I've just seen
About where I've just been
You don't have to be a part of this
I don't think I want you to be
You don't need this
You don't need me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
