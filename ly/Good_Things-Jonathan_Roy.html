		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is just an imaginary conversation I had with myself
Last night around twelve o'clock
I said don't you call her and don't you make contact

Let it go that girl won't come back
So hard to listen to that
And just admit the truth
But she's gone, get it through your head, it's only the first part
But she's gone and you'll never guess
What is the worst part

It's when the good things happen to me
I use to call you up immediately
I got so many good things coming my way
But there is no one to call today
It's when the good things happen to me
I use to take your picture so you can see
And that's the first thing I usde to do
And it's the worst thing there is about not being together with you
Together, oh

And this is just a next heart for my mind
It just keep spinning around all the time
Can't you make it stop?
Can't you make it stop?
I wanna know
But she's gone, get it through your head
It's only the first part
But she's gone
You'll never guess what is the worst part

It's when the good things happen to me
I use to call you up immediately
I got so many good things coming my way
But there's no one to call today
It's when the good things happen to me
I use to take your picture so you could see
And that's the first thing I use to do
And that's the worst thing there is about not being together with you
Together

(Only when the good things)
Only when the good things
(Only when the good things)
Only when the good things
(Only when the good things)
Only when the good things
(Only when the good things)

I got so many good things
I got no one to call
Good, good, good things
Yeah

It's when the good things happen to me
I use to call you up immediately
I got so many good things coming my way
But there's no one to call today
It's when the good things happen to me
I use to take your picture so you can see
And that's the first thing I use to do
And that's worst thing there is about not being together with you
Together with you, oh

Only when the good things
Only when the good things
