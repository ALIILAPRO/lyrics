		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bared my soul to you
And here comes the rain again
Once the weight of the world was a feather
Sweet innocence
There is a dusty room
Kept for a friend
Through the windows to the world I had opened
When will I see you again

We used to be the raincatchers
And we couldn't see what we were running from
You made me feel like nothing really matters
Here in my dreams we're raincatchers
Come back to me, like it was before
You made me feel like nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

If we let this run
Caught on a river
Everything that we left unspoken
Will never be said
And you forgot (miss you always)
But I remembered (I remembered)

We used to be the raincatchers
And we couldn't see what we were running from
You made me feel like nothing really matters
Here in my dreams we're raincatchers
Come back to me, like it was before
You made me feel like nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

If I call now 
Would you listen?
The shaking ground
Do you feel it?
If I call now (if I call now)
Would you listen? (Would you listen?)
Shaking ground (if I call now)
Would you feel it?
Far away
I'll remember

We used to be the raincatchers
And we couldn't see what we were running from
And you made me feel like nothing really matters (nothing really matters)
Where have you been, raincatcher?
Come back to me, like it was before
You made me feel like nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
