		<p>
		  Yeah, Cash Money shit
Cash Money shit

I can tell that money's got you working
We've been talking for so long
Now we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

Girl, you look good won't you back that ass up?
You a fine motherfucker, won't you back that ass up?
Call me big daddy, won't you back that ass up?
Girl, who is you playing with? Back that ass up
You working with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah (uh, uh, uh)
Girl, you working with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah (uh, uh, uh)

Girl, you working with some, ass yeah, you bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash yeah, his last, yeah
Hoes frown when you pass, yeah, they mad, yeah
Couple thousand on your bag, yeah, fuck, yeah
I'm a Big Tymer nigga, yeah, money flipper, yeah
Get it understood, yeah, it's all good, yeah
Girl, I know it's real 'cause I've been around it
You only want what's real, you just never found it, oh
Don't give them no more chances, ooh, girl, they had their turn
Everything for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them
But when I get you to myself
You know what's going down, what's going down, oh

Girl, you look good won't you back that ass up?
You a fine motherfucker, won't you back that ass up?
Call me big daddy, won't you back that ass up?
Girl, who is you playing with? Back that ass up
You working with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah (uh, uh, uh)
Girl, you working with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah, yeah (uh, uh, uh)

I know he messed up
But let a real nigga make it right
Let a real nigga make it right, you deserve that much
Let me put something in your life
Let me put something in your life, put something in your life
You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with
I'ma trust you, I'ma give you the benefit of the doubt and I'ma love you
You can even call me daddy, give you someone to look up to

And my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now, need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now, need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now, need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504
Need to drop it right now, need to drop it right now, oh

After you back it up then stop (back it up, baby)
After you back it up then stop, uh
Hey, baby girl, after you back it up then stop
Yeah, girl, after you back it up then stop

I can tell that money's got you working
Got your body so wet
And we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me
