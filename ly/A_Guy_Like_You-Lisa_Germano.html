		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't hear anything
You can yell, you can scream
I got my things to do anyway
Far from you

You are this baby
Pulls me down angry
I don't care anyhow
People just let me down
I just get angrier

You say that love is it
All of it, a bunch of shit
I'll ruin everything
Peace of mind, or a ring

What makes me angry
Just makes you sad
This should be easier
Maybe if I could hear

But I'll just get angrier
And close my eyes
And wish away
Hide it inside, nobody knows

I just get angrier
There's something you need me for
But I can't give anymore
I gave it all away
Less and less every day

What makes you crazy takes me there, too
I just expect it to
Trying to be a guy like you

Walk away
Intoxicate
Nobody knows
I can't hear anything
