		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
And I don't want to fall in love
No I don't want to fall in love
With you

What a wicked game you played to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
And I don't want to fall in love
No I don't want to fall in love
With you, with you

And I don't want to fall in love
No I don't want to fall in love
With you, with you
