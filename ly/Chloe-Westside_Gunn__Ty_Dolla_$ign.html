		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, come here, bitch
Yeah
Let me change ya life (let me change your life, let me change your life, ooh)

Ayo, I eat yo pussy anywhere just say it (say it)
Fuck your, how you want to play it (woo, woo, woo, fuck that nigga)
In Santorini twin white Lamborghinis
Take my heart, bitch, please believe me (please believe me)

Fuck you from the back
Hands around your throat (ah)
You sweating' on the Rose, bitch, I'm tryin' to kill you
Tryin' to kill you
Tryin' to kill you (tryin' to kill you), tryin' to kill you (kill you)
Tryin' to kill you, tryin' to kill you
Come here, kiss my hand, bitch (kiss my hand, bitch)
Make you understand shit
We spent 50k on Venice coco (Venice coco)
Another 50k, we in fuckin' Soho (fuckin' Soho)

Grab you four heels, now I'm really in it (ah)
Spit in yo' mouth for talking too much, bitch, mind your business (mind your business, ho)
You used to run from the dick
Now you put it up and have fun on dick
Catch you eatin' pussy, put the tongues on the bitch (woo)
You the prettiest when I nut on you, bitch woo, ooh
folk mad, best sex both had
give my pussy away its toe tag

Beat it up, beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
Lately ain't been holdin' back on that cat, on the pussy killer
Fuck on y'all, as soon as I'm done she gone sound that nigga
Deep in her box I been swimmin'
I'm a dolphin in it
I'm a dog, he a lizard
On my pinky ring it's a blizzard
I'ma put dick in her kizzy
While her man textin he missin'
While I'm readin' her raw not a swisher
I've been really ballin' last ten years
I've been fuckin' my side bitch for seven
Deep down, I know she really want a wedding
Deep down in the back of your walls, I'll knock
Who is it? I can't stay the night, I came for a visit
She kiss it from the tip to these balls
Gotta scream she ain't doin' no whisper
Please believe me, yeah

Hand on your throat (ah)
Skirtin' on the rolls, bitch, I'm tryin' to kill you
Tryin' to kill you
Tryin' to kill you (tryin' to kill you), tryin' to kill you (kill you)
Tryin' to kill you, tryin' to kill you
Come here, kiss my hand, bitch (kiss my hand, bitch)
Make you understand shit
We spent 50k on Venice coco (Venice coco)
Another 50k, we in fuckin' Soho (yeah, fuckin' Soho)

Like I said before
The Earth is 4 and a half billions years old
And you're lucky enough to be livin' in the super Flygod era
