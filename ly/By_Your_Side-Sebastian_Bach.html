		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So long my dear departed 
Where did you go 
I can't believe you're gone and 
The lights go on so slow 
I'm missing you each morning
Days gone by
Again I feel the longing
To look you in the eye

You know I'll never let you go 
You know I'll never hurt so bad 
And if It takes a thousand Years 
I will be right there by Your Side 
You know I'll never hurt so much 
When I lost you I was blind 
And every time I catch me with tears 
I will be right there by your side 

I Feel you when you're watching from afar 
To Young to leave me standing 
I wonder where you are 
The precious time we spent 
My fondest memories 
I'll hold on to the promise 
That You Made To Me 

You know I'll never let you go 
You know I'll never hurt so bad 
And if It takes a thousand Years 
I will be right there by Your Side 
You know I'll never hurt so much 
When I lost you I was blind 
And every time I catch me with tears 
You are right there by my side 

I stare into his eyes and then I see your face 
A dying love inside 
A love you can't replace 
You're looking down with pride 
And let me show what I Can tell 

So long my dear departed
Where did you go
I cant believe your gone, and
My life goes on so slow

You know I'll never let you go 
You know I'll never hurt so bad 
And if It takes a thousand Years 
I will be right there By Your Side 
You know I'll never hurt so much 
When I lost you I was blind 
And every time I catch me with tears 
You are right there by my side
