		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching you watching me
I was hoping you'd be here tonight
Watching him watching you
He'd better watch out too
'Coz he keeps getting in my light
I think he's going overload
Don't know what you're running for
He thinks he's got you where he wants you babe
But he don't understand the power of the claw
The claw, the claw, the claw

You know me I know you
We both know what we came here fore
And he think he knows you
He thinks he's got you too
Gonna make him cry for sure
He's going to have to make his own way home
I don't know what's he's smiling for
He thinks you're gonna keep your promises babe
But he don't understand the power of the claw
The claw, the claw, the claw

Me walking up to you
And whisper in your eager ear
You whisper back to me
And he begins to see
He feel the claw is near.

And so the ballet starts again
Exit stage left through the door
And we begin the horizontal dance
And he begins to know just what the claw is for
The claw, the claw, the claw, the claw
The claw, the claw, the claw, the claw

You know just what the claw is for
You know just what the claw is for
You know just what the claw is for
I know what my claw is for
