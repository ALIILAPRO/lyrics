		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fly boy yeah right
Hey mama they call me Weezy
You should be with me I gotta pocket of full of reasons
Baby I can bless you when you ain't even sneezing
I'll be at your rescue you don't even need me
I can have you dreaming when you even sleeping
Mama I can help you get off like the weekend
She said she wanna do it to the new Enrique
I pop the disc in and put the song on replay
And then she backed it up like replay

When you need it
Girl I try to hide it
But I can't escape it, oh baby
Please forgive me,
when I think of you my thoughts are so x-rated, oh baby
Baby I don't give a damn,
I know that your man's nowhere in sight
Our eyes don't tell a lie,
I know you wanna come with me tonight
And I say alright
First you gotta

Push push back upon it (girl)
Make me believe you want it
Push push back upon it (girl)
Well I can go all mornin'
Push push back upon it (girl)
Go ahead lay it on it
Don't stop until the mornin' (girl)
Just keep pushing back on it

Oh yeah you know it (do you need me)
You know it (will you please me)
You know it (will you tease me)
You know it

Baby I,
I'm the kinda guy that don't get real excited
oh baby

When you have,
When you have you're private party
I you hope that I'm invited, oh baby
Baby I don't give a damn,
I know that your man's nowhere in sight, oh oh
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me tonight
And I see you right
First you gotta

Push push back upon it (girl)
Make me believe you want it
Push push back upon it (girl)
Well I can go all mornin'
Push push back upon it (girl)
Go ahead lay it on it
Don't stop until the mornin' (girl)
Just keep pushing back on it

After you bag it up just stop
No drop it like it's hot, no pop it like a glock
No stop it like a watch, now move it like clockwork
Your body is screamin' and your booty is an outburst
She wanna do it, do it with no delay
I told her I could run it, run it just like relay
'Cause I'm cool,
Just like the breeze-way now pushin' like salt and p-e-p-p-a

Push push back upon it (girl)
Make me believe you want it
Push push back upon it (girl)
Well I can go all mornin'
Push push back upon it (girl)
Go ahead lay it on it
Don't stop until the mornin' (girl)
Just keep pushing back on it

Push push back upon it (girl)
Make me believe you want it
Push push back upon it (girl)
Well I can go all mornin'
Push push back upon it (girl)
Go ahead lay it on it
Don't stop until the mornin' (girl)
Just keep pushing back on it

Push push girl
Mr. Morales
Push push girl
Push push girl
Push push
