		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn, I'm alone again
But I don't wanna call my friends (call my friends)
'Cause I don't wanna bother them (bother them)
These days, been so locked in (locked in)
Studio, my crib, my head (my head)
Fell off, had to get my bread right (get my bread)
Still no woman in my bed (bed)
More and more bros on to the married life

When the day is done, I still roll one up (I still roll one up)
And I wish you well
Though we ain't keepin' in touch (we ain't keepin' in touch)
I'll be back when I dig my mind out the mud (dig my mind out the mud)
So afraid to fail that I ain't movin' in love

I been waitin' out
For a long, long time
I been waitin' out
Waitin' out

Oh, here we go again
Will it all end? I just don't know when
All in my head, can't help myself
Don't know what it is (don't know what it is)
Feelin' like I'm in over my head
Worried I might not know what's next
Maybe I'll try to deal with it instead

Oh, when the day's done, feel like I'm not doin' enough (doin' enough)
Reminiscin' on every time I've given up (time I've given up)
Thinkin' back when I knew it was all because (knew it was all because)
I'm so afraid to fail, probably just thinkin' too much
Too much

I've been waitin' out
Mm, for a long, long time
Mm, I've been waitin' out
