		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try hard to be good to you baby
It's been a while since we felt like us
The pressure keeps on building up lately
Can you see what we've become

You staying inside at home
Doesn't help a thing
You saying it's fine
But I know
It's never gonna change here

Fragile eyes
Is my light too bright?
For your fragile eyes
Does it shine too bright?
 
I work hard and what's wrong with it?
This is not a race
Stop making it one
Is it cause I'm younger than you are?
Or that I'm a woman
You feel less of a real man

You staying inside at home
Doesn't help a thing babe
You're saying it's fine
But I know
Things are gonna change here 
So I had to get away for two months
Tryna get my head straight
I gotta find my way
I'm done

Fragile eyes
Is my light too bright?
For your fragile eyes
Does it shine too bright, for ya
Fragile eyes
I don't want to hide
What I feel inside, is my light too bright?
For your fragile eyes

When I'm high you're low
No room to grow
I'm just trying to do my thing
Why you gotta make it like this
When I'm high your low
I've got to go
I'm just trying to do my own thing
Why you gotta make it like this
