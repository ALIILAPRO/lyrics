		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can rock it, you can suck it
You can even put on your brand new jacket
Because I'm the man who can put you in the musical brackets

Party like it's 1980
With the afro shiny and the girls all purty
With a white girl molly
And a dark-skinned Kylie
Can I rock both bodies?
New 'Rari, how I ride both shotty, uh
Keep the table, can we boogie on the floor?
I've been stressin' all week
Tryna clear it through the door now
Ballin' like LeBron now
Shots like a pro now
Hella weed, yeah goes 'round
Let me tell you how it goes down
I ain't drivin' when it's goin'
Now pour me another cup
This your favorite song on
Don't tell me you in a rush
When I give you all I have
You tell me it ain't enough
I've been tryna clear our mind
And wine and dine ya
See I know just how you like it
I'll back behind ya
If I look up at the stars ain't hard to find ya, ayy

Passin' all them haters, cash out (cash out)
Smashin' up, them 'Raris dash out (cash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count until we pass out
Passin' all them haters, cash out (cash out)
Smashin' up, them 'Raris dash out (cash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count it up until we pass out

Yeah, uh, we gon' party like it's 1980
In a buggy-eyed 'Cedes
Or a dopeboy Caddy
With a nickel bag baggie, gold Rolex
Timin' for your climax climbin'
Got the bedsheets jumpin'
When your heartbeat poppin'
And your love keep comin'
Shake somethin', break somethin'
Shit I'm tryna work somethin'
Show you right, motorbike
You could ride me overnight, uh
Never been one to judge
We restin' back at the club
Put it down from above
Your body my only drug
We do it like Vegas
Rich and famous
We doin' it major
We wakin' the neighbors

Passin' all them hater, cash out (cash out)
Smashin' up, them 'Raris dash out (cash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count until we pass out
Passin' all them haters, cash out (cash out)
Smashin' up, them 'Raris dash out (cash out)
'Member all them nights we used to trap out?
Now we count it up until we pass out

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah), yeah, yeah
Okay, okay, okay, it's on
Hey

Let's party like the '70s
Blowin' on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah yeah
Let's party like the '70s
Blowin' on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah yeah
Let's party like the '70s
Blowin' on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah yeah
Let's party like the 70's
Blowing on hella tree
Broccoli and collard greens (collard greens)
It don't matter to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

Collard greens, to me
We play, babe
