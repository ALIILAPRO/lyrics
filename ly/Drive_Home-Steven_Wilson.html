		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold windowpane
A car upturned in the rain
Wait on in vain
Don't try to bear the blame
Deal with the pain
Dust down your wings again

You need to clear away
All the jetsam in your brain
And face the truth
Well love can make amends
But while the darkness always ends
You're still alone
So drive home

Pause without end
A moment in time suspends
How could she leave?
Release all your guilt and breathe
Give up your pain
Hold up your head again

You need to clear away
All the jetsam in your brain
And face the truth
Well love can make amends
While the darkness always ends
You're still alone
So drive home

Drive home
Drive home

Drive home
Drive home

Drive home
Drive home

Drive home
Drive home
(Drive home)
