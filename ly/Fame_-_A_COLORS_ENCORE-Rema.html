		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No no no no no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Eh no no no no no
Yah

Shit I think I changed
Things don't feel the same
I don't wanna play no games
Since I got this fame
It's been so hard to love again
Girl your love is in vain
Now you feel the shame
Girl you told me no
Because I wasn't getting paid

These hoes I can't blame
Nobody feeling my pain
I don't wanna stretch my limbs
And now they think am doing the same
Things don't feel the same
I don't wanna play no games
Since I got this fame
It's been so hard to love again

Don't ever trust nobody
Don't trust your friends
Tell me what is in the pictures
They wanna take your plans
Store it all on me
I know they gonna ask me where I've been
Girl I have been trying to love you but
But all the time
I would never taste
Always on a roll
I would never rest
You starring at me
She is looking upset
I would never love back
I would never care
Make my money I wanna invest
She so so prize that I never had sex
Yes till now
That's my taste
Even if am down
I will never confess

Shit now change
Things don't feel the same
I don't wanna play no games
Since I got this fame
It's been so hard to love again
Girl your love is in vain
Now you feel the shame
Girl you told me no
Because I wasn't getting paid
