		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet it feels so right
To give up my control
Wish I could let you lead
Like on and on and on

I've been running
I've been hiding
I'm so tired of being scared
To fall
To fall for you

The rhythm is driving me mad
Got no escape from this one
The danger I smell is cold as ice

My stories on rewind
Wish I could turn them off
Fighting to let you in
Like on and on and on

I've been running
I've been hiding
I'm so tired of being scared
To fall
To fall for you

The rhythm is driving me mad
Got no escape from this one
The danger I smell is cold as ice

Oh I
I can't wait to try
I just wanna make you feel all alright
Uuuu
Make you feel all alright
