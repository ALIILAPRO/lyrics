		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey now, could we stop the world tonight?
Just wanna lay down and feel your body close to mine
All I wanna hear you say is that we never gonna leave this place
But if we ever fade away, I hope you know

I'm feeling so high when we're together
Yeah, let's make it last forever
We'll stay young, stay young
We are the perfect lovers
Don't care about the others
I wanna stay young, stay young with you

I wanna stay young
I wanna stay young with you

Hey now, we are young and wild and free
I just wanna shake out all the love inside of me
Underneath the golden sky we sit and watch the evening tide
I see the fire in your eyes and I gotta say

I'm feeling so high when we're together
Yeah, let's make it last forever
We'll stay young, stay young
We are the perfect lovers
Don't care about the others
I wanna stay young, stay young with you

I wanna stay young

I'm feeling so high when we're together
Yeah, let's make it last forever
I wanna stay young, stay young with you
