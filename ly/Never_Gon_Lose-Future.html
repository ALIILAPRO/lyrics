		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, this bitch from Australian and I'm an alien
(808 Mafia)

I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy
But I love it baby
When I jump out the whip 
When I hop out the whip 
Then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink till I pass out I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch 
Then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter
In the sewer, the streets turn a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger
I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super cause she got that super
When I say super that's young Super Future
We never gone lose, we never gone lose

Never gone lose, 'cause these bitches gone choose
These bitches gone be who they is
Walking and talking like classy
You hold to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be working that boy, I'm a pour it
Serving that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playing my cards
Whip after whip pulled up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of that dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally then gather the squad
Yeah gather the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafucking tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothing but avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swerving on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol

I remember nights in Europe saying we ain't falling off
I'm on a lotta green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
They got a magazine with no Visine
Just riding around with this forty
She gone thug for me, she gone thug for me
In Ohio, that's my shorty
We ain't playing around this dungarees
We gon' go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me and then copy
They wasn't playing fair no, no, no, no, no, no
Bitch is a bozo, she counting the photos
We sell the coco you talking to popo
You know that's a no, though, you know whats a no, no
You know that's a no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Came at the door, pour, serve out the paddy door
Bitch, I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch, you stepping in, no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back to back, back, back to back with these stallions
Like she trunk after trunk, I just carry on
Got the sack on me now I just carry it
Got some Ms in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some Ms, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagon, 56 nights I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Ladin

I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy
But I love it baby
When I jump out the whip 
When I hop out the whip 
Then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch 
Then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter
In the sewer, the streets turn a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger
I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super cause she got that super
When I say super that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose

Woo
These bitches gon' choose
We never gon' lose
