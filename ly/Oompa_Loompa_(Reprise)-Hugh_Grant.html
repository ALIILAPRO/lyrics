		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oompa loompa doompety doo
I've got a little bonus for you
Sit back down and stay in your seat
For a last oompa-loomparous treat

Abacus Crunch returned to his home
Benz to her friends, Lottie Bell to her phones
Brave Larry made a triumphant comeback
One day, his ex wife saw the act
Laughed a lot and took him back

Oompa loompa doompety day
But what of Mrs. Scrubbit and Bleacher, you say?
Give me just a moment or two
And I'll oompa loompa show it to you

Uh, I do beg your pardon
What is wrong with this infernal machine?
I'll show it to you
There, much better
