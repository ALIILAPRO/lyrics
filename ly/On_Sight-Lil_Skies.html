		<p>
		  Ayy, uh, uh-huh
Uh, my sight
Woah, my sight, yeah
My sight
This is how we do it, my sight
Woah, for my sight (Pharaoh got that heat yo)

Ayy, ayy, ayy, it's on sight
I got thirty shooters with me, it's on sight
Nigga say he comin' for me, not hard to find
I ain't never runnin from you, I never hide
Yeah, nigga on my sight
This is how we do it, lil' nigga on my sight
Yeah, on my sight
This is how we do it lil' nigga on my sight

Lil' nigga, big wheels, pimp rides
Lil' shorty ride the dick, pussy tight
Nigga stalkin' me like he don't got a life
I don't trust nobody while I'm out of sight
I got hella problems, thinkin' I'ma die
Roll the leaf up and I take it like a flight
Lately I'm not in the mood, I ain't nice
Yeah, nigga, I ain't nice, uh
Roll it up and we get high
She just hit the blunt and committed a suicide
Lil' bitch, let's go die
Take another puff and we matchin', these hella vibes

Ayy, it's on sight
I got thirty shooters with me, it's on sight
Nigga say he comin' for me, not hard to find
I ain't never runnin from you, I never hide
Yeah, nigga on my sight
This is how we do it, lil' nigga on my sight
Yeah, on my sight
This is how we do it lil' nigga on my sight

Ayy, you switch, you lie
Make the money, stack and save it up for baby Ki
I give him everything, I promise a better life
I love you forever son, hug you and hold you tight
Ayy, but they switch, they lied
I make my money, stack and save it up for baby Ki
I give him everything, I promise a better life
I love you forever son, hug you and hold you tight
Yeah and fuck what them people saying 
Yeah
Uh-huh, uh-uh, uh-huh, uh-uh
Uh-huh, uh-uh, uh, yeah
