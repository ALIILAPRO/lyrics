		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was her heart that he was stealin'
Oh, he was ready to impress
And the fierce excitement, the eyes are bright
He couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it
That bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holdin' hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somehow they could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it
That bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know
