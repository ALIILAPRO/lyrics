		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
You're like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, (oh) I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
Just like a dream to me 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
It's like a dream to me 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
It's like a dream to me 
Oh

(Thank you)
