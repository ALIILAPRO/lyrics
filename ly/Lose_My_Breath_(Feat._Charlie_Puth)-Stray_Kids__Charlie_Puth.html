		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops

It only took me a moment
And now I'm imprisoned to your touch (whoa)
I, I don't know where it's going now
But I know I need your love

Now, I'll always be here, I won't ever run
'Cause you took the air right out of my lungs

Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
You make my knees drop, it's like I'm in shock
Now, all I think about is how
My world turned upside down
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops

Right now, I feel like dying and I'm lying
On the tilings when you walk in the room
Freezing but you're steaming
Yeah, catch my breath every time you make a move
Can you be a part of my life?
Girl, I need you right by my side
When I look at your eyes
I'm out of breath (I'm out of breath)

Now, I'll always be here, I won't ever run
'Cause you took the air right out of my lungs

Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
You make my knees drop, it's like I'm in shock
Now, all I think about is how
My world turned upside down
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops

Oh, I feel like there's something comin' over me
I feel like there's something comin' over me
Oh, I feel like there's something comin' over me
Over me, over me
Your lips on my lips make me lose my, ah, ah
Baby, keep 'em there 'til there's no air in my chest
I lose my breath

Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops (no)
Ah, I lose my breath (my breath) when you're walkin' in (walkin' in)
You make my knees drop (you don't know), it's like I'm in shock
Now, all I think about is how
My world turned upside down (I lose my breath)
Ah, I lose my breath (when you're walkin' in)
When you're walkin' in ('cause when our eyes lock)
'Cause when our eyes lock (it's like my heart stops)
It's like my heart stops

Ooh
Baby, I lose my, lose my breath, yeah
