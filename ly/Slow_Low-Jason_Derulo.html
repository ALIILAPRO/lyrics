		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me hit in slow motion
If you keep it up, girl, I'ma run out of Trojans
Let's savor the moment, yeah
I know you couldn't wait to bust it wide open

Ooh-na-na-na, slow the tempo
Ooh-la-la-la, keep it simple
Good things gonna come if you just wait
She ride me faster and faster
And she do it with passion
I feel it comin', it's comin'
So baby, slow down
She ride me faster and faster
Don't know how long I can last, yeah
I feel it comin', it's comin'
So baby, slow down

Let me love you
Slow, low-low, low-low-low
Slow, low, low-low-low
Slow, low-low, low-low-low
Let me love you
Slow, low-low, low-low-low
Slow, low, low-low-low
Slow, low-low, low-low-low
Let me love you slow

How you do that with your body?
All them positions you get from pilates
Girl, you ride like Ferrari
Gonna hit the brake, brake, tryna make it to the mornin'

Ooh-na-na-na, slow the tempo
Ooh-la-la-la, keep it simple
Good things gonna come if you just wait
She ride me faster and faster
And she do it with passion
I feel it comin', it's comin'
So baby, slow down
She ride me faster and faster
Don't know how long I can last, yeah
I feel it comin', it's comin'
So baby, slow down

Let me love you
Slow, low-low, low-low-low
Slow, low, low-low-low (slow)
Slow, low-low, low-low-low
Let me love you
Slow, low-low, low-low-low (slow it down)
Slow, low, low-low-low
Slow, low-low, low-low-low
Let me love you slow

Let me love you slow
I love it when you say
Jason Derulo, lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Slow, low-low, low, low
