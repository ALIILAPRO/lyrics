		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear "I love you" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again (breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again (breathe again)
Yeah

And I can't stop thinking about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinking about
About the love that you made to me
And I can't get you out of my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And throw my heart away?
And I can't stop caring about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doing without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide you won't see me again

If I never feel you in my arms again (again)
If I never feel your tender kiss again (again)
If I never hear "I love you" now and then (and then)
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again (breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again (breathe again)

And I can't stop thinking about
About the way my life would be
No, I can't stop thinking about
How could you love me then leave?
And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I've tried
And if you walk right out my life, God knows I'm sure to die
And I can't stop doing without, no
(Without the rhythm of my heart)
No, I can't stop doing without, no
(For I will surely fall apart)
And I can't get you out of my mind
('Cause I know I can't deny)
And I would die if you decide you won't see me again

If I never feel you in my arms again (if I never, ever see you)
If I never feel your tender kiss again (no, no, no, no)
If I never hear "I love you" now and then (now and then)
Will I never make love to you once again? (never make love, never make love)
Please, please, please understand, if love ends (if it should ever end)
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again, no, no, no (breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again (breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again, no, no, no (breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again (breathe again)
