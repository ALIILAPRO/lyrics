		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, C5

Don't cry, don't go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa

Why y'all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga who done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind, even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I'm hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the fountain of youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads "Don't cry, stay tuned"
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you (don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is god-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble and
Conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like "dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
It's suicide or it's do or die
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I'll give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll

Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry), I fuckin' love you
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you (don't cry)

Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise
