		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a little sugar in my bowl
I want a little sweetness down in my soul
I could stand some lovin', oh so bad
Feel so funny, I feel so sad

I want a little steam on my clothes
Maybe I could fix things up so they'll go
What's the matter daddy, come on, save my soul

I need some sugar in my bowl, I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar in my bowl

You been acting different I've been told
Soothe me, I want some sugar in my bowl

I want a little steam on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
What's the matter daddy, come on, save my soul

I want some sugar in my bowl, I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar 
In my bowl
