		  What?

Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house
Jump out that bitch (what?), jump out that bitch (what?)
Jump out that bitch (what?), jump out that bitch (what?)
Jump out that bitch (what?), jump out that bitch (I jump out that bitch, what?)
Jump out that bitch (jump out that bitch, what?)
Jump out that bitch (jump out that bitch, what?)

Yeah, racks, I'm talkin' 'bout my motherfuckin' bitch (what?)
Racks, I'm talkin' 'bout my motherfuckin' bitch (what?)
Racks, I'm talkin' 'bout my motherfuckin' bitch (what?)
Racks, I'm talkin' 'bout my motherfuckin' bitch (what?)
Bags, I got them bags, bitch (what?)
Bags, I got them bags, bitch (what?)
Bags, I got a fast car
Bags, I ain't even drive it
Fit, I ain't even drive it (what?)
Fit, I ain't even drive it (what?)
Fit, I ain't even drive it (what?)
I ain't even drive it
SRT, with no mileage
SRT, it's not silent (yeah)

Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house, jump out the house (what?)
Jump out the house
Jump out that bitch (what?), jump out that bitch (what?)
Jump out that bitch (what?), jump out that bitch (what?)
Jump out that bitch (what?), jump out that bitch (I jump out that bitch, what?)
Jump out that bitch (jump out that bitch, what?)
Jump out that bitch (what?)
