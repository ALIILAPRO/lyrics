		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once I heard a Robin, who really sang like no one else
He could make me a believer, and I’d forgive him nonetheless.
I’m still haunted by the beauty, of the songs before the fall
open like a satellite receiver, without them I’d be nowhere at all

The Tower you hold so dear, you worship your undoing
Brick by brick into the sky as you fade into ruin.
Fly, into the sundown
you can hide beyond the blinds of the sunlight
I promise I’ll be here waiting
-for you to join me at this side of love

Society’s mutation, can really turn your heart to stone
and mould your face to nothing and thus becoming a true unknown
Underneath the golden calf, the crawling king snake is gonna crawl
-and mute your songs of beauty, if you all gonna answer his call.

By the Tower you hold so dear, you worship your undoing
Brick by brick into the sky as you fade into ruin.
Fly, into the sundown
you can hide beyond the blinds of the sunlight
I promise I’ll be here waiting
-for you to join me at this side of love
