		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There must be something wrong with me
What it is I can't quite see
I can't seem to do nothing right.
Maybe I need to change my style
Been this way for a long long while
Maybe there's a few things I ought to fix.
Can you teach an old dog new tricks?
Wanna put a little fire in my life
Climb a little higher, did it right
Tired of this ordinary bullshit.
Maybe I need to change my style
Been this way for a long long while
Maybe there's a few things I ought to fix.
Can you teach an old dog new tricks?
Can you teach an old dog new tricks?
Well, that right
Maybe I should leave well enough alone
I might not be perfect but I'm me to the bone
I don't need to change my style
Been this way for a long long while
There ain't nothing that I got to fix
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
You can't teach an old dog
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't teach an old dog new
You can't teach an old dog
You can't teach an old dog
You can't teach
You can't teach
You can't teach
