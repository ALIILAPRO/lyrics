		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it hurts
It's hard to breathe sometimes
These nights are long
You've lost the will to fight

Is anybody out there?
Can you lead me to the light?
Is anybody out there?
Tell me it'll all be alright

You are not alone
I've been here the whole time singing you a song (ooh)
I will carry you, I will carry you

I know you can't remember how to shine
Your heart's a bird without the wings to fly

Is anybody out there?
Can you take this weight of mine?
Is anybody out there?
Can you lead me to the light?

You are not alone
I've been here the whole time singing you a song (ooh)
I will carry you, I will carry you

You are not alone
I've been here the whole time

You are not alone
I've been here the whole time singing you a song (ooh)
I will carry you, I will carry you
(Is anybody out there?)
I will carry you, I will carry you
Is anybody out there?

I know it hurts
It's hard to breathe sometimes
