		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunsets and summer nights
She's dancing on my mind
Texts and says she'll be outside in five

Tan lines, indigo eyes
I'm barely still alive
But I turned around and put it into drive

Looking ahead till we're out of sight
Fleeting dreams under pink skies
Till the end of these city lights
Get us out of this paradise

I'm talking syncopated breathing
In love every evening
Going three, six, five were dancing every night
Fading in and out feeling
But permanently high
I'm talking you and i
Going 365

Sunrise and summer skies
Were never far from home
I'll always keep my eyes up on the road

Cheap clubs and coffee cups
Are all we'll ever know
But anywhere with you could feel like rome

Looking ahead till we're out of sight
Fleeting dreams under pink skies
Till the end of these city lights
Get us out of this paradise 
I'm talking syncopated breathing
And love in the evening
Going three, six, five were dancing every night
Fading in and out feeling
But permanently high
I'm talking you and I
Going 365

Going 365
We're going 365
