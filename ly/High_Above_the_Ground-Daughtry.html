		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I both, we come from different worlds
I'm a small town kid and you're an uptown girl
We've both been hurt, we got a few scars
But it don't matter now, we're staring at the stars

When it comes to my heart you gotta catch and fall
Deep down in my soul I know that I would die
If I didn't have you how could I ever fly?
A hundred miles beyond the sky

It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we never coming down
'Til we want to
But why would we want to?

It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we never coming down
'Til we want to
But why would we want to now?

Remember that day, we knew it from the start
We've come a long way and we're gonna go far
I see the future in your eyes
Forever and always, you and I

It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we never coming down
'Til we want to
But why would we want to?

It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we never coming down
'Til we want to
But why would we want to now?

When we're so close to heaven
Then we gonna like this paradise
It's gonna be too hard to say
Goodnight yeah

It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we never coming down
'Til we want to
But why would we want to?

It's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we never coming down
'Til we want to
But why would we want to?

Oh, it's feeling like we're high above the ground
It's feeling like we never coming down
'Til we want to
But why would we want to now?
