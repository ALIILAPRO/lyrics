		  (EarDrummers)

Ain't beat a bitch in a motherfuckin' minute
I'm back puttin' hoes in the ground
First nigga play with my motherfuckin' paper
I'm back with a whole hundred rounds (bitch)
Diamonds makin' 'em drown (ooh)
Pounds, let's got to town (go)
Blew through the bag like the money at Magic
It's money all over the ground (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin'
Shawty in the club shakin' ass, make it clap somethin'
Clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin'
Havin' beef with me over niggas 'cause he clap somethin'

Makin' it clap like I won a award
I up the score, put that shit on the board
Oh, that's your nigga? I seen him before
Pussy like water, he drink it like Core
Attitude stank, fuck an impression
Beefin' with me, ho, what's the aggression?
Throwin' this money like fuck a recession
Went to see Usher, he givin' confession (hahahaha)
P bitch, I ride it good when he need it
Ho, it ain't beef if I don't never see it
You think you tough? You wanna repeat it?
All in my guts, you mad 'cause he beat it? (Ayy)
Feelin' like Simon, he do what I say
I need some love, I'm callin' your bae
Treat me like Party, I'm gettin' my way (oh, I like this)

Ain't beat a bitch in a motherfuckin' minute
I'm back puttin' hoes in the ground (baow)
First nigga play with my motherfuckin' paper
I'm back with a whole hundred rounds (bitch)
Diamonds makin' 'em drown (ooh)
Pounds, let's got to town (go)
Blew through the bag like the money at Magic
It's money all over the ground (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin'
Shawty in the club shakin' ass, make it clap somethin'
Clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin', clap somethin'
Havin' beef with me over niggas 'cause he clap somethin'
