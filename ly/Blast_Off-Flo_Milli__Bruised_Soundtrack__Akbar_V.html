		  Flo Milli shit
(I want the cash like Diego)
(BankRollGotIt)
Uh

Fresh out, I hopped out the bed, turned my swag on (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm plugged in but this ain't no add on (no)
I'm allergic to broke niggas, back off (eww, why?)
Used to be broke, now I'm flexin', huh
Like I just took my cast off (ayy, ayy, hold on, hold on)
Three, two, one (ayy), watch a bitch blast off (haha)

Got my own style, don't follow no trends (no)
I want the Range, don't fuck with the Benz
Makeup on point, everything blend
I'm good by myself, I don't need me no friends (fuck y'all)
They gon' be rappin' this shit like a milli' though (ooh)
No comparison, this a Flo Milli flow
Diamonds be dancin', your shit lookin' silly though
And this pussy stay tight like a Cheerio (ooh, tight)
I'm 'bout to kill 'em, ooh, no this ain't Terrio
I got rich over night, now my pockets on swole
You bitches be birds, pigeons and crows
I look good in real life, bitch, I don't need a edit (I do)
Fuck what you heard, if I said it, I said it (ho)
I been the wave, better give me my credit
I be runnin' these beats, so they think I'm athletic

Fresh out, I hopped out the bed, turned my swag on (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm plugged in but this ain't no add on (no)
I'm allergic to broke niggas, back off (eww, why?)
Used to be broke, now I'm flexin', huh
Like I just took my cast off (ayy, ayy, hold on, hold on)
Three, two, one (ayy), watch a bitch blast off

I took off like a rocket
I got your favorite rapper in my pocket (ooh)
Look at my fit, ho, this shit is nostalgic (it is)
Bought a new bag, but you shouldn't have bought it (hoe)
Bitches be beggin' for Birkins but can't pay their rent
So, if that nigga dub you, don't call me to vent
If it don't make a dollar, it don't make no sense
I'm in the mansion, your shit like a tent (damn)
I got the world goin' crazy when they heard my voice on these motherfuckin' songs (ooh, I do)
My body is snatched (meow), this pussy is tight (haha) 
My ass is too fat to be wearin' these thongs (it is)
He tryna lick it up like it's a ice cream (lick it up)
Callin' me rude, but he know that I'm feisty (haha)
I be knockin' these bitches out like it's a fight scene
I be knockin' these bitches out like it's a fight scene

Fresh out, I hopped out the bed, turned my swag on (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm plugged in but this ain't no add on (no)
I'm allergic to broke niggas, back off (eww, why?)
Used to be broke, now I'm flexin', huh
Like I just took my cast off (ayy, ayy, hold on, hold on)
Three, two, one (ayy, uh?), watch a bitch blast off (go)

A hundred K on my Patek (uh)
And I still don't know how to set it
I'm fuckin' with a rich ass boss right now 
And that nigga know how to bet it
Got boogers in my ear, lookin' snotty-nosed
What I paid for this bag cost a lotta Os
Broke hoes always statin' opinions
Bitch, stay out a rich bitch business (uh-huh)
Say he wanna see my Vickies on
Ass too fat, ain't got panties on
While I suck a nigga dick took his soul home
Then I'm on to the next with a bag on
I'm in a AMG, yeah, the fast one (skrrt)
This the talk that you talk when the bag long
I'm over mean 30, like Steph Curry (mean)
Y'all bitches my kids, don't need more lil' bitch, yeah

Fresh out (huh), I hopped out the bed, turned my swag on (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm plugged in but this ain't no add on (no)
I'm allergic to broke niggas, back off (eww, why?)
Used to be broke, now I'm flexin', huh
Like I just took my cast off (ayy, ayy, hold on, hold on)
Three, two, one (ayy), watch a bitch blast off (go)

Watch a bitch blast off
Three, two, one, watch a bitch blast off
Watch a bitch blast off
Three, two, one, watch a bitch blast off
