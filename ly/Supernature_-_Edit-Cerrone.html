		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time, science opened up the door
We would feed the hungry fields till they couldn't eat no more
But the potions that we made touched the creatures down below, oh
And they grew up in the way that we'd never seen before

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

They were angry with the man 'cause he changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge, as they trample through the night
For a hundred miles or more, you can hear the people cry
But there's nothin' you can do even God is on their side

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
