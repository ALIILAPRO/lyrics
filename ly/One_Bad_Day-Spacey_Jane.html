		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You called it a break
I'll call it the mourning
Everything we had
Everything I'm losing
Tell it all again
Start at the beginning
You say it's in my head
It's real because I feel it

Ooh, ah
This is the last time I feel like this
Or at least I hope it is
Ah, this is the last time I feel like this
Or at least I hope it is

One bad day
I lost my shit and called the week off
Got your way
You threw the baby out with the trough
It's not that bad if you think about it
You leaving now is a gun to my head

You called it a break
Call me in the morning
And it starts like this
Yeah, we've both been here before

Ooh, ah
This is the last time I feel like this
Or at least I hope it is

One bad day
I lost my shit and called the week off
Got your way
You threw the baby out with the trough
It's not that bad if you think about it
You leaving now is a gun to my head

Honey, won't you stay?
The overpass
Caught out in the rain
And under glass
Honey, won't you stay?
It all will pass
It all will pass
It all will pass

One bad day
I lost my shit and called the week off
Got your way
You threw the baby out with the trough
It's not that bad if you think about it
You leaving now is a gun to my head

Ooh, ah
This is the last time I feel like this
Or at least I hope it is
It's not that bad if you think about it
This is the last time I feel like this
Or at least I hope it is
