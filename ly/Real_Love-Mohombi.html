		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Neighbors been complaining saying that were
Getting way too loud
Tonight they're gonna call the cops thinking
That we had enough fight

I cant go thinking, no, about tomorrow
Got your body shaking
We scream and we shout and you end up on top
I like it when you

Girl, I like to make you angry
It turns me on
Cause that's when you do me like you hate me
Is that so wrong?

We fight, we cry, we break up just to make up
That's just the way it goes
When there's real love
We fight, we cry, we break up just to make up
That's just the way it goes
When there's real love

It's funny when you tell me you'll
Be leaving when the morning comes
But now were in the bed so I
Guess you didn't make it that far

I can't go thinking, no, about tomorrow
Got your body shaking
We scream and we shout and you end up on top
You never set me free

Girl, I like to make you angry
It turns me on
Cause that's when you do me like you hate me
Is that so wrong?

We fight, we cry, we break up just to make up
That's just the way it goes
When there's real love
We fight, we cry, we break up just to make up
That's just the way it goes
When there's real love

But we break up just to make up
Why we break up we break up just to make up
That's just the way it goes
When there's real love

We fight, we cry, we break up just to make up
That's just the way it goes
When there's real love
We fight, we cry, we break up just to make up
That's just the way it goes
When there's real love

We got that love, yeah
