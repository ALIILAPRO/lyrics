		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I only could deceive you
Forgetting the game
Every time I try to leave you
You laugh just the same

'Cause my wheels never touch the road
And the jumble of lies we told
Just returns to my back to weigh me down

We lay cards upon the table
The backs of our hands
And I swear I like your people
The boys in the band

Reminiscences gone astray
Coming back to enjoy the fray
In a tangle of night and daylight sounds

doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo

All completeness in the morning
Asleep on your side
I'll be waking up the crewmen
Banana-boat ride

She responds like limousine
Brought alive on the silent screen
To the shuddering breath of yesterday

There's the succor of the needy
Incredible scenes
I'll believe you in the future
Your life and death dreams

As the cavalry of despair
Takes a stand in the lady's hair
For the favor of making sweet sixteen

You make my life and times
A book of bluesy Saturdays
And I have to choose
