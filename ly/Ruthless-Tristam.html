		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had each other
Floating and tethered
You saw me broken
So you cut me open

It's like I don't even care at all
Thinking retrospectively 
I was narrowed in on a tear
As I was ripping the velvetine

Trust me I know it's real the pain you say that you feel
Trust me I know it's true I can be ruthless to you
Oh but I promise that it's only love that I feel
I wish I had some clue, why I'm so ruthless to you

Out in the open 
Loud when it's spoken
Even when I peak
I'm hopeless and I'm weak

It's like I don't even care at all
Thinking retrospectively 
I was narrowed in on a tear
As I was ripping the velvetine

Trust me I know it's real the pain you say that you feel
Trust me I know it's true I can be ruthless to you
Oh but I promise that it's only love that I feel
I wish I had some clue, why I'm so ruthless to you

Maybe a change in season,
With the falling leaves
Maybe a calming breeze will whisper through

I want to find the reason
Where I got this feeling
Why I'm ruthless to you
