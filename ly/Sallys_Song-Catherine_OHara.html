		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice my feelings for him
And will he see how much he means to me
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last
And will we ever end up together
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one
