		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Any other day, any other time, I'd be on my way
There was a time where you tried, and you said
"Why would you fight what was inside?"
That wasn't part of the plan
Now I know that I should go

Lookin' for some reasons
Tell me there's something wrong with it
Tell me there's something inside that I need
You know I'm not gonna stay the night, no
I just need one reason
I know there's nothing wrong with it
It's hard to pretend, it's not what I want
Way too close, you'll read my mind (yeah)

I know you got your reasons, yeah
I know the meanin'
I know you're still healin', baby
But you're still appealin'
Hope you don't think I'm reachin'
But I got feelings to the ceilin'
And I'm still in my feelings, gyal
You know you're very well-seasoned
I know you got your reasons, yeah
I know the meanin'
I know you're still healin', baby
But you're still appealin'
Hope you don't think I'm reachin'
But I got feelings to the ceilin'
And I'm still in my feelings, baby
You know you're very well-seasoned

I'm likin' the way that you talk to me nice
You know what you're doin', don't look in my eyes
Oh, that one time when I say what I say when the rum was over
Only been two times that we've done what we did
When I put it on you, when I put it on you

Lookin' for some reasons
Tell me there's something wrong with it
Tell me there's something inside that I need
You know I'm not gonna stay the night, no
I just need one reason
I know there's nothing wrong with it
Hard to pretend, it's not what I want
I want you to read my mind

I know you got your reasons, yeah
I know the meanin'
I know you're still healin', baby
But you're still appealin'
Hope you don't think I'm reachin'
But I got feelings to the ceilin'
And I'm still in my feelings, baby
You know you're very well-seasoned

In my feelings, I'm feelin' my sorrow
I want you today, I want you tomorrow
I want you to stay, I'm not gonna borrow
I steal you forever, I take you Morocco
Me and you together, you're drivin' me loco
I wanna be with you, I don't wanna be solo
J Hus, aka Elle Zollo
When you call me, I'll be there, comin' pronto
But I kept it G, I never spent a cobo
Make her splash and I dash, you know that's the motto
She drivin' me, I'm inside a moto
Your usna feels like I just won the lotto
Touchin' me, she feelin' my muscle
I spend time with you, I'm pausin' my hustle
Pour something in my cup, me and you are a couple
Bad man, but sometimes I wanna cuddle

I know you got your reasons, yeah
I know the meanin'
I know you're still healin', baby
But you're a still appealin'
Hope you don't think I'm reachin'
But I got feelings to the ceilin'
And I'm still in my feelings, gyal
You know you're very well-seasoned
I know you got your reasons, yeah
I know the meanin'
I know you're still healin', baby
But you're still appealin'
Hope you don't think I'm reachin'
But I got feelings to the ceilin'
And I'm still in my feelings, baby
You know you're very well-seasoned (baby)
