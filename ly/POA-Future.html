		  Oh yeah, Super Super
Astronaut, yeah

Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin' too specific
10 black whips I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches tell me if I'm too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought 'em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym

I'm 'bout to fuck up some mula, but you don't owe me no check
I don't care if you my daddy, bitch I'ma cut off your neck
We rockin' VV and Ss, I swear it'll get a lil' crowded
My chain, they fight for attention, my neck'll get a lil' rowdy
I'm doin' my thizzle my nizzle
I work me the price down the middle
I keep me a bag of those Skittles
Tryna get you a radical feelin'
Automatic, it came with no ceiling
All this trappin' it got you offended
Hit a 3-6-0 in a minute
Then I punch on the gas a lil' harder
I be whippin' the Lamb like a Charger
Get that money in the bag like a robber
When I whip it up, whip it up harder
To the young nigga rockin' the Starter
I was sittin' in the back of the MARTA
Now I sit in the back of a foreign
Soon as I took out the 'Rari
I got the clutch in the carbon

Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin' too specific
10 black whips I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches tell me if I'm too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought 'em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym

Why you be lookin' so foul
I put the hundreds in piles
We 'bout to roll up some Franklins
We 'bout to roll up some loud
You better stay in your lane
I'm swervin' all over the map
I got a Panamanian
With her pretty face all in my lap
I let her go to Sak's Fifth Avenue
Run up some laps
Sometimes I go to Chanel
And I sit in the bitch like it's a trap
Rolex store's my bando
Boy George Bush with the ammo
I spent an M on indo
Put it on an 18-wheeler
Trappin' and rappin', finessin'
I go beyond for the scrilla
Freezin' that ice out your chest
You lookin' just like a dealer
Add it all up on an iPad
Talk to the plug on a car phone
Went to Miami and re'd up
Rovers, push it

Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin' too specific
10 black whips I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches tell me if I'm too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought 'em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym

I'm 'bout to water whip it
So I could fuck up a bag
I'm 'bout to cop me a Mazzi
I'm 'bout to cop me a Jag
I done made 21 million
I got a zillion stacks
I done made 21 million
I had to run up a sack
I'm 'bout to twerk dem numbers
'Bout to go get me a hundred
I done went gram from gram
I done been workin' a hundred
I made a fair amount
Stunted and doubled my digits
Just know that Pluto is hungry
Like when I worked a midget
I am original gang member
I'm not a New Edition
They ain't gonna never be able to see me
I'm 'bout to make them admit it
Everywhere I go is Fiji
Everywhere shine for the city
Everywhere I go is foreign
Wake up, take out the ceiling

Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin' too specific
10 black whips I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches tell me if I'm too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought 'em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym
