		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  2 AM
They ran out of lemonade
So I shot that vodka straight, anyway
She came in
Missin' bottle off the shelf
I can't drink this by myself, sit with me, babe
Then I started laughin'
Like it was funny
But it really ain't funny, uh

Take me home, don't shut me out
It's easier to leave me down here on the ground
Take me home, baby, I'm fucked up now
I know it's easier to leave me down here on the ground

'Cause enough is enough
I can't stand up
I can't stand, can't stand, 'cause enough is enough

Long nights in the city of sin
They said I pick fights that I won't ever win
I got a bad bitch that'll bring all her friends
But when I'm with you it's like I'm livin' again
And baby, I'm shit-faced sittin' on the sidewalk
Ain't nobody listenin' when I talk
I fall down and laugh
But it really ain't funny, uh

Take me home, don't shut me out
It's easier to leave me down here on the ground
Take me home, baby, I'm fucked up now
I know it's easier to leave me down here on the ground

'Cause enough is enough (shut me out)
I can't stand up (I, I)
I can't stand, can't stand, 'cause enough is enough (I, I)
Ha, ha, I can't stand up
Ah-ah-ah, I, I can't stand, can't stand

2 AM
They ran out of lemonade
So I shot that vodka straight, anyway (ooh)
