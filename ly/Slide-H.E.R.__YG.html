		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always wearin' them glasses
You don't wanna let no sucka look you in your eyes, huh?
Better show off them eyelashes
You love what you do with a passion
Ooh that shit attractive
I fuck with you girl

All you wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way
Only keep the fam' around me
So let me know what it's gon' be
I don't plan on gettin' no sleep, while we

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
We up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise we be on it
Ooh I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?

Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide?
Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby, when we goin' slide?
Slide, slide, slide, slide

I don't care if we on the run
Nothin' matters when we one on one
Lookin' at us 'cause we goin' dumb
We on the same wave, you the same way
You know I be down if it's with you
Where we goin'? Baby, what's the move?
We should take a trip up to the moon
Get a room

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
We up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise we be on it
Ooh I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?

Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide? Yeah yeah
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide? Oh oh
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide?

4Hunnid
I need a baecation
I need my bitch in an apron
Booty all out cookin' bacon
Orange juice and Ace what we drinkin'
I only come out when the stars out
I'm on a mission but we far out
This city talkin' with a large mouth
Yeah they after the boy like Fall Out
4Hunnid
Drop and give me fifty, girl, drop and give me fifty
Used to slide with me 'cause you be trippin' when you miss me
You gon' hold me close and on yo neck gon' be a hickie
I ain't gotta do too much, I know what get you sticky
I ain't gotta know astrology I know yo' vibe
Skip the foreplay, you won't let niggas fuck with yo' mind
I ain't givin' out apologies when I'm behind
Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
We up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise we be on it
Ooh I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?

Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide? Yeah yeah
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide? Oh oh
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide?

Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride
