		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're the Symbol of Society
The Masters of our Race
We've Learned our Lessons - of Those Who Lived
And How they Lost Their Face
What's Wrong with Living a Proper Life
When it's Yet Our Time to Die?
Faith and Honor Well Preserved
For We Never Question Why........
Taking your life in your own hands
As we do Every Day
Living Life in the Danger Zone
Someday You'll Have to Change
                  Devine Wind - Kamakazi Flies Within
                  Devine Sin - You'll Never See His Face Again

No Reason Living - No Reason to Die
You Look in the Mirror - And see your Cold Eyes
One Final Moment - Before You Take to the Skies
The Needles your Pilot - and the Snow is your Guide
To Turn Your Back On the Rising Sun
Would Surely Bring Your Honor Shame
Crying for the Ways We Live
When We Only Have Ourselves to Blame
