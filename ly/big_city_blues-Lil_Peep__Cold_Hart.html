		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Charlie Shuffler on the beat

I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna make you mine
We can spend time, smoke away the time
We can go anywhere you ever wanted
Anything you ever dreamed
I can make your dreams come true (come true)
I'll be on my own, no crew (crew)
Out here makin' these moves (yeah)
Singin' these big city blues (city, yeah)
I don't wanna think about you (nah, nah)
Every time I think about you (you)
I swear I fall in love again (damn)
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real (yeah)
Girl, I got a deal (got a deal)
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Promise me it's real (yeah)
Girl, I got a deal (aye)
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Coldhart, Coldhart

And we can leave this club
And we can get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy
Girl, I felt your heart beatin' heavy for me (woah)
And I just wanna see you shine (shine)
Girl, you got stars for eyes (you do)
And she sweet like Texas tea
With a ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sittin' drinkin' whiskey, hopin' that you'll miss me
Baby, say you do (please say you do)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Maybe say you do
