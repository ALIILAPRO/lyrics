		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I'll tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that you got daddy issues
And I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shame always comes at the worst time

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I'll tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that you got daddy issues

I keep on tryin' to let you go
I'm dyin' to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead, it hurts
This time, I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared

Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that you got daddy issues
And I do too
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that you got daddy issues
And I do too
