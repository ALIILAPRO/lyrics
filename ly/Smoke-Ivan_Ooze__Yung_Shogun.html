		  VERSE 1

Wake up and I get lit,

Smoking on the best Shit,

Slide into my dickies,

Got that carhart on my chest kit,

Rolling through the city,

Super pretty like my ex bitch,

M O B the new glow,

You can be my side chick,

Homie I’m a giant,

Highest of the highest,

Ballin with the best,

Rest in peace Kobe Bryant,

Callin’ all the guests,

If you up at my climate,

Time to start a mosh pit,

Time to start a riot,

This be terrifying,

Coming for the belt like Orion,

Bitch imma star,

Nah there ain’t no denying,

Rich from a far,

Nah I ain’t i be lying,

Grew up in the ghetto,

Product of my own environment,

Probably being modest if I’m saying I ain’t biased,

Uzi got this shit hittin better than some violence,

Uzi got this shit hittin like it’s a requirement,

Do a John krasinski mother fucker,

Be quiet,

HOOK

All I do is smoke weed & get paid x 8

VERSE 2

Oh shit, Wake up,

Sipping on henny for breakfast,

Baby I missed my alarm,

She put on her thong, I put on my necklace,

She wanna have sex on the money,

OOOO damn, that’s expensive,

My mind is expanding, I’m on that LSD, I am not landing,

I don’t smoke no more but shit im high as hell,

Can’t you tell, I linked up with ooze, got high off the smell,

We not tryna share, we just making sales that’s for real though,

When im out in public they look at me like a weirdo,

Carhartt on tee, dickies below the belt,

Eclectic brother I excel, rolling deeper than Adele,

Clique full of black boys, paint all on my nails,

Rolling with some white boys, inhale, exhale,

I be pumping purple rain with my chains on,

Yeah I see the irony, they eying me, that’s game though,

I am definitely a product of where I am from,

All I, all I do is smoke shit, where my scales bro?

HOOK

All I do is smoke weed & get paid x 8
