		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

He been gone since three thirty
And coming home lately at three thirty
I'm super cool I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby you gone get it
Now I ain't tripping ah! I ain't twisting ah!
I ain't demented ah, but just a lil' bit
I'm kicking asses I'm taking names
I'm on flame don't come home babe

I'm breaking dishes up in here
All night (Oh-oh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police and lights
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man

A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an

I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless
I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man I don't know
I'm looking around for something else to throw

I'm breaking dishes up in here
All night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police and lights (Uh-huh)
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight

A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an

I don't know who you think I am (I am)
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come I'mma huff and puff and
Blow this, blow this uh,
Blow this, blow this,
I'mma blow this, blow this
Blow this, blow this,
I'mma blow this, blow this
Blow this house, house down
Dishes breaking, dishes breaking

I'm breaking dishes up in here
All night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police and lights (Uh-huh)
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight

A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-a-a-an

Breaking, breaking, breaking
Dishes, dishes, dishes
