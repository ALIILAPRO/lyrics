		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a dumb teen boy
I eat sticks and rocks and mud
I don't care about the government
And I really need a hug
I feel stupid (stupid)
Ugly (ugly)
Pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong but
I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs

It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you
I really like your spotty sweater, if
Ladybugs are girls
How do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world
I bet it's just so much better

I just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how its s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs right?
(Boys will be bugs right?)

I'm a dumb teen boy
All I wanna do is quit
My mum told me that she's worried
And I couldn't give a shit
I have friends who understand me
Their names are spider, beetle, bee
They don't say much but
They have always listened to me

The other boys at school
Think it's cool to hate your parents
But they're lying all the time
The bugs advised that I should let 'em
And if you wanna cry
Make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet
Block it out and never feel it

I just turned fourteen
And I think I know everything

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs right?
(Boys will be bugs right?)

Just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen and I think I know everything)
Just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen and I think the world revolves around me)

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs right?

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs right?

(Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs right?)
