		<p>
		  Puh Puh Prince Harry
Girl like to marry
Save up all your USD's for British Universities

Puh Puh Prince Harry
Girl like to marry
Save up all your USD's for British universities

Cut to the chase, you're a big disgrace
With a skip and a beat and you're in this place
If you'd have known better then you'd have written a letter
Complaining all the time about the dull, rainy weather

I don't know if...this what you this what you've come for
I don't know if...this what you're this what you're looking for

Go go away
You know we've changed
So much more than your playground
You'll be safer stay uptown

Go go away
You know we've changed
So much more than your playground
You'll be safer stay uptown

Go go away (Cut to the chase, you're a big disgrace
With a skip and a beat and you're in this place)
Go go away (If you'd have known better then you'd have written a letter
Complaining all the time about the dull, rainy weather)
Go go away (I don't know if this what you've this what you've come for)
Hahahaha (this what you're, this what you're looking for)

Puh Puh Prince Harry
Girl like to marry
Save up all your USD's for British university
