		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Come get me the warmth I've been needing
Come spend the night and don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me

Two doors up on the casket, road to Damascus, yes
Tapped out cabinet, everything a habit
Everything, I have it, everybody latchin'
To a different piece of me but don't see I'm in fragments
You don't have to stay, yeah, I know all about leaving, yeah
Just stay for the night and give me something to believe in 
(Something to believe in)
Yeah

I've given up tryna battle my demons (tryna battle my demons)
Ayy, frove an hour to granny's, just to hear I need Jesus (hear I need Jesus)

Two pills up from my last fix, making sure to mask it
I got plenty questions, but got nowhere left to ask it
Money for your basket, treated like a bastard
Why you always askin' why I'm always absent?
Can't give you warmth, can't give you what you needing, no
Can't give you somethin' if I don't know the feeling

Yeah, I've given up tryna battle my demons (Battle my demons)
Ayy, drove an hour to granny's, just to hear I need Jesus (hear I need Jesus)
Yeah, I hide my face in a mask, pistol up in my jacket (up in my jacket)
Yeah, my girl too scared to ask, is this "I love you" my last breath
(Is this "I love you" my last breath)
Ayy, I hide my face in a mask, pistol up in my jacket, my jacket, yeah (up in my jacket)
My girl too scared to ask, is this "I love you" my last breath 
(Is this "I love you" my last breath) my last breath, yeah

Come get me the warmth I've been needing
Come spend the night and don't leave me 
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Just give me the warmth I've been needing
Come spend the night and don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
