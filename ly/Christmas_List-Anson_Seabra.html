		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's an angel in the snow
She's knocking at my door
She's keeping my heart warm tonight

And there's a table set for two
A cozy little room
A window with a view of white

Then you ask me what I want this year
Well I already know

I tried to make my Christmas list
But I don't want a single gift
'Cause I've got everything I need

So I won't ask for anything
No shiny toys or fancy things
'Cause I've got everything I need
With you here next to me

There's a sleigh up in the sky
WIth presents piled high
But none of them are mine tonight

'Cause my gift doesn't need a bow
It's perfect on its own
And I just wanna hold it tight

So don't ask me what I want this year
'Cause you already know

I tried to make my Christmas list
But I don't want a single gift
'Cause I've got everything I need

So I won't ask for anything
No shiny toys or fancy things
'Cause I've got everything I need

I could lie and say I want a sweater
A holiday to warmer weather
But that's just not the truth

Because all of Santa's elves could never
Make a gift for me that's better
Than this night with you

I don't want something new
I just want you

I tried to make my Christmas list
But I don't want a single gift
'Cause I've got everything I need

So I won't ask for anything
No shiny toys or fancy things
'Cause I've got everything I need
With you here next to me
