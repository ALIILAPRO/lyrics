		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight
I'm free
So free

For the first time
I've seen
New life
New life

Start to breathe

And you came to me
In some way
And my life
Will never be the same

(And one day you'll feel me
A whisper upon the breeze)

And that night
As I dreamed
And I slipped away

To another place
Where you spoke to me
Of this day
Of this day

And you came to me
In some way
And my life
Will never be the same

And you came to me
In some way
And my life
Is like a hurricane

And you came to me
In some way
And my life
Will never be the same

For you're mine
And I'm yours
For life

For you're mine
And I'm yours
For life
For life

The fear is just an illusion
