		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Superstar
Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Got a clue, what you doing?

You can play brand new to
All the other chicks out here
But I know what you are
What you are, baby

Look at you
Gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby you
Got all the puppets with their strings up

Fakin' like a good one
But I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are
What you are, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer
You're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby

You, you, you are
You, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer
Womanizer

Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
You got me going
You're oh so charming
But I can't do it
You womanizer
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah

You say I'm crazy
I got you crazy
You're nothing but a
Womanizer

Daddy-O
You got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you
You just can't find the right companion

I guess when you have one too many
Makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are
That's just who you are, baby

Lollipop
Must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I
Would be a victim, not another

Say it, play it, how you wanna?
But no way I'm ever gonna
Fall for you
Never you, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer
You're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby

You, you, you are
You, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer
Womanizer

Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
You got me going
You're oh so charming
But I can't do it
You womanizer
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah

You say I'm crazy
I got you crazy
You're nothing but a
Womanizer

Maybe if
We both lived in a
Different world
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)

It would be all good
And maybe I could be your girl
But I can't
'Cause we don't

Womanizer, woman-womanizer
You're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby

You, you, you are
You, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer
Womanizer

Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
You got me going
You're oh so charming
But I can't do it
You womanizer
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah

You say I'm crazy
I got you crazy
You're nothing but a
Womanizer

Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah

Womanizer, woman-womanizer
You're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
