		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take up some space
You're too far away
Make no mistake
I think you should stay

You'll get every little bit
You ain't never seen a drip like this
Heaven at your fingertips
Don't you let a minute slip 

Just say you'll have me 
Oh, taste and see
Hope you don't sleep on me (no)
I've got good and plenty (plenty)

Inhabit all the spaces in-between
It's magic when I taste your inner being 
An average day is spent all in the sheets 
Emphatic when I tell you what you mean to me (ayy)
Chemistry 
Intimate memories
Every time I give you all my 
Energy 
Emphasis, never sleep (yeah, never sleep)

Say you'll have me 
Oh, taste and see (I see, I see)
Hope you don't sleep on me
I've got good and plenty (plenty)

Say you'll have me 
Oh, taste and see
Hope you don't sleep on me (don't you sleep on me)
I've got good and plenty (plenty)

Say you'll have me 
Oh, taste and see
Hope you don't sleep on me 
I've got good and plenty (plenty)
