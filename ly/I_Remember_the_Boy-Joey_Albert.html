		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today I heard them play that song again
An old familiar strain from way back when
Ev'ry note and ev'ry line
Has always been a fav'rite song of mine

It used to haunt me so some years ago
Reminds me of a boy I used to know
And although the melody lives on
The mem'ries and the boy are all but gone

And while the song still brings that certain glow
And the words still sing of love I know
It isn't quite the way it was before
I remember the boy but I don't remember the feeling anymore 

The promises we made seem easier then
As if we knew our love would never end
But seasons change and time erases the tears
As swiftly as the rivers disappear.

So while the song still brings that certain glow
And the words still sing of love I know
It isn't quite the way it was before
I remember the boy, but I don't remember the feeling
I remember the boy, but I don't remember the feeling anymore
