		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His window's already passed
So he's shooting at the glass
Keeping guns in his locker
And he denies it
Like it's actually important 
But he lied 'cause I sure did watch him
Showing up wearing black 
And he knows that

His daddy's on death row
But he'll say it with his chest, though
His friends move dope
He hasn't tried coke
But he's always had a problem saying no
His older brother bagged the valedictorian 
His mother steady screaming he should be more like him 

Can you read my mind, I've been watching you
(You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it's true)
Couldn't fight to save your life but you look so cool
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to beat when you're on all fours
Good men die too so I'd rather be with you, you, you

I owe you a black eye and two kisses
Tell me when you wanna come and get 'em
I only want him if he says it first to me
I wanna uh him in the back of his mom's mercury
He looks like he works with his hands
And smells like Marlboro Reds
It makes me so uh and I can't get enough of it

Something's been feeling weird lately
There's just something about you, baby (there's just something about you baby)
Maybe I'll just be crazy (I'll be crazy)
And piss him off 'til he hates me
(Yeah right, he fucking loves me)
Low slung bad bitch, baby come and get you some

Can you read my mind, I've been watching you 
Couldn't fight to save your life but you look so cool
(You know it, you know it, you know)
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to beat when you're on all fours
Good men die too so I'd rather be with you, you, you

Oh, I'd rather be with you
Oh, I'd rather be with you
'Cause good men die too so I'd rather be with you
