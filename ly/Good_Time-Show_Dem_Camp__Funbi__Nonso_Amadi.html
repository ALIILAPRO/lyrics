		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Classic
We just came to have a good time because we're here for a long time
Your girl her name is Ajose and cause she's here for a long time
We just came to have a good time because we're here for a long time
Your babe her name is Aronke and we're gonna here for a long time
Say

Odoo odoo mi o
You know I see you baby
My darling baby o
You know I see you baby
Odoo odoo mi o
You know I see you baby
My darling baby o
You know l see you baby

So not to catch feelings and just go with the flow
Like lemme show you the town
I've got some money to blow
Now we doing it big
You know kicking the doe
Must be some jazz in that thing cause men the feeling so dope
Oh yeah you running this baby you got the vintage soul
I'm talking you need a baker
Sweet loving you too
Spell coconut for me lemme light up the stove
Lemme show you the sites I get outta the globe
I want more than the skies
I want you more than the nights
I want your thing in my space
I give you yours in disguise
So gimme all your sugar
I handle all your spice
You outta all baby that's why l'm falling right

She gat that brown skin with the motion of the ocean yeah
Wrap the boat whole and let it cap side yeah
And wanna be starting something something something
Skin jiggy on the left hand side yeah yeah

I see fire fire fire
Set this place on fire
Just when I look at you I wonder
You make me wanna touch the fire
I see fire fire fire
Set this place on fire
Gat to be starting something

Yeah light is up for the hardest in the world
Your pure fire guts and there's nothing we can do
I pass cross and I know say no be flu child of destiny
Omo you the baddest in the group like
Watching all your moves
Tryna keep it cool not tryna catch feelings
We just tryna keep it loose
Why you always on my mind so this gatto be the truth
Aid this baby so they way you did it gatto be a cool life
Plam plam
Plam to the mall
Have you seen my omo she is bad to the core
All this other babes they don't shark me on more
Things I used to do don't attract me no more so

Odoo odoo mi o
You know I see you baby
My darling baby o
You know I see you baby
Odoo odoo mi o
You know I see you baby
My darling baby o
You know l see you baby

So make we get busy with no limits
Say the grove is not for us we can't greet it
And nobody force we can't willing
And me I want to focus on you
So jo fumi ma kuri yen
Tell me how you like it
I don't need to pariwo
Know that me I like your way

We just came to have a good time because we're here for a long time
Your girl her name is Ajose and cause she's here for a long time
We just came to have a good time because we're here for a long time
Your babe her name is Aronke and we're gonna here for a long time
Say

Odoo odoo mi o
You know I see you baby
My darling baby o
You know I see you baby
Odoo odoo mi o
You know I see you baby
