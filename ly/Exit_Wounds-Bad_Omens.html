		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raised by wolves in sheep's clothes that abandoned me, 
But taught me to get up when I fall to my knees

Man makes monster, monster kills man
Taking your crown's always been part of the plan
If you weren't so stuck in your own head, you'd be where I am now instead
Nobody's gonna hear you when you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you because the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out
Drown you out

I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside

Dead on the inside

If you want an enemy I'll be the last one that you ever meet
But I can tell you now that you don't stand a goddamn chance against me
Nobody's gonna hear you when you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you because the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out

I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside

Fuck that
Fuck this
If you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim
Fuck that
Fuck this
If you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim

I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am, and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside
I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am, and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside

Dead on the inside
