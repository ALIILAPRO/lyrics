Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end

Oh can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

Oh staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh oh can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I got to stay high
All the time, to- time, to-
High all the time, to- time, to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind (ooh ooh)
High all the time, to- time, to-
High all the time, to- time, to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind (ooh ooh)

Oh oh

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end

Oh can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

Oh staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh oh can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I got to stay high
All the time, to- time, to-
High all the time, to- time, to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind (ooh ooh)
High all the time, to- time, to-
High all the time, to- time, to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind (ooh ooh)
