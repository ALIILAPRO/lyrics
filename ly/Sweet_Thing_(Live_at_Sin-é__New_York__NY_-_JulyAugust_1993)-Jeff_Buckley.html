		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I will stroll the merry way
And jump the hedges first
And I will drink the clear
Clean water for to quench my thirst

And I shall watch the ferry-boats
And they'll get high
On a bluer ocean
Against tomorrow's sky

And I will never grow so old again
And I will walk and talk
In gardens all wet with rain
Hey, it's me, I'm dynamite

And I don't know why
We shall walk and talk
In gardens all misty and wet with rain
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing

And I will raise my hand up
Into the night time sky
And count the stars
That's shining in your eye

And I'll be satisfied
In gardens all wet with rain

And I will never, ever, ever, ever
Grow so old again.
Oh sweet thing, sweet thing
Sugar baby with your champagne eyes
And your saint-like smile...
