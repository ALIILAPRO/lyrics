		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a stranger
With a twisted smile and I'm wondering, ah
Your heart is in danger
Come close now, let me tell you a lie

Wild child
You got me running through the turnstile
Baby, come with and I'll make it worthwhile
You're gonna get my love today, yeah

You are a sweet dream
With a tender heart and beautiful smile
But things aren't what they seem
So I'll let you go and dream for a while

Wild child
You got me coming outta exile
Baby girl, you know I'm liking your style
You're gonna get my love today, yeah

I just wanna hold you at the end of every day
Girl, I wanna please you, oh, I'm needing you to stay
The sun is gonna shine if you would just come out and play
Baby, won't you show me your wild child ways

Wild child
You got me running through the turnstile
Baby, come with and I'll make it worthwhile
You're gonna get my love today, yeah

Wild child
You got me coming outta exile
Baby girl, you know I'm liking your style
You're gonna get my love today, yeah
