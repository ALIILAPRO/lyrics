		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This what they all been waiting for
I guess so
They been waiting for this shit for a long time didn't they? (Hey)
I guess so
They been waiting for this shit for a long time didn't they? (Hey)
Hey, I'm just feeling my vibe right now
I'm feeling myself

Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the mscho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and shit, sipping Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Wake up Versace, shit, life Desiigner
Whole bunch of lavish shit
They be asking 'round town who be clapping shit
I be pullin' up stuff in the Phantom shit
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti whip, look how I drive this shit
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, killing on camera
Pop a Perc, I can't stand up
Gorilla, they come and kill you with bananas
Four fillas, they finna pull up in the Phantom
Know niggas, they come and kill you on the camera
Big Rollie, it dancing bigger than a Pandie
Go Oscar for Grammy, bitch pull up your panty
Fill up I'm a flip it, I got bitches pull up and they get it
I got niggas that's counting for digits
Say you make you a lot of new money
Know some killers pull off and they in the Wraith
Ctd, they pull up in a killa Bape
Call up Phillip-Phillip, gon' fill the bank, niggas up in the bank
We gon' drill the bank, fuck we gon' kill the bank, get it
I got broads, yeah I get it
I got cards, yeah I shitted, this how I live it
Did it all for a ticket
Now Flex drop bombs when he spin it
And Bobby gon' trend it
Jeff The Don doing business
Zana Ray fucking up shit and she doin' her business
I be getting to the chicken, counting to the chicken
And all of my niggas gon' split it

Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me
