		  I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I'm working on dying
(BNYX)

Ridin' with my demons, I can't take nothin' back
Yeah (yeah)
Riding with my demons, they my deadliest friends, ah
Money make 'em do 'em something, put 'em in a trance (I-I'm)
Whole lot of mud inside this motherfuckin' buildin' (yeah, yeah)
Whole lot of motherfuckin' money in this buildin' (shh, shh-shh-shh, yeah)
All my demons call me, yeah, they call me, I said, "Yeah, yeah"
Ridin' in this motherfuckin' Scat, I said, "Yeah, yeah"
Ridin' in this motherfuckin' Urus (oh-oh), I said, "Hell, yeah"
Pullin' up on people, now they ask me (skrrt), yeah, yeah (I-I'm)
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' patek, I said, "Yeah, yeah" (yeah)
Where you think I got this fuckin' money? I said, "Yeah, yeah" (yeah, woah)
Off this fuckin' muddy, boy, I knew you could smell it (shh)
All white Margielly-elly on me, I'm a yeti (Woah, ah, I-I'm)
"How the fuck you play me in the worst, ain't adding up, yeah?" (yeah-ah)
All this fuckin' cash, I'm winnin', spin, I still won't buy it (yeah)
Santa Clara, yeah my bitches, bad bitches, naughty (yeah)
I'm on this yacht full time, you got it one day (oh, yeah)

Don't get it confused, I'm runnin' my blues up
Hoppin' inside of the Bentley, then whippin' it
Spittin', that muhfuckin' clean it up (ah)
Swervin' then dippin', and your bitch get sad, then motherfucker eatin' up
I give a fuck what they sayin', the motherfuckin' rest, the best, I heard enough
Shut up, shut up, shut up bitch, yeah, heard enough (yeah)
All these motherfuckers dead, they motherfuckin' snitchin', motherfuckin' slurpin' up
Heard that they wanna come beef with the kid, in that body be spillin', they turnin' up
I just be wanna be geeked in a minute, the sky, the private jet it not enough (yeah)
Wait, I can't let it up, bitch, it not addin' up
Some of these moves we learnin', some of these names, some of them sad enough (yeah)
Half of these motheruckin' rappers copyin' my swag, I'm done playin' daddy's son
I'm already up in the space, these motherfuckers done 'cause I already done enough

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Ridin' with my demons, I can't take nothin' back
Yeah (yeah)
Riding with my demons, they my deadliest friends, ah
Money make 'em do 'em something, put 'em in a trance (I-I'm)
Whole lot of mud inside this motherfuckin' buildin' (yeah, yeah)
Whole lot of motherfuckin' money in this buildin' (shh, shh-shh-shh, yeah)
All my demons call me, yeah, they call me, I said, "Yeah, yeah"
Ridin' in this motherfuckin' Scat, I said, "Yeah, yeah"
Ridin' in this motherfuckin' Urus (oh-oh), I said, "Hell, yeah"
