		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen up, I really need to get some shit off my chest
And I need to apologize for who I am
Sorry for what I have done to you
All the shit you have been through
All the pain you felt was true
And all the tears you cried, ah fuck
Come on man you got this, even though it hurts
Yeah
I'm so afraid I'm not sure if this shit is real
I'm not sure what I should do or how I should fucking feel
I'm not sure if I'll ever make it out of this
'Cause I don't know what will happen after I let go of it
I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to tell you what I have done to you
Just to cover up the fear
Of going through something that no one wants to
But I've been through it before
And I don't wanna do this ever again
So I lied to you and never told you the truth
Even though I know I have to
You wanted the truth
Yeah, I'm trying to
I'm trying to let go of everything
But it's hard to accept the mistakes
That I did at that time where I thought I need everything ah fuck
I don't know how I was able to hurt you like that
I don't know how I was able to fuck everything up like that
Death will do us apart from each other
But my sins will haunt me deep down to my fucking coffin
I don't feel well
I took a final breath as I let my hand go from what
I thought would have kept me so safe
The grave that I have dug myself is the reason why I hate myself
The hatred that I got for myself wants to make me kill myself
And I just wanna be myself
And I just wanna save ourselves
And I just want nobody else
I just want no body else but you
And only you can change up this broken heart
That I broke from always lying straight at you
What will I do without you by my side
It's so fucking empty inside of my selfish heart
Forgiveness is part of my eulogy
I try everything to become everything to you
You are everything to me
You are everything that I really need in my life
Follow me, this is my fucking way to my graveyard
All I really need is you to lay with me in my grave
