		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raised unright
So uptight
But why blame you
You wouldn't be
If you could choose
Most of the time 
It's out of site 

It hit me today 
Who gave who the right 
Who took mine away 
What a site
What a sound 
What a way to bring people down 
What a way to bring me down 

I know that you'll get yours 
When you get empty 
It's so close 
I'm sure that you 
Would rather do that 
Than be in your clothes 

You must have waited a long time 
Bet you were disappointed 
I waited longer than that 
Just goes to prove 
(Illogical) proving's illogical 
But it's sometimes necessary 
Proving's illogical 
But it's a cinch 
Fa-la-la (Illogical) 

But why blame you 
You wouldn't be 
If you could choose

Most of the time 
It's out of site 
It hit me today 
Who gave who the right 
Who took mine away 
What a sight 
What a sound 
What a way to bring people down 
What a way to bring me down 
It goes on and on 
And on and on and on
