		  Hmm

You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been craving
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doing tonight?
Better say, "Doing you right" (yeah)
Watching movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight (yeah)

I don't wanna keep you up (you up)
But show me, can you keep it up? (It up)
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinking coffee (I've been drinking coffee, coffee)
And I've been eating healthy (I've been eating healthy, healthy)
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah (you know I keep it squeaky)
Saving up my energy (yeah, yeah, saving up my energy)

Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you stay up all night? (all night)
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Can we stay up all night? Fuck a jet lag
You bring your fine ass and overnight bag
Add up the numbers or get behind that
Play and rewind that, listen, you'll find that
I want that six-nine without Tekashi
And I want your body and I make it obvious
Wake up the neighbors, we got an audience
They hear the clapping, but we not applauding 'em (yeah, yeah)
Six o'clock and I'm crushing
Then it get to seven o'clock now he wants it
When it hit eight o'clock, we said, "Fuck it"
Forget your girl, pretend that I'm her
Come make the cat purr, come make my back hurt, ayy
Making that squirt and rain and shower and spray
Now that's perfect, baby, we don't sleep enough
But I'ma keep you up, if you can keep it up (baby)

Can you stay up all night? (All night)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (daylight)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you stay up all night? (Can you stay?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (can you stay?)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ayy, rock you like a baby, but you know I'm 'bout to keep you up
Welcome to my channel, and today I'm 'bout to teach you somethin'
I can make you pop, legs up like a Cancan
Wake the neighbors up, make it sound like the band playing
Bitch, let me get cute (yeah)
He's about to come through (he's about to come through)
I've been in the shower for 'bout a whole hour
He finna act a dog in it so he get the bald kitty
Netflix or Hulu? Baby, you choose
I'm up like Starbucks, three pumps, ooh
This pussy good for ya health, call it superfood
When I'm by myself, DIY like it's YouTube
Bad, bad bitch, all the boys wanna spank me (spank me)
Left him on read, girlfriend need to thank me (thank me)
Make his toes point, ballerina, no tutu
Baby, I'm the best, I don't know what the rest do (ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)
Dive in the water like a private island
Thirty-four, thirty-five, we can sixty-nine it
And I been a bad girl but this pussy on the good list (good list)
I hope that you ain't tired, we ain't stopping 'til I finish (ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)

Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight (yeah, yeah)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Thirty-four, thirty-five)
Can you stay up all night? (Do you know what that means?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (do you know what that means?)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Means I wanna "69" with you
No shit
Math class
Never was good
