		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you have fun rotting in hell
Swim the witch, slay the infidel
Suck a dick, heretic
I hate you
And I'd like to see you burn, burn, burn

So tell all your friends
This is the end of everything
Too late to repent
The wicked will reap what they sow
We will sanctify (rise, my brethren)
Purify (purge out the sin)
Rejoice in their sorrow and sing
All hail next gen (all hail next gen)
Can I get an amen?

Somebody call the exorcist
This is heresy, the child is possessed
(Subjugate the apostate)
Don't you know
You're so six-six-sick?
Yeah, you fanatics prey on me, hate on me
Patiently waiting to watch me bleed
Get your head from out of my ass
Got me feeling like a human centipede
Just let me breathe
Stay the fuck away from me
I don't really want me
As my own enemy

So tell all your friends
This is the end of everything
Too late to repent
We'll bathe in the blood of the damned
We will sanctify (rise, my brethren)
Purify (purge out the sin)
Rejoice in their sorrow and sing
All hail next gen (all hail next gen)
Can I get an amen?

Just let me suffer (just let me breathe)
Just let me suffer (suffer in peace)
Just let me suffer (just let me breathe)
Oh, just let me
Just let me suffer
Or just let me breathe
Just let me suffer
Suffer in peace
I'm about to lose control
Fallen from grace, corrupted our faith
Foul renegade
I'm about to lose control
Thou will be done 'til kingdom come
No absolution

So tell all your friends
This is the end of everything
Too late to repent
The wicked will reap what they sow
We will (sanctify, purify)
Rejoice in their sorrow and sing
All hail next gen (all hail next gen)
Can I get an amen?

I'll execute judgment on you
You wicked demon
You burn in hell
You burn in hell
It's over
(Wow, that's really cool)
