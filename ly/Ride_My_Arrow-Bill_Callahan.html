		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't ever want to die
Do you know this arrow when it arches high
To meet the eagle in the sky

The eagle flies using the river as a map
A small animal in its clasp
Alive and enjoying the ride
Is life a ride to ride?
Or a story to shape and confide?
Or chaos neatly denied

And some people find the taste of pilgrim guts to be too strong
Me I find I can't get by without them for too long
Tear out the flesh, tear out the bone
Of anyone who tells you the known is unknown
Cause life ain't confidential
No, no, no it's not
It isn't and it ain't confidential
No, no, no

Ride my arrow
Ride my arrow
Ride my arrow

The land I love is splitting in two again and again and again
War muddies the river
And getting out we're dirtier than getting in

Ride my arrow
Ride my arrow
Ride my arrow
