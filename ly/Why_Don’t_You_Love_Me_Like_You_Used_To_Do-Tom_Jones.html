		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair is still curly and
My eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me
Like you used to do?

Ain't had no lovin' and a-huggin'
And a-kissin' in a long, Long while
We don't get nearer, further
Closer than a country mile

Why don't you spark me like you used to do?
And say sweet nothings like you used to coo?
I'm the same old trouble
You've always been through
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Ain't had no lovin' and a-huggin'
And a-kissin' in a long, Long while
We don't get nearer, further
Closer than a country mile

Why don't you say the things
You used to say?
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair is still curly and
My eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me
Like you used to do?

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
