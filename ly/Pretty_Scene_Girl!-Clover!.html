		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know this pretty scene girl
I wish you could've seen her
I know she got some problems
But I don't wanna leave her
And every time I see her
She makes me get this feeling
It feels just like I'm dreaming
Gets me higher than the ceiling
I know this pretty scene girl
I wish you could've seen her
I know she got some problems
But I don't wanna leave her
And every time I see her
She makes me get this feeling
It feels just like I'm dreaming
Gets me higher than the ceiling
Studded belt, pretty blue long hair
And every time she's near I cant help but stare
Fell in love at first sight
I cant lie
Yeah I got so many feelings I cant hide
And I just wanna call her
She makes me crazy
lost my mind right when I saw her
And when I go to sleep at night my thoughts are all about her
I don't know what I would do if I lived life without her
And I don't want nobody else
Saw her and I swear I fell so hard that I can't get up
I just want her love!!
I know this pretty scene girl
I wish you could've seen her
I know she got some problems
But I don't wanna leave her
And every time I see her
She makes me get this feeling
It feels just like I'm dreaming
Gets me higher than the ceiling
I know this pretty scene girl
I wish you could've seen her
I know she got some problems
But I don't wanna leave her
And every time I see her
She makes me get this feeling
It feels just like I'm dreaming
Gets me higher than the ceiling
