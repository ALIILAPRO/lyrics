		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a flower among the weeds, more beautiful than any rose
I put the creases in her shoes, she put the crinkle in my nose
I'll have wrinkles when I'm young, from all the laughing I suppose
And I'll hold your heart forever, long after I propose

Hold her while you can, 'cause someday you won't get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you've spent
'Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won't end
So, I'll hold her while I can, 'til the one day that I get the chance again

She's a doll at 83, acting like we both just met
Reminding me of times that I swore I'd not forget
Now I'm 85 years old, alone, lying on this bed
Missing the sound of her voice and the three words that she once said

Hold her while you can, 'cause someday you won't get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you've spent
'Cause this life will all be over, my love for you won't end
So, I'll hold her while I can, 'til the one day that I get the chance again

Hold her while you can, 'cause someday you won't get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you've spent
'Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won't end
So, I'll hold her while I can, 'til the one day that I get the chance again
