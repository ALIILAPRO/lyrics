		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody anybody anybody everybody
Get off me
Everybody ain't nobody, anybody ain't nobody
Get off me

Bury two thumb disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky

Never not at war-torn mystic sheddin' bands' form of linguistic
Subliminal exit lurk in cryptic black Google search it won't find shit
Fifth attitude bury all my business

Bury two thumb disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky

Chemical leak melts your reef dry heave crease your knees
Python in your belly nauseous, got the chills
Draw the blinds it's time to get
Can't explain it's a feeling inhale the moment 
Till I scorch your lips don't hurt me
Gypsy gallop does you dirty
Peak at three-thirty in the morning with your 
Voice in my headquarters and I'll take you there

Everybody anybody anybody everybody
Get off me
Everybody ain't nobody, anybody ain't nobody
Get off me

Bury me two thumb disappear three eye I run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky

Sudden death in the west london connect live and direct
Mad cow on the beat break me speed lace your senses
Can't think straight I can't relate, it's all a dream mate leave a message
I'm slangin' pain in the paint can't make it stop
Said knock that off I rep that gutter fly
Come from from where you run from hide ain't no level 'bove this high
Off I rep that gutter fly, off I rep that gutter fly
Bass rattle stars out the sky

Get off me

Everybody anybody anybody everybody
Get off me
Everybody ain't nobody, anybody ain't nobody
Get off me

Bury two thumb disappear three eye run 
among you base rattle stars out the sky
