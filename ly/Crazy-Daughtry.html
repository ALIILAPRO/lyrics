		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no hiding room
When everyone brings the darkest place to light
So why not assume
Straight out the womb
I've been marked by the beast of some kind
And there's so many reasons why you're not

Crazy for leaving
Crazy for staying so long
I'm amazed you're still breathing
Amazed you can feel after all the pain I've cause you
I'm the one crazy after all
I'm the one crazy after all

There's no need for signs
When your crying eyes said a million words tonight
And I rather die then see you do time
For the wrongs that you can't make right

Crazy for leaving
Crazy for staying so long
I'm amazed you're still breathing
Amazed you can feel after all the pain I've cause you
I'm the one crazy after all
I'm the one crazy after all

I'm so far gone found my way back to broken somehow
Yeah when you moved oh, I can't find my way out
We're not crazy for leaving
Just crazy for staying so long

I'm amazed you're still breathing
Amazed you can feel after all the pain I've cause you
I'm the one crazy after all
I'm the one crazy after all
I'm the one crazy after all
Not crazy
