		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm americano-colombiano
Yeah, americano-colombiano
House in Marinilla on a high note, yeah
Whippin' through the city like I'm Pablo (Pablo)
This is not a visionary crime flow
But I know they runnin' where that man go
Yeah, lifestyle sweeter than a mango
Give it to 'em dirty like a narco

Venenoso, it's too wild in this country
Ask OSHO (OSHO!)
I'm just here to do what I'm supposed to
Shit is out of hand and I'm emotional (woo)
Marinilla, Marinilla, and in the Oro of la Milla with a grilla
Marinilla, Marinilla, had to run and play 'em dirty like it's FIFA

Esta muñeca, no me desprecia
Want to impress her, I'm 'bout to set it off, put it on
Esta muñeca, no me molesta
She doin' extra, I'm 'bout to set it off, put it on

I'm americano-colombiano (¡Colombiano!)
Livin' up in Cali y Medallo
'Bout to spin a record on a vinyl
We should do it, only you and I know
Give it to them subtle like a haiku
Never had the vision to be like you
Misfit, I'ma do it how I like to
Drop Américano just to hype you
'Teo? Why you look Christian like Bale (Like Bale)
Why don't you put the poncho on sale?
Cop a little Off-White, you too pale
¡Pausa! (woo)
(Marinilla, Marinilla, and in the Oro of la Milla with a grilla)
Marinilla, Marinilla, had to run and play 'em dirty like it's FIFA

Esta muñeca, no me desprecia
Want to impress her, I'm 'bout to set it off, put it on
Esta muñeca, no me molesta
She doin' extra, I'm 'bout to set it off, put it on

I'm americano-colombiano
Yeah, americano-colombiano
House in Marinilla on a high note, yeah
Whippin' through the city like I'm Pablo (Pablo)
This is not a visionary crime flow
But I know they runnin' where that man go
Yeah, lifestyle sweeter than a mango
Give it to 'em dirty like a narco

Took off from the A, I'm on the way
She wanna californicate while in LA
Flying to Antioquia, como siempre
Pillow talking, aguardiente
¡Negra, vente!

Calidosa, niña hermosa
Come and sip up on this vino rosa
Mariposa, strum that bossa
Sólo novia, yo no quiero esposa
I've been mixing with Kombucha, reading Kama-sutra
Tell me, mami, what's your dosha?
Hit the cheeb, it make you perezosa
I don't lean, but, girl, I need you closer
¡Mami!
