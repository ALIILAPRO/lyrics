		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's too soon
What the fuck were you thinking?
Look baby, rockstar in the making
All black
God why would i fake it?
And you always thinking 'something else changes'
Cos' u get too high for your liking
Dopamine kicking in yeah you never had cravings
Heart made of gold but your soul fading
Cos' i never thought that you'd say this
I
Don't feel alive in my mind, yeah
But you always said
Cos' you don't show love
When i start to fall apart
Thinking 'shit you weren't the one'
Gotta lift my head move on
Summer breeze drift across my skin now
I don't find it hard but i feel like giving up now
And i'm asking how you've been but i feel that you're lying
Saving all the silence for the risks that you're taking
And i know I've been kinda distant lately
And i hope you can see the reasons baby
And my mind has always been hazy
Living in the past for a minute on the daily
Don't go baby
I know i'm crazy
But i know that you don't mind
Cos' you don't show love
When i start to fall apart
Thinking 'shit you weren't the one'
Gotta lift my head move on
Got me low
Got me low
Got me low right now
What did i do?
Me and you broke the faith our vows
And nothing more
It's just a chore to love you any more than i do right now
Take my soul
Take it slow
You can't go
I don't know how to function without you
You don't know what i know
Played it safe
My mistake
I should know it would haunt you too
