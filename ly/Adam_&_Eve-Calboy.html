		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, darling, darling
Die without my darling, yeah
Ayy, darling, yeah, hey, hey

Darling, you know you my darling
Even though I be workin', baby, I can't see you often
And she gorgeous, drop dead, she fresh out the coffin
Play with her, you drop dead, we don't do no talkin'
Boy, this shit ain't easy
Swear that bitch my Eve, I might take that bitch to Eden
None of that shit make believe, I knew that bitch was a demon
Told her don't break my heart, then I watched that lil' bitch eat it
She change like the seasons, why you get so greedy?

Alright, let me tell you how it started
I was with my niggas, we was trappin' out apartments
Unc' was my big homie, he say that love shit is nonsense
We come from the trenches, baby, we was taught to pop shit
Ayy, but I wasn't tryna listen, baby, I was feelin' dark
Told the bitch come and link up when I'm trappin' out the park
Ayy, and she made me feel better, so I gave that bitch my heart
I was thinkin' from the heart, introduce her to the mob
Ayy, meanwhile, foenem tryna clown
I said, "Boy, don't doubt, I rock with her proud"
I might say that loud
That clear, she got to switchin', I gave it a year
Them bitches, they wanted me all in they ear
Now look at a nigga, I'm man of the year

Darling, you know you my darling
Even though I be workin', baby, I can't see you often
And she gorgeous, drop dead, she fresh out the coffin
Play with her, you drop dead, we don't do no talkin'
Boy, this shit ain't easy
Swear that bitch my Eve, I might take that bitch to Eden
None of that shit make believe, I knew that bitch was a demon
Told her don't break my heart, then I watched that lil' bitch eat it
She change like the seasons, why you get so greedy?

Got me feelin' a lil' darker
I can't trust these niggas, they like sharks up in this water
Had that lil' bitch cross me like Samson and Delilah
So I'm still ridin' solo, bitch, I don't got a partner
You know how I'm vibin', I'm ridin'
Bend a couple blocks and I got my lil' brother drivin'
Devil on my shoulder, I can't wait 'til we come find him
She gone like the serpent, I swear that lil' bitch so slimy
I got demons in my face, but the angels right behind me
I ain't never lose my faith, my soul gold and that's timeless
I done found a few ways to get paid, now I'm grindin'
And I love the role that you play, made me stay, I was blinded, yeah

Darling, you know you my darling
Even though I be workin', baby, I can't see you often
And she gorgeous, drop dead, she fresh out the coffin
Play with her, you drop dead, we don't do no talkin'
Boy, this shit ain't easy
Swear that bitch my Eve, I might take that bitch to Eden
None of that shit make believe, I knew that bitch was a demon
Told her don't break my heart, then I watched that lil' bitch eat it
She change like the seasons, why you get so greedy?
