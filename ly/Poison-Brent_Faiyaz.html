		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know you ride it right
I might just die tonight
But you know I'm still coming through baby (through baby)
I know it's bad for me
And you know it tastes so sweet
I think I need your abuse baby

Girl, you do damage to me
You know I love it, yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Girl, you do damage to me
You know, I love it, yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Than your poison baby

Mh-mh-mh-mh, oh
Angel of the night
Drown between your thighs
I'm still here, ain't no excuse baby (excuse baby)
I see you in my sleep
I'm scarred beyond belief
Ain't nothing you can't make me do, baby (do baby)

Hey, oh-oh
Girl, you do damage to me (you)
You know I love it, yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Girl, you do damage to me
You know, I love it, yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Than your poison baby (woah-woah-woah-woah)

Girl, you know I play my role when I'm inside that
With my hands around your throat I know you like that
Girl, I'll do anything
To hear you scream my name, I love your game, I do, I do

Girl, you do damage to me
But I love it babe
Oh, you're poisonous baby (oh-oh)
