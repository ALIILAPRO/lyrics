		  Mr. Worldwide, T-Pain
El que no vale consejo, no llega viejo
So listen up
Let her go, la-la-la-la
If your girl wanna play, let her go (ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la
If your girl wanna play, let her go (ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la (ah-ha)
If your girl wanna play, let her go (ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la
If your girl wanna play, let her go
(Dále, Pain)

Hey, baby girl, what you doin' tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (hey, hey baby)
You're giving it your all when you're dancin' on me
I wanna see if you can gimme some more (hey, hey baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (hey, hey baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (hey, hey baby)

Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (hey, hey, baby)

Ooh, drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say hey, baby (you can have whatever you want)
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make me wanna say hey baby (you can have whatever you like)
Ooh, you got it, 'cause you make me wanna say hey baby (you know what I want)
Yeah, don't stop it 
(I want you tonight)

I'm a Dade county, self paid, self-made millionaire
I used to play around the world
Now I'm around the world, getting paid
Girl problems, no problems
Don't hate the game that won't solve it
I want to get with you, mami
Now let me see where the Lord split you (dale)

Hey, baby girl, what you doin' tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (hey, hey baby)
You're giving it your all when you're dancin' on me
I wanna see if you can gimme some more (hey, hey baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (hey, hey baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (hey, hey baby)

Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby la-la-la-la-la-la-la (hey, hey, baby)

Ooh, drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say hey, baby (you can have whatever you want)
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make me wanna say hey baby (you can have whatever you like)
Ooh, you got it, 'cause you make me wanna say hey baby (you know what I want)
Yeah, don't stop it, 'cause you make me wanna say (I want you tonight)

Make money, make money
This chico right here gotta eat, baby
Scared money don't make money
That's how it goes in the street, baby
But enough about the the nonsense
Baby girl, take a shot to clear your conscience
Not a goon or a goblin, I'm a monster
'Cause I hit all baddest woman in the world, gangsta

Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la-la) (hey, hey baby)

Ooh, drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say hey baby (hey, hey baby)
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make me wanna say hey baby (hey, hey baby)
Ooh, you got it 'cause you make me wanna say hey baby (hey, hey baby)
Ooh, don't stop it, 'cause you make me wanna say

Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la) (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la) (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la) (ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby (la-la-la-la-la-la) (hey, hey baby)

Ooh, drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say hey, baby (you can have whatever you want)
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make me wanna say hey baby (you can have whatever you like)
Ooh, you got it, 'cause you make me wanna say hey baby (you know what I want)
Ooh, don't stop it (I want you tonight)
