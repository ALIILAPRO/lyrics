		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you feel it at the doorstep?
Do you feel it all the time?
Is it passing over you like a cloud from time to time?

Does it greet you in the morning?
Does it catch you by surprise?
Is it passing over you like a cloud from time to time?

Does it appear like a window does?
Does it appear like a mirror?
Is it passing over you like a cloud from time to time?

Does it flow through you like a river does?
Does it come crashing like a wave?
Is it passing over you like a cloud from time to time?

At the center of this is the center of you
At the center of this is the center of you
Is the passage there?
Is it open now?
Is the passage there?
Is it open now?

Do you write it with the same pen?
Do you arrive at the same thing?
Is it passing over you like a cloud from time to time?

Is it the place where light and shadow meet?
Is it the passage of time?
Is it passing over you like a cloud from time to time?

At the center of this is the center of you
At the center of this is the center of you
Is the passage there?
Is it open now?
Is the passage there?
Is it open now?
