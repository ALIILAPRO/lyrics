		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should've been there
Should've burst through the door with that, "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door, just waitin' for you to walk in
But the time is tickin'
People ask me how I've been as I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standin' there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone, but your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart and the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly, "He said he'd be here"

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And askin' me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say when tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standin' there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standin' around me, singin'
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Oh, oh, I knew
Oh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew
