		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will they mourn for me
A dying memory
Will they mourn for me
A dying memory
This shall not pass
The grip of guilt
Sinks itâ€™s claws in your back
The light retracts
Unforgiving and black
I see the face of destruction
Our soil never settles
Our conscience never clean
Our prayers are nothing but
Empty apologies
One with the worms
That crawl in the dirt
Comfort in the embrace of snakes
My father my plague
Old ghosts of agony
Will they mourn for me
A dying memory
Will they mourn for me
A dying memory
This shall not pass
The stain of grief
On eyes of glass
A man who only knows his path
Walks alone
And buries his soul for sanity
Our soil never settles
Our conscience never clean
Our prayers are nothing but
Empty apologies
Love is not stronger than death
Lightless we sift through the silence
Secretly begging for rest
The hope we resist
As IVs drip
A conciseness
Of the waiting rooms emptiness
Comfort in the embrace of snakes
My father my plague
Blinded by rage
The darkness our only escape
Bloodletting sealing our fate
Unforgiven
Love is not stronger than death
Another hospital another year of regret
Buried in the pain of my past
Old ghosts of agony
A dying memory
Will they mourn for me
A dying memory
Will they mourn for me
A dying memory
