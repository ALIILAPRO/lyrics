		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Isaiah fifty-four, verse seventeen
No weapons formed against you shall prosper
It's Dax yeah

Straight from the depths of hell (Facts)
The devil's callin' he might
Win a couple battles
But I promise he will not prevail
(He won't win)
These words are what I use to post bail
My people trapped inside these chains
(LexNour)
They got us thinkin' in these jail cells
So keep it quiet when I'm spittin' real
(Spittin' real)
The way we livin' isn't right and yeah
I bеt that's how 2Pac would feel ()
This generation's differеnt had to go
And cop a shield and keep myself away from
Addicts glorifyin' poppin' pills
This is the energy of Malcolm X, Rosa Parks
Martin Luther King Jr, Harry Tubman
Emmett Till (Emmett Till)
Look to God then I kneel, yeah
The Devil's callin'
He's been lookin' for the weak
But I promise we won't sign and seal

Yeah, this is not game
The devil's callin' on my people, stay inside
And please be quiet when he screams your name
He tried to lead me down the wrong way
I used to question God
But after what I've seen
I'll never do that shit again
These verses biblical
I rap and pray that every day
The people watchin' listen and add heed
To the things I say
I've been through it, felt pain, been down
Felt rage (I felt rage)
Bounced back, seen God, bowed down, got saved
Not from the streets
I'm on the sidewalk advocatin' peace (Peace)
I want to see all my people win and set free
(Come on) i'm here to tell you that you
Better know that God sees
And if you do not listen
He will humble you right to your knees
Fuck fame, fuck greed
All the material things
The devil's in sheep's clothing he
Gives what you don't need (Facts)
Keep your eyes open, don't sleep
(Don't sleep) and if you do
Be aware he will visit you inside your dreams
(Dreams)
And once you wake up he will not leave
His speed's 5G
Everywhere and scrollin' on your phone screen
Hacked in, force feed, front row, nose bleeds
Old friends, home team, come home
Don't leave
So listen close, 'cause I'ma say it slow
(Say it slow)
The devil's watchin' every move you make
And every single place you go (Place you go)
I used to think that I was all alone
Until I felt him breathin' down my neck while
I was sleepin' right inside my home
I tried to wake up
But the devil had me in a hold
I tried to move
He paralyzed my skeleton and all my bones
And that's when I called God and
Then I shouted out "Amen"
And I can put that on the Father
Son, Holy Spirit and the Ghost, uh
That I will not fold
That I will never crack, never sell my soul
(Never sell)
6'2", standin' on my faith, I feel 9'4"
(Ha ha ha) walkin' on this path
I could do it with a blindfold (Facts)
Devil tried play me for my
Faith like a console, hell no
(Go, go)
Stayed down, ten toes, hands up, case closed
(Go, go, go, go)
They know to stand strong as the rain
'Posed to wait 'til the gates close
And pray as the pain goes
Everything you see is not what is seems
(It's not) even the nicest people that you
Meet have devilish genes
In this world full of evil
We all sinners and fiends
The devil's callin' on us but we
Gotta let that phone ring

Straight from the depths of hell (Facts)
The Devil's calling he might
Win a couple battles
But I promise he will not prevail
(He will not prevail)
These words are what I use to post bail
My people trapped inside these chains
They got us thinkin' in these jail cells (Mm)
This is the energy of Malcolm X, Rosa Parks
Martin Luther King Jr, Harry Tubman
Emmett Till (Emmett Till)
Look to God, then I kneel
Yeah the devil's callin'
He's been lookin' for the weak
But I promise we won't sign and seal

Amen stand up
Take this walk with me it's Dax
Huh, huh, huh
