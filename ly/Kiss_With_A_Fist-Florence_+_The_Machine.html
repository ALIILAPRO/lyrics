		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hit me once, I hit you back
You gave a kick, I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed

You hit me once, I hit you back
You gave a kick, I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed, oh

My black eye casts no shadow
Your red eye sees nothing
Your slaps don't stick, your kicks don't hit
So we remain the same
Love sticks, sweat drips
Break the lock if it don't fit

A kick to the teeth is good for some
A kiss with a fist is better than none
Oh, a kiss with a fist is better than none

I broke your jaw once before
I spilled your blood upon the floor
You broke my leg in return
So sit back and watch the bed burn
Love sticks, sweat drips
Break the lock if it don't fit

A kick in the teeth is good for some
A kiss with a fist is better than none
Oh, kiss with a fist is better than none

You hit me once, I hit you back
You gave a kick, I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed, oh

Oh, you hit me once, I hit you back
You gave a kick, I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed
