		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're crying twilight tears
Oh, they're crying, yes, they're dying
Twilight
T-t-tears, t-t-tears

It all comes alive at night
A shattered mirror looking for sunlight
Diary of a soul with a story
Hide the blood, it's gory
Under the sky of a stormy painting
With lightning that feels like it's aiming
The colors are dim but degrading
What is happening to me?

They're crying twilight tears
Oh, they're crying, yes, they're dying
Twilight tears
C-c-cry, c-c-cry
Twilight tears
Oh, they're crying, I'm sick dying
Twilight
T-t-tears, t-t-tears

T-t-tears, t-t-tears
T-t-tears, t-t-tears

Never thought or realized
My dark manifestations starlight
My mind is painting them to life
Hide and run, and worry
Closing in to survive
Pulling me down with a grip that's tightening
My heart is racing, it's frightening
What is happening to me?

They're crying twilight tears
Oh, they're crying, yes, they're dying
Twilight tears
C-c-cry, c-c-cry
Twilight tears
Oh, they're crying, I'm sick dying
Twilight
T-t-tears, t-t-tears

T-t-tears, t-t-tears
T-t-tears, t-t-tears
