		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First they knockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers"
"And never leave your day one's in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My momma said, "Trust no hoe, use a rubber"

I'ma act
One, two, stop the track
Bring it back, what it do?
See Ricky said, "Never let nobody get the one up on you"
If they run up on you, hit 'em with a one, two
Or a bitch slap, leave the cul-de-sac 
you're brothers gon' have your back regardless
And stick with your day one homies that was here before you started
And fear no man, but the man above your head
Pray before you got to bed, everything my momma said

First they knockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers"
"And never leave your day one's in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My momma said, "Trust no hoe, use a rubber"
My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers"
"And never leave your day one's in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My momma said, "Trust no hoe, use a rubber"

Ay, your momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit
And I been makin' waves way before Nostalgic
That was back in Carol City yeah, when I was just a jit
With the all black faded Dicky with the Raider fit
That was it, we was lit, y'all wasn't even shit yet
We was Three 6, Wu-Tang mixed with Dipset
Ricky used to take me to my first shows ever
Would only drop jewels way before they dropped cheddar

First they knockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers"
"And never leave your day one's in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My momma said, "Trust no hoe, use a rubber"
My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers"
"And never leave your day one's in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother" (yeah)
My momma said, "Trust no hoe, use a rubber" (rubber)
