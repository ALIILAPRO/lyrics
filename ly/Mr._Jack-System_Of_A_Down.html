		<p>
		  Hey, Mister Jack
Is that the mouthwash in your eyes?
Hey, Mister Jack
Is that the cause of your surprise?

Hey, where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car?
Hey, where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car?
In the car
On the side of the freeway in the

Hey, Mister Jack (hey)
Is that the trick of your disguise?
Hey, Mister Jack
Is that the cause of your demise?

Hey, where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car?
Hey, where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car?
In the car
On the side of the freeway in the car?
In the car
On the side of the freeway in the

Wake up
Seven AM, morning
Came to take us away
Little men, big guns
Pointed at our heads

Seven AM, morning
Came to take us away
Little men, big guns
Pointed at our heads
At our, at our heads

Your prospect of living gone
You ran the light at dawn
Protectors on your back
Lights are on their track

You must now face authority
You're nothing like me
You must now face authority
You're nothing like me

Put your hands up, get out of the car
Put your hands up, get out of the car
Put your hands up, get out of the car

Fuck you, pig
Fuck you, pig
Fuck you, pig
Fuck you, pig
Put your hands up, get out of the car
