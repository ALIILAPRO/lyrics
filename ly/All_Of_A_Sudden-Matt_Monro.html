		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were fools you and I
Now we know it
We stood still as the days moved along
Love was ours but our eyes didn't show it
Suddenly we can see we were wrong

All of a sudden this world's yours and mine
All of a sudden water tastes like wine
Now every moment there are songs to sing
All of a sudden everything

Let's not talk of all the times we've been lonely
But let us speak of the times we will know
From today I will live for you only
Wish I'd said all these things long ago

All of a sudden this world's yours and mine
All of a sudden water tastes like wine
Now every moment there are songs to sing
All of a sudden everything

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
