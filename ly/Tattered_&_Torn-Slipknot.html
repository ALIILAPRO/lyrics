		  Kill Me
Something aches
Bad things slither
My floors are burning down
And I can't find a window

This is medieval
This is cerebral
Suffocated
Melodramatic

Driven to the verge of
I make you my enemy
The nerves you sever
Can serve you better

In the blink of an eye
In the space of a second
Open my wrists
Give me my lessons

(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
(Tearing myself apart) from the things that make me hurt
