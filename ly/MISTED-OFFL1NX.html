		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this weeping in the air
Who can tell where it will fall?
Through floating forests in the air
Cross the rolling open sea
Blow a kiss, I run through air
Leave the past, find nowhere
Floating forests in the air
Clowns all around you
Clowns that only let you know
Where you let your senses go
Clowns all around you
It's a cross I need to bear
All this black and cruel despair
This is an emergency
Don't you hide your eyes from me?
Open them and see me now

Do you see me now?
Can you see?
Do me now
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Do you see me now?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Do you see me now?

Do you see me now?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Do you see me now?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Do you see me now?
