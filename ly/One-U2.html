		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame?

You say
One love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
One love
We get to share it
Leaves you, baby
If you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much?
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one
But we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other
Then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you made me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should
One life
With each other
Sisters
Brothers
One life
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other

One
One
One

Ooh
Oh
May we get, may we get, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher, yeah
Yeah, get higher
Oh, higher
