		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lighting Bolts Flashing
Demon Crys
Satan Worries into the Night
Thunder Roaring - No disguise
The World is ending before your eyes
A Thousand times - You've thought of life
and How Time Would Not Pass You By
Now your eyes do see the light
You've got that feeling - Too Scared to Cry
The Roaring Thunder in your Ears
Brings back to you - Your Childhood Fears
All the Worries - All of Life
Could all end - on this One Night
As the Noise begins to grow
The Cloudburst sky begins to glow
You Close your Eyes
The World So Bright
Suddenly the Day
Turns into Night
              Death Noise
The Lower World - Will Rise Above
Taking over all they can
Sand aside and fight with us
or fall - Decline of Man
There's no turning back in the worlds eyes
Satan played it off with his Nuclear Guise
Great Radiation That Fills the Sky
With Poisonous Air That Kills off Life
Now the ground begins to Shake
It's Satanist Souls - Not ours He'll take
To Rid Forever
From the Universe
Those Who Claim their Faith
with Lucifer
