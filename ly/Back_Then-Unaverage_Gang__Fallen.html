		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you acting shady when I come around?
Keep that hellcat on me got at least 500 rounds
Light 'em up, I love it when they hit the ground
If you wasn't with us back then shut you fuckin mouth
Why you acting shady when I come around?
Keep that hellcat on me got at least 500 rounds
Light 'em up, I love it when they hit the ground
If you wasn't with us back then shut your fuckin mouth

Pussy mothafuckas got way too many opinions
Now they all just sitting back
Clamining that they fucking wit us
Only riding riding for my gang
9 Millimeter never missing
Staring right back at the devil, when I'm standing in the mirror
Putting on my ski mask then I load it up
I'm the Night time stalker feeling dangerous
Coming close mothafucka dare to test your luck
Hallow points chirpin when it's entering your cranium
A lot of things have changed from final overdose
Kept it real from the gate and no one coming close
Friends turning into snakes and never hit my phone
And Ain't nobody fucking with me if I'm in my zone woah

Why you acting shady when I come around?
Keep that hellcat on me got at least 500 rounds
Light 'em up, I love it when they hit the ground
If you wasn't with us back then shut you fuckin mouth
Why you acting shady when I come around?
Keep that hellcat on me got at least 500 rounds
Light 'em up, I love it when they hit the ground
If you wasn't with us back then shut your fuckin mouth

A lot of things never change, It's just how it goes
I'm feelin like another number, just a hollow ghost
I swear to God all these feelings, they be gettin' old
Crossin thru my mind, and got my guts spillin on the floor
It's takes a lot just to wake up everyday
Just to see i'm worthy to receive another day
Sick of all the repetition, I know I'll go insane
But it's sad that my mind is always lookin for a change
I'm all alone
Findin the unknown
It's bad enough I have to find the motivation just to go
I'm all alone
Fightin the unknown
It's bad enough I have to find the motivation just to go
