		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The shadows on the way
But you're the space between, mmm
What's on the other side
Is closer than it seems, mmm

Smoke up in the sky here, take my key, mmm
Step into the light remember me here, mmm

'Cause I would walk through the fire
And I would give you
Every last breath 'til there's nothing left
And I would walk through the fire
And I would give you
Every last breath 'til there's nothing left

Mmm, said it a hundred times
You are my silver lining, mmm
The sirens in the night
Yeah, they can see the riding, mmm

Smoke up in the sky here, take my key, mmm
Step into the light remember me here, mmm

'Cause I would walk through the fire
And I would give you
Every last breath 'til there's nothing left
And I would walk through the fire
And I would give you
Every last breath 'til there's nothing left

Every last breath 'til there's nothing left
Every last breath 'til there's nothing left
Every last breath 'til there's nothing left
Every last breath 'til there's nothing left
