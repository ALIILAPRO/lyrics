		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bought the earth, I sold it too
I would sell ya whole life, if I could too
You can't fit in, a pair of shoes

Yeah, I know it's not all great
But I love feeling this way
I'm off the grid, yeah, I'm out the way
Paint a picture with some blood all day
All day
I like a mixture
All day
Off the drugs but I miss 'em
All day
I tried to warn you 'bout this shit, but you ain't listen anyway
All day
I'm in 2093 all day

Am I wrong for being selfish?
Am I wrong for putting me first?
And I know why you confused, I got a way with words
Is it money? Is it power? Which one first?

I make, more money then you ever did
I make, a lot more money then ya bitch
I might, start talking crazy in this bitch
You might, just go and drive into a ditch
I don't hear a word when ya talk
I know that this world could be a lot
I know more than anybody else
I know what you do when you a mess

Tell me when you lie, tell me when you cry
But look me in the eye
I'm a busy guy, I'm out here building lives
No regard for life, I roll it on the dice
Don't tell me twice, put in on ya-, fuck that
Put it on ya life, you want a fairytale life
You want me to tuck ya in bed, read ya books all night
I live a trillion dollar life, I'll employ you a night

I know it's always changing every turn
I'll never look back on the bridge I burnt
I'll tell you one thing this wait the worth
Making all this money enough to buy the earth

I bought the earth, I sold it too
I'd sell ya whole life, if I could too
You can't fit in, a pair of shoes
I'ma pandemic, always on the news

When it comes night, always on the loose
When it comes night, what you gon' do?
I don't need the light, I see right through
I see your reflection in my rear view
Damn, what a good view
Damn, what we could do
Damn, I'm paranoid and rude
Damn, more disrespectful then you thought you knew
