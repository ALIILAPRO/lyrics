		  Mmm nah
Mmm nah mmm

Shawty just keep it a hunnid,
Don't know why she always wanna be with someone, 
Can't be alone she always needing somethin',
A broken heart she can't believe in nothing,
Shawty on one

Shawty just keep it a hunnid,
Don't know why she always wanna be with someone,
(I don't know said I don't know)
Can't be alone she always needing somethin',
A broken heart she can't believe in nothing,
Shawty on one

I don't wanna be the one,
She back and fourth wanna be the one,
Ain't in control, picky picky uh,
She with somebody but don't feel the love,

So come on, keep it goin
He a bum but she go back knowing
Won't treat her right, but she can't let go him
Always on her mind, but she can't keep goin

So she throwing it, keep throwing it
Won't treat her right but she can't let go of him, so she throwing it, keep throwin' it, keep throwin' it
keep throwing it,

I can't be, somebody in ya company, come with me and you'd own it, ya whole body, you showin' it, why you throwin' it, baby keep throwin' it

Shawty just keep it a hunnid, (Throwin' It)

Don't know why she always wanna be with someone, (Throwin' It)

Can't be alone she always needing somethin', (Throwin' It)

A broken heart she can't believe in nothing, (Throwin' It)

Shawty on one (Throwin' It)

Shawty just keep it a hunnid, (Throwin' It)

Don't know why she always wanna be with someone, (Throwin' It)

Can't be alone she always needing somethin', (Throwin' It)

A broken heart she can't believe in nothing, (Throwin' It)

Shawty on one (Throwin' It)

I don't wanna be the one,

(Throwin' It)

(Throwin' It)

(Throwin' It)

Ain't in control picky picky uh,

(Throwin' It)

(Throwin' It)

(Throwin' It)

Baby keep throwin' it

Baby keep throwin' it

Baby keep throwin' it

throwin' it

throwin' it

throwin' it

Baby keep throwin' it

throwin' it

throwin' it

throwin' it
