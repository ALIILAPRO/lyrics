		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We saw it all pass by and you went by
And I can't control anything
When you said that life can't be what you want
And I really want everything

When I pray
When I believe

I saw it end long before it ended
Life itself turned pale and ended
I saw you cry out acres of your image
Life itself does not heal me

Like a slow scenery I'm losing all my faith
In lifeless motion you're walking like you're dead
Like a slow scenery I'm losing all my faith
In lifeless motion you're walking like you're dead

We saw it all pass by and you went by
And I can't control anything
When you said that life can't be what you want
And I really want everything
