		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soon as you came in
All the beasts went away
They noticed that you're warm
Wait until you leave
Then come back for more

The ropes hang to keep us all awake
And I should have known

As soon as you came in
The agony, it went away
I noticed what you wore
To everything
We spoke and more

The ropes hang to keep us all awake
And I should have known

It only takes one break of your pose to get off
To save our place, home with you
Still the same song

As soon as you came in
Is when I believe we both crashed course

The ropes hang to keep us all awake
And I should have known
It only takes one break of a pose to get off
And to save our place home with you all
That's all it takes
Well, I should have known
It's still the same song
It's still the same song
