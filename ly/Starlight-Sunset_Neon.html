		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forever and ever
Wherever you are
We're always together
We're both made of stars

And even though I know I'm missing you
We'll be together, baby, oh, so soon

Stay with me
You're all I need
And in this night
We are starlight

This distance won't matter
You're always my heart
We've shared the same matter
In our lives from the start

And even though I know I'm missing you
We'll be together, baby, oh, so soon

Stay with me
You're all I need
And in this night
We are starlight

Stay with me
You're all I need
And in this night
We are starlight
Stay with me
You're all I need
And in this night
We are starlight
