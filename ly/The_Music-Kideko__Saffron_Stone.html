		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't stop the music

Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round

Don't stop the music

Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round  
Beat keeps going round

Don't you know you've got me mesmerized
With the beat I always fantasize
Don't stop the music 'cause it tends to soothe
I can tell you want to move  
   
Don't stop the music, it's so satisfying
It feels so good to me
Just because it's two o'clock
Don't stop the music
 
Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music
Don't stop the music 

the beat keep goin' 'round and 'round 
turns me upside down

the beat keep goin' 'round and 'round 
turns me upside down

Don't stop the music 

Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round  
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round  
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round  
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round
Beat keeps going round  
Beat keeps going round

Don't stop the music

Don't stop the music
