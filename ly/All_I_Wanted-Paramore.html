		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of me when you're out, when you're out there
I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well, it's a shame I'm a dream

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black-and-white reruns
That escaped from my mouth (oh, oh)

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
And maybe then we'd remember to slow down
At all of our favorite parts

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
