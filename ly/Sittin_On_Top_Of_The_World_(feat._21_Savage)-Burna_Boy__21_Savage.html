		<p>
		  Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

(I'm just tryna be me) go, go ahead, it's your time, baby
It's your time, baby, get wild, baby (I'm just tryna be me)
That's the difference when you're my baby
That's how it is when you're (sittin' on top of the world)
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
Her body make me stop the world
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)

Feel my thug passion
Give you what you ask for
So tell me if you want action
Until the lights back on
I get the one wey go last long
In an eleven room mansion
Pure like water where dey for nylon
I pull up in my high fashion, every light flashing
Anyway
We can go ahead and just head out
And chill up in my villa
Together the whole night
Just get in the drop top, take the head out
And cruise with your head outside

(I'm just tryna be me) go, go ahead, it's your time, baby
It's your time, baby, get wild, baby (I'm just tryna be me)
That's the difference when you're my baby
That's how it is when you're (sittin' on top of the world)
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
Her body make me stop the world
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)

Tell me what do we do
When these people don't know
What you been through
You survived through the night
Through the darkest of times
It's only right that you do what you like (21)

I can help you shit on anybody you ever hated (21)
Put you in Baguettes, got you feelin' like you made it (21)
Everything advanced, nothing that I do is basic
Me and Rolls Royce on a first name basis
Liquor with no chaser (yeah)
Only give her hundreds, 'cause she hate seein' new faces
Know she one of mine by the stones in the bracelet
Love money, nigga see her out, and they don't say shit (on god)
She told me to pay for it, now she backin' it up
Used to date a ball player, but they wrappin' it up
Got her in the penthouse, and I'm smackin' it up
They gon' point you to the top if you askin' for us (21)

(I'm just tryna be me) go, go ahead, it's your time, baby
It's your time, baby, get wild, baby (I'm just tryna be me)
That's the difference when you're my baby
That's how it is when you're (sittin' on top of the world)
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
Her body make me stop the world
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
(I'm just tryna be me) go, go ahead, it's your time, baby
It's your time, baby, get wild, baby (I'm just tryna be me)
That's the difference when you're my baby
That's how it is when you're (sittin' on top of the world)
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)

(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)

(I'm just tryna be me, I'm just tryna be me)
(Sittin' on top of the world)
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
(Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world)
