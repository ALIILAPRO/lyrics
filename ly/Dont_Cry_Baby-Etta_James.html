		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't cry, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know 
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

And oh, don't cry 
Don't cry baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know, you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

Don't cry, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know 
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again
