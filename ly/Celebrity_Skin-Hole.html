		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, make me over
I'm all I want to be
A walking study
In demonology

Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, so glad you could make it now

Oh, look at my face
My name is might have been
My name is never was
My name's forgotten

Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

When I wake up in my makeup
It's too early for that dress
Wilted and faded somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here
With your pound of flesh
No second billing 'cause you're a star now
Oh, Cinderella
They aren't sluts like you
Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses
Can you stand up or will you
Just fall down

You better watch out
What you wish for
It better be worth it
So much to die for

Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

When I wake up in my makeup
Have you ever felt so used up as this?
It's all so sugarless
Hooker, waitress, model, actress
Oh, just go nameless
Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
She obliterated everything she kissed
Now she's fading
Somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here
With your pound of flesh

You want a part of me
Well, I'm not selling cheap
No, I'm not selling cheap
