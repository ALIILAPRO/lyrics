		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, do you really wanna be my friend?
Do you really wanna be my lover?
If not, baby, let's pretend, pretend, love
Girl, do you really wanna be my friend?
Do you really wanna be my lover?
If not, baby, let's pretend, pretend, love

I just don't know what it is
That makes me so insane, girl
Maybe you should have our kids
'Cause then I'll see you forever
If we depart tonight
Please just call me, darling
If we depart tonight
Please just be my girl

Girl, do you really wanna be my friend?
Do you really wanna be my lover?
If not, baby, let's pretend, pretend, love
Girl, do you really wanna be my friend?
Do you really wanna be my lover?
If not, baby, let's pretend, pretend, love
Girl, do you really wanna be my friend?
Do you really wanna be my lover?
If not, baby, let's pretend, pretend, love
Girl, do you really wanna be my friend?
Do you really wanna be my lover?
If not, baby, let's pretend, pretend, love
Pretend, love
Pretend, love

Yeah
Mm-mm-hm
I hope you know I feel a way about you
About you, yeah
I hope you know I feel a way about you
About you
And I hope you know I feel a way about you
I can't doubt you, no
Just know
