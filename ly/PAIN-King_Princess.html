		  Do, do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do

These girls just come and let me down
I guess that's how I'll do it now
Pain

She don't think I got the time
Now I'm wondering if she's mine
Pain

I'd just hate for somebody to need me
I need you now
Can't you just love me or leave me
I figured out 
Like to be trapped in the feeling
I feel it now
Pain

'Cause I can't help
Turning my love into pain
And I can't help
Turning my love into pain

Do, do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do

You and I just get along
I wonder how I'll fuck it up
Pain

I know that I'm difficult
I hope it makes my wallet full
Pain

I'd just hate for somebody to need me
I need you now
Can't you just love me or leave me
I figured out 
Like to be trapped in the feeling
I've always found
Pain

'Cause I can't help
Turning my love into pain
And I can't help
Turning my love into pain

Oh, so I'll just wait 'til the day you leave me
Oh, so I'll just wait 'til the day you leave me
Oh, so I'll just wait 'til the day you leave me
Pain

'Cause I can't help
Turning my love into pain
And I can't help
Turning my love into pain

Do, do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do
Do do, do, do do
Do do do do do do

Pain
