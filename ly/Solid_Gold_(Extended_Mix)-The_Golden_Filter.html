		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silver, silver and gold
Silver and gold, silver and gold
Everyone wishes for silver and gold
How do you measure its worth?
Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth.

Silver and gold, silver and gold
Mean so much more when I see
Silver and gold decorations
On every Christmas tree.

Silver, silver and gold
Silver, silver and gold
Silver and gold
Silver and gold
Silver and gold

Wise men brought gifts to the mange I'm told
Mary was humble to see
Shepherds and kings there on bended knees
It's silver and gold, silver and gold

Feeling the world with their lives
Silver and gold how they shimmer on every Christmas night
On every Christmas night
Silver, silver and gold
