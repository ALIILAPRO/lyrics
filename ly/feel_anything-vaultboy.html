		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stare in the mirror i don't like myself
Feel like I'm not who I could be

Same drinks, same people
In the same hometown
They say they will, they never leave
I wanna leave i wanna leave

I'm feelin cabin fever
Don't know what's stopping me
From diving in something deeper cause

I want a heartbreak i want it to hurt
Call her back and make everything worse
I'd rather feel anything with anyone
Anything

I wanna get lost to find my way back
Fall in love even if it won't last
I'd rather feel anything with anyone
Anything than nothing

Seen the same billboards since 2006
Just driving past them drives me mad
Every first date ends with
The same first kiss
This simulation's such a drag such a drag
It's getting bad

I'm feeling cabin fever
Don't know what's stopping me
From diving in something deeper

I want a heartbreak i want it to hurt
Call her back and make everything worse
I'd rather feel anything with anyone
Anything

I wanna get lost to find my way back
Fall in love even if it won't last
I'd rather feel anything with anyone
Anything than nothing

I'd rather feel anything with anyone
Anything than nothing

I'd rather feel anything with anyone
Anything than nothing
