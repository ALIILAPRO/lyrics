		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can this be him?
The one I have waited centuries to see?
How strange
So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory
Can this be him, this Hellboy?

You don't even know what I've been through (what I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you
You don't even know what I've been through (what I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you

Leave me to bleed, I know I got you on your knees
But somethin' keeps on tellin' me
It keeps on tellin' me
Peep, leave it alone, I'm good on my own
Mama miss me at home, but I'm good on my own
Baby I'm cold, back on the road
Show after show, fuckin' ho after ho
I swear it gets so lonely sometimes
Please just hold me one time
Fuck these hoes and fuck life
I've been waitin' here all damn night
Not one call or text from you
You're the same as my ex, fuck you
Damn, bitch

You don't even know what I've been through (what I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you
You don't even know what I've been through (what I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you
