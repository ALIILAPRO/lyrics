		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uhhh
Oh Baby
Ahhh

Every week and night
I sit here thinking of you
I can´t wait to get in
I´m waiting for the week to be trough

Saturday´s the only day I am really think of
'Cause every other day is just another day no doubt
'Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go trough my mind
And everybody´s working for the weekend

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I've got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till he hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be ok
'Cause it´s a Saturday

And thinking about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday it´s alright
And thinking about Thursday or Friday 'cause tonight´s Saturday night

Every week and hour
I think about just you all by my side
And I can´t wait much longer
Want to show you how I feel for you tonight

Saturday´s the only day I am really think of
'Cause every other day is just another day no doubt
'Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go trough my mind
And everybody´s working for the week
'Cause it´s a Saturday

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I've got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till he hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be ok
'Cause it´s a Saturday

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I've got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till he hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be ok
'Cause it´s a Saturday

Saturday´s the only day I am really think of
'Cause every other day is just another day no doubt
'Cause every time I think about you, thoughts go trough my mind
And everybody´s working for the weekend


Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I've got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till he hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be ok
'Cause it´s a Saturday

And thinking about Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday it´s alright
And thinking about Thursday or Friday 'cause tonight´s Saturday night

Everything is alright on a Saturday night
And I've got all my fellows with their honey by my side
The DJ spins a record ´till he hits the morning light
And everything´s gonna be ok
'Cause it´s a Saturday
