		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea, yea, yea
Ooh
I can feel it move me
Feel it shove me
As I break the law
Said yea
I can feel it's jabbing
Cuts the numbness then I
I come alive yea

Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
'Cause it's a

Yea twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive

Said yea
I took it standing
Broke commandments
And he tumbled like a toy
Blood
Like a crimson highway
Spreading out
From his forehead to the ground

Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
'Cause it's a

Yea twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
Wo-oh, yea

Wo-oh God above
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart, well
Wo-oh
want to know
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below, yea

Yea
I know my breeding
Know my father
He was born of light
Said yea
Can't hardly stand it
Cuts me down the middle
Then I
I come alive yea

Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
'Cause it's a

Yea twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
Come alive
Wo-oh, yea

Wo-oh
God above
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart, yea
Wo-oh
want to know
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below

Wo-oh, wo-oh
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart
Wo-oh, wo-oh
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below, yea
