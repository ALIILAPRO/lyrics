		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could be your North Star
I can be the love of your life
I could warm your cold heart
I could walk the edge of your knife
And when you think you're so high
I can always take you higher
You never can be too high
Fuck it, baby let's go higher

'Cause every time I say I'm sorry
I never wanna fight again
I never wanna hurt you honey
Remember when we were just friends?

So, let me go wild
I wanna float I wanna fly
My inner child
I only need it to survive
Let me go wild
I gotta flow, I gotta fly
Let me go wild
We're only running out of time

Out of time, oh oh oh
Time time time, oh oh oh

I could be your quick fix
I could be the catch for your fall
And when you need to get kicks
I can give the best of them all

'Cause every time I say I'm sorry
I never wanna fight again
And even if we end our story
Everything is just pretend

So, let me go wild
I wanna float, I wanna fly
My inner child
I only need it to survive
Let me go wild
I gotta flow I gotta fly
Let me go wild
We're only running out of time

Out of time, oh oh oh
Time time time, oh oh oh

So, let me go wild (out of time, oh oh oh)
So, let me go wild (time time time, oh oh oh)
(Let me go wild) (out of time, oh oh oh)
(Let me go wild) (time time time, oh oh oh)
