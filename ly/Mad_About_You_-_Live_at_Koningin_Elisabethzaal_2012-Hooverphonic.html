		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel the vibe
Feel the terror
Feel the pain
It's driving me insane
I can't fake
For God's sake why am I driving in the wrong lane
Trouble is my middle name
But in the end I'm not too bad
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you

Mad about you
Mad

Are you the fishy wine who will give me a headache in the morning
Or just a dark blue land mine that will explode without a decent warning
Give me all your true hate and I'll translate it in our bed
Into never seen passion, never seen passion
That's why I am so mad about you

Mad about you
Mad

Trouble is your middle name
But in the end you're not too bad
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you

Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad

Give me all your true hate and I'll translate it in your bed
Into never seen passion
That is why I am so mad about you

Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
