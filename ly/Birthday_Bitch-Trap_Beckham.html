		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One time for the birthday chick
Two times for the birthday chick
Three times for the birthday chick
Go ahead if it's your birthday chick
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 

If you a bad, bad chick and it's your birthday
G'on head and f-it up in the worst way
If you a bad, bad chick and it's your birthday
G'on ahead and f-it up in the worst way
C'mon, one time for the birthday
Two times for the birthday
Three times for the birthday
It's you baby, it's your birthday

Yeah, you the birthday b-
It's time to do some birthday sh-
I wanna see that birthday cake
Lil' bae g'on and birthday shake
I'm trying to get you to the birthday bed
You can even get the birthday hea-
That's what you call birthday sex
You don't need no love from ya birthday ex
She came with her birthday clique
Her and her girls looking birthday rich
Take a shot of this birthday liq'
I'm trying to get you back home in your birthday 'fit
It's time to get birthday drunk (what you talkin' 'bout?)
I'm talking 'bout birthday slumped
Bend it over this your birthday song
Let the dress come up, show your birthday thong
One time for the birthday chick
Two times for the birthday chick
Three times for the birthday chick
G'on ahead if it's your birthday chick
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 

If you a bad-bad chick and it's your birthday
G'on head and f-it up in the worst way
If you a bad-bad chick and it's your birthday
G'on ahead and f-it up in the worst way
C'mon, one time for the birthday
Two times for the birthday
Three times for the birthday
It's you baby, it's your birthday

And she came with her best friend
So she 'bout to f-it up, f-it up, f-it up, f-it up
And she is a good girl
But tonight she's cutting up, cutting up, cutting up, cutting up
Smack her on the booty if it's real for me
Make it roll like it's going down the hill for me
And she 'bout to turn up if you 'bout the drama
Then it don't concern her, she all on the stage
Got the place 'bout to burn up
She f-it up, watch her shake Tina Turner
It's all about you, girl, tonight it's 'bout you
Make the whole club stop whenever she come through
One time for me two

One time for the birthday chick
Two times for the birthday chick
Three times for the birthday chick
G'on ahead if it's your birthday chick
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 
Get up if it's your birthday 

If you a bad-bad chick and it's your birthday
G'on head and f-it up in the worst way
If you a bad-bad chick and it's your birthday
G'on ahead and f-it up in the worst way
C'mon, one time for the birthday
Two times for the birthday
Three times for the birthday
It's you baby, it's your birthday
