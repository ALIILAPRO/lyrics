		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life

I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life
We gon' party all night
She don't care if I die
Yeah, right, yeah, right
Yeah, I bet you won't cry
Yeah, I bet you won't try
But you know I don't mind
But you know I don't mind

Yeah right, yeah right
Yeah right, yeah right
Yeah right, yeah right

Yeah, you bet I know that she ain't
Never give a single fuck about me
Yeah, you bet she know that we ain't
Never gonna be together, I see
Yeah, you bet I go to see you when
I'm feeling like a drum without a beat
Yeah, you dance so good
And I think that's kinda neat

What you know about love?
What you know about life?
What you know about blood?
Bitch, you ain't even my type
Yeah right, yeah right
Yeah, you know I feel right
Yeah, you living right now
You don't ever pick sides
Yeah right, yeah right
I'm overthinking my pride
But I don't gotta look nice
She just feelin' my ice
(She just feelin' my-)

Yeah, you bet I know that she ain't
Never give a single fuck about me
Yeah, you bet she know that we ain't
Never gonna be together, I see
Yeah, you bet I go to see you when
I'm feeling like a drum without a beat
Yeah, you dance so good
And I think that's kinda neat
