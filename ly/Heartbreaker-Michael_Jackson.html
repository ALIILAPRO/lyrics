		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs 
She only knows how low that she can go 
She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant 
Only for me, then spoke with her body 
Her only goal is just to take control 
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right thriough her 
She's a heartbreaker 

She plays a game with such an innocent face 
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
And she'll keep playing until I let her go 
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right thriough her she's a heartbreaker 

I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
Stop being without you 
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
And start being without you 
But I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
And stop talkin' about you 
And what will she say? 
They will say I was the man that got away 

I can't blame her
I thought it was love, but it's game huh?
When you're dealing with the emotions, it's pain ma
Take a closer look when your dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, no
Heart murder in place then you'll see
It won't heal from Pepsi they see
Ball hard player, she's a star player
I need Liz Cracker
I ain't seen the heartbreaker, so come on

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 

That girl I
Should have known she was a 
That girl I 
Should've seen right through her
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
