		  Reaching out for something to hold
Reaching out
Reaching out
Reaching out
Reaching out
Reaching out
Reaching out for something to hold
Reaching out for something to hold

Something's on and I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know
What I'm looking for
Something's on and I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know
Reaching out for something to hold
Reaching out for something to hold
Something's on and I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know
What I'm looking for

Something's on and I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know
Reaching out for something to hold
Reaching out for something to hold
