		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen a lot of shit
Yeah
Seen a lot of shit

I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner sellin' crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen bakin' soda all up on the floor
Police bangin' on the door while grippin' a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half-breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm makin' to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fuckin' problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah, we leave 'em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capeesh? Homie, word up

Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominatin', uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease 
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we droppin' bars
It's all love, man, this shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shootin' for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah
I heard y'all finally eatin' over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack 'til the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rappin' for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mindstate celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap gettin' me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they mamas
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's Ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic

Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

Mmm, I'm thinkin' (C Sick)
Okay, yeah
