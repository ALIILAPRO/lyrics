		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After all the time
After you
Had you seen me with someone new
Hanging so high for your return
But the stillness is a burn

Had I seen it in your eyes
There'd have been no try after try
Your leaving had no goodbye
Had I just seen one in your eyes

I can't give it up
To someone else's touch
Because I care too much

I can't give it up
To someone else's touch
Because I care too much

Could you tell
I was left lost and lonely
Could you tell
Things ain't worked out my way

Wish the best for you
Wish the best for me
Wished for infinity
If that ain't me

Give it up
I can't give it up

Give it up
I can't give it up

I can't give it up
To someone else's touch
Because I care too much

I can't give it up
To someone else's touch
Because I care too much

Give it up, I can't give it up
