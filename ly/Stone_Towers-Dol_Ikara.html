		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a slumber in the moss
Like a display in the dark

I have loved you from the start
But there's cold veneer near the cloud of you
Of you, of you, of you, oh

Sit on back in thrones of blue
And inlay black, so righteous you
Bear cold decree, it's dead to me
Sit on through while your mistakes loom
You're stone dead blind and it's drowning all
Your company, it's dead to me, yeah

What are you here for? You're caught astray, yeah
What am I here for? You're my decay

So, you codify in stone towers of courtyards
And I shudder, oh, I hide
The silhouette of white in the middle of the night 
The night, night

Sit on back in thrones of blue
And inlay black, so righteous you
Bear cold decree, it's dead to me
Sit on through while your mistakes loom
You're stone dead blind and it's drowning all
Your company, it's dead to me, yeah

So what am I here for? I'm caught astray, here
What am I here for? I've gone astray, here
What are you here for? Now, I'm your decay
Now, what are you here for? Now I'm your decay

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh

Oh, but I nearly died
By a forest fire in your eyes
