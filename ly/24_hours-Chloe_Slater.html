		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not clear if I am ripening or rotting
It girl told me if I'm sad to just go shopping
Kinda wish I could cut holes in all her french designer pockets but I can't

She's a waitress and works part time as a hobby
Spends her wages in ten days on hipster coffee
Then moves abroad to be a star
I'd love to live on daddy's money but I can't

Am I pathetic for being lost
Only ever slip through the back door
Cos apathetic comes at a cost
Babe I swear to god that I need this more

And my imagination frequents your life
Thirty seconds snippets that twist the knife
Your 24 hours aren't the same as mine

(Do you wish you were that hot)
(Do you wish you were paid to shop)

And I would look so much better if I had your clothes
I watched the whole series when you did your nose
Even though it always looked fine
Your 24 hours aren't worth the same as mine

You're a fucking liar but wait
I just wanna watch you unbox even more land waste
Because it scratches my brain
My attention span is been lacking as of late
Tell me about that awful date
How you had to go home and masturbate
I doom scroll through all the hate
Please distract me from the state of the world as I know it

Am I pathetic for being lost
Only ever slip through the back door
Cos apathetic comes at a cost
Babe I swear to god that I need this more

And my imagination frequents your life
Thirty seconds snippets that twist the knife
Your 24 hours aren't the same as mine

(Do you wish you were that hot)
(Do you wish you were paid to shop)

And I would look so much better if I had your clothes
I watched the whole series when you did your nose
Even though it always looked fine
Your 24 hours aren't worth the same as mine

Saw you on a billboard babe
When I was walking to my 9 to 5
I know that the worlds a stage
Can't help thinking if I had your life
I'd be dressed to the nines
I'd be out all night
I'd be drinking wine
Sink in with a backstage pass
With a brand new ass I'd be quite alright

And my imagination frequents your life
Thirty seconds snippets that twist the knife
Your 24 hours aren't the same as mine

(Do you wish you were that hot)
(Do you wish you were paid to shop)

And I would look so much better if I had your clothes
I watched the whole series when you did your nose
Even though it always looked fine
Your 24 hours aren't worth the same as mine
