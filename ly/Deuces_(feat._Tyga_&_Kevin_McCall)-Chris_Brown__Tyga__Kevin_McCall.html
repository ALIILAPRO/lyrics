		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hopin' for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, "Keep it drama free"
Woah-woah (Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Yeah, yeah, told you that I'm leavin', deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Woah, woah
I know you mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm movin' on to somethin' better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (say bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (say bye-bye)

Uh, used to be valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (no reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip or pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to (oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet 
I don't never feel like we vibin' (oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter (oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm movin' on to somethin' better, better, better
No more tryna make it work, no (deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (say bye-bye, oh-oh, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (say bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her, yeah (say bye-bye)

Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills (oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me (oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu (oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (oh)

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh (deuces)
I'm movin' on to somethin' better, better, better (better, baby)
No more tryna make it work, hey (deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (say bye-bye, bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (say bye-bye) 
Deuces
