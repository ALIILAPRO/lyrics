		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save me
Lift the veil that shades this somber sleep

I disintegrate with all the things you say
A blame I can not take
Neither can you

Digging through the dirt
Crawling on my knees
Lying by my grave of self-esteem

From your beams of light
There's no place to hide
In the witching hour I'll stay

Now there's a glint within the darkness
A tainted ancient auras grave
Concealed, the remnants of a carcass
I hear your voice and I lose control again

So many years behind
So many times I lied
There are many things I regret

So many years will pass
So many times you'll lie
There are many things you'll regret

Save me
Take away the pain inside and
Teach me
How to keep those stone cold eyes
Hold me
Tell me how the phantoms die
Guide me
Lift the veil that shades this somber sleep

Keep our tainted kingdom flawless

Tried to deny what I always confined
I have to be frank
To be looked in the eye
I must try to defy what once made me fright
And I cannot comply
The greed needs supplies
And I tried to rely on who I left behind
The stakes were too high

Tried to deny what I always confined
I have to be looked in the eye
I must try to defy what frightens me
Cannot comply, I cannot satisfy
The greed needs supplies
To rely on who I left behind
The stakes are too high

Stay under my cozy wings
There's no danger sleeping next to me
Foe, or maybe a loyal friend?
Let desire set the course to take

Save me
Take away the pain inside
Heal me
Tell me if I've gone completely blind

Save me
Take away the pain inside and
Teach me
How to use those compound eyes
Hold me
Tell me how the phantoms die and
Guide me
Lift the veil that shades this somber sleep
