		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like tall, tan driving 'round the city
Flirting with the girls like,"You're so pretty"
"Springsteen is the king, don't you think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing"

Like ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-whoa

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh

Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now
You're like so sick, everybody said it
You're way ahead of the trend, ge-get it
Elvis is the best, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress

Like ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-whoa

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh

Everybody wants to go fast but they can't compare
I don't really want the rest, only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying but I'm praying for you

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh
Like an American
