		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is ticking 
Like it always does
It flies right by
Right over us

There is nothing 
You can do to quell
To stop that girl 
From running like hell 


cll the sweet tea in Carolina
cll the sun that comes to dry up all the rain
cll the mountain peaks in colorado
They're waiting there and
Calling out our names


What I've been missin
Is your tender touch
If I've got you
Then I have enough

Don't wanna waste it
cll these precious nights
We never know the day
When we're gonna fly


cll the sweet tea in Carolina
cll the sun that comes to dry up all the rain
cll the mountain peaks in colorado
They're waiting there and
Calling out our names


cll the sweet tea in Carolina
cll the sun that comes to dry up all the rain
cll the mountain peaks in colorado
They're waiting there and
Calling out our names
