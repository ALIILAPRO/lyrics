		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Freak bitch keep starin' at the Draco
Type to lob, but promise summer make my days long
Fuck up a bitch nigga in my bae clothes
Askin' questions, all my friends are fake hoes
Double up, no triple six, you're typin' less
Used to do it nine-to-five, no double shift
If he don't share the ho, he's not my friend
He playin' greedy with the bitch, come get your mans

Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity
Big stench, yes, yes, you big stench
You big stench, yes, yes, you big stench (yeah)
You big stench in my life, you big stench
You big stench in my life, you big stench (ooh-ooh)

The energy is triple six and mine is blessed (ooh-ooh)
Thank God I put them crosses on before we met (ooh-ooh, yeah)
What time we takin' off today? My type of stress (stress)
I send them boys by, but surprise they gon' collect (ooh, yeah)
Ain't seen your ass in 'bout two weeks, but how you doin'? (ooh)
But this Bugatti cost me three, I ten-to-two it (ooh, yeah)
Ooh, Jacques, you a asshole (yeah, oh)
If it's beef, it's pedigree, my dawgs gon' chew it (yeah, chew)
Takin' blues right after blues is how she blew it (blew it)
Ate the whole bag 'fore it got to me, she runnin' through it (through it)
Keep talkin' wreck when we do crashes, have insurance
Talkin' money when I'm on the Peloton for the endurance (for the endurance)
Got IQ and she cute, so she special
And I like the way she bounce it, instrumental (instrumental)
I can't fall in love, it's fuckin' up my mental (fuckin' up my mental)
I can't fuck with bitch niggas on a menstrual (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Too good, two AM, need the fade (fade)
I like creepin' four AM when it ain't safe (ain't safe)
And she with it, with the blicky when it's late (late)
She roll me one, I dick her down
She tighten my braids up (she tighten my braids up)
She go out, I go in, it's okay (alright)
She keep powder on her nose, it's not no makeup (it's lit)
Bandana silky, on her braids is how they lay up
She need a light, she need a ta-ta-ta-taste

Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity
Big stench, yes, yes, you big stench
You big stench, yes, yes, you big stench 
You big stench in my life, you big stench
You big stench in my life, you big stench

Huh, I'm big rich
Go run that comma, tell your mama, ho-ho
You know I'm crazy like my mama, ho-ho
You know I get it from my mama, ho-ho
Don't talk to your mama crazy, ho-ho
Have a baby, ho
Give me top and braid my hair
Now while I'm prayin', don't be eyeballin' your sister, ho-ho
Smokin' mystical
Two hoes gettin' psychical, huh, more like scissorin'
Kiss a bitch, no Listerine, clitoris flickerin'
Pussy taste like tangerine
You went back to your ex on me
Huh, just to flex on me
But that shit don't mean anythin', quit textin' me
You got an innocent face, I stroke it
You got good taste, when we met, I left you frozen
I know you wanna be a rich nigga focus
You love me because I get the check and throw it

Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity, huh-huh
Durag activity
Big stench, yes, yes, you big stench
You big stench, yes, yes, you big stench 
You big stench in my life, you big stench
You big stench in my life, you big stench
