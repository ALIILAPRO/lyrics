		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like

What is it really that's going on here?
You've got the system for total control
Now is there anybody out there?
Now watch us suffer, yeah, 'cause we can't go

What is it really that is in your head?
What little life that you had just died
I'm gonna be the one that's taking over
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby?
Are you going with me?
'Cause I'm going with you
That's the end of all time

What is it really that motivates you?
The need to fly or this fear to stop?
I'll go along when you realize
When we get there I say nine of ten drop

Now who's the light and who is the devil?
You can't decide, so I'll be your guide
And one by one, they will be hand chosen
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby?
Are you going with me?
'Cause I'm going with you
That's the end of all time

You are a robot

Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide
Now this is what it's like

What is it really when they're falling over?
Everything that you thought was denied
I'm gonna be the one that's taking over
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby?
Are you going with me?
'Cause I'm going with you
That's the end of all time

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby?
Are you going with me?
'Cause I'm going with you
That's the end of all time

Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready
That's the end of all time
Are you going?
Yeah, I'm going
That's the end of all time
