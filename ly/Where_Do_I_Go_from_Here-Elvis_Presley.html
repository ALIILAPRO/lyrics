		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I knew the way I'd go back home
The countryside has changed so much I'd surely end up lost
Half-remembered names and faces so far in the past
On the other side of the bridges that were burned once they were crossed

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Get back home where my childhood dreams and wishes still are none of my regrets
Go back to a place where I can figure all the odds
Have a fighting chance to lose the blues and win my share of bets

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Tell me where, where does a fool go when there's no-one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go when he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
