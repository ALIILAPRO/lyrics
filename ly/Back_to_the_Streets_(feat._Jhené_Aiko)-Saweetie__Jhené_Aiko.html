		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull up in my hood best dressed (best dressed)
Next thing, upgrade, who's next? (Who's next?)
Rich boy got him on deck (on deck)
Good boy, tell that nigga fetch, I
Put my new man on a leash (on a leash)
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy a round spin him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spin him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da (da-dee-da)
Back to the streets

So clean when I pull up to the scene
Big goals and I put that on me
What you thinkin'? What's good?
Fuck how you feel and I wish a nigga would
Had to hit the Heisman on ya homies
Steppin' in here, bad bitches only
My ex used to act like he owned me
Ain't enough just to treat me like a trophy
I had that, passed that, knew I had to trash that
Bounced on his ass, turn that boy into a flashback
I'm a 5 star bitch with the price tag
Gotta find me somebody that could match that

My last one got on my last nerve
Made me go change my passwords
I hit the curve with bad swerve
You know I get the last word

Pull up in my hood best dressed (best dressed)
Next thing, upgrade, who's next? (Who's next?)
Rich boy got him on deck (on deck)
Good boy, tell that nigga fetch, I
Put my new man on a leash (on a leash)
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy a round spin him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spin him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da (da-dee-da)
(Yeah), back to the streets

Back to the streets, sent you back to your old hood
On hood, baby, this is for your own good
I'm a player ass bitch and you knew it
Had a good time, now I'm ready for some new dick
Passed it to Saweetie, now you hit it, through with it
There it ain't really nothin' else to do with it
Yeah, you know I leveled up
I can't be stuck
I wish you luck though
Consider yourself blessed
You got to fuck with the baddest
You know that I can't be capped, no, I gotta dip out

Pull up in my hood best dressed (best dressed)
Next thing, upgrade, who's next? (Who's next?)
Rich boy got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga fetch (yeah)
I put my new man on a leash (on a leash)
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease (ooh)
I ride around town 'til I leave ('til I leave, oh)
I gave the boy a round spin him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah, I spin him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets

La-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets
Ba-back to the streets
La-da-dee-da-dee-da
Yeah
Back to the streets

(Put my new man on a leash)
(He was just a lease)
(Ride around town 'til I leave)
