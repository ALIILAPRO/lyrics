		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Conductor) ayo

Extravagant gat, ravishing
Rockin' full moons
My hi-point have me arrogant
My whole team smothered in Marine
Stashing crack in my Celine drawers
Niggas got wet, shot up Geraldine's
Mason jars, Maison Margiela scarves
Macintosh catalogue
The illest shit ever, I swear to God
We let you all have it
50 hanging out the stick
Now I made a sure classic
Had to throw the work in acid
Every verse we work the magic
Dior jacket one of one (One)
Left with the moon, came back with the sun
(Sun)
You fuck niggas done (Fuck niggas done)
My shooter don't shoot unless it has drum
(Has drum)

Crescent moons and indica trees
Got three killas to the left of me
When they get a whiff of death it pleases-me
He got four mill' at a
Safe house on the lake
Start with his pops, Pitchfork his face
Make his bitch beg please
Then sledgehammer both her knees
