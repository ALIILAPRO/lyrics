		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

I will be one of the greatest
That is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
Always wanted to be famous
Just being real, yeah, just being honest

My haters gon' always be nameless
Give them no cloud, I give them no power

Creators built different, they ancient
Sooner than later, all will be ours

I keep an eye out for the numbers
I stay in contact, synchronization

To infinity, even beyond it
I am a comet, no destination

A lot of things I am above
And there are a lot of things
That are above me

Do no come for the people I love
'Cause then I get scary, then I get ugly, yeah

Ain't no problem when I'm the equation
Prescence noted, observation
I'm not new here, reborn creation
Come and find me, sending location

Ain't no problem when I'm the equation
Prescence noted, observation
I'm not new here, reborn creation
Come and find me, sending location

Enlightened, they call me a siren
Through them I receive my guidance
Don't keep it all in, don't fight it
Fire to a flame, ignite it
Rules make me more defiant
I will never be compliant
Yeah, I got it down to a science

It's so much more than a mindset
Gotta start now, gotta change it
Take it all back, reclaim it
Don't bite your tongue, just say it
Don't get too high, stay weighted
Time to break down the matrix
They know that the mind can play tricks
Their message it clear, it's blatant, it's blatant

Yeah, yeah, yeah ooh

I will be one of the greatest
That is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
(Ooh, ooh) that is a promise
Always wanted to be famous
Just being real, yeah, just being honest
Just being honest

I will be one of the greatest
That is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
That is a promise
Always wanted to be famous
Just being real, yeah, just being honest
Just being honest
