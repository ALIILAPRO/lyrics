		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't stop won't stop get guap
Ten white toes in them Tory flip flops
Manicures and pedicures I'm always tip top
When they say I'm not hot all these lies need to stop
'Cause I'm icy, wifey haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get RIP up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean got some hitta's moving shiesty
Ask me if I'm rollin' with some Gucci bitch I might be
It's very unlikely my wrist ain't looking icy
Charging by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey
Yeah, I be where the bosses be
Judging from my vibe you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror I thank God for what I'm about to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird stay clear I'm living drama free
Never living comfortably, got a lot of goals to meet
My team is trying to eat so we grinding 'til our mental bleed
You tryna get a bag of weed?
I'm tryna get a bag a week
Put it in my savings and invest in the right companies
My dream is like a child and I'm taking all the custody
Obstacles be slowing me
But that buffer moldin' me
So I take my time 'cause I'm always where I'm suppose to be
Keep my niggas close to me 'cause I'm knowing they go for me
You can not get a hold of me?
I'm probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that's how I keep my sanity

Yeah it's my team's summer, couple set backs
Bounce back and recover
The clique real small but we making big moves 
And we headed to the top so we can get a better view like

I'ma catch a tan overseas while I'm out the country
Let me get some Hennessy while I'm chilling on the beach
I'ma count a couple G's let the server bring receipts
Double checking my expenses never messy always neat
Never ever, that's how a hot girl do it
Number one stunner icy girl with a Cuban
Cash money mama that be dining in Bahamas
Eating Fettuccini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters
Huh, I don't got no time for these hoes
Speaking on my name like I'm someone that they know
I'm the big cat bitch yes these niggas love me
Is that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be!
