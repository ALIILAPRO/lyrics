		  Flatline
My love is blind
Flatline
My love is blind

I think I'm lost in a girl, she adore me
I've got a case of whatever you call it
Now I go dumb, I go stupid, I love it
Flatline my brain

Flatline
My love is blind
Flatline
My love is blind

I-I-I said what I needed to say
Back to zero, and I'm nothing again
I-I-I said what I needed to say
(Ba-ba-ba) back to zero, and I'm nothing, I'm nothing

I-I-I said what I needed to say
(Ba-ba-ba) back to zero, and I'm nothing
I said what I needed to say
(Ba-ba-ba) back to zero, and I'm nothing, I'm nothing

Cut the shit, are you fucking with me?
Step away, I can feel your disease

Cut the shit, are you fucking with me?
Step away, I can feel your disease

Cut the shit, are you fucking with me?
Step away, I can feel your disease

Cut the shit, are you fucking with me?
Step away, I can feel your disease

Flatline
My love is blind
Flatline
My love is blind

Flat
Flat
Flat
