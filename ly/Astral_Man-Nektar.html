		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back in town with the biggest show around
Strike up the band it's time for Astral Man
Don't know where he'll be landing
From his tightrope in the sky
Don't know if he will make it
Close your eyes watch him fly

Astral Man turning in relation to the ground
Burning, please remember what you see
Returning together down to Earth

Astral Man how gracefully he lands
Thrills all 'round his antics know no bounds
Don't know what he'll be doing
On his tightrope in the sky
He thrills the little children
Close your eyes watch him fly

Astral Man turning in relation to the ground
Burning, please remember what you see
Returning together down to Earth

Astral Man acknowledges the band
People clap they appreciate his act
He bows towards the people
And leaves the ring behind
Hoping he has given
Money's worth down to Earth

"And thank you, Astral Man!"
