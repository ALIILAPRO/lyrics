		  (I got a good feeling)

Spent days inside this hotel
Tryna' find some piece of mind
Need space to deal with myself
I need a minute on my own

I've been closing blinds and cutting ties with everybody I know, I know
Something tells me it ain't helping all this shit ain't good for my soul, my soul

I been hiding away 
From myself M.I.A
But when I woke up today 
I got a good Feeling
Think I'm ready this time
Got a new state of mind
Things are gonna be fine

Oooooooooo
I got a good feeling
I got a good feeling
I got a good feeling
I got a good feeling

3 miles outside my home 
Been a minute since I called
Sunshine I feel alive I feel alive again
I can finally see it all

I've been closing blinds and cutting ties with everybody I know, I know
Something tells me it ain't helping all this shit ain't good for my soul, my soul

I been hiding away 
From myself M.I.A
But when I woke up today 
I got a good Feeling
Think I'm ready this time
Got a new state of mind
Things are gonna be fine

Oooooooooo
I got a good feeling
I got a good feeling
I got a good feeling
I got a good feeling
