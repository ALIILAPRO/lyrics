		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's in the

Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (you, you)
I wondered if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew (knew)

I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought you had your shit together

But damn, I was wrong (wrong)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw, yeah
But you got no job (job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

I used to think you were shy (shy)
But maybe you just had nothin' on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine (mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find

(So) so easy (easy)
(So mm-mm) easy, mm-mm-mm, mm

Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually

But you proved me wrong (wrong)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
But you got no job (no job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (think you're such a lost cause)
But you got no job

What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, now, now, now, now, now
What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, now, now, now
