		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, your name, do solemnly swear not to off myself
Think about offing myself
Or continue thinking about offing myself
Without reaching out for help
After listening to this song

Sometimes I see her on the sidewalk
Biking on the wet chalk
Spelling out their names
And I feel insane
'Cause I know it's just a game
That I'm playing with my brain
I don't see her, but I see her
And I know it isn't real
But I fake it anyway
Pull a smile and wave
Nod and look away
Wait for it to fade
But it happens all the time, people say it's fine
My roommate says they're killing us
But we're killing ourselves
I'm surrounded by 

Dead girls on the road
Dead girls on my phone
Dead girls, where do they go?
All of the fucking
Dead girls all around
Dead girls in my town
Dead girls, I don't know
Dead girls, where do they go?

And it'd be wrong to say I miss them
I didn't really know him
I just have a couple friends who say they knew him well
They'd seemed like something special
Really don't they all?
I guess before you're gone it can be kinda hard to tell

I broke the fucking news
It wasn't mine to break
She cried but I was empty, it wasn't mine to say

There's dead kids on the road
Dead kids in my phone
Dead kids, where do they go?
I wanna be a dead kid, with my friends
Dead kids, home again
Dead kids, I don't know

You like 'em better dead
Better dead
Just say you like that
You like me better dead 
Better dead 
Going against your head
You like em 'dead

And if all you ever see are dead girls
If all you hear is terrible news
Maybe it's not all of them, the dead girls
Maybe it's more about you 
The living need attention too

Dead kids all the time
Dead kids in our crime
Say, kids, where do they go?

I wanna be a dead girl like the rest
Dead girls are the best 
That's why we're on every show

You like 'em better dead
Better dead
Just say you want it like that
You like me better dead 
Better dead 
Going against your head
You like em 'dead
