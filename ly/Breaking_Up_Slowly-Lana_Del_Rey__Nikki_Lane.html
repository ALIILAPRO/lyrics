		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing

Are these my good years or do I have none?
Are there really good years for everyone?
I don't wanna live with a life of regret
I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette

'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do

George got arrested out on the lawn
We might be breaking up after this song
Will he still love me long after I'm gone?
Or did he see it coming all along?

'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely (baby, breaking up is hard to do)
Breaking up slowly (baby, breaking up is hard to do)
Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely
But it's the right thing to do
