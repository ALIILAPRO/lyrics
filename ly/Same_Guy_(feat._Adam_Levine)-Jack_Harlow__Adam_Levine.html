		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah

I can't keep lettin' shit slide
Thought that I would change, but I'm the same guy
Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time (ooh)
And when it comes to you and I, all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? (Oh, oh)

Does it add up when you do the bad stuff? Mm-mm
Time keeps movin' past us
If they gon' shoot, then I pray they end up shootin' past us
Temptations that I knew to pass up, but I didn't
When I said I loved you, know I really thought I meant it
Can I go to heaven? Is it time to put my bid in?
I'm no longer a kid, I should probably quit the kiddin'
And the playin'
I wanna do the right thing, man, that's all I'm sayin'
I can't keep blamin' entertainment
And the money and the fame that I been obtainin' (ooh)
There's a reason for these girls that I'm entertainin'

I can't keep lettin' shit slide (can't keep lettin' shit slide)
Thought that I would change, but I'm the same guy
Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time (had time)
And when it comes to you and I (ooh), all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? (Up 'til I die, oh)

These are my confessions, couldn't say it to you
So that's why I booked this session
The company I kept and I slept with
Kept me from bein' all alone with my reflection
Trust me, now I know that you a blessin'
All these white lies are growin' to life-size
I don't wanna split, but I know it's the right time
You don't wanna look, but you know there's a bright side
If you got a feelin' like mine, sing it like

I can't keep lettin' shit slide
Thought that I would change, but I'm the same guy
Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time (had time)
And when it comes to you and I (ooh), all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? (Up 'til I die)

Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh (ayy-ayy)
Ooh, up 'til I die
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ayy-ayy
Ooh, oh lord, Jetson made another one
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh lord, Jetson made another one
