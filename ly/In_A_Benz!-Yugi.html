		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might take off in a Cobra, I might take off in a Benz
I might take off in a Cobra, I might take off in a Benz
I might take off in a Cobra, I might take off in a Benz
I do not know who you are, so why you act like you my twin?
Yugi, where are you?
Plugg
Now she see me getting guap, and now she wanna make amends
I might take off in a Cobra, I might take off in a Benz
I do not know who you are, so why you act like you my twin?
I remember I ain't have no swag and she ain't want me then
Now she see me getting guap, and now she wanna make amends
I might take off in a Cobra, I might take off in a Benz
I do not know who you are, so why you act like you my twin?
I remember I ain't have no swag and she ain't want me then
Now she see me getting guap, and now she wanna make amends
We cannot be friends
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout Benjamins
Told lil bro to leave me 'lone, let me count my dividends
That boy know that he a clone, he just like to follow trends
She just wan' know what we on, she wan' kick it with the gang
I get money, and you niggas bums, we are not the same
Shawty say I'm fly just like a drone, and we know you lame
Hop up in that foreign and I'm gone, I stay in my lane
I might take off in a Cobra, I might take off in a Benz
I do not know who you are, so why you act like you my twin?
I remember I ain't have no swag and she ain't want me then
Now she see me getting guap, and now she wanna make amends
I might take off in a Cobra, I might take off in a Benz
I do not know who you are, so why you act like you my twin?
I remember I ain't have no swag and she ain't want me then
Now she see me getting guap, and now she wanna make amends
Yugi, where are you?
