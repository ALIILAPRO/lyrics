		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been alone in my thoughts
Can't fill this void between us
I cannot stand losin' you, whoa, whoa

All these feelings intertwined, oh
Fighting the urge to reach out
And my stance remains unchanged, baby
I can't help it, I'm so into you

Oh, when you're ready
We can put this behind us
Baby, we can find us again, I know
Put this behind us
We can find us again
'Cause I don't wanna go
I was alone, I was alone in this world
And I needed people
I know my funeral gon' be lit 'cause how I treated people
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna

Swervin' between emotions
I know we got real issues
Can't give in so easily, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ain't going out with no fight, no
I'm just tryna play my part, yeah
I'm not ready to let go, whoa, whoa

Oh, when you're ready
We can put this behind us
Baby, we can find us again, I know
Put this behind us
We can find us again
'Cause I don't wanna go
I was alone, I was alone in this world
And I needed people
I know my funeral gon' be lit 'cause how I treated people
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna
