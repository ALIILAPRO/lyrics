		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The summer sun has disappeared
But I'm not alone I've got you here
The world has gone blue nothing we can do 
Just static on the line
Holding on a dream nothing else it seems
Alone together tonight 

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

There's a storm ahead I can see
Clothes on the line it's blowing the sheets
And oh, the air is heavy with smoke
And oh, I feel the weight, the weight 

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lines have gone down, it's not just me
Wind from the storm brought them to their knees
The world has gone blue nothing we can do 
Just static on the line
Holding on a dream nothing else it seems
Alone together tonight 

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
