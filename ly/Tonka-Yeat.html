		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I don't know yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (GOONTEX)

Bitch, I'm on that X, I'm out in space
Eight AM, I took another one
Can't feel my face
Can't be in the stu' with no thotties, yeah
Can't be in the stu' with no Jakes
My money acrobat, I flip it twenty ways
The devil told me my time was ticking
I got like thirty days
Tell that boy I'm up, on my mama
Told me that was disgrace
Pull up matte black, windows tinted
I can race
Way I make these hit's and make this money
Keep up the pace
Swerving, dodging, oppies, coppers
Pulled up in this matte black
Chopper hеlicopter i just called Izaya
I told him we flying privatе jets
If you my twizzy, you for lifer, my twizzy
My twin

I go in, you go crazy
It's just like it's 6AM
I tried to quit them Percs with Kratom
But that ain't do me bad
Every song I got a new flow
They can't even steal that shit
Lil' boy made a hundred songs
They all sound same as shit
Bonkers, yeah, bonkers
I was in that widebody, that Tonka truck
Tonkers can't even ask them why they
Not as fresh as us pulled up in that kitted
Out lil' Bentley truck
I be so damn paranoid
I don't need nothing next to me
It's 8 AM, I'm making this hit
This shit a recipe
Yeah, I told my bitch I feel her
But I could barely feel a thing
I told my bitch I see her
But I could barely see
I'm for real a geeker, l geek like every week
I ain't caught no sleep in days
I ain't had a break
I could ship you Za' and get you
Lows or I could ship you shake
I'm high in the stu'
I ain't go to sleep so this a wake and hit
(I ain't even made it yet)
Take these Percs, they blue like Sonic
Audemars with the baguettes on it
Take these Ecstasy so I don't really have
To go and stress on it
They say, "When you go up, just remember me
" go put your bless on it
I don't play no games no more
I'm not been playing no chess on it
(GOONTEX) yeah, I can't play no, yeah

Bitch I'm on that X, I'm out in space
Eight AM, I took another one
Can't feel my face
Can't be in the stu' with no thotties, yeah
Can't be in the stu' with no Jakes
My money acrobat, I flip it twenty ways
The devil told me my time was ticking
I got like thirty days
Tell that boy I'm up, on my mama
Told me that was disgrace
Pull up matte black, windows tinted
I can race
Way I make these hit's and make this money
Keep up the pace
Swerving, dodging, oppies, coppers
Pulled up in this matte black
Chopper helicopter i just called Izaya
I told him we flying private jets
If you my twizzy, you for lifer, my twizzy
My twin

On this beat, I ain't even rapping
I just told you what I did this morning
No, they ain't gon' ignore it i'm just rich
