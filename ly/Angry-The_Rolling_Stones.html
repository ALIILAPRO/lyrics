		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two
One, two, three, go

Don't get angry with me
I never caused you no pain
I won't be angry with you
But I can't see straight (yeah)
It hasn't rained for a month, the river's run dry
We haven't made love and I wanna know why
Why you angry with me?
Why you angry?

Please just forget about me
Cancel out my name
Please never write to me
I love you just the same
I hear a melody
Ringing in my brain
Just keep the memories
Don't have to be ashamed

Don't get angry with me
I'm in a desperate state
I'm not angry with you
Don't you spit in my face
The wolf's at the door with the teeth and the claws
My mouth's getting sore, I can't take anymore
Why you angry with me?
Why you angry?

Voices keep echoing
Calling out my name
Hear the rain keep beating
On my window pane
I hear a melody
Ringing in my brain
You can keep the memories
Don't have to be ashamed

Don't get angry with me

(Angry)
(Angry)
Yeah (angry), yeah (don't be angry with me)
If we go separate ways
(Angry) yeah, don't be angry with me
Let's go out in a blaze
(Angry) yeah (don't be angry with me)
Don't you spit in my face
(Angry) oh
Don't be angry with me
Don't get, don't get
No, no (angry), yeah (don't be angry with me)
I'm still taking the pills and 
I'm off to Brazil (angry, don't be angry with me), yeah
Please (angry), don't be angry with me (don't be angry with me)
Come on
Don't (angry), no, no
(Don't be angry with me) no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
