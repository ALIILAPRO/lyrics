		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Relax
Here we go, part two, check me out

Once again, now where do I start, dear love
Dumb struck with the pure luck to find you here
Every morn' I awake from a cavernous night
Sometimes still pondering the previous plight
Seems life done changed long time no speak
Nowadays I often forget the day of the week
Taking it by stride if you know what I mean
No harm done, no offense taken by me
So let's rap, we'll catch up to par, what's the haps? Perhaps we're even closer
Now after, all things considered on this side of the planet
Couldn't pick a better time even if we planned it
To come clean and candid if I have to
Oh what I wouldn't trade for your laughter
Sweet and sour spice in my poetry pot melting
Even better than the real thing
It's like the God in me saw the devil in you
I wanted to break myself in the worst way when I met you
Who would have thought, conversate by the river, celebrate birth
Sit and delivered the lines that would prove to be the seeds of trust
Unsigned, yeah but destined to grow with sunshine
Self-assigned task piled on the desk of good works
Knowing hardship appreciate the best of both worlds

C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E evidently, see every song has a sequel
Never same, everything but the name, all fresh just like back then, how we do everyday
C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E eloquently, see every dream has a part two
Never same, you got to keep it tight, always just like back then, now hear me out

Once together, now where do we go, dear divine
I pray that you keep watching over us
From the heavens where light is the nucleus
To this space filled with darkness and negative matter
Anti-gravity pull is what I would rather, feel when I leave this shell eventually
Ties to the mother earth ground me mentally
Real vibes will keep me alive spiritually
Imagination brings bliss at no cost, when I blink blink I receive at no loss
Victory comes in small packages like a leaf of an olive tree brought back by a dove
From above, then I'm gonna rhyme love
Well you saw that one coming ever since the beginning of the end
Well anyways, I am not a perfect being, yes I am, a man full of S-I-N
It's like the devil in me saw the God in you
You epitomize the etymology of enthusiasm
Look it, up there lies the clouds that form the rain
That came from the ocean that flowed from the river
I'm a believer, firm with the first words, lyrical transceiver of our ancient roots
Science plus arts multiplied by faith then divided by the number of our ethnic race
Let me mention what I've been thinking
How to save the children, when the ship is sinking
So I'm singing, no lip syncing to slogans
Political hooligans with tanks, missiles and guns
Everything is relative when it's all in the family of man
Understand the time has finally come to realize the great power of one
All formulas equalize under the sun, amen

Yeah, the rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
All good souls lost may they rest in peace

Yeah, the rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Hip-hop world wide we got to live in peace, like that
