		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nos furiae nocturni terrores

We are the night
We haunt your mind

A thousand silent voices have been screaming in my mind this night again
I am trying to decipher the allusion so I'll finally ascend
Run around in circles no direction without any end to see
Imagine there's a world with all the answers, are they hiding within me?

Can we find the lightning that shines inside our mind?
Can we fight the dark side, we've all been trying to hide?
The many sleepless nights, the panic that rewinds
Waiting for the sunrise as paradise arrives

We own the night
You better hide

The whispers of a liar cursing me inside, my thoughts are all on fire
Have been staring in the mirror of perception leaving everything behind
Holding on to sanity before the darkness cuts me like a knife
I am suffocating in a world in which I have to die to feel alive

Can we find the lightning that shines inside our mind?
Can we fight the dark side, we've all been trying to hide?
The many sleepless nights, the panic that rewinds
Waiting for the sunrise as paradise arrives

Darkness bleeding in the night's light
Standing at my bedside
Bring upon the nightmares

Open up the secret window
Step into the unknown
Longing not to be scared

Lightning that shines inside in our mind
A dark sight we've all been trying to hide

We've all been dancing in the dark
We've all been drifting worlds apart

Nos furiae daemonia tua
(We've all been dancing in the dark)

Can we find the lightning that shines inside our mind?
Can we fight the dark side, we've all been trying to hide?
The many sleepless nights, the panic that rewinds
Waiting for the sunrise as paradise arrives

With peace of mind
Unlocking all the secrets in me
We harmonize
I carry my own skeleton key
