		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate feelin' like this
I'm so tired of tryin' to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of is waking to you

Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missin'
And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losin' you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Wakin' up to you never felt so real)
I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Wakin' up to you never felt so real)

I hate livin' without you
Dead wrong to ever doubt you
But my demons lay in waitin'
Tempting me away
Oh how I adore you
Oh how I thirst for you
Oh how I need you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'less I feel you next to me

You take the pain I feel
(Wakin' up to you never felt so real)
I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Wakin' up to you never felt so real)

Breathing life
Waking up
My eyes
Open up

Comatose
I'll never wake without an overdose of you

I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Wakin' up to you never felt so real)
I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Wakin' up to you never felt so real)

Oh how I adore you
Wakin' up to you never felt so real
Oh how I thirst for you
Wakin' up to you never felt so real
Oh how I adore you

Oh
The way you make me feel
Wakin' up to you never felt so real
