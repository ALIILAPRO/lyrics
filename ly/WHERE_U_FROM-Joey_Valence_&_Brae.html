		  Swag

Hop out, um, wanna be us
I'm a Civic, bitch, you a Prius
Turn heads in the car when they see us
Stay mad 'cause they really wanna be us
Ooh, I guess I don't care-a
I feel like Michael Cera in his swag era
What I got, won't share-a
You got a lean gut, don't compare us
I know, I know, I know, I know
How we got heart but not much to show?
I'm a hero, wait 'til I go pro
You a late bloomer, I'm a big huncho
I don't know you, you don't know me
You a lame, that's a shame, you corny
Aw, now everybody wants some
But you got no bag

Where the hell you from? (Where the hell you from?)
What you doing right here? (What you doing right here?)
Where the hell you from? (Where the hell you from?)
What you doing right here? (What you doing right here?)

Eat a booty like a tight-end, I attack that
Full metal in the bank, gotta have that
Full metal on the whisk, gotta add that
I'm a street plant, you a lab rat
Who you think you are, lil' bruh?
Rollin' 'round in your new car, lil' bruh
You ain't really gettin' that far, lil' bruh
You ain't really lookin' that hard, lil' bruh
I can tell you think you're the shit
Motel money, but you stay at The Ritz
You want glamor, you want glitz
Zero drip with your wack-ass fits
Pretty boy, I got the swag
You is in your trash bag
You still using hashtags
Who the hell is you?

Where the hell you from? (Where the hell you from?)
What you doing right here? (What you doing right here?)
Where the hell you from? (Where the hell you from?)
What you doing right here? (What you doing right here?)
Where the hell you from? (Where the hell you from?)
What you doing right here? (What you doing right here?)
Where the hell you from? (Where the hell you from?)
What you doing right here? (What you doing right here?)
Where the hell you from?

So do not talk to me, girl
Play it cool, you wanna be
You do it just for show
But you ain't got your own
So do not talk to me, girl
Play it cool, you wanna be
You do it just for show (one, two, three, go)
But you ain't got your own 

Swag
Where the hell you from?
What you doing right here?
Where the hell you from?
What you doing right here?
