		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's almost two and all I see is you right now, how
Blue light shining through the room
It's just you and the moon right now, and I
Just wait til you come my way
See I know you try
Keep it all inside so
Dance with me til it all feels right
Like it how it's supposed to be, so spin around for me
And let it all burn down while we dance through the night
What I'm trying to say is
Come close to me
Put both your hands on my shoulder
And if it all fades away in the morning
N'you you save one memory
Could you save this dance for me
Spin around like a ballerina
Away in my arms, you a masterpiece
Here you go, take the last of me
Could you save this dance for me
Spin around like a ballerina
Awake in your arms, a fantasy
Here you go, take the last of me
So used to showing no emotion
Used to going through the motions and I
Try to hide my pain, never opened up
But you make it all okay
Cause some days I'm just tryin' to stay alive
So dance with me til' it all feels right
Like how it's supposed to be, so spin around for me
And let it all burn down while we dance through the night, all I'm saying is
Come close to me
And put both your hands on my shoulder
And if it all fades away when we're older
N'you save one memory
Could you save this dance for me
Spin around like a ballerina
Away in my arms, you a masterpiece
Here you go, take the last of me
Could you save this dance for me
Spin around like a ballerina
Awake in your arms, a fantasy
Here you go, take the last of me
Spin around, spin around n'round
Oh you a masterpiece, take the last of me
Save this dance for me, save this dance for me
