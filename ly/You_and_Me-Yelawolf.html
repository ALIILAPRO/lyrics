		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black boots, red cup
Brown liquor, no suds
Some bad motherfuckers just rolled up
Yeah
Firecracker, short fuse
I pull the plug out on you like a corkscrew
No limit, no curfew
Yeah

To get everything I wanted in this lifetime
I had to put my beliefs on the front line
And every song that I sing
It's always been you and me
Tell my baby it will be another late night
I left work eight hours after midnight
No breaks, no sleep
And it's always been you and me

You know it's always been you and me
No money, no short change
Still hating, poor thing
Middle fingers up, tell you one more thing
Yeah
Can't hear me, let me dumb it down
I'm slum by nature from a small town
We tote guns by nature no showin' out
Yeah

To get everything I wanted in this lifetime
I had to put my beliefs on the front line
And every song that I sing
It's always been you and me
Tell my baby it will be another late night
I left work eight hours after midnight
No breaks, no sleep
And it's always been you and me

Like a raven over the grave, I get lost over the page
I'm in tune with my spirit, doing shrooms, trip for days
18 with the bat, in the project with the raps
White boy with the blacks, from the sticks, I crossed the tracks
Rock and roll, rolling stone, daddy left his pistol home
Load it up, shooting bottles off the porch to his songs
I was troubled, I was hurt and it bubbled to the surface
Took it out on writing songs, put that seed up under the dirt
God gave me water (bless) two sons and one daughter (bless)
I prayed and prayed harder, now I work hard and play harder
I visualize, put thumbtacks over outlines
When they said I was out of my mind I put more goals in the pipeline, this is my time

To get everything I wanted in this lifetime
I had to put my beliefs on the front line
And every song that I sing
It's always been you and me
Tell my baby it will be another late night
I left work eight hours after midnight
No breaks, no sleep
And it's always been you and me

You know it's always been you and me
You know it's always been you and me
