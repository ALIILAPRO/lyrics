		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been known to miss a red flag
I been known to put my lover on a pedestal
In the end, those things just don't last
And it's time I take my rose-coloured glasses off

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (mm)
Tryna make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (mm)
I already know your type, think you're playin' your cards right (mm)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion

Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance all night (I be like, ooh)
Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance, dance

Was a time when that shit might've worked
Was a time when I just threw a match and let it burn
Now I'm grown, I know what I deserve
I still like dancin' with the lessons I already learned

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (mm)
Tryna make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (mm)
I already know your type, think you're playin' your cards right (mm)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion

Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance all night (I be like, ooh)
Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance, dance

Illusion
I really like the way you're movin'
Yeah, I just wanna dance with the illusion
Yeah, I just wanna dance with
Yeah, I just wanna dance with
I could dance all night (woo)
(Dance all night)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illu- (illusion)
Ooh-ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin' (illusion, illusion, illusion, illusion)
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion
