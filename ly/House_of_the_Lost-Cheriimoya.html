		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  in the house of the lost 
we‘re all looking for a way out 
so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad


I don’t wanna be restrained 
we‘re all looking for the same 
I know, I know, I know 
and if you see me in a different light 
I will show you what it’s like 
I will show you the other side 
so don’t be afraid to fall 
It’s time to take a walk 
beyond these walls and try to find 
the place where I am called 
they say one day you‘ll know where you belong 

 

In the house of the lost 
we‘re all looking for a way out 
so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad
I don’t wanna be restrained 
we‘re all looking for the same 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

 
I know, and I still feel the same 
If I could just change, I would make a change and change 
I feel it in my veins and I still feel the silence in waves and I can’t wait for the day 
I feel the power coming around again
I get a feeling that I know I can’t resist 

 
going into the darkness 
to explore the inside of it 
to be in the middle of it 
try to get it fixed yeah 
try to get it fixed yeah yeah 
to be in the middle of it 
try to get it fixed yeah 
try to get it fixed yeah yeah 


In the house of the lost 
we‘re all looking for a way out 
so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad
I don’t wanna be restrained 
we‘re all looking for the same 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
