		<p>
		  Oh-oh
Yeah-yeah
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro

Where my twin at? In a courtroom
With his head up, ain't no tissue
Any issue, slang a pistol
At the opposites, smash off in a wide-body kit

Stacked a hundred bucks and it's obvious
Two mil' a show, I can geek a audience
Where the wind at, nigga?
Where the lean at, nigga?
Where the fin at, nigga?
Where my twin at?
In a courtroom, I'm on mushrooms
Renew the contract, that's a process, yeah
We ain't stoppin', we ain't boxed in
Forever locked in (with me, yeah)
Take the Glock, go squeeze, don't you ask me
Gettin' mopped in a foreign while I'm backed in
Few thousand gon' turn up the assassins
Don't you ask me, yeah
I love Mexico, I'ma always keep a decoy
Take this rappin' shit global, still a D-boy, huh
Smell the odor comin' off, it gettin' re-rocked
Niggas tied to the mafia like Reeboks, uh
Bring the lean out, uh, bring the speed out, uh
Bring the keys out, uh, bringin' Bs out, uh, bringin' Cs out, uh
We just tee up, uh, we don't tee out
I can't let a bitch get close to my stash house
I done seen what niggas do to a slime boss
I get to trippin' in Jimmy Choo, I feel fine now
I get to shoot a clip, let a nigga find out
Them people hidin' out, I could feel the vibe out
They swear they know the truth, but still, niggas ride out
I see my hitters on my live, gotta log out
I could've damaged this shit, I couldn't talk about
I'm tryna manage this shit, smoke a whole pound
Had this lil' sandman bitch sign for the penthouse
I done felt abandoned, now I know how to win now
I'ma be her friend now, no matter how it end now

Where my twin at? In a courtroom
With his head up, ain't no tissue
Any issue, slang a pistol
At the opposites, smash off in a wide-body kit
