		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm stuck in all that I'm used to
And I shouldn't stay but I choose to
I fail my heart every time I give in
I, I'm a slave to the memories
And I play it safe so I never leave
Oh, it's day after day, I just dance with the pain

They say I'm more than the scars on my back
But all of my demons keep holding me back
Right into that open door
Somewhere that I've been before

Can't seem to get no rest
Trying to escape myself
I guess I must confess
I'm comfortable in this mess
Better the ache I know
I'm scared of the fate I don't
Just like a hand to hold
At least I'm not alone

Pride lays the rules that I choose to abide
Latching on tempting me to the high
Though it's flawed by design I give in

War in my veins, can't get away, self-medicate
Oh, Lord
Thoughts in my brain are never sane
I'm never in control
Right into that open door (open door)
Somewhere that I been before

Can't seem to get no peace of mind
All these feelings never fade
And the pain won't go away
And it haunts me that nobody's gonna save me

They say I'm more than the scars on my back
But all of my demons keep holding me back
Right into that open door
Somewhere that I've been before

Can't seem to get no rest
Trying to escape myself
I guess I must confess
I'm comfortable in this mess
Better the ache I know
I'm scared of the fate I don't
Just like a hand to hold
At least I'm not alone
