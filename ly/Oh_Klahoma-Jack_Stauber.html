		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Set the phases to rot
What has got you distraught?
It's negative attention at best
But call it nothing

Maybe it's something, a little bit, a little bit
Maybe it's something, do a little bit

It's all about ascension, I guess
Don't put me to rest

Go on and hand me your clothes (oh, here you go)
Take a picture or two (two or three?)
I can see you (oh)

Tears falling down at the party
Saddest little baby in the room
Fears, tell me fears, don't get me started
I get a little grey hair for every scare you share

Those aren't meant to bend
No, those aren't meant to bend
Those aren't meant to bend
No, those aren't meant to bend

I hear your eyes and I see those cries
I hear those eyes and I see those cries
I can't be the only one who hears you

Tears falling down at the party
Saddest little baby in the room
Fears, tell me fears, don't get me started
I get a little gray hair for every scare you share

Those aren't meant to bend
No, those aren't meant to bend
Those aren't mean to bend
No, those aren't meant to bend

Tears falling down at the party
Saddest little baby in my eye
Fears, tell me fears, don't get me started
I might die
