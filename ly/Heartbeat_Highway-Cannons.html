		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I caught a smile that you meant to hide
When you were sitting in my passenger seat on the 405
And your cigarette smoke rose like a serpent of light
One of those moments where everything is alright

But sooner, later, danger, danger
Need to give you this disclaimer
Know it may not be forever
Sooner, later, danger, danger
Write me up for bad behavior
And I, and I, and I

And I'm here tonight to ride this through
And just for tonight, I'm here with you
'Cause I'm goin' through emotions in motion with you
And I'm here tonight, riding down this road with you
Down this road with you

Another day, lost inside the maze
Maybe I'm not my best, but I'm trying my best
That should be okay

But sooner, later, danger, danger
Need to give you this disclaimer
Know it may not be forever
Sooner, later, danger, danger
Write me up for bad behavior
And I, and I, and I

And I'm here tonight to ride this through
And just for tonight, I'm here with you
'Cause I'm goin' through emotions in motion with you
And I'm here tonight, riding down this road with you
Down this road with you

Down this road with you
Down this road with you
Down this road with you
Down this road with you
