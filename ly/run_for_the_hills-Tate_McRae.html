		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hotels, late nights, hands through my hair
Long talks, red eyes, clothes everywhere
Missing a moment when you're still there
You gotta thing you can't find nowhere

(Yeah, yeah)
Kissing, screaming, straight back to war
I'm walking out until I lock the door
Maybe the danger's covered by the thrill
'Cause I know I should be running for the hills

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart, yeah, it cuts me
'Cause I know deep down that it's
Never gon' ever be us, oh-oh-oh
Never gon' ever be more than just something that's fucking me up
Don't tease me and keep me around like it's easy
When you know deep down that it's
Never gon' ever be us, oh-oh-oh
Never gon' ever be more than just something that's fucking me up

I know that when it's all done, I'll hate you bad in the long run
But somehow it never ends, my heels on the edge of your bed again (yeah, yeah)
I get obsessive with you, all that I want is attention from you
Break into my life and break all my rules, it's true

The way you touch me
Straight to the heart, yeah, it cuts me
'Cause I know deep down that it's
Never gon' ever be us, oh-oh-oh
Never gon' ever be more than just something that's fucking me up
Don't tease me and keep me around like it's easy
When you know deep down that it's
Never gon' ever be us, oh-oh-oh
Never gon' ever be more than just something that's fucking me up

Should run for the hills
Should run for the hills
Should be running for the hills, the way you touch me
Should run for the hills
Should run for the hills
Should be running for the hills, the way you touch me
Should run for
Run for the hills, should be running for the hills, the way you touch me
Should run for
Run for the hills, should be running for the hills, the way you touch me
Huh, huh
