		  "This bitch gon' make me"

You got me all up in my feels
In all kind of ways, I be tryna wait
But lately, I just wanna keep it real (real)
No more playin' safe
Let's take it all the way
I'm just sayin'

I just wanna make time for you (yeah)
Swear it's just right for you 
Like this pussy designed for you (yeah)
Ten out of five on you
Know I would sign on that line for you (yeah)
Bet I look nice on you (yeah)
Open my mind for you (yeah)

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (yeah, yeah)
What you waiting for? (What you waiting for?)
What you waiting for?

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (yeah, yeah)
What you waiting for? (Waiting for?)
What you waiting for? (Waiting for?)

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get (nasty)

Tonight, I wanna get (nasty)

Promise I'ma give it to you like you never had it
I do it so good, it's gon' be hard to break the habit
You're like a whole constellation (yeah)
Swimming like you on vacation (yeah)
Promise I'm still gonna love you when you wake up in the AM

I just wanna make time for you 
Swear it's just right for you 
Like this pussy designed for you
Ten out of five on you
Know I would sign on that line for you 
Bet I look nice on you (yeah)
Open my mind for you (my mind)

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (oh hey)
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty
What you waiting for? (What you waiting for?)
What you waiting for? (Waiting for?)

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (nasty, nasty, mmm, ah)

Tonight, I wanna get (nasty, oh whoa, boy, yeah)

Boy, you know the vibes
I don't waste no time
Take what's on your mind
Make it real life
Get all the homies to bounce
Switch from the bed to the couch
And get to know how I'm feeling inside

So much conversation
Words so sweet
Been so well behaved but boy, I'm weak
Yeah, my body's gotta say something to you
That's one way to tell I speak the truth

Don't wanna wait on it 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (baby)
What you waiting for? (What you waiting for?)
What you waiting for? 

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty
What you waiting for? (What you waiting for?)
What you waiting for? (What you waiting for?)

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (nasty, tonight, I wanna get, mmm)
Tonight, baby (tonight, I)
Tonight, I wanna get (nasty, oh)

Yeah
