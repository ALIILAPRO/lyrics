		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tie yourself to me
No one else, no
You're not rid of me, mmm
You're not rid of me

Night and day I breathe
Hah-hah, ay, hey

You're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me

I beg you, my darling
Don't leave me, I'm hurting
(Lick my legs, I'm on fire)
(Lick my legs, of desire)

I'll tie your legs
Keep you against my chest
Oh, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll make you lick my injuries
I'm gonna twist your head off, see

'Til you say don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her

I beg you, my darling
Don't leave me, I'm hurting
I've been lonely
Above everything
Above every day
I'm hurting

(Lick my legs I'm on fire)
(Lick my legs of desire)
(Lick my legs I'm on fire)
(Lick my legs of desire)

Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll make you lick my injuries
I'm gonna twist your head off, see

'Til you say don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
(Lick my legs, I'm on fire)
(Lick my legs, of desire)
(Lick my legs, I'm on fire)
(Lick my legs, of desire)
