		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spinning globe.
Repeating lie.
God gave me
an apple of dischord.
Desire gives birth to war.
And death and rain cover all.
The second hand cruelly turning.
The footprints of the tanks.
The shell of a child.
The view is beautiful from here
inside this sea of blood.
I see a man talking
the life of this fellow man.
The conflict is
for what purpose?
Repeated history.
Stop already.
Someday, the light
which resembled hope
will cover the world.
The silence spreads
and the human race disappears.
Even the second hand stops.
Already, it doesn't rain.
Have you seen a woman
who's crying
and hungging and going mad
with the shell of her child?
Someday, the light
which resembled hope
will cover the world.
The silence spreads
and the human race disappears.
Even the second hand stops.
Already,
lai lai lai lai lai lai lai...
lai lai lai lai lai lai lai...
lai lai lai lai lai lai lai...
oh and hungging and going mad
Have you seen the smile of a man
whose legs were torn from him?
What is liberty?
What is love?
I can do nothing, nothing to do
but only sing the song of peace.
of peace.
