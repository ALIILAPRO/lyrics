		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The night is yours, the night is mine
I beg you baby, take your time
It's like paradise
See your magic eyes
Feel the need in me
The night is yours, the night is mine
I beg your baby, take your time
Heaven in your eyes
Takes me to the sky
I'm in love with you

Love takes time, it's hard to find
That's true
Not a game you play - a night or two
Take my heart
Let's make it real tonight
We'll be dancin' to the pale moonlight
Your dreams are real today
And now you gonna stay

I will try to make your dreams come true
Trust me baby, nothing else will do
There's no need for you to be so cool
Love takes time just like the golden rule
Your dreams are real today
And now there gonna stay

Girl, when I see you smile
Imaginations running wild
Love makes me feel alright
Help me through the night
Sometimes you're weak
Sometimes you're wild
You're a woman
You're a child
Love makes me feel alright, tonight
