		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, glory, Halle
What's all that noise?
Hallelujah
Don't give up with that now

Glory, Halle
Who's that over in the corner?
Hallelujah
I believe that's Mr. Teagarden

Hey what you doin' up there, man?
Last time I saw you
You were sayin' fare thee well to Harlem
I done bin wise g'wine
An' I ain't g'wine there n'more

You sho' come back the right time
It's Christmas up here
What d'ya mean up here?
It's Christmas ev'rywhere

Yeah, but it ain't all Christmas
Like it's Christmas in Harlem
No

Ev'ry gal struttin' with her beau
Through the streets covered white with snow
Happy smiles er'ywhere you go
Christmas night in Harlem

Black and tans feelin' mighty good
In that old colored neighborhood
Here and now be it understood
Christmas night in Harlem

Ev'ryone is gonna sit up
Until after three
Ev'ryone will be all lit up
Like a Christmas tree

Come on now ev'ry coal black Joe
You just lead me t'the mistletoe
With a kiss and a hi de ho
Christmas night in Harlem

Hee, man, dog
What'd Santa Claus leave in your stockin'?
Let me see, there's an orange, a jar ?
And, man, look at this slide trombone
Yeah, but it might not sound so pretty
Let me hear you tune it

Mr. Mercer, I'm glad to be back in this festivity
Ah, you said it Mr. T
It's Christmas night in Harlem
Well it's Christmas night in Harlem
Man, you drew the ?
