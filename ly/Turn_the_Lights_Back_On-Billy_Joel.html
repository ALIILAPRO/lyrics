		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please open the door
Nothing is different, we've been here before
Pacing these halls
Trying to talk over the silence
And pride sticks out its tongue
Laughs at the portrait that we've become
Stuck in a frame, unable to change
I was wrong

I'm late, but I'm here right now
Though I used to be romantic
I forgot somehow
Time can make you blind
But I see you now
As we're laying in the darkness
Did I wait too long
To turn the lights back on?

Here, stuck on a hill
Outsiders inside the home that we built
The cold settles in
It's been a long winter of indifference
And maybe you love me, maybe you don't
Maybe you'll learn to, and maybe you won't
You've had enough, but I won't give up
On you

I'm late, but I'm here right now
And I'm tryin' to find the magic
That we lost somehow
Maybe I was blind
But I see you now
As we're laying in the darkness
Did I wait too long
To turn the lights back on?

I'm late, but I'm here right now
Is there still time for forgiveness?
Won't you tell me how?
I can't read your mind
But I see you now
As we're layin' in the darkness
Did I wait too long
To turn the lights back on?

I'm here right now
Yes, I'm here right now
Looking for forgiveness
I can see as we're laying in the darkness
Yeah, as we're laying in the darkness
Did I wait too long
To turn the lights back on?
