		  ('Til the world ends, remix)

Ai, chimpanzees is hating but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career but somebody lied
I ain't talking poultry when I say, "This chicken's fried"
Anyway Britney, why they so jealous that you teamed up with me?
Tell 'em "they my son," yup, gyal dem a mi pickney
Anyway, brembedell, what's that? I don't know, Femme Fatale
Sniff sniff cries, I done slayed your whole entire fucking life
Oh, oh, you got some Epsom Salt?
I done balled all day, you ain't touched the court
What, you tired? You need a break?
You was hot when? Ricki Lake

I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good shit, this is the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

It's Britney, bitch
I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Kesha

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
C'mon get me, get me on the floor
Dj what you, what you waitin' for?

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

Watch me move when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch, dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearin', I'm noticin' you starin'
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
C'mon get me, get me on the floor
Dj what you, what you waitin' for?

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

See the sunlight, we ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends

Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

See the sunlight, we ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
