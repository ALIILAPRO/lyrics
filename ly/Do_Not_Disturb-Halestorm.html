		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think we should make out
In a few hours I'm getting on a plane
There's a pretty safe bet you'll never see me again, yeah

I love your accent
I wonder what it'll sound like when you cum
Let's see if Blondes or Brunettes are more fun

I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"

And if I were you I'll bring your girlfriend too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturb

Let's take our clothes off
I wanna show you my hidden tattoo
That nobody ever gets to see but you do

Oh baby let me taste ya, shake ya, tie you up and break ya
'Cause I've been alone, left on my own for too long
Oh damn, too long, too long, too long, I say come on

I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"

And if I were you I'll bring your girlfriend too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb", "Do not disturb"

It's now or never
Put a sign on the door
Turn all the lights off
I left sign on the door
I take all your clothes off
There's a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"
"Do not disturb"

I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"

And if I were you I'll bring your girlfriend too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb", "Do not disturb"
