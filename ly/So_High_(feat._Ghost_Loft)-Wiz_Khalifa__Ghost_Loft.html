		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First thing uh huh, wake up out a dream, uh huh
Grab a lighter uh huh, something I can steam, uh huh
Bong rip uh huh, make sure it's clean, uh huh
Smoke sesh uh huh, nigga what you mean, uh huh
In my car uh huh, cruising down the street, uh huh
So stoned I'ma need something to eat, uh huh
No tray uh huh, ashes on my seat, uh huh
High it up uh huh, Taylors on my feet, uh huh
Cloud 9 uh huh, going through my mind, uh huh
Take a toke uh huh, hold it 'til you choke, huh uh
Moving forward uh huh, cruising on my board, uh huh
Still got more uh huh, burn it to a short, uh huh

(And I be floating) I get so high, fuck around and never come down
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be floating) I get so high, fuck around and never come down
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be higher than a motherfucker)

High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling

Tell that nigga use a grinder for that weed, uh huh
And tell him "roll another joint don't fall asleep," uh huh
Smoke peace uh huh, pipe like a chief, uh huh
Heard you got a cheaper price for that reefer, huh
What you need? Uh huh, never find a seed, uh huh
Take a dab uh huh, straight THC, uh huh
For the highest in the room look at me, uh huh
Somewhere in the clouds that's where we wanna be, uh huh
Got you shook uh uh, not just for the look, uh huh
Half the day uh huh, rolled the whole book, uh huh
Drive slow uh huh, blowin' by the O, uh huh
Eyes low uh huh, everybody know it damn

(And I be floating) I get so high, fuck around and never come down
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be floating) I get so high, fuck around and never come down
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be higher than a motherfucker)

High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling

Going up uh huh, never gave a fuck, uh huh
Pulling out the '62 and showing up, uh huh
Twenty-six, guess that mean I'm growing up, uh huh
Pouring up uh huh, all my niggas rolling up
Making sure that

I get so high, fuck around and never come down
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be floating) I get so high, fuck around and never come down
I get so high, I get so high (and I be floating)

High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
