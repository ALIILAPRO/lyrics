		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, everyone seems a damn genius lately
TikTok talkin', late night TV
There's still so much I have yet to know
We get dressed up just to go downtown
In some ego filled late night crowd
It seems to be where I feel most alone

I'd like to get lost on some old back road
Find a shade tree and a honey hole
And talk to my grandpa again
And I see God in everything, the trees and pain and nights in the spring
So why do I still long for a home?

I'd like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
And feel the fear of never wakin'
To know the true warmth of the sun
I'd like to love my lady long and hard
And lay down lines of laymen guitar
Never leave her loving arms again

My exes hate me and my friends all miss me
I wanna drown in rot gut whiskey
Leave this small town for awhile
Head to Paris on a late night flight
Find a bar and get in a fight
Write a few poems on a sunny balcony

I wanna be a child climbing trees somewhere
Breathing in the fresh, outside air
And before I knew this life was unkind
I want a well trained dog on a couple of acres
A kind, kind lady and a place to take her
A few good friends I can count on one of my hands

I know I'm bound to die one day, so when I reach those golden gates
I pray to say I did the best I can
Sit with my mother and the dearly departed
Send a prayer down to the broken hearted
Let 'em know it all turns out just fine

To know me is to love me and to hate me is to wrong me
I prefer my nights so lonely
Love blues guitar, muscle cars and gin
I'm a simple man, I don't need much
Just my simple songs and some human touch
I'm tired now so I'm bringing my ass home

So let me go down the line
Let me feel it all, joy, pain and the sky
So let me go down the line
We all burn, burn, burn
And die
So let me go down the line
I wanna feel it all, joy, pain and the sky
So let me go down the line
We all burn, burn, burn
And then die
So let me go down the line
I wanna feel it all, joy, pain and the sky
So let me go down the line
We all burn, burn, burn
And then die
