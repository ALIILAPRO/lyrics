		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah
Yeah
I wanna see you work, work, work, and work
I wanna see you work 
All the bad bitches work, ayy (Murda on the beat so it's not nice)

He like when I ride that, ride that, ride that, uh
Pick it up, throw it back, drop that shit (drop that shit)
Never go back and forth with a nigga (nope)
I'm too pretty, gotta stop that shit, I'm lit
Off Casamigos
My pretty white toes (ah)
My natural afro
My neck and wrist froze, yeah
Work, work, work
Just look at my ass when I twerk, twerk, twerk
That nigga mad, that's that hurt, hurt, hurt
A bitch like me, yeah, I know my worth
Fuckin' with me is a gift and a curse (ah)

Ayy, I paid my own rent
Ain't no nigga sleepin' over puttin' me in my place (in my place)
Nigga, be grateful, you should be thankful 
You even get to breathe in a real bitch space
I got that Hellcat, skrrt off on a nigga 
Soon as I get off of his face (skrrt-skrrt)
Nigga, don't put one hand on this frontal 
'Less you can afford to replace this lace
Dropped a bag on my purse, purse, purse
That El Chapo, this that work, work, work
Fix your face, bitch, you hurt, hurt, hurt
All that talkin' ain't makin' me nervous
Feelin' yourself, put down them Percies, ah

Yeah (real motherfuckin' hot girl shit)
Ayy (yeah)

I wanna see you work, work, work, and work
I wanna see you work, all the bad bitches work, ah

He like when I ride that, ride that, ride that, uh (ride that, uh)
Pick it up, throw it back, drop that shit (drop that shit)
Never go back and forth with a nigga (nope)
I'm too pretty, gotta stop that shit, I'm lit
Off Casamigos
My pretty white toes (toes)
My natural afro (yeah)
My neck and wrist froze, yeah
Work, work, work
Just look at my ass when I twerk, twerk, twerk
That nigga mad, that's that hurt, hurt, hurt
A bitch like me, yeah, I know my worth
Fuckin' with me is a gift and a curse

Ayy, shout out to my pussy, this lil' bitch the G.O.A.T.
And a honorable mention to my throat (to my throat)
All dicks, please rise, let's praise the ass
And all my real freak hoes, let's fuck some more (ah)
My motherfuckin' body, my choice (my choice)
Ain't no lil' dick takin' my voice
Crazy how y'all be the first ones tuned in listenin'
But claim I ain't makin' no noise
I was goin' through the knife, still ain't cut like me
Cowgirl hat, still can't buck like me
I done switched my shit, like, four, five times (four, five times)
None of these hoes get nails done like me
Call him when it's something I don't wanna pay for (pay for)
He gets to spendin' on me 'cause he know I'm player
But I'ma ride that dick so motherfuckin' good
Have him come to the spirits like a seance

He like when I ride that, ride that, ride that, uh (ride that, uh)
Pick it up, throw it back, drop that shit (drop that shit)
Never go back and forth with a nigga (nope)
Way too pretty, gotta stop that shit, I'm lit
Off Casamigos
My pretty white toes (toes)
My natural afro (yeah)
My neck and wrist froze, yeah
Work (yeah), work, work
Just look at my ass when I twerk, twerk, twerk
That nigga mad, that's that hurt, hurt, hurt
A bitch like me, yeah, I know my worth
Fuckin' with me is a gift and a curse, ah
