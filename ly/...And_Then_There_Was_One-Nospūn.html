		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Isolation
Now my burden
I can't quite remember
How I got here
When you find yourself alone
But you realize it's been that way all along
Just remember where you draw your strength from
When you're trapped inside this house
But you're the one who's keeping you from getting out
Only reaching the end can save you now
One PM and I just woke up again
From a delusion I composed, yeah
Blink my eyes, but hearing only silence
I'm reminded grimly that I'm on my own now
I blinked my eyes and the world was shattered
Is it my destiny to still remain
When you find yourself alone
But you realize it's been that way all along
Just remember where you draw your strength from
When you're trapped inside this house
But you're the one who's keeping you from getting out
Only reaching the end can save you now
Now I'm trapped inside this house
And I'm the one who's keeping me from getting out
Only reaching the end can save me now
