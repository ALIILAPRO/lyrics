		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looks like there's rain up ahead
Like there's a crack in the heavens
Feels like my day could be turning
Like I can tell that my luck's gonna change
If you could see me now
I'd probably let you down
But that's enough for me
You got me begging, baby

Looks like I'm on my knees again
Feels like the walls are closing in, in
Looks like I'm on my knees again-in-in

Looks like the tables have turned
Like there's a change in the weather
Feels like my time is returning
Like I'm about to get out of this cage
If you could see me now
I'd probably let you down
But that's enough for me
You got me begging, baby

Looks like I'm on my knees again
Feels like the walls are closing in, in
Looks like I'm on my knees again-in-in

Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees

Looks like I'm on my knees again
Feels like the walls are closing in, in
Looks like I'm on my knees again-in-in

Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees again
Looks like I'm on my knees
