		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I am, not sure you should take a chance
I like playing dumb, letting you figure me out
But I was faded in my own defense
So drop a bomb on all the things we dreamed about

Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm

Trumpets bring the angels, but they never came
And no one let them in 'cause they didn't know my name
I know I keep my feelings so tucked away
Just another day spent hoping we don't fall apart
So drop a bomb on all the things we dreamed about

Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm

So let's twist the knife again
Twist the knife again like we did last summer
Let's twist the knife again, twist the knife again
I'm just trying to keep it together
But it gets a little harder when it never gets better
I'm trying to keep it together
To keep it together
Keep it together, no

Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
