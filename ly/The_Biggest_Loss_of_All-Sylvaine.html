		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The biggest loss of all
Is what dies inside of you
While you live
During a lifetime
Pieces of you
Fall to dust

No changes are to be made
The damage is already inflicted

Dreams slowly fading away
With time they wither, decay
Like the autumn leaves
At the doorstep of winter

Other obstacles seem so trivial
Faced with the light within
Perishing
As the decades pass
You realize what
You've lost

These chains will not break
Your self so very restricted

The biggest loss of all
Is what dies inside of you
While you live
The childish sparkle
Succumbs with age
Such a shame

Dreams slowly fading away
With time they wither, decay
Like the autumn leaves
At the doorstep of winter

There is no way to be saved
Your soul was already convicted
