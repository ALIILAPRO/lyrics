		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go
And then you'll know
For me to stay here I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reaching me by phone
Because I promise I'll be gone for a while

When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person that you really are now
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman takin' up my time
Oh, how could you ever allow
I guess I wonder how
How could you get out of pocket for fun
How, how
When you know that you never number two
Number one gonna be number one

Oh, I'll be good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
Get the message over to you now
