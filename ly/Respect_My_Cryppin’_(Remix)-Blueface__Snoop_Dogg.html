(Yeah aight, uh)
(Stop playin' with me)
(Don't respect you trippin')

Give a fuck if he like it, but he gon' respect this crippin' (scoop)
Yeah a'ight, it's all fun and games 'til a nigga trippin' (I'm finna trip him)
Mop the floor, hide the wet sign just to catch him slippin' (caught him slippin')
Pull up, bounce out with a briefcase, it's time to handle business (it's time to handle business)

Give a fuck if he like it, but he gon' respect this crippin' (scoop)
Yeah aight, it's all fun and games 'til a nigga trippin' (I'm finna trip him)
Mop the floor, hide the wet sign just to catch him slippin' (caught him slippin')
Pull up, bounce out with a briefcase, it's time to handle business (it's time to handle business)

Janky, baby, I just look like this, fuck a nigga mean? (Janky)
Play with my respect, leave him wetter than a dream (wetter than a dream)
I'll die for this shit baby, I'm a different breed (yeah aight)
I never let the beef get cold, nigga, where's the meat? (Where's the meat?)
I'm an alpha male, ain't no bitch in me (all alpha)
Grown ass man, feed my family (feed my family)
Any nigga get in my way, I'ma feed him a Pedigree
I hold my own, baby, never need a nigga stand next to me (nope, never)
Everybody a hot nigga 'til 12 pull up, get cold feet (cold feet)
Stay by myself, ain't gotta worry 'bout a nigga tellin' (nope)
Stay by myself, ain't gotta worry 'bout a nigga jealous (nope)
I don't even like workin' with niggas, baby
'Cause I'm hella selfish (Blueface, baby)

Big chains, pieces on pieces (pieces)
That boy got on a necklace, yeah aight
Nigga talkin' out his neck 'til I leave his ass neckless (neckless)
It get tricky, fuck it, nigga finna get reckless, on the gang

Give a fuck if he like it, but he gon' respect this crippin' (scoop)
Yeah a'ight, it's all fun and games 'til a nigga trippin' (I'm finna trip him)
Mop the floor, hide the wet sign just to catch him slippin' (caught him slippin')
Pull up, bounce out with a briefcase, it's time to handle business (it's time to handle business)

Give a fuck if he like it, but he gon' respect this crippin' (scoop)
Yeah aight, it's all fun and games 'til a nigga trippin' (I'm finna trip him)
Mop the floor, hide the wet sign just to catch him slippin' (caught him slippin')
Pull up, bounce out with a briefcase, it's time to handle business (it's time to handle business)

I shoulda known that this ol' buster-ass nigga (sup nigga?)
wasn't really with the Crip shit
Full court press make a nigga flip
Got his main bitch suckin' on this big stick
Gotta see a little different just to see a Crip
East side nigga with the hammer if a nigga wanna set trip
Fuckin' with the Dogg'll be your death wish (death wish)
I'm knockin' off everythin' above your necklace
I take off quick and take your face off
Eighteen holes but I don't play golf
Respect my crippin', I'm a straight boss
And I do it for life with no days off
Tyin' niggas up like a shoelace
Shootin' like 2K, me and my nigga Blueface
On the block, makin' the block hot
Big bag, back pocket, heater with the Crip flag, nigga, get back

Give a fuck if he like it, but he gon' respect this crippin' (scoop)
Yeah a'ight, it's all fun and games 'til a nigga trippin' (I'm finna trip him)
Mop the floor, hide the wet sign just to catch him slippin' (caught him slippin')
Pull up, bounce out with a briefcase, it's time to handle business (it's time to handle business)

Give a fuck if he like it, but he gon' respect this crippin' (scoop)
Yeah aight, it's all fun and games 'til a nigga trippin' (I'm finna trip him)
Mop the floor, hide the wet sign just to catch him slippin' (caught him slippin')
Pull up, bounce out with a briefcase, it's time to handle business (it's time to handle business)
