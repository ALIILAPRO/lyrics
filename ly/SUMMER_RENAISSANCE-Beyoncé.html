		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna house you and make you take my name
I'm gonna spouse you and make you tat' your ring
I'm gonna take you all the way
Baby, can I take you all the way?

You sexy motherfucker
Boy, you growin' on me
I just wanna thug you
The category is bae
You gangsta motherfucker
Boy, you growin' on me
I just wanna touch ya
I can feel it through those jeans

Ah, ah, ah (ooh-ooh)
Boy, you never had a chance
If you make my body talk
I'ma leave you in a trance
Got you walkin' with a limp
Bet this body make you dance, dance, dance, dance

It's so good, it's so good 
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good
Ooh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good
(Ooh, it's so good, it's so good)
(It's so good, it's so good, it's so good)

I wanna crush you, I won't over analyze
I'm gonna trust you, even though we met tonight
But I'm gonna take you all the way
Baby, can I take you all the way?

You sexy motherfucker
Boy, you growin' on me
I just wanna thug you
The category is bae (you growin' on me)
You gangsta motherfucker
Boy, you growin' on me (you-you-you growin' on me)
Black silicone and rubbers
I can feel it through those jeans (growin' on me)

I'm feelin' way too loose to be tied down
Can you see my brain open wide now?
Come and get what I came for, hella night now
Know you love when I role play, who am I now?
I'ma doc, I'ma nurse, I'ma teacher
Dominate is the best way to beat ya
Sorry 'bout yesterday, now the sweet stuff
You a sweetie pie, come, let me eat ya

(Fuck it up)

Ooh-ooh
Boy, you never had a chance
If you make my body talk
I'ma leave you in a trance
Got you walkin' with a limp
Bet this body make you dance, dance, dance, dance 

Oh, it's so good, it's so good 
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good
Oh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good

Applause
A round of applause
Applause
A round of applause

Say, I want, want, want what I want, want, want
(I want, want, want what I want, want, want)
I want, want, want what I want, want, want
(I want, want, want what I want, want, want)

I want your touch, I want your feeling
(I want your touch, I want your feeling)
I want your love, I want your spirit
(I want your love, I want your spirit)
The more I want, the more I need it
(The more I want, the more I need it)
Need it (need it)

Versace, Bottega, Prada, Balenciaga
Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy 
Collect your coins, Beyoncé
So elegant and raunchy
This haute couture I'm flaunting
This Telfar bag imported
Birkins, them shit's in storage
I'm in my bag

Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
