		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long drive, dark lights
I ask baby are you alright?
New love, new start but it's too bright
Might try yeah to always stay around her
Don't sleep we can stay awake forever

And do you hear me? When i'm calling
I mean okay we both want this
But one day when the sky goes grey
We'll remember this as the day we met

Long drive, dark lights
I ask baby are you alright?
New love, new start but it's too bright
Might try yeah to always stay around her
Don't sleep we can stay awake forever

I bought you roses but you didn't need them
You need my love
So that's all that I'm bringing
Whеn we first met I didn't
Think I just leapеd in
Your eyes were so blue I
Didn't mind the deep end
Deep dive, didn't even think why
Was captured by the loving
Nature of your eyes
Yeah you made me hypnotized

One life, one heart
But it's you that I needed
Found trust in the ask stop the bleeding
You remind me of the stars
And galaxy in motion

Don't let me go yet I beg you
Cos I ain't been the same since I met you
On the rainy day
But haven't we always been this way?
And it's all up in the air now
But i don't really give a fuck now
There comes a day where it all fades away
I don't wanna waste no time

Long drive, dark lights
I ask baby are you alright?
New love, new start but it's too bright
Might try yeah to always stay around her
Don't sleep we can stay awake forever
