		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never wanna let go of a what if

I can turn right up where I’m not wanted

And I can read your mind in hindsight

Tell me I’m clever tell me I’m alright



Hey how long can you keep your head under water

See how fast I can run that track

All my faith is unravelling travelling

All that heart yet you can’t look back



Give me a rope and I’ll walk it

Anything to please you what do I get

Forget about the past and look at me

I can do a dance I can be Sylvester still I promise you



And I know better I think

About it all the time



Hey how long can you keep your head under water

See how fast I can run that track

All my faith is unravelling travelling

All that heart yet you can’t look back



And I know better I think

About it all the time

And I was better before

Don’t try to remind me



Hey how long can I keep my head under water

See how far I can run that track

All my faith is unravelling travelling

All that heart yet I don’t look back
