		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could hold you next to me
Coldest shoulder I could lean
Would it mean a single thing
While we’re frozen in between
Nothing and everything

You won’t like this
I own all the fighting
Sometimes I get frightened
And I can not hide it

It broke up my mind when
You took me in silence
Peeled open my eyes and
You crawled in the lightning

You touch so smooth (you touch so smooth)
I can not move (I can not move)
Out of the blue (out of the blue)
I’m wrapped into

Nothing and everything

Open my mind
I know I live a lie
My purpose in life is
A person who dies

The moment you sigh I
See wind in the sky line
And when you inhale I
Feel my body rise

You touch so smooth (you touch so smooth)
I can not move (I can not move)
Out of the blue (out of the blue)
I’m wrapped into

Nothing and everything

I thought I saw you yesterday
High hopes are calling me astray
I thought I saw you yesterday
I thought I saw you, saw you

All my friends are moving away
I try and try to make them stay
Look I don’t want no trouble, kay?
I’m scared to die alone one day

Bitter world you’re breaking me down
So I will bend and twist and shout
I got so much to talk about
Yet I can’t seem to leave my house

All I learn from love is pain
It opens up my heart to break
So I will close the door today
Cause cowards always play it safe

I didn’t take my meds today
Cause I’m too tired to run this race
I try and try to stay awake
But I still always fall a…. sleep

Lying naked acting free
Let’s just wrestle in our ring
While we’re frozen in between
Nothing and everything
