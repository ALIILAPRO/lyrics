		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me, what you're thinking
What's been missing?
You stay long enough to keep me warm
I'm not the last thing 
A kiss in passing that makes me question everything I know

I keep hanging on you, I do, I do
I keep hanging on like a love song

I wanna cover my eyes, lights out in your high fidelity
Won't you shake me right down
Hold tight, baby do it all for me
And you know me so well, I fell like I never have before
But, there's something in the way you leave me always wanting more

I see us getting older
I'm not over wanting more than just a compromise 
I'm too devoted, I suppose it's gonna be that way until we die

I keep hanging on you, I do, I do
I keep hanging on like a love song

I wanna cover my eyes, lights out in your high fidelity
Won't you shake me right down
Hold tight, baby do it all for me
And you know me so well, I fell like I never have before
But, there's something in the way you leave me always wanting more

Oh when you get it so right (so right)
No one compares to you and I

I wanna cover my eyes, lights out in your high fidelity
Won't you shake me right down
Hold tight, baby do it all for me
And you know me so well, I fell like I never have before
But, there's something in the way you leave me always wanting more
