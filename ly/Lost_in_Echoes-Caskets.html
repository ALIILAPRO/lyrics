		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I lost my mind
Everything I knew came falling down
Anything I build comes crashing down
I'm pleading god not now
Save me from my sins before I leave
Free me from the weight so I can breathe
The more I fool myself
The more I feel it creeping in
I think I lost my mind again
Don't worry I'll be lost in
Echoes, be laughing
On my own
It's tragic but it's the only life I know
What should I do
What should I be
I'm at a turning point right now
I'm so full of rage, too blind to see
The more I fool myself
The more I feel it creeping in
I think I lost my mind again
The more I start to fall
The more I don't see me at all
I think I lost my mind again
I keep picturing my ending
Beneath a yellow rose
I don't recall this type of feeling
A seed inside my bones
My soul's turned its back and left me
I burnt the bridge within
Just another waste of human
Weighing down this skin
And it pulls me further from the point that I belong
And all you wanna do is
Take me, break me, hide me away
Or you can shame me, blame me
Burn me at the stake on a lie
â€˜Cause my own mind wilts at the thought
Of being alive
And that I'd like if I tried
The more I fool myself
The more I feel it creeping in
I think I lost my mind again
The more I start to fall
The more I don't see me at all
I think I lost my mind again
