		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause baby
Baby can't you tell that it's fading
I feel like my heart's rather jaded
Wasted, fuckin' on the couch in the basement
Too many times, too many tribulations
Baby
Baby can't you tell that it's fading
I feel like my heart's rather jaded
Wasted, fuckin' on the couch in the basement
Too many times, too many tribulations
Lately
I feel like i'm swimmin' thru the river of all the fake shit
I'm drippin' water not from yo shit but from the payments
I drip like it's Aquafina leavin' bitches hydrated
They built me like Caesar, the way i'm dressing up entertainment
Then there was a model she was off the meter
Pulled up for the three and took the shot and hit the buzzer beater
Duckin' from the ex bitch
Like Ali, had bob and weave her
Realized I was better off without a fucking bottom feeder
Now I'm on my back
And I've realized that
That you never really cared enough
I was blind in fact
From the day we first met
To the feelings we mistake for love, 'cause
Baby
Baby can't you tell that it's fading
I feel like my heart's rather jaded
Wasted, fuckin' on the couch in the basement
Too many times, too many tribulations
Baby
Baby can't you tell that it's fading
I feel like my heart's rather jaded
Wasted, fuckin' on the couch in the basement
Too many times, too many tribulations
Baby we lost the euphoria
By the way you keep Secrets they call you Victoria
Some days, it was hard resisting ya lingerie
But then I remember all the times that don't fade away
Look now
Now I be stacking chips up like its Lay's
Some say, it's easier said than done to fill the bank
And everybody forgettin' about the memories
Of all the days that I worked late
Now I'm on my back
And I've realized that
That you never really cared enough
I was blind in fact
From the day we first met
To the feelings we mistake for love, 'cause
Baby
Baby can't you tell that it's fading
I feel like my heart's rather jaded
Wasted, fuckin' on the couch in the basement
Too many times, too many tribulations
'Cause baby
Baby can't you tell that it's fading
I feel like my heart's rather jaded
Wasted, fuckin' on the couch in the basement
Too many times, too many tribulations
Baby
Baby can't you tell that it's fading
I feel like my heart's rather jaded
Wasted, fuckin' on the couch in the basement
Too many times, too many tribulations
