		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every second, every day
I spend hoping we never change, love when you
Never wait or hesitate
To tell me what is on your mind, really do
Enjoy your company, I think you would agree 
Just where you'd rather be is right here with me
Make my day in every way
Know I'll be ok when you are around

I just want to stop
Worrying 'bout what could come

I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far 
Now I fear a change, want time to stop

Waiting for an argument
Inevitable, but don't know how bad 
The smallest things will get to you 
Hoping we won't be a thing of the past
But where we are today is where I want to stay 
Leave worries far away when you're here with me
I should just enjoy this time
In case we end up leaving all this behind

I just need to stop
Worrying 'bout what could come

I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far 
Now I fear a change, want time to stop

Yeah, I'm always with you
I wanna remember this moment in time 
Though I'm always with you
I wanna remember if we leave this behind

I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far 
Now I fear a change, want time to stop

I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far 
Now I fear a change, want time to stop

(How will this go?)
Yeah, I'm always with you
I wanna remember this moment in time 
Though I'm always with you
I wanna remember if we leave this behind

Yeah, I'm always with you
I wanna remember this moment in time 
Though I'm always with you
I wanna remember if we leave this behind
