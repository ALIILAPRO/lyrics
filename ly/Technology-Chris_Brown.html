		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you ever wondering where I am
Anchor to my own wonderland
These different time zones
How do I ever land by you
By you?
Yeah, all these days go by and it feels like I'm counting sand
I want you around me to fill up this emptiness
Girl, help me write the story with a happy ending with you
(Oh yeah) For you

I want you close, closer, baby
'Cause this long distance ain't working for me (no)
Why do you have to be overseas?
'Cause this technology, you know it

It don't do it for me (hey, yeah)
For me (no, it don't, it don't)
It don't do it for me (no, it don't, hey)
For me (it don't do it, baby, no)
It don't do it for me

Baby, you know I'm in love
Your body, I got the answers (for me)
Why you teasing me all the time?
'Cause it don't do it for me
Baby, you know I'm in love, yeah
Your body, I got the answers (for me)
(Oh yeah) It don't do it for me

I've been drinking way too much
Time goes so slow, an orbit around the sun
Is there any chance you could fly to me?
To me, please?
Don't hang up your cell phone, don't give up on me
I'm tryna make this FaceTime last
Actin' like any time, minutes ain't free
Oh-oh, I need you here with me, yeah
To write these songs, oh-oh, about you

I want you close, closer, baby
'Cause this long distance ain't working for me (no, whoa)
Why do you have to be overseas? (you have all this water)
'Cause this technology, you know it

It don't do it for me (hey)
It don't, it don't do it for me
It don't, it don't do it for me (hey)
It don't, it don't do it for me (oh)
(It don't do it baby, no)
It don't, it don't do it for me

Girl, I need all of your love
Sun down to sun up, yeah (for me)
For me, oh baby
It don't do it for me (it don't do it for me)
Give it here, give it here (yeah)
Girl, I know you've been waiting (for me)
And you know that
It don't do it for me

Baby, you know I'm in love
Your body, I got the answers
Why you teasing me all the time? (for me)
Baby, you know I'm in love
Your body, I got the answers
Why you teasing me all the time?
