		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's a story about the ears that never listened
Here's a riddle of the fire in a heart
Here's a song about the hands that took Goliath for a dance
About being brave enough to stand up to the man
About when you're feeling way too small to make a difference
'Cause your shouting to the monsters in the dark
About a girl with little braids
That turned the world to a parade
And here's a song about doing anything it takes

And though I trembled in the cold blue night knowing I'm alone this time
And then I looked up into the giant's eyes and I found my strength inside

Now I'm Goliath
I'm standing on the head of a giant
And I won't be silent until you hear me
Yeah, I'm Goliath
I'm standing on the head of a giant
I'll start a riot until you hear me

Here's a story about the power of the broken
Here's a riddle 'bout the rebel in your heart
Here's a story 'bout a tick that beat the giant with a trick
About when you told me to do everything I can

And though I trembled in the cold blue night knowing I'm alone this time
And then I looked up into the giant's eyes and I found my strength inside

Now I'm Goliath
I'm standing on the head of a giant
And I won't be silent until you hear me
Yeah, I'm Goliath
I'm standing on the head of a giant
I'll start a riot until you hear me again

Now I'm Goliath
I'm standing on the head of a giant
And I won't be silent until you hear me again
