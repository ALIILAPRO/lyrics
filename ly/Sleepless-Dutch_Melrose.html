		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my oh my oh my 
Why's it every night
I'm feeling so sleepless
Oh why oh why oh why
I'm losing my mind
Maybe you're the reason

Cause darling I'm scared
That you
Might wake up loving someone new
And darling I'm scared 
When everything leads back to you

Started as friends
But less than lovers
It's all making sense
On days I'm thinking about us
I can't pretend
I never wondered
If you'll need me like I've needed you

I know I'm so selfish 
Hate the thought of someone else
Making you laugh, smiling, happy
If it ain't me or myself 
I overthink over obsess 
That's what I do best 
And if they'd ask me I'd say 

Oh my oh my oh my 
Why's it every night
I'm feeling so sleepless
Oh why oh why oh why
I'm losing my mind
Maybe you're the reason

Cause darling I'm scared
That you
Might wake up loving someone new
And darling I'm scared 
When everything leads back to you

My shallow pride
Aging like whisky 
You know I try
But I lose myself when you're gone
I know in time
I'll find it easy
But till then won't you promise I'm yours

I know I'm so selfish 
Hate the thought of someone else
Making you laugh, smiling, happy
If it ain't me or myself 
I overthink over obsess 
That's what I do best 
And if they'd ask me I'd say 

Oh my oh my oh my 
Why's it every night
I'm feeling so sleepless
Oh why oh why oh why
I'm losing my mind
Maybe you're the reason

Cause darling I'm scared
That you
Might wake up loving someone new
And darling I'm scared 
When everything leads back to you
