		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""I've got a lucky hand got two sun eyes  but it's too late the English Summer's calling my friends will wait  I've got a heavy metal head a two-sided dime  but it's too late the English Summer's calling my friends will wait my friends will wait  Under the better hand my shit's golden  but it's too late the English Summer's calling and I have to wait  Cool kids they find when returning from their slumber their days already gone Feels like somewhere beyond our setting now they're mourning the loss of the sun and it's already done the summer set's giving see I'm already there the stakes of the living and it's already and you're already done  I've got a lucky hand got worn-out shoes  but it's too late the English Summer's my friends will wait but it's too late the English Summer's my friends will wait  Let's not get carried away!""
