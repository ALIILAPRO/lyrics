		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taps always dripping 
Sleeping in the daylight 
Leaning out of windows 
Someone laughing 
No one's gonna say anything very nice

Charm dripping like fresh honey 
I'm the Milky Bar kid 
Soiled trousers 
Shiny cheekbones like graveyards in the sun
Murder shoes 
Dirty eyes sizing up

Taps always dripping 
Sleeping in the daylight 
Leaning out of windows 
Someone laughing 
No one's gonna say anything very nice 

Unless you got nothing to say 
Just don't say it 
Sleepless angels have blessed us
And I'll shout you down in a slumlord way 
Scary people 
Saying silly shit 

Taps always dripping 
Sleeping in the daylight 
Leaning out of windows 
Someone laughing 
No one's gonna say anything very nice

Shake it down 
(Ha ha ha ha ha) 
Shake it down 
(Ha ha ha ha ha) 
Shake it down 
(Ha ha ha ha ha) 
Shake it down

What you like about me?
What you like about me?
What you like about me?
What you like about me?
What you like about me?
What you like about me?
What you like about me?
What you like about me?

Taps always dripping 
Sleeping in the daylight 
Leaning out of windows 
Someone laughing 
No one's gonna say anything very nice
