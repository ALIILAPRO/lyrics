		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah (Gun smoke)
Yeah (Gun smoke)
Yeah, yeah (Gun smoke)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Gun smoke)
Yeah, yeah

One man army from the get-go (Get-go)
One man army pullin' kick doors (Kick doors)
Talkin' out yo' neck get you tag toed (Tag toed)
I'm a killer whale, you a tadpole (Tadpole)
Nigga, you got asthma, you don't want smoke (Straight up)
Who want cancer? I'm giving out smoke (Straight up)
I got too many bitches, I can't trip bro (On God)
Most of the time, I be caked up with my stick bro (On God)
Yeah, AK make yo' brotha do the limbo (On God)
Make this Glock "Shiggy Challenge" out the window (On God)
Savage, why you always rappin' 'bout guns for? (Straight up)
'Cause, bitch, I fell in love with the gun smoke (Straight up)

Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Yeah, gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Put my Glock down, that's a no-no (No-no)
When I wear my suit, I tote my .44 (.44)
Y'all ain't killin' shit, y'all niggas hoes-hoes (Hoes-hoes)
Cryin' over pussy, you a broke joke (Broke joke)

Started with a deuce deuce, turned it to a .38
Then I got a Glock 9, turned it to a AK
First I was a leg shooter, now I'm hittin' chest, face
She done caught rug burn, give that girl a neck brace
Shoot at me with a handgun, that's an insult (Straight up)
We got plenty sticks, nigga, plus my M's up (Straight up)
My young niggas ready to crash, they don't give a fuck (Straight up)
Let it bang, let 'em hang, I'ma drop mine (Straight up)
I don't need no shooter, everybody know I pop mine (On God)
I'm at Crucial on stage with a Glock 9 (On God)
I keep one in the head, I ain't got time to cock mine (On God)
Murder Gang, nigga, I'm redder than a stop sign (On God)
You niggas know you need to cut out all that dickriding (Bitch)
Skinny capris, you think you finer than yo' bitch, huh? (Lil' bitch)
You niggas mad 'cause I keep throwin' up Zone 6, huh? (Lil' bitch)
Like "Look at Savage, lil' bitch ass, he think he the shit, huh?" (Facts)
I think I am when I'm ridin' with this stick, huh (21)
I think I am 'cause I just fucked that nigga bitch, huh (On God)
I swear to god my deal worth seven figures, not six, huh (Straight up)
You think you hard, you wanna get shot all up in yo' shit, huh?

Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Yeah, gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Gun smoke (Gun smoke)
Put my Glock down, that's a no-no (No-no)
When I wear my suit, I tote my .44 (.44)
Y'all ain't killin' shit, y'all niggas hoes-hoes (Hoes-hoes)
Cryin' over pussy, you a broke joke (Broke joke)
