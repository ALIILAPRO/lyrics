		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
If everybody demons, I'ma call this hell
How I get rich off of a skill that I taught myself?
I remember when I couldn't even afford this belt
I ain't had the best drip, but I wore it well
Yeah, I brought that pain with me
I'd rather sleep alone than have the wrong bitch layin' with me
Different walks of life, but niggas is from the same city
I take him out the game for good, that nigga keep on playin' with me
I been through all type of shit
Fake friends, new opps, the wrong type of bitch
Goin' live, ShadeRoom, I lost likes and shit
I got famous, friends died, I lost life to this
And everybody actin' funny
Always get mad when I tell 'em that they actin' funny
And they gon' hate me with their soul, but they gon' ask for money
And when I tell 'em niggas "No," they say I'm actin' funny
Like I don't know the real truth
Like I don't know the shit that I survived would've killed you
I got rich, but when I was broke, I was on them pills too
To walk a mile in my feet, you had to steal shoes
We got the same twenty-four hours, nigga
Why what's mine gotta be ours, nigga?
Talkin' 'bout niggas need help, nigga, I was "niggas"
But I rose out of the dirt, give me my flowers, nigga
I see you hatin', nigga, just admit it
How you playin' victim to a crime that you committed?
How you mad about a life that you ain't livin'?
And how you tell me how to spend a bag that you ain't gettin'?
Even my family couldn't stand me
I feel like only Instagram understand me
They kill me in they raps, but I don't believe the cap
'Cause every time I'm out, I'm never hidin' where I'm at
And they be talkin' crazy every day behind my back
But every time I see 'em, niggas always give me dap
Can I live? All that stupid shit I did
I iced out the gang before I iced out my kids
I packed out a show before I packed out my fridge
And they sayin' they need more, that's some disrespectful shit
Like bitch, I pay the rent, how you put my bags out and shit?
I brought you back in my life, how you want me back out the crib?
I'm tryna be a good nigga, why you wanna spazz out and glitch?
Actin' like it's nothin', I don't just pass out this gift
Damn, this what I waited for? Uh
To get money and get hated more?
Everybody I thought loved me is wagin' war
If I knew this what it was, I'd have been stayin' poor
If I knew this what it was, I'd have been stayin' poor

If I knew this what it was, I'd have been sayin' more
If I thought it was a game, I would've been playin' more
I'm really hot 'cause I grew up without the fan on
I'm really 'bout to pull my Glock out on the landlord
I'm really like that, tell my mama we ain't stayin' poor
I feel like the G.O.A.T. every single time I cut that Lamb' on
Urn be on my dresser since he was present on my standoffs
My granny house a mil', she ain't even know I could rap my ass off
You shittin' me? I was super broke, I took that cast off
Started sellin' work, you hit this shit, you probably blast off
Auntie, she got seven homies, three, and I still passed off
Knowin' she won't pay me, but I'm knowin' I'm a rap star
Switchy on they block got niggas runnin' like they track stars
You spin too many times, we drill your whip up like it's Nascar
Ff-ff-ff, shoot your shit up on the dashboard
My youngin' tryna crash and he can't wait to go on this crash course
Ff-ff-ff, shoot your shit up on the dashboard
My youngin' tryna crash and he can't wait to go on this crash course

Huh, Fivio Foreign, Meek Mills, nigga
Viral
Moral of the story, though
I got no sympathy for you bitch-ass niggas
Yeah
Oh, yeah, when you, you niggas pick a side too, nigga
You bitch-ass niggas
And when you pick a side, stay there, nigga
You know what time I'm on, you know my side, nigga
