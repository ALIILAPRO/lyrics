		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
Oh
That shit makes me bat shit crazy
We got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out

We're going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Drink everything in sight (hey)
We're going 'til the world stops turnin'
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We're screaming like demons and swingin' from the ceilin'
I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me
Oh
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got 'em lined up, shot down, firing back straight Crown

We're going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Drink everything in sight (hey)
We're going 'til the world stops turnin'
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Tickin' like a time bomb, drinkin' 'til the nights gone
Well, get your hands off of this glass, last call my ass
Well, no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out

We're going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Drink everything in sight (hey)
We're going 'til the world stops turnin'
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We're going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Drink everything in sight (hey)
We're going 'til the world stops turnin'
While we burn it to the ground tonight
