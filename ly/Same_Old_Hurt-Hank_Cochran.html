		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a new house with new lumber even got a new phone number
Did it all since we broke apart
Got acquainted with new faces started going to new places
But I got that same old hurt in my heart
Got a new suit for next Sunday got a new job startin' Monday
Got everybody thinkin' I am a half smart
Got a new vocabulary even got a new canary
But I got that same old hurt in my heart

No matter what I change same old hurt stays the same
Always there reminding me that we're apart
Got a new job with more money got a new girl that calls me honey
But I got that same old hurt in my heart
