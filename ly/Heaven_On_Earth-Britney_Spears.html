		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your touch, your taste, your breath, your face
Your hands, your head, you're sweet, your love
Your teeth, your tongue, your eye, you're mine
Your lips, you're fine, you're heaven on earth

I've waited all my life for you
My favorite kiss
Your perfect skin, your perfect smile
Waking up and you're next to me
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep

(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time
The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven, you're heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

Your breath, your face, your hands, your head
You're sweet, your love, your tongue

I'd move across the world for you
Just tell me when, just tell me where
I'll come to you
Take me back to that place in time
Images of you occupy my mind

(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time
The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven, you're heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

Fall off the edge of my mind
I fall off the edge of my mind for you
Fall off the edge of my mind
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes)
I fall off the edge of my mind for you
(Taken me so far)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven, you're heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

I'm so in love
I said I'm so in love
I said I'm so in love with you
