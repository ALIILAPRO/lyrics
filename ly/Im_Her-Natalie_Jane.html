		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you know I could see forward in time?
Where there is no trace of you in my mind
Boys are like pennies and nickels and dimes
If I don't need 'em I leave 'em behind

I will not have an idea who you were
All of the shit that you did will not hurt
All of the shit that you gave will be burned
Memories dead to me now in the dirt

I'm a god
Obliterate you
From my heart
I'll make them hate you
Don't cause harm
To a god, god, god, god, god
What?

God
Ha ha ha ha ha

Once you lie there's no empathy
I don't break bread, especially not with my enemies
Turning water to wine
Blood in the sky
Shouldn't have bit off the apple tree

You made a mess
Hades of death
Revenge is divine
Don't be surprised
If I go and ruin your everything
Thing, thing, thing, thing
What?

I'm a god
Obliterate you
From my heart
I'll make them hate you
Don't cause harm
To a god, god, god, god, god
What?

God
Ha ha ha ha ha
God

I'm not even holy
But my heart is safe and sound
'Cause if you hurt me
I'll come right back around

Swinging at full speed
Go and call the cops
Tell them that you've seen
A God, oh
God

Ha ha ha ha ha

God
