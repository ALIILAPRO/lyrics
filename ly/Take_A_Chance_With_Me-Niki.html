		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
The kind that colors the sky
Heart intangible, slips away faster
Than dandelion fluff in the sunlight
And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
Uncovering the dreams he dreams at night
As much and hard as he tries to hide
I can see right through
See right through

His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
What I would give for me to get my feet
Back on the ground, head off the clouds
I laugh at how we're polar opposites
I read him like a book and he's a clueless little kid
Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
Just to make him smile
Make him smile

Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?
Take a chance with me
Take a chance with me

Ooh
Ooh

His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
Electricity surgin' in the air
He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware
That I'm hopelessly captivated
By a boy who thinks love's overrated
How did I get myself in this arrangement?
It baffles me too, baffles me too

Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?

In the end, we only regret
The chances we didn't take
I'll be your safety net
So why not raise the stakes?
I can hear your heart from across the room
Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
Lie to me all you please
I can see right through
See right through

Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?
Take a chance with me
Take a chance with me

Ooh
