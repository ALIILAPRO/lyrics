		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say

Take me back, I love you
It hit me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along

Without you
