		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pulled in to Nazareth was feelin' 'bout a half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
Hey mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed
He just grinned and shook my hand, no was all he said

Take a load off Fanny, take the load for free
Take a load off Fanny and, and, and you put the load right on me

I picked up my bag I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, hey Carmen come on let's go downtown
She said I gotta go but my friend can stick around

Take a load off Fanny, take the load for free
Take a load off Fanny and, and, and you put the load right on me

Go down Moses there's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke waiting, waiting on the judgement day
Well Luke my friend what about Anna Lee
He said do me a favor stay and keep Anna Lee from company

Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny and, and, and you put the weight on me

Catch me a cannonball now take me on down the line
My bag is sinking low and I believe that it's about time
Get in touch with Fanny you know that she's the one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free 
Take a load off Fanny
