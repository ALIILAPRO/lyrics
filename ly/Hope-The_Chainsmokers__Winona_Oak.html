		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Hope
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Always another bender, I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me, darling
But I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trick
And all the magic we felt was just a hit

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

('Cause you had me so low)
Hope
(Now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
