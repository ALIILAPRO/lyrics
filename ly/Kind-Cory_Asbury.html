		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes marriages don't work
And sometimes babies die
Sometimes rehab turns to relapse
And you're left just asking why
And for all the prayers I've prayed
I still wonder if He's real
And if He is how is He choosing
Who He does and doesn't heal

I've tried to run from Jesus
I've started holy wars
I've tried the patient waiting
And the kicking down the doors
I've cursed His name anger
With my fists raised to the sky
And in return all He's ever been is kind

I've burned my share of bridges
Learned to tuck my tail and run
Watched the wreckage in the rear view
From all the crooked things I've done
And I know that He forgives me
But it's hard to forgive myself
I can't help but think amazing grace
Is for everybody else

I've tried to run from Jesus
I've started holy wars
I've tried the patient waiting
And the kicking down the doors
I've cursed His name anger
With my fists raised to the sky
And in return all He's ever been is kind
All He's ever been is kind

And I know I wasn't there
But when I look up at the cross
I see the darkest day in history
And I guess that's what kindness cost

I've tried to run from Jesus
I've started holy wars
I've tried the patient waiting
And the kicking down the doors
He knows I don't deserve it
But He's never changed His mind
All He's ever been is kind
All He's ever been is kind
