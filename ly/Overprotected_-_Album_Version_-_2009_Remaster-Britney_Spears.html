		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need time (time)
Love (love), joy (joy)
I need space (love)
I need me (action!)

Say hello to the girl that I am
You're going to have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't want to be so damn protected

There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I'll tell them what I like, what I want, what I don't
But every time I do I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize
I'm overprotected

There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I need time (love)
I need space
(This is it, this is it)

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm going to
Do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just
What, what, what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me (Action!)

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm going to
Do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just
What, what, what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
