Wanna know what it's like (like)
Baby, show me what it's like (like)

Hold up, I'm goin' wide (wide)
We could just start at ten (ten)
Then we can go to five (five)

Might just fuck him with my makeup on (I will)
Eat it like I need an apron on (yeah, ay)
Eat it 'til I need to change my thong (yeah, ay)
We could do it to your favorite song (yeah, ay)
Take a ride into the danger zone
You know my nigga be buggin' me

You're exciting, boy, come find me
Your eyes told me, "Girl, come ride me"
Fuck that feeling both us fighting
Could he try me? (Yeah) mmm, most likely

Tryna see if you could handle this ass
Prolly give his ass a panic attack
Sorry if I gave a random erection
Prolly thinkin' I'm a telekinetic
Oh, wait, you a fan of the magic?
Poof, pussy like an Alakazam (yeah)

Clink with the drink, gimme a sip
Tell me what's your kink, gimme the dick
Spank me, slap me, choke me, bite me (ew)
Uh, wait, I can take it (ah)
Give a fuck 'bout what your wifey's sayin' (yeah)

Wanna know what it's like (like)
