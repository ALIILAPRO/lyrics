		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini

Time is passin' like a solar eclipse
See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss
It's your moment, baby, don't let it slip
Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?

They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini

If you're good enough, you'll find a way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change her ways
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay

Everything you say is soundin' so sweet (ah)
But do you practice everything that you preach? (Ah)
I need something that'll make me believe (ah)
If you got it, baby, give it to me

We've been stealin' from tomorrow
Free the people from daylight
All the plans go out the window
When we're out this late at night

They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go (I come and I go)
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows (I'm not here for long)
Catch me or I go Houdini

If you're good enough, you'll find a way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change her ways
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay

(Like a solar eclipse)
(See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss)
(Baby, don't let it slip)
(Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?)
(They say)

I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go (I come and I go)
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows (I'm not here for long)
Catch me or I go Houdini

We've been stealin' from tomorrow
Free the people from daylight
All the plans go out the window
When we're out this late at night

They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go (I come and I go)
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows (I'm not here for long)
Catch me or I go Houdini

Houdini
Houdini
Houdini
Catch me or I go Houdini
