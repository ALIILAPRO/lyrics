		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I should give up
I think I should give up
I think I should give up now
I wanna be happy, I'll never be happy
I was born to kill myself

Now I think about you
Now that I'm without you
I wanna be happy, I want you to be happy too
I think that I'm worthless
It's simply cause I'm worthless
It's not right

I think I should give up
I think I should give up
I think I should give up all the time
I feel fucking worthless
But I do deserve this
I would give anything to simply smoke dope

Now I think about you
Now that I'm without you
I wanna be happy, I want you to be happy too
I think that I'm worthless
It's simply cause I'm worthless
It's not right
