		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Vers 1:
I put my hand in yours
Said I'm not ready to let go yet
But I could read your thought
Was only yours until the sunset
Pre:
I'm not alone to feel lonely
But now it feels like that
Cause I'm waking up alone
Got your cap and cologne
Whatever takes me back
At least it feels like that
And I guess
Ref:
If you don't mind
I wanna write another storyline
So maybe I'mma get to call you mine
Now it's all play pretend
Like we don't see the end, yeah
I hope you don't find
Another lover in somebody else
Don't wanna carry on all by myself
So don't you kiss me goodnight
Hold me tight one last time, yeah
If you don't mind
Vers 2:
Stuck on what might have been
If I did better on the first try
Caught in the in-between
Of giving in or facing goodbye
Pre:
I'm not alone to feel lonely
But now it feels like that
Cause I'm waking up alone (waking up alone)
Got your cap and cologne
Whatever takes me back
At least it feels like that
And I guess
Ref:
If you don't mind
I wanna write another storyline 
So maybe I'mma get to call you mine
Now it's all play pretend
Like we don't see the end, yeah
I hope you don't find
Another lover in somebody else
Don't wanna carry on all by myself
So don't you kiss me goodnight
Hold me tight one last time, yeah
If you don't mind
Bridge:
See your body dancing in golden lights
Shining so bright, shining so bright
Wanna feel your skin, body next to mine
And it's alright, yeah it's alright
See your body dancing in golden lights
Shining so bright, shining so bright
Wanna feel your skin, body next to mine
And it's alright, yeah it's alright
Ref:
If you don't mind
I wanna write another storyline
So maybe I'mma get to call you mine
Now it's all play pretend
Like we don't see the end, yeah
I hope you don't find
Another lover in somebody else
Don't wanna carry on all by myself
So don't you kiss me goodnight
Hold me tight one last time, yeah
If you don't mind
