		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day, you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ayy
Makin' beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me (yeah, yeah)
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah
Makin' beautiful mistakes

You did me wrong 'cause I let you (let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid (damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin', lucid 
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
But really I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love all in your bed (bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair (hair)
Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (lookin' sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
You're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (oh)
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, hey (let it go)
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah (ooh)
Nah-nah-nah
