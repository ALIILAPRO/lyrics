		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For once, there's someone for he, for she
For once, there's someone for he, for me

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our (my) people's plans
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be here (near)
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear

So this is the aftermath

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plans
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you

For once, there's someone for he, for she
For once, there's someone for he, for me

Let me tell you about my mother

For once, there's someone for he, for she
For once, there's someone for he, for me

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plans
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things (that) I need to tell you, things you need to hear

How can I be sure?
In a world that's constantly changing
How can I be sure?

How can I be sure?
In a world that's constantly changing
How can I be sure?

Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
How can I be sure?
