		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mustard on the beat, ho

Yeah, pop champagne, put the pussy on my lap, yeah
I'm the type of nigga that live what I rap (blaow)
Make a famous bitch drive where I'm at (yeah)
Daddy was a hustler, I was born to be a mack (yeah)
Hit the booty club and I'm airing out the racks (cash)
She licking on my neck while you staring in the back (back)
I'm the type of nigga that was built to last
She want that yolk, I got more in the stash (yolk)

I got more in the stash (yeah)
Gave her my chain, I got more in the stash (more in the stash)
The price was a bag
Broke that shit down, rolled that shit on the dash (dash)
I got more in the stash
Open the stash, price was a bag (bag)
Roll that shit on the dash
Gave her my chain, I got more in the stash

You ain't shit, where your mans at? (Mans at?)
Said you ain't cheating, it's a lap dance (lap dance)
You gon' turn a nigga to a madman (madman)
And we gon' turn his body into quicksand (quicksand)
I'm loving how you looking in them Tom Ford heels
You the murder mami 'cause you dressed to kill
Ain't shit realer than real on real
I can make you famous, for real
Sitting real low like a Big Wheel (Big Wheel)
I'm a bad boy like Big Will (Big Will)
Walking out the bank with a new deal (new deal)
"You want that in cash?" Nigga, hell yeah, hell yeah
Pop champagne, start the foreplay (foreplay)
She strip to her toes in the doorway (strippin')
It ain't the hallway, it's the whore-way (bitch)
See yourself out in the morning

Told that bitch (what?)
I got more in the stash
Gave her my chain, I got more in the stash (more in the stash)
The price was a bag
Broke that shit down, rolled that shit on the dash (dash) (on the dead homies)
I got more in the stash
Open the stash, price was a bag (bag) (blew the bag)
Roll that shit on the dash
Gave her my chain, I got more in the stash

Blueface, baby
Yeah aight, famous Crip, I can make you famous (scoop)
Good die young, instead of safe, I gotta stay dangerous (stay dangerous)
Pockets blue, I'm a Crip, you know I blew a bag (blew the bag)
Blower to his lips like a mustache (ooh)
Blueface pendant bustin' like a disabled man (bustin')
Movie clips on me like the cable man (bop)
Glock poppin' and lockin', make 'em break dance (poppin' and lockin')
I wanna see ass shaking, not shake hands (bleed 'em)
I came to get it in, I only got dead friends (on the dead homies)
No rockstar, but I play with hella bands (big bands)
Only 91 supremeium in my Mercedes Benz (big bands)
Blueface, baby

Yeah, I got more in the stash
Gave her my chain, I got more in the stash (more in the stash) (yeah aight)
The price was a bag
Broke that shit down, rolled that shit on the dash (dash) (on the dead homies)
I got more in the stash
Open the stash, price was a bag (bag) (yeah aight)
Roll that shit on the dash
Gave her my chain, I got more in the stash (ooh)
