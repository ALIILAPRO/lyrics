		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've thrown away, I've thrown away again
The pills that make me
I've thrown away, I've thrown away again
The chance, the want to change
I've thrown away, thrown away again
Standing all alone
I've thrown away, thrown away again

Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
Pulling back the skin it happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
It's all the same but in the end, it keeps me coming

I've blown away, I've blown away again
The fear of failing
I've blown away, I've blown away again
The lies that make me sane
I've blown away the chance to make it right
I wanna be, I wanna see, I wanna make it back to me

Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
Pulling back the skin it happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
It's all the same but in the end, it keeps me coming

Just waste away
The chance, the time, to face, the change
To make myself to think that things are better

Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
I'm pulling back the skin it happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
It's all the same but in the end, it keeps me coming

Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
Pulling back the skin it happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut, running through my brain
It's all the same but in the end, it keeps me coming
