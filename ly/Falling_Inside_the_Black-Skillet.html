		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight I'm so alone
This sorrow takes a hold
Don't leave me, it's so cold
Never wanna be so cold

Your touch used to be so kind
Your touch used to give me life
I've waited all this time
I've wasted so much time

Don't leave me alone
Cause I barely see at all
Don't leave me alone
I'm

Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks
Falling to the depths, can I ever go back?
Dreaming of the way it used to be, can you hear me?
Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks
Falling to the depths, can I ever go back?
Falling inside the black
Falling inside, falling inside
The black

You were my source of strength
I've traded everything
That I love for this one thing
Stranded in the offering
Don't leave me here like this
Can't hear me scream from the abyss
And now I wish for you, my desire

Don't leave me alone
Cause I barely see at all
Don't leave me alone
I'm

Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks
Falling through the depths, can I ever go back?
Dreaming of the way it used to be, can you hear me?
Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks
Falling through the depths, can I ever go back?
Falling inside the black
Falling inside, falling inside

The black
Black
Black
Black

Falling in the black
Slipping through the cracks
Falling through the depths, can I ever go back?
Dreaming of the way it used to be, can you hear me?
Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks
Falling through the depths, can I ever go back?
Falling inside the black
Falling inside, falling inside
