		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like

Still blowin' out O'z
Still sippin' out the liter
But that ain't slowin' down the meter
A lot of shit been gettin' old
Might see a change in my demeanor
It's gettin' dropped if I don't need it
They say I should be on the road
I made a promise that I won't forget
But I still got habit's I been copin' with
And I still got damage I'm too broke to fix
Stuck ways made it hard enough
To open my ears
And these niggas talk so ideal
They ain't sympathize the pain
They had no idea they ain't in it for the
Same reason I came in
I ain't in to get some fame
But you know I did
Things change in exchange you accept that
Can't entertain
I ain't stayin' for the best act
I'm feelin' far from where I
Came can't forget that
I'm inna coupe switchin' lanes
Trynna get back home
Wish I could remember what it feel like
'Cause nowadays every day ain't
Gotta feel right i know this haze got me
Dazed but I still light
I know that she ain't good for me
But I still might
I know I shouldn't ride with it
But it's still tight
It's only me and GOD when
It comes to real life
I keep a lot inside I just wanna reel right

Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
Wish I could remember what it feel like
