		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should take it as a compliment
If I were you, I would be more confident
You're lucky that you're pretty
Why are you obsessed with your appearance?
I don't wanna hear it, you're fine

It's been my best kept secret for a while now
No one ever sees it but it's all around
It's the dinner conversation no one talks about
Don't know how much longer I can keep this down

Beauty is a knife, I've been holdin' by the blade
Swallowin' my pride, so I won't eat anything
It's all a lie
Honestly, it's eatin' me alive
They're all like, "Did you change your hair?
Did you lose a little weight?
You should keep it up, 'cause it really looks great"
I hate that I
Always look my best
When I'm dyin' on the inside
When I'm dyin' on the inside

I wish I could break the mirror
That makes me feel like I should fuckin' disappear
And drown my demons in a bathtub filled with tears
No matter what I try
They always seem to come back to life

What if I didn't do this to my body?
What if I quit and then you don't want me?
The dinner conversation no one talks about
Don't know how much longer I can keep this down

Beauty is a knife, I've been holdin' by the blade
Swallowin' my pride, so I won't eat anything
It's all a lie
Honestly, it's eatin' me alive
They're all like, "Did you change your hair?
Did you lose a little weight?
You should keep it up, 'cause it really looks great"
I hate that I
Always look my best
When I'm dyin' on the inside
When I'm dyin' on the inside
When I'm dyin' on the inside

You should take it as a compliment
If I were you, I would be more confident
You're lucky that you're pretty
Why are you obsessed with your appearance?
I don't wanna hear it, you're fine

Beauty is a knife, I've been holdin' by the blade
Swallowin' my pride, so I won't eat anything
It's all a lie
Honestly, it's eatin' me alive
They're all like, "Did you change your hair?
Did you lose a little weight?
You should keep it up, 'cause it really looks great"
I hate that I
Always look my best
When I'm dyin' on the inside
