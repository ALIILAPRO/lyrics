		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a seat back in your clam shell
If the ocean's not enough, nor am I
Rollin' in, I feel a dark swell
Crawlin' up the skin of my spine

If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd've let you waste another guy
Well, alrighty, Aphrodite
Go whip that red for other eyes

Run your morning bath in sea foam
Soak your milky skin in the tide
Little pearl, you think you're in gold
But I can see the dirt in your lines

If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd've let you waste another guy
Well, alrighty, Aphrodite
Go whip that red for other eyes

If I'd known you sold on maybe
Then, I'd've let you waste another guy
Well, alrighty, Aphrodite
Go whip that red for other eyes
