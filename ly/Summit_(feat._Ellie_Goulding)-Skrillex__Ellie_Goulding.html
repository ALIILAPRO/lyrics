		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.
I was the one who loved you after all.

A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.
I was the who loved you after all.

A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight of which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.
I was the one who cared after all.

A silent heart ticking under the ground.
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found.
If you can hear me now why don't you recall.
I was the who loved you after all.
