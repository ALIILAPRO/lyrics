		  Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh (brr), oh (brr), oh

Got more ice than a skatin' rink, think I need my mink, gotta bundle up (mink)
Take my chain, watch the news next week, you gon' see dead bodies turnin' up (bah, bah)
Poppin' this molly got me grindin' at night 
Got some porcelain teeth, I done fucked 'em up (fucked 'em up)
I was eighteen with a pound of weed, I was baggin' up dimes at the back of the bus
Hidin' from me, throwin' dirt on my name 
You gon' fuck around, get your homeboy touched (bah, bah, bah)
Goin' in the fridge, I ain't lookin' for a Sunny D, I just want the purple stuff
Upgraded me to a diamond account, I been gettin' bitches, fillin' up Uber trucks
Sal said that he got another million-dollar check for me
I told him to run it up, run it up

Say you want smoke, we'll turn you to a pack
Take a hood girl and I'll turn her to a brat
Rap game fake, yeah, it's hard to adapt
Everything they talk 'bout is cap, cap, cap
Textin' my phone, I don't never write back
I been losin' sleep just countin' up cash
Lots of bad habits, I'm poppin' off tags
I'ma fuck the game up when I drop "Bag"
Rollin' off the pills, two hundred on the dash
I'ma bend the corner, I almost crashed
Got everythin' that I need
If I see somethin' else that I want, I'ma buy it in cash
We was dead broke
We ain't had no money for the work, so we drive around pickin' up bags
Got pulled over, had P's in the trunk
Frost said he'd take the charge, but they gave us a pass

Got more ice than a skatin' rink, think I need my mink, gotta bundle up (mink)
Take my chain, watch the news next week, you gon' see dead bodies turnin' up (bah, bah)
Poppin' this molly got me grindin' at night 
Got some porcelain teeth, I done fucked 'em up (fucked 'em up)
I was eighteen with a pound of weed, I was baggin' up dimes at the back of the bus
Hidin' from me, throwin' dirt on my name 
You gon' fuck around, get your homeboy touched (bah, bah, bah)
Goin' in the fridge, I ain't lookin' for a Sunny D, I just want the purple stuff
Upgraded me to a diamond account, I been gettin' bitches, fillin' up Uber trucks
Sal said that he got another million-dollar check for me
I told him to run it up, run it up

Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh
Oh

Pull up like Ace and I'm shameless (shameless)
Pull up like Ace from the cleaners (cleaners)
I dropped two hundred on a watch (hunnid)
She wet, Aquafina, yeah ('fina)
Me and NAV in the Bugatti ('gatti)
Movin' too hotty (movin' too hotty)
'Cause we came from the bottom (the bottom)
Now we solvin' all our problems (our problems)
Crib got five stories, yeah, I live like a king
Thirty-five carats the ring 'cause ('cause)
Diamond cuts on my necklace
I'm so expensive
I been spendin' (yeah)
I'm young and reckless ('less)
I been havin', yeah
If we all gettin' money, nigga, why are you hatin'? (Why are you hatin'?)
If you ain't talkin' money, change the conversation (change the conversation)
Niggas know my name, ain't no false claimin' (oh, oh)
When I walk in the spot, niggas know who we are
No, I ain't twirlin', we shootin' them stars
