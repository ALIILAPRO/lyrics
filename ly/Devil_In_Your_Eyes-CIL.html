		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I finally met you last night
I saw the truth behind your pretty little lines
Nightingale singing pretty little rhymes
The world's greatest
Oh, look at you, you're famous
Everybody at your feet and you're complaining
You like to watch them bleed
You find the music in their screams

I see you crawl
Crawl up in their walls
With poison in your touch
You forgive us

I see the devil in your eyes
I see the devil in your eyes
Admit it, I am not surprised
You're the devil in my eyes
I'm not going down with you
Staying 'cause you want me to
You can try and change the sky and compromise
You're still the devil in my eyes

Draped in satin and you're lookin' so attractive
All the people in your palace
Drinkin' liquor from your chalice (oh-oh-oh)
You think you're special for your particular powers
Picking women for their prowess
But you're really just a coward

You crawl
Crawl up in their walls
With poison in your touch
You forgive us

I see the devil in your eyes
I see the devil in your eyes
Admit it, I am not surprised
I see the devil in your eyes
I'm not going down for you
Staying 'cause you want me to
You can try to change the sky and compromise
I see the devil in your eyes

But I'll admit your face is like a silver sky
And the smell of roses by the bed
I was cleared from your haze
Found bound by your chains
Unveiled your disguise

I saw the devil in your eyes
I saw the devil in your eyes
I'll admit, I am not surprised
I saw the devil in your eyes
I'm not going down with you
Staying 'cause you want me to
You can try to change the sky and compromise

You're still the devil in my eyes
You're still the devil in my eyes
You're still the devil in my eyes
You're still the devil in my eyes, uh
