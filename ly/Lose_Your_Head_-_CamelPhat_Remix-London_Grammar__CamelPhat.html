		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to learn
When this thing called love
When it's a mirror, baby
Can you see all those parts of me
Broken across the world?
I need to find some kind of peace of mind
It's a demon, baby
When it comes like my oldest friend
Have you got a friend in the night?

You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head
You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head

What a way
What a way
What a way (to lose your head)
What a way
What a way
What a way, what a way (to lose your head)

There's a place I see it in your head
Full of evil, baby
Can you see all those parts of me
Broken across the world?

You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head
You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head

What a way
What a way (to lose your head)
What a way
What a way (to lose your head)
What a way
What a way
What a way (to lose your head)
What a way
What a way (to lose your head)
