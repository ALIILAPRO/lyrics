		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I'm being honest, when you look at me
It's like kissin' a million angels
And every tattoo's so intoxicating
From your neck and right down to your ankles

15 and 16, I had to be strong
22, I'm still scared of it all
'Cause I know one day I could wake up and you'll be gone

And I'll just be lonely, missing
Holding your hand when we're half asleep
Lonely, wishing
We'd never kissed in your backseat

And that's what scares me the most
Knowing that you could just let me go
And I'll just be lonely, missing
Holding your hand when we're half asleep

Getting kinda tired of turnin' pages
I hope you're not the type to pull the same shit
'Cause you could be like everyone I've dated
They don't love me, they just want to see me naked

15 and 16, I had to be strong
22, I'm still scared of it all
'Cause I know one day I could wake up and you'll be gone

And I'll just be lonely, missing
Holding your hand when we're half asleep
Lonely, wishing
We'd never kissed in your backseat

And that's what scares me the most
Knowin' that you could just let me go
And I'll just be lonely, missing
Holding your hand when we're half asleep

If I'm being honest, when you look at me
It's like kissing a million angels
And every tattoo's so intoxicating
From your neck and right down to your ankles
But that's what scares me the most
It'll tear me apart when you go
