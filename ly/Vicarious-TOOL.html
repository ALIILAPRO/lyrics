		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eye on the TV
'Cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be like
Killed by the husband
Drowned by the ocean
Shot by his own son
She used a poison 
In his tea
And kissed him goodbye
That's my kind of story
It's no fun until someone dies

Don't look at me like
I am a monster
Frown out your one face
But with the other
Stare like a junkie
Into the TV
Stare like a zombie
While the mother 
Holds her child
Watches him die
Hands to the sky crying
"Why, oh why?"

'Cause I need to watch things die
From a distance
Vicariously I live 
While the whole world dies
You all need it too, don't lie

Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing
Neither the brave nor bold
Were writers of the stories told
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing

I need to watch things die
From a good safe distance
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same, so
Why can't we just admit it?

Blood like rain come down
Drum on grave and ground

Part vampire
Part warrior
Carnivore and voyeur
Stare at the transmittal
Sing to the death rattle

La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie

Credulous at best
Your desire to believe in
Angels in the hearts of men
Pull your head out of your hippie haze
And give a listen
Shouldn't have to say it all again
The universe is hostile, so impersonal
Devour to survive, so it is
So it's always been

We all feed on tragedy
It's like blood to a vampire

Vicariously I 
Live while the whole world dies
Much better you than I
