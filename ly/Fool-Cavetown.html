		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am just a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
You are just a fool to keep pretending that you're loving me
I don't know where I'm supposed to go 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh

Call me on the phone at three, I talk to you while half asleep
Complaining 'bout your mother so I take you to the cemetery
Rant to me I like the sound, I like your voice, I like your mouth
Oh, oh
Mm-mm-m

Cycling to school at 7:30 in the morning
I am still your baby boy I'm stuck in 2013
Don't understand my body, Washing machine confuses me
Oh, oh
Mm-mm-m

I am such a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
You are such a fool to keep pretending that you're loving me
I don't know where I'm supposed to go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh

I was such a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great
You were such a fool to keep pretending that you're loving me
I don't know where I'm supposed to go
(Look in the mirror, I love that boy, don't hurt my dear, don't hurt my joy)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh
