		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the camp

I hide my face and run far away
I get crazy, angsty, when you get under my skin
The power it takes to make me cry that way
Baby, I hate it when you get under my skin (yeah, when you, yeah)

Another glass, broke the other glass
Technically, it wasn't me, I'm sober now (now)
You get all in a mood when it's overcast (cast)
I get all in a mood when it's over cash (yeah)
I'm over that (I'm over that), you notice that? (That)
Other couples be cussin' and fightin' over tabs
Baby, take another tab, come and hold my ass (just hold me)
Don't you ever in your life call me Doja Cat (don't)
I don't sign titties on my coffee dates (nah)
I emptied out your motherfuckin' Coffee-Mate
I can show you crazy if you call me cray
I ate a pussy for you, don't you call me gay
You out here actin' like you sniffin' on some Carly Rae
Cartier on you, but you barkin' like you Cardi B (yeah)
You ain't stupid, but you probably ain't as smart as me
I told the concierge to change the lock for the apartment key

I hide my face and run far away (I hide my face)
I get crazy, angsty, when you get under my skin (crazy)
The power it takes to make me cry that way
Baby, I hate me when you get under my skin (yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah)

I stopped poutin' (twin), I stopped cryin' (ah)
The chef made breakfast, check the center island
Dhl package came, I don't have to sign it
The toilet seats poppin' open when I walk by 'em
Put it to bed, close the black-outs
You wouldn't treat your mama like that in a Black house
Hats off to that, I can't cap now
Admit you hate seein' me with all them plaques now
Security around the clock, you gotta back down
And put the bag down, turn your ass 'round
Now that you got it front and center, face the facts now (yeah)
This what you get for leavin' bitches in the background
Quote, bitches, end quote (ah)
(Yeah, yeah, said, I)

I hide my face and run far away (I hide my face)
I get crazy, angsty, when you get under my skin (crazy, angsty)
The power it takes to make me cry that way
Baby, I hate me when you get under my skin (baby, hate me)

Ngikuthembile 
Waguquka esiswini wena njengotshwala
Angiyithandi lento yokuxabana njalo
Lento ingiphula umoya
Ngikuthembile 
Waguquka esiswini wena njengotshwala
Angiyithandi lento yokuxabana njalo
Lento ingiphula umoya
Ngikuthembile 
Waguquka esiswini wena njengotshwala
