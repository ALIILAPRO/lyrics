		  What do I do now
Wish I could say that I feel stupid, but I don't
'Cause honestly a part of me's still holding on to hope
You ticked too many boxes
I've read too many books
To think it's not exactly as perfect as it all looks
And it's been a minute
I've been holding on
But you're already gone
So what do I do now?
Cause I finally found what I searched for
I finally had you
How am I supposed to let you go?
No, I just don't know how
You can fit perfectly
But still think you're not meant for me
I get the part where I get let down
But what do I do now?
If I told you how I feel, you'd probably feel worse
You always tried your best to keep my heart from getting hurt
I'm trying to do the same thing you never need to know
That my heart broke to pieces when we said
We're letting go
And it's been a minute
I'm still holding on
But you're already gone
So what do I do now
Cause I finally found what I searched for
I finally had you
How am I supposed to let you go?
No I just don't know how
You can fit perfectly
But still think you're not meant for me
I get the part where I get let down
But what do I do now?
With all of the feelings
And all of the pain
And all of the words that u chose not to say
I'm trying to hate you
But I don't know how
So what do I do now
Cause I finally found what I searched for
I finally had you,
How am I supposed to let you go?
I just don't know how
You can fit perfectly
But still think you're not meant for me
I get the part where I get let down
But what do I do now?
