		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eerie whispers trapped beneath my pillow
Won't let me sleep, your memories
And I know you're in this room, I'm sure I heard you sigh
Floating in between where our worlds collide

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, whoa

And I know the moment's near
And there's nothing we can do
Look through a faithless eye
Are you afraid to die? Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, whoa

And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, whoa
