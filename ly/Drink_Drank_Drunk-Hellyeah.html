		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah!
I'm a madman, and I came to go
I'm on the move, I wanna screw
I wanna fuck till I'm sore
Gather up your women and children
We're here to throw down
And drink up all the booze that you've got in your house
There ain't a god damn thing that you can do
Cause we're gonna trash this party like we did in high school
So tap up the barrel, and twist up the weed
Law that I decree, It's our time now
So everybody scream, Yeah!

Let's get fucked up, till we fall down
So everybody get drink drank drunk, right now
Let's get tore up, till we're face down
Because the Hellyeah drink, drank, drunks are back in town
Right now

To all the hellions all around the globe
Slam your fists on the bar, demand a round of shots
Half rack a joint and a bottle of booze
I can't walk a straight line, but that's the life I choose
Call me an animal, but I'm bringing the hope
If this party was the Vatican then I'd be the Pope
Tap up the kegger, twist up the weed
Law that I decree, it's our time now
So everybody scream, Yeah!

Let's get fucked up, till we fall down
So everybody get drink drank drunk, right now
Let's get tore up, till we're face down
Because the Hellyeah drink, drank, drunks are back in town
Right now, let's get fucked up
Right now

There's only two reasons, that we showed up here, right now
To party and kick some ass, and we're almost outta beer
There's only two reasons, that we showed up here
To party and kick some ass, and we're almost outta beer
Yeah!

Hellyeah!
Let's get fucked up, till we fall down
So everybody get drink drank drunk, right now
Let's get tore up, till we're face down
Let's all get drink, drank, drunk

Right now, fuck this shit up
Right now, fuck this shit up
Right now, fuck this shit up
Right now, fuck this shit up

Right now, fuck this shit up
Right now, fuck this shit up
Right now, fuck this shit up
Right now, fuck this shit up
