		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sara the girl she'd never smile
Waste my time and birth my child
I told her what id do i put my finger back at you
She’d rather lie than tell the truth that kid dont look a thing like you
Tell her how you feel
Erase that thing that wound wont heal
All i want from you
Is time time time time time
All i want from you
Is time time time time time time
Sara the girl shed never smile waste my time and birth my child
She used to be down for what i do shed share that fucked up point of view
What kind of man would turn his back on the woman he loved for a lie like that
Running around with your fist drown we fixed that fight we wrote that song
Sara the girl shed never smile
Waste my time and birth my child
Told her that i dont know now id make this better if I knew how
Sara the girl this point of view i point my finger back at you
She’d rather lie than tell the truth that kid dont look a thing like you
all i want from you
Is time time time time time time
All i want from you
Is time time time time time time
all i want from you
Is time time time time time time
All i want from you
Is time time time time time time
