		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think you coulda get inna my feelings? (Nah)
You couldn't get me fi sekkle down (sekkle down)
Me give you a hit and run (run)
Me give you a hit and run (move)
Me did only want likke dealings (yeah)
Love you did a look, you must be dumb (must be dumb)
Me give you a hit and run (yesso)
Me give you a hit and run (Di Genius)

Ayy
My yute (my yute), you take it too serious (jhee)
Give you likkle piece, just a likkle feel up (ayy)
Now you take set a pon me, you itch up
Give me space, give me room, give me likkle breeze nuh Jesus (Jesus)
A what make you feel so? (Yeah)
True, me keep it tight and me ever clean so
Want me, did want, seh me never need you
This enough fi people know, I keep it pon the d-low

Me too young fi lockdown with nobody
I pray, one day, somebody keep your company (ooh-whoa, oh-oh)
And a girl like me just want to have fun and more money
But you a pree relationship and that's a no for me, oh-oh-oh

Ayy, you think you coulda get inna my feelings? (Feelings)
You couldn't get me fi sekkle down (sekkle down)
Me give you a hit and run (run)
Me give you a hit and run (quick)
Me did only want likkle dealings (likkle dealings)
Love you did a look, you must be dumb (must be dumb)
Me give you a hit and run
Me give you a hit and run

Long story short, your pussy good and done
Heaven me see when you pull your drawers down
Call, call your phone, me want some
Dial tone again, your heart numb
A wicked, a wicked 'bout hit and run
Me a real bad bitch, me no sekkle down
Get the bricks, I level up, can't style me though, me up
But me miss when we ah fuck, ayy

Me too young to lockdown with nobody
I pray, one day, somebody keep your company (no one send for me, girl)
And a girl like me just want to have fun and more money
But you a pree relationship and that's a no for me, oh-oh-oh (no one send for me, girl)

Ayy, you think you coulda get inna my feelings? (Feelings)
Me couldn't get you fi sekkle down (sekkle down)
Me give you a hit and run (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Me give you a hit and run (quick)
Me did only want likke dealings (likkle dealings)
Love you did a look, you must be dumb (yeah, for real)
Me give you a hit and run
Me give you a hit and run

(Hit and run, hit and run, ayy, ayy, hit and run)
Me give you a hit and run
(Hit and run, hit and run, ayy, ayy, hit and run)
Me give you a hit and run (run, run, run, run, run, a hit and run)
Me give you a hit and run
