		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See I know a little bit something good
Always comes out of a little bit something bad
And I wasn't looking for someone new
Till you came down
Giving me the best the time I've had
And now you're on my skin
Body to body
Working me out
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady
Round after round woah oh oh oh

I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh

Mistakes I don't worry 'bout them no more
It ain't no thing
'Cause you got me, I'm on Cloud 9
So good, no I cannot just keep it real
T-shirt and jeans
See you making me feel so fly
And now you're on my skin
Body to body
Working me out
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady
Round after round
Woah oh oh oh

I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh I

You make me wanna ride again 'cause I
I wanna hear you say my name 'cause I
You make me wanna ride again 'cause I
I, I, I, I
You make me wanna ride again 'cause I
I wanna hear you say my name 'cause I
You make me wanna ride again 'cause I
I, I, I, I (I)

Oh uh
Woah oh oh oh

I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh

I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first
Baby there wouldn't have been
No second, third or fourth love
Woah oh oh oh I
