Strugglin', I'm tryna find my way
Fightin', I'm havin' battles with faith
They criticize me and speak on my name
But perfect's somethin' that I'll never be

Yeah i remember days back as a kid
They was hatin'
Sayin' I was never gonna be nothin' dope
(Pow)
They was sayin' I was never gonna make it
They would try to put me in a headlock
Had me by the throat (Never)
They would say I was a little boy, snot nose
Wrong path, I was dodgin' all the potholes
Syndrome they diagnosed called Stockholm
Goin' through hеll
Was walkin' on the hot coals
Mama said I was a special case
And dеmons talk to those we cannot replace
That the world was a hell and test of faith
To crown those who would walk
To the heavens gates so I'd sit and wait
Face to face with those who would
Try to break my mental state
Then take all the hurt and pain
And paint barbells I'd use
Just to shoulder weight now my strength
Got the people askin', like
"Who's stoppin' him?
We ain't never seen a nigga this poppin'
Without that garbage that
Be brainwashin' 'em"
So every time I get a chance
I'm bombin' the verbal vomit
Is tick-tick-tockin' 'em into a coffin
Your fifteen seconds is up, be Giannis
The bucks you chase couldn't chip my commas
I digest greats and I paid my homage (yeah)
Fuck cheese, what I'm spittin' is nachos
Niggas didn't believe I was
Spittin' the gospel now they gotta receive
Take a swig of the hot sauce
Bow and get on they knees
'cause these verses Picasso
I won't fold, yes, I got my soul
Every bar I throw is a strike, I bowl
They won't pin me, no, I won't spare or go
Down the path they chose
I'ma bring them home

Strugglin', I'm tryna find my way
Fightin', I'm havin' battles with faith
They criticize me and speak on my name
But perfect's somethin' that I'll never be
Strugglin', I'm tryna find my way
(Find a way)
Fightin', I'm havin' battles with faith
(Havin' battles with faith)
They criticize me and speak on my name
(Let me speak on my name)
But perfect's somethin' that I'll never be

Now I'm a veteran, uh
They didn't know they was fuckin'
'round wit' a specimen
Many men tried to get me, but my adrenaline
Came in so heavy that I was able
To take on ten of them
Every battle was won, I made them irrelevant
The screams loud, the cries of men deafenin'
I told 'em all I was
Sorry and that I'm heaven-sent
But if I gotta kill 'em, then fuck it
I'll go to hell again
Now I'm straight drivin' it, uh (Skrrt)
I see demons pull up outside
To the left and the right
Tryna get up inside
So I gas every beat and let
'em know what I'm vibin' with
Don't give me that paper, I'm not signin' it
I see the evil
You niggas ain't disguisin' it
I'm sick wit' it, not talkin' about sinuses
If they wanna puppet
I'm throwin' a peace sign to it
Ate the hate, then put it the game in reverse
Built a base
Engaged and through the flames I emerged
(Go) grabbed the gates of hell
To close then turned to the devil's face
And said we are adjourned
Every cell and each and every single nerve
In my body jumped as I began to purge
Then I hit the bend and sped around the curve
To the sign that said "Return
Back up to earth"
Now they haunt me, can't get up off me
Wakin' the people up like some c-c-c-coffee
Devil knows what I'm doing so
He tryin' to stop me
Braking the chains of mental slaves
On the path less chose
Went against the grain
Everybody fuckin' knows Dax the next to reign
Anybody who oppose burns then heats the flame
Throws and seeks the sheep
Then begin to change

Strugglin', I'm tryna find my way
Fightin', I'm havin' battles with faith
They criticize me and speak on my name
But perfect's somethin' that I'll never be
Strugglin', I'm tryna find my way
(Find a way)
Fightin', I'm havin' battles with faith
(I'm havin' battles with faith)
They criticize me and speak on my name
(Let me speak on my name)
But perfect's somethin' that I'll never be
