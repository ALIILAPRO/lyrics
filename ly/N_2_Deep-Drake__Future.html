		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah, yeah
Kept the Galleria open 'til ten for you and your friends
You know how I spend in H-O-U-S-T-O-N
I get too crazy, had a little baddina
We stay good friends, we get too wavy
All I know is that when this cup ends, the next one begins
My bae, you know me and you knew me back then
And you know how it goes when I see you again
You know I'm making my way to your ends
And you know I need you to be there for me

You a little Post Oak baby
You a little forty-eight baby
Got a little candy in her pocket
She gon' take off like a
You already know (know, know, know, know)
Dirtied up a cup, I'm on the Northside
Text you but I know you probably courtside
Know I got to come and check the whole man, baby, hold tight
I just touched the city with the G-block stainers
And we got adopted by some fifth ward strangers
You know what it means when I twist these fingers
Me and you been on a first name basis
Why you think I hate it when you talk that Drake shit?
Same reason that you never left me hangin'
Same reason that I tried to make you famous
Same reason that I tried to show you just who I was

Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would 'cause you to judge
Outside of the club
Show you just who I was
Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would cause you to judge
Outside of the club

"Some OVO shit, let's go have some fun, enjoy the show
You know, we in Houston celebrating
We goin' to Houston, Atlanta, Vegas
Y'all already went to Vegas? Now we in Houston
We definitely goin' down
Goddamnit, appreciate you"

Pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Yeah, pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Now I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep, oh
I'm in too deep, in too deep, oh
In too deep, in too deep, oh
I'm in too deep, oh, in too deep

Got some bad bitches
That's gon' fuck me for that AP
Fuck me for that AP, fuck me for that AP
If I wasn't rappin', baby, I would still be trappin', baby
Comin' down off sippin' 'Techs, boppers on me, hella crazy
New Mercedes for my baby, 2022, updated
Shorty met a sponsor in the club
Shock's spend a hundred like dubs
I'm lovin' droppin' bands on her
Emilio Pucci curvin' her up
We turn the studio into a strip club
Got the strippers goin' way up
Drankin' on Texas and I pop two pills
That's gon' make a nigga stay up
In too, in too deep (poppin' freaks)
Bitch on demon time, she don't get sleep
You get She Nay Nay, number five five, one, two, three, whoa

Pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Yeah, pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Now I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep, oh
I'm in too deep, in too deep, oh
In too deep, in too deep, oh
I'm in too deep, oh, in too deep
