		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you were with us until the last minute
And then you were gone from here
And I watched and I just figured out
That I will never see you again

I had a choice
You had to leave
Into the night
This was my choice

It's so hard to explain what I meant
When I said that I wanted you dead
But I saw you fuck up and I just can't get back
The feeling I had for you

So I put all my strength into my only will
It was the only thing to do
And now I only regret that I cried
'Cause you would never do that for me
