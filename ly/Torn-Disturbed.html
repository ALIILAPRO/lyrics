		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I learned how to fall today, didn't think it would kill you
To settle the debt I thought never would be paid
Found out I was wrong today, too weak to continue
One final defense to fall
Still unbroken

Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away

Knew there was a price to pay, didn't think it would thrill you
To witness the fallen one shattered and ashamed
No I'm not the only one yearning to fulfill you
Unwilling to risk it all
Still uncertain

Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away

Yeah!!

Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know

That I am torn (torn)
Thought it was over this time
And we know (know)
There's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away
