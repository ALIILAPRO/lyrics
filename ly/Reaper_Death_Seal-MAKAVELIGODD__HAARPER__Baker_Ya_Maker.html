		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the chop street
Dead bodies hanging by they feet
You see this demon when I walk
You hear this evil when I speak

Mark of the beast
When I reap I claim your soul as mine to keep
And in the middle of the night I'm
Looking for some blood to leech
Catch your throat missing fresh blood
Spitting out your teeth
But I still practice what I preach
Give his family time to weep

I'm at the crossroads, you make a deal
I got just what you need
But just know when your time is up
Them hellhounds coming out to feast
I done slit my wrist so much
I guess I'll never get to feel
Yeah, this demon I got's real
He just showed me how to kill

Cloaked in hoodies, crooked daggers
Demon sigils, candles lit
See that full moon in the night
We 'bout to sacrifice, yo bitch

Sacrifice, sacrifice, yo bitch
Sacrifice, sacrifice, yo bitch
We 'bout to sacrifice, yo bitch
Sacrifice, sacrifice, yo bitch

We 'bout to sacrifice, yo bitch
Sacrifice, sacrifice, yo bitch
We 'bout to sacrifice, yo bitch
Sacrifice, sacrifice, yo bitch

She lookin' like Megan fox, double 09
Conjugate ya soul after following the signs
Takin' all ya hoes to the
Road where they hide
Where the spirit's stay alive
Skinnin sheep for their hides

You can run from us you can back out now
But when the sun plummets
You won't camp without all the
Voodoo in the night
Know we gotchu in our sight
We gon' catch ya by surprise
Gotcha fearin fo ya life

Cest la vie, tell me what you know
You a dumb bitch and I'm fuckin' on ya, hoe
When the gun hit's
You'll be sippin' on patrone
Thinkin' everythang is good, Samsung G-Note

You cannot fuck with us
You throwin bluffs sippin' tuss
I'ma uppercut right through yo
Face from a lunge pop a lung, Murk ya son
Puttin knives in ya tum
Listening to bone thug while I get the redrum

Redrum, rum, rum you cannot out run
I'm goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
I'ma get me some

We spillin rum, rum, rum you cannot out run
I'm goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
I'ma get me some Lil bitch

Bare face run up in place
There's no where hide
The people eater with the cleaver
Out for blood and homicide
Murdering high I get the rush when the bones
Goes crush and the brain turns mush
I wonder why I have to touch, I kill so much
When lost in lust

Smoking with the fabled reaper
Having talks between myself
Is there someone else inside or is
It just that I need help
Mental health is off the tracks
If approached I will attack
No remorse I'm showing back
It's kill 'em all destructive path
