		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you women who want a man of the street
Don't know which way you wanna turn
Just keep a-coming and put your hand out to me
'Cause I'm the one who's gonna make you burn

I'm gonna take you down
Oh, down, down, down
So don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it, pull it, pull the trigger

Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills, yeah
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
I got my gun at the ready, gonna fire at will
Yeah

I'm like evil, I get under your skin
Just like a bomb that's ready to blow
'Cause I'm illegal, I got everything
That all you women might need to know

I'm gonna take you down, yeah, down, down, down
So don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it, pull it, pull the trigger

Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills, said
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
I got my gun at the ready, gonna fire at will
'Cause I shoot to thrill, and I'm ready to kill
I can't get enough and I can't get my fill
I shoot to thrill, play to kill
Yeah, pull the trigger
Pull it

Pull it, pull it, pull the trigger, yeah

Oh
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills
I said, shoot to thrill, play to kill
I got my gun at the ready, gonna fire at will
'Cause I shoot to thrill, and I'm ready to kill
And I can't get enough, and I can't get my thrill
'Cause I shoot to thrill, play to kill

Yeah

Shoot you down
Yeah
I'm gonna get you down on the bottom, girl
Shoot you, I'm gonna shoot you
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna shoot you down, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna get you down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shoot you, shoot you, shoot you, shoot you down
Shoot you, shoot you, shoot you down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm gonna shoot to thrill
Play to kill
Shoot to thrill, yeah
Oh yeah
