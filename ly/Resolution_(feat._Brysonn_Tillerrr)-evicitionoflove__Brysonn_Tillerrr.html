		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm 'bout to turn this bird to my ex like I'm Elon
Pull up to the club 'round twelve, word to Dijon
Must've been a opp the way she toppin' all these peons
She turned her location off, I need recon
Remember when I took days off? Wish I could rewind
'Cause now a nigga feel laid off, you know I need mine
I'm tryna get the crib paid off, stop actin' like I'm tryna take a bitch AWOL
I'm at the factory, just tryna make a hit, (?)
No disrespect but I've been feelin' like this ain't all, I can have
I'm flyin' out to Brisbane, y'all
Lil' Aussie, tryna suck the membranes off
Sit up on D, girl, get you whip paid off
And you debt paid off, and your dress came up
I'm in the jetlane, up (I'm in the jetlane, up)

And I could go anywhere in this world
Searchin' for you, be my girl
You're like a dream come true (come true)

I know it hurts 'cause
You never thought I
Could be the it guy
Not like this, nah
I been rich, why? Ever since twenty-five
But now it's his time, his bein' mine
I got no wife so it's for my kids, me and mine
She got no life, been swindlin' me and mine
They got it right, Young Tiller didn't see the signs
But Slum Tiller, gon' tell these niggas, "Come get her"
Don't get it fucked up now, I had fun with her (yeah)
I spent seven figures (yeah)
I tried to settle with her (yeah)
I tried to let her do her thang but she left quicker
I'm on a jet with my-, I'm on a jet finna

Take off and see all this world
Take it from me, be my girl
It's like a dream come true (come true)

Oh, hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah (Yeah)
Slum Tiller finna, Slum Tiller finna
Tell these niggas, "Come get her", Slum Tiller finna
Slum Tiller finna, Slum, Slum, Slum dawg, (?), hey, hey
Slum dawg, (?), hey, hey
Strip club, take her friends out, hey, hey
Ayy, Swan, bring the ones out, hey
Tell Neal bring the ones out, hey
Terrance bring the ones out, hey
Tell Richard, bring the ones out, hey, hey

I'm transparent, I ain't got nothin' to front about
Shawty starin' like I'm 'bout to throw a hundred thou'
She said to (?), "Grab, what's the fuss about?"
I wanted marriage with your girl, I ain't the one in doubt
I ain't the one in doubt, I ain't the one in doubt
I ain't the one in doubt, I ain't the one in doubt
I ain't the one in doubt
Nah, I ain't sharin' with 'em, girl, go 'head and fuck around
Go 'head and find out, go 'head and find out (go 'head and find out, find out)
Go 'head and find out (find out)
Ayy, you know where to find me at
I'm in South Beach, Miami with it
Yeah, South Beach, Miami with it
I'm not a tourist so baby, don't
Long way from Louisville, so baby, don't
