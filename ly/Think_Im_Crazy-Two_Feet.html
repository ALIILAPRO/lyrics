		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought that i was calling up my friends now
But Kurt told me that they were in my head so
Do I wanna be like Leo in that movie
Cocaine and groupies
Qualudes and boobies

Ooh I’ve got lots to do no no
And I really fuck with you oh oh
Would you wanna stay around I know, you know, don’t go
I think im crazy, lately. Everything is hazy. Everything and anything I ever want to do.
I think im crazy lately, feeling like im faded
Everywhere I go
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I need to tell you something weird about me
I like it when you tie the rope around me
And my life has always been a little different
Since you’ve been in it
Got double vision

I think im crazy, lately. Everything is hazy.
Everything and anything I ever want to do.
I think im crazy lately, feeling like im faded
Everywhere I go
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I think im crazy, lately. Everything is hazy.
Everything and anything I ever want to do.
I think im crazy lately, feeling like im faded
Everywhere I go
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I think im crazy, lately. Everything is hazy.
Everything and anything I ever want to do.
I think im crazy lately, feeling like im faded
Everywhere I go
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
