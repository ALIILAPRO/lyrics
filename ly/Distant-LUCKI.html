		<p>
		  (This is a high-quality film, right?)
Ayy, yo yo, ayy, ayy, ayy
Tell that bitch I miss it
More from a distance
Woah, keep it away, ayy, ayy
Keep it away, keep it away, keep it away
Keep it away, ayy keep it a uh, woah
Ayy, ayy, ayy tell that bitch I miss it
More from a distance

Tell that bitch I miss it
More from a distance
I got codeine in my pores
I can't kick shit, ayy
Under 30, I got Forbes in my wishlist, ayy
Leave my faith all up to
Lord, I won't kick shit, ayy
I was in school noddin' off, I'm a misfit
Ayy all them cosigns, nigga still
Did nothin' with it, ayy
That lil' ho will do me wrong
What make you different?
This Max Payne world, Percocet my vision, ayy
What is pain, world, I wish
I could feel this, ayy
This the same ho, molly love her different
Ayy i didn't change, nope, I'm
Still with my misfit's, ayy
In the same boat, our waters just different
Ayy i'm the same dummy
You everything you isn't
How do you go home
Don't know who you came with
It ain't talking my money longer
I lose and get it
I love her, I don't condone her
She really with it
Wock-sipper, but I'm alone
Now I see it different
Wock-sipper, but I'm alone
Now I see it different
Wock-sipper, but I'm alone
Now I see it different

Keep it away, keep it away, ayy, ayy
Woah, keep it a ayy, woah
Keep it away, keep it away, keep it away, ayy
Keep it away, keep it away, keep it away, ayy
Woah, ayy, yeah
Woah, keep it a woah, woah, woah
Wock-sipper, but I'm alone
Now I see it different
Wock-sipper, but I'm a ayy, woah, woah
