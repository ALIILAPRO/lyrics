		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frozen stairs, carpet in blood red
Seating goodbyes left unsaid, goodbyes left unsaid
Despite our promises, here I am following your steps
I'm following your steps

Drop by drop
As your unchanging reality dampen my sleeve
You kissed them off
Through the fibers of my handkerchief

I am fire
Burn those who dare to care for me
And my fuel are memories, fuel are memories of you
They perish with the heat, perish with the heat
So I can move on

Flower of iron
Shrivelled up to hide the imposter in me
"Hey, why did you leave? Why did you leave?"
Don't let those words out of me
Imposter's about to speak
So I chewed on Huameitang

For whom the shelves hold on to the pages, hold on to the pages
Their pain, their joy were given value as they were rated
Isn't it ironic?
Greed is unlimited, freedom is a limited resource
Extra large for you means less for me
There'll be less for me

I banged the drums (Weiwu)
Court of hell (Weiwu)
Demanding a new trial (Weiwu)
You got the wrong head
Would you take mine instead, take mine instead?
Stop leading me on

World of titan allows me to live
Only in the mud down its feet
Though you're not with me, you're not with me
I'll never admit defeat
'Cause when I thought that every nice thing about me has become Canxiang

You showed me I still had an umbrella full of love inside me
Without you I could never be
So sincerely thank you for everything
It pains me to think
That my happiness turned out to be one of those fingers that strangled you until you couldn't breathe
Not ashamed to go this way
I just want to choose my fate
I'm on my last white rabbit Naitang

I am iron
In my blood it streams roots deep
With bruises on my knees, bruises on my knees
And ribs crushed down to pieces, crushed down to pieces
Nothing left to hold on

Actually wait
I do have one regret
That day before you left me
"You're my everything"
Before my thoughts began to speak
I bit my lip, said nothing
And just sucked on Maiyatang
