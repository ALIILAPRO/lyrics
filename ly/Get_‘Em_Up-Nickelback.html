		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His driver's license said James he went by Jim
A gangster wanna be and baby that was him
He stole his uncle's 44 last Friday night
Said if I wanted in we'd have to plan this thing just right
We'll need the gloves, we'll need the bags a couple masks
We'll need to steal a car with windows tinted black
He picked the nearest bank on main and 17th
We wrote down every line from every movie that we'd seen
Screamin'

This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more (yeah)
We want your cash open the safe get off the phone
Don't be a hero and you might just make it home
Get 'em up
Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Get 'em get 'em up

The fresh restored mustang small block 302
Drove by the bank a dozen times this afternoon
The only parking spot was half a bock away
Gave us time to practice just exactly what to say
Screamin'

This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more (yeah)
We want your cash open the safe get off the phone
Don't be a hero and you might just make it home
Get 'em up
Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Get 'em get 'em up
Get 'em get 'em up

The only thing I wish that one of us had known
That it was Sunday and the god damn bank was closed
Too bad we didn't see the cops across the street
We dropped our guns and tried
to run and there went all our dreams
Screamin'

This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more (yeah)
We wanted easy, straight and now we'll never know
Somebody call my mom and tell her I ain't coming home
Get 'em up
Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Then get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
