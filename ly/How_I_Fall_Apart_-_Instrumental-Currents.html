		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All alone inside my head
All alone inside my head

To escape the thought of loneliness is to resist
There's no point to refuse this
Crawling toward something serious
I'm not trying to push you, I'm just too distant
Is this who you are? 'Cause it's not who I am
You can't make me change
I'm just a shell with no substance

Now I know that I'm all alone
And nobody will come to save me
This is how, how I fall apart
All alone with these nightmares in my head

In time the walls surround me
Decrepit fixtures on the shelf all fade from my memory
Trembling behind the mask
Devoid of anything resembling humanity

Always under pressure, I dissolve
Void in my vacancy
Buried underneath it all
In silence, I sink

Now I know that I'm all alone
And nobody will come to save me
This is how, how I fall apart
All alone with these nightmares in my head

All alone inside my head
All alone inside my head

I can't give myself to you further
For everything's so meaningless to me
I'll rip out your heart
'Cause that's all I'm good for
I can't be your shepherd if I'm lost

Now I know that I'm all alone
And nobody will come to save me
This is how, how I fall apart
All alone with these nightmares in my head

Now I know that I'm all alone
And nobody will come to save me
Now I know that I'm all alone
All alone with these nightmares in my head
