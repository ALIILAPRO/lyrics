		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)
There's something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are (where you are)
There's something missing in my heart
