		  (TeeDee, you f-)
If yuh mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out (Bugzy Malone)
If yuh vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out (ya kno')
If yuh hot, wile out, right or not, don't stop, wile out (2022)
Gwarn get deep, make a scene, wile out (Big TeeDee)
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him

If yuh mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out 
If yuh vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out 
If yuh hot, wile out, right or not, don't stop, wile out
Gwarn get deep, make a scene, wile out
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him
If he mad, wile out, go along good g-

No such thing as turnin' back right now
It's an attack right now
Everyting black right now
Don't get it twisted I've had to back mine out
Stack my P, stand my ground
King of the Nizzy, had to rep my town
Man tried but I kept my crown
It's, it's, it's, it's peak for these industry geeks
I'm a G from the streets, how you mean?
I spent Christmas shottin' off weed on a pedal bike scheme, how you mean?
I was livin' a nightmare, the nightmare turned to a dream
And all this 'cause I spat a quick cold sixteen and I told them to walk with me
But talk is cheap
I kept my word, I'm ten years deep
The G63's a dangerous Jeep
The Great British dream was made by me
Who smacked up the game like this independently?
I'm like a UK Jay-Z, and you can go and ask JD
I said you can go and ask JD
It's, it's, it's

If yuh mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out 
If yuh vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out 
If yuh hot, wile out, right or not, don't stop, wile out
Gwarn get deep, make a scene, wile out
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him
If yuh mad, wile out, go along good girl-

I said I'd get rich one day, I used my pain
Deep thinkin', I had to use my brain
I'm a made man see me in a plane Jane
The litty committee don't play no games
No, the litty committee don't play no games
No face no case if I have to set pace

I never thought I'd reach my goals
When I was hustlin' in the cold
I had to walk that lonely road
And then I came up out of nowhere (nobody pit bull gets it, wile out)
Came up out of nowhere
Came up out of nowhere
I never thought I'd reach my goals
When I was hustlin' in the cold
I had to walk that lonely road
And then I came up out of nowhere
Nowhere
Came up out of nowhere
Came up out of no-

And then I came up out of nowhere

If yuh mad, wile out, go along good girl wile out 
If yuh vexed, wile out, nobody pit bull gets it, wile out 
If yuh hot, wile out, right or not, don't stop, wile out
Gwarn get deep, make a scene, wile out
And then embarrass them, gon' scream and shout, tell him
