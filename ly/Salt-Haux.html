		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tight lipped 
At the salt lakes
The birds sing 
But the heart aches
Wading 
In the shallows
As he watched you 
From the shadows

You can't be lost 
If you can't be found
You can be hurt 
If you don't make a sound
You can't be lost
If you can't be found
You can get hurt 
If you don't make a sound

Fading 
In the corners of your eyes
So you dive deep 
But you can't hide

You can't be lost 
If you can't be found
You can be hurt 
If you don't make a sound
You can't be lost
If you can't be found
You can get hurt 
If you don't make a sound

So please don't wait 
To ask me if I'd walk you home
So please don't wait 
'Cause I'd prefer to be alone
'Cause I'd prefer to be alone
Yes, I'd prefer to be
Yes, I'd prefer to be
Yes, I'd prefer to be alone

Salt sands 
From the bottom of the lakes
Stayed with you
Now it's falling down your face
