		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must be a criminal (Yo)
Keep your talkin' minimal (Yo)
'Cause most of it's subliminal (Yo)
And it'll put you in a critical (Yo, yo)
Used to be invisible (Yo)
They would refer to me as mythical (Yo)
Sippin' on Mastika, yeah, I sip it slow (Yo)
Not on my level, not on your tippy-toes (Yo)
Walk in the bank and I yell, "Gimme those" (Yo)
Hot as a stove, yeah, I'm wearin' Fendi clothes (Yo)
I'm want my spot, yeah, look at Wendy nose (Yo)
My niggas eatin', they gettin' minerals (Yo)
If you throw shots, then you know my men'll roll (Yo)
Up on your block, now you lookin' pitiful (Yo)
Tinted the windows, I need a minute, yo (Yo)
I'll leave your missus all mad and miserable (Go)
You picked the wrong time to pick a fight
Your bitch a dyke, she think she Ike
You sippin' on a drink that's spiked
Enough for you to say goodnight
For the rest of your life
I know your sons won't miss you
I did a favor for them niggas
Took a loss to a winner
Rick Ross, you been dinner
You ain't fly, I make your wings stop
I'm real as fuck and your ring's not
Fresh as hell like a king's socks
Your real car is a slingshot
Don't need a gun, I use a slingshot
If I was a beverage
You would have to drink hot

Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Yo, yo)
Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Yo)
Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Yo)
Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Go)

Havin' flashbacks, where yo' past at?
Where the cash at? Ayo, pass that
I will stab backs just for bags, racks
Front on me and I'll punch yo' ass flat
Are you okay? Please don't ask that
I don't act black, got a fat cat
You a rat-rat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat-a-tat-tat
Tattoos, but you can't see 'em
Ice cold, yeah, I'm goin' skiin'
I get around at the coliseum
Used to roam around with no pot to pee in
I was pissed off
Get away with murder like Kristof
You get criss-crossed in the big loft
I'm a big boss
So much sauce, I drip broth
The wait is over, I'm takin' over (Yo)
You're overweight, you ate a soda (Yo)
I'm super sober, you doin' coke (Yo)
Coca-Cola (Yo, yo)
Ahead of you, like a closure (Yo)
When Troy died, I had to find some closure (Yo)
Don't push me, bitch, I am not a stroller (Yo)
Pop off on a nigga like bread in toaster (Yo)
Double D-cup, you should use a coaster (Yo)
I'm on the post, I need the deal like kosher (Yo)
So I shop it over, blue faces (Yo)
And I call 'em Grovers (Yo)
Butter pecan Rover, I'm that odor (Yo)
Wanna be like me when I get older (Yo)
Talked to God, then he came over (Yo)
Talked to God, then he came over (Yo)

Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Yo, yo)
Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Yo)
Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Yo)
Got a job I gotta do (Yo)
I get down and dirty, too (Yo)
What it is? What it do? (Yo)
Same shit, nothin' new (Go)
