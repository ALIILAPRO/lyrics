		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every single day you say you wanna run away
What you scared to face, just another embrace
I won't take this anymore
I won't take this anymore
Everything you say just keeps you running in your place
Death wins the race, just another embrace
I can't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore

Every single day you say you wanna run away
What you scared to face, just another embrace
I won't take this anymore
I won't take this anymore
Everything you say just keeps you running in your place
Death wins the race, just another embrace
I can't take this anymore
I can't take it anymore

Every game you play leads you further astray
Pain leads the way but you blame me today
Asking me to play or to pay with no shame
Amazing, it's driving me crazy

Every single day you say you wanna run away
What you scared to face, just another embrace
I won't take this anymore
I won't take this anymore
Everything you say just keeps you running in your place
Death wins the race, just another embrace
I can't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore

Every single day you say you wanna run away
What you scared to face, just another embrace
I won't take this anymore
I won't take this anymore
Everything you say just keeps you running in your place
Death wins the race, just another embrace
I can't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
