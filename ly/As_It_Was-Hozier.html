		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a roadway, muddy and foxgloved
Never I'd had life enough
My heart is screaming out
And in a few days I would be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me is yours just as it was

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The love, the dark, the light, the flame

The eyes at the heights of my baby
Let's hope at the fight of my baby
The lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

And tell me if somehow some of it remained
How long you would wait for me?
How long I've been away?
The shape that I'm in now is shaping the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Just tell me about your day

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drugs, the dark, the light, the shame

Eyes at the hights of my baby
And this hope at the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold was as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
Half as beautiful too
