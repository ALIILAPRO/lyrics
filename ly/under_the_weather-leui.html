		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the rain drips down on our faces
I feel alive
The way your smile is so contagious
Makes me cry
Raincloud's all over the sky
You'll always be my light

When I get bored I look at the photos that you left
Heard once before you were with another man that's better
Can't stand this shitty weather
Why'd you send me those letters

When the rain drips down on our faces
I feel alive
The way your smile is so contagious
Makes me cry
Raincloud's all over the sky
You'll always be my light
It's just you and I
You'll always be my light
