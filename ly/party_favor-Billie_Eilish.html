		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, leave a message

Hey, call me back when you get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

"Stay" and, "blah, blah, blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha', babe?
I'm not your party favor

Look, now I know, we could've done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

You hear, "Stay" and, "blah, blah, blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha', babe?
I'm not your party favor
