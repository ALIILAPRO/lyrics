		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought that I would be me here on my own
I had to delete all your pictures out my phone
But I really want you closer
Still I had to cut you off like I don't know ya
'Cause it's over

Never thought that I would be me here on my own
I had to delete all your pictures out my phone
But I really want you closer
Still I had to cut you off like I don't know ya
'Cause it's over

Ne-ne-never thought that I'd still have you on my mind
Still you got me thinking 'bout you all the time
Yeah, I really want you closer
Still I had to cut you off like I don't know ya
'Cause it's over (over, over)

Never thought that I would be me here on my own
I had to delete all your pictures out my phone
But I really want you closer
Still I had to cut you off like I don't know ya
'Cause it's over

Ne-ne-never thought that I'd still have you on my mind
Still you got me thinking 'bout you all the time
Yeah, I really want you closer
Still I had to cut you off like I don't know ya

New me, who's she?
Got the bassline kickin' like we Bruce lee
Plus a new ting chattin' 'bout she wanna do me
But I had to swerve that 'cause I just wanna do me
I gotta level up
Always moving and I'm never stuck
See me kiss the trophy, pick my medal up
Always getting better, look, I don't need no better luck
'Cause I'm gone now, backs a direction that I'll never look

Never thought that I would be me here on my own
I had to delete all your pictures out my phone
But I really want you closer
Still I had to cut you off like I don't know ya 
'Cause it's over

Never thought that I'd still have you on my mind
Still you got me thinking 'bout you all the time
Yeah, I really want you closer
Still I had to cut you off like I don't know ya
'Cause it's over
