		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension

It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile
It's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you
You
And only you
Got me
Daydreaming, with my chin in the palm of my hands
About you
You
And only you

For you oh oh oh
For you oh oh oh
For you oh oh oh
For you oh oh

Now I can't wait
To hold you in my arms
I know I was made for you
I'm in love with all your charm

It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile
It's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you
You
And only you
Got me
Daydreaming, with my chin in the palm of my hands
About you
You
And only you

But I want you
Got to have you
And I need you
Like I never have loved you before

Oh I want you
Ooh I need you
Got to have you
Like I never have loved you before

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you
You
And only you
Got me
Daydreaming, with my chin in the palm of my hands
About you
You
And only you

For you oh oh oh
For you oh oh oh
For you oh oh oh
For you oh oh
