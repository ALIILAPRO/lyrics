		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Polaroid of you dancin' in my room
I want to remember, I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands, in my hands

And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you

I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinkin' 'bout the fool that I was, I was such a fool
I'm alone now but it's better for me
I don't need all your negativity

And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll never make you blue
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
