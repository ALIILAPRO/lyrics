		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I knew this would happen to you
Inside I did, but I refused to know the truth
I'm headin' back inside to sit at home with you
I think I know what's wrong

My friends put on their bravest face
Their tails between their legs, something's out of place
I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face
Keep your mouth zipped, son

Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on
I was at the end of every tether waitin' for what once was

(Ooh)
(Ooh-ooh)

Tell me all the important stuff
What's your favorite color, what makes you so tough?
Please don't let go when you've had enough
I'm on my knees

Baby, I've been here before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was

(Ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh)

Baby, I've been there before
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone
And now I'm still hangin' on
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was

Waitin' for my love
Waitin' for

(Ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh)
