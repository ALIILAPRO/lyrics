		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't find my way back home
Since I fell down this rabbit hole
I love you so, but I had to go
To find something of my own
I see their patterns in my mind
Anxious designs of the darkest kind
And piece together the cruelest clue
To paint a portrait to capture you

I must guide my love through the night
I see what's coming, it's coming into light
Mother's a seer with second sight
The meaning behind this violent rite

I follow you into the dark, I follow you into the dark, dark, dark
I follow you into the dark, I follow you into the dark, dark, dark (dark)
I follow you into the dark, I follow you into the dark, dark, dark
I follow you into the dark, I follow you into the dark, dark, dark (dark, dark)

Follow the deer to follow the owl
I'm fighting to save my love somehow
I cannot feel her by my side
Even in this place inside my mind
I see their patterns in my mind
Anxious designs of the darkest kind
And piece together the cruelest clue
To paint a portrait to capture you

Carve the secrets from your bruised still heart
Shape my story, tear every page apart
Inside this room, you left your mark
I burn away the shadows, I strike a spark

I follow you into the dark
I follow you into the dark, dark, dark
I follow you into the dark
I follow you into the dark, dark, dark, dark
I follow you into the dark
I follow you into the dark, dark, dark
I follow you into the dark
I follow you into the dark, dark, dark, dark (dark)
