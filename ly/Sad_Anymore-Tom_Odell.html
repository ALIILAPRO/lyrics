		  Mm-mm, oh

I don't wanna be sad anymore
I don't wanna be sad anymore
Don't wanna be sad anymore
I don't wanna be sad anymore

Look at all the happy people
Look at all the happy people, baby, yeah
Look at all the happy people
What are they doing that I ain't doing?

I don't wanna be sad anymore
I don't wanna be sad anymore
Don't wanna be sad anymore, nah, nah, no
I don't wanna be sad anymore

I don't wanna be sad anymore
I don't wanna be sad anymore
Don't wanna be sad anymore
Don't wanna be sad anymore

Look at all the happy people
Yeah, look at all the happy people
Yeah, look at all the happy people
What are they doing that I ain't doing?

Baby, yeah, look at all the happy people
Look at all the happy people
Look at all the happy people
Look at all the happy people

Baby, I don't wanna be sad anymore (what a waste)
I don't wanna be sad anymore (what a waste)
I don't wanna be sad anymore (what a waste)
I'm not gonna be sad anymore
