		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Tell me baby in the night do you think of me
When you open up your eyes am I there
Are you standing by my window when I'm asleep
Are you quiet when you know that I'm near

You know I love you, you thought I would leave you
But baby I got you still
You think you want to be by yourself, don't you
But baby you never will

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is, I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit and miss, we're both going to get hurt
If this is love

If this is love, yeah yeah

Are you picturing me lying across your bed
Are you thinking you were wrong to hurt me
I forgive you, I'll forget everything you said
You will love and you will not desert me

You think you're crazy, I'm not I'm your baby
I promise I'll always be
You think eventually this too will pass
But I promise I'll never leave

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is, I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit and miss, we're both going to get hurt
If this is love

If this is love, if this is love

Baby, baby if this is love
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Baby, baby if this is love
I will not accept it, I will not

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is, I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit and miss, we're both going to get hurt
If this is love

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is, I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit and miss, we're both going to get hurt
If this is love

If this is love, if this is love

Yeah
