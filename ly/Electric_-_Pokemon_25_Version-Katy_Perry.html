		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Electric

In the dark, when you feel lost
Wanna be the best, but at what cost?
If you're gonna stay here
Nothing's ever changing, no
Big world, gotta see it all
Gotta get up even when you fall
There's no point in waiting, no

Oh
They'll try to bring you down
Oh
But you've got the power now

I know you feel it (feel it)
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric (yeah)

Long road, got a ways to go
Took a big step, but you're not alone
'Cause we got each other
There's so much you'll discover
Headstrong, but your heart is stronger
Stay calm walking through the fire
I know you're gonna make it out

Oh
They'll try to bring you down
Oh
But you've got the power now

I know you feel it, feel it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric

Oh
They'll try to bring you down
Oh
You're electric right now (electric)
Oh
But you've got the power now
Oh
You've got the power now

Electric
You've got the power now

Whoa-oh yeah, yeah

I know you feel it, feel it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it (oh, I can see it)
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric

Oh
They'll try to bring you down
Oh
You're electric right now (electric)
Oh
But you've got the power now
Oh
You've got the power now

You've got the power now
