		  Fuck this club up

Ayo 
I tell 'em that I'm the Sleeze, they tellin' me, "Okay, prove it"
I leave these bitches on read, so they know that they blew it
I tell 'em I'm movin' units, my videos, they gon' view it
Spotify ain't gotta lie, they really streamin' my music (woo)
I give bitches the crown, they fuck around and lose it, nah
I am the wave, I only wave when I'm tellin' 'em, "Bye"
Bitch, we ain't twinnin', ain't fraternal or identical
When I'm around, bitch, you know you become invisible

Mm, who wanna play with Nicki?
Got the power, I could tell my niggas spray like 50 (brrt)
Come on, bitch, I just put a milli' on my Richie
Minus like fifty, mine was nine-fifty, sissy

Fuck this club up
Fuck this, fuck this club up (fuck it)
Fuck this club up
Fuck this, fuck this club up (fuck it)
Fuck this club up
Fuck this, fuck this club up (fuck it)
Fuck this club up
Fuck this, fuck this club up (fuck it)

Yeah, high heels on my tippies
Dolce and Gabbana, that's on my titties
Pop me Vetamins when I ride the dickie
I still got the juice, bitch, buy a sippie
I will never slippy, like a Mickey
Stay in your Tory lane bitch, I'm not Iggy
I know that these niggas tryna bang like Chiddy
I am such a catch, nigga, throw in ya mitty
Uh 

Who wanna play with Nicki?
Got the power, I could tell my niggas spray like 50 
Distribute about a million dollars, word to brickies
Told 'em to keep fifty, my cut nine-fifty, bitchy

Mmm, give me my tens
Give me, give me my tens
Give me my tens
Then take away two 
I ate, I win
Mmm, give me my tens
Give me, give me my tens
Give me my tens
Then take away two
I ate it up again
