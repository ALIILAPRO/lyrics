		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways I want to say "I love you"
Let me hold you in my arms forevermore

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And, oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song?

Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever, let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes, I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh, yes, I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

Lady, your love's the only love I need
And beside me is where I want you to be
'Cause, my love, there's somethin' I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady
