		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

You left your hair tie, batten those eyes
By the sink, you leave 'em behind, I think I know why
I'm just looking for the answer
When's the next time I'll expect ya?

You gotta remind me with some nerve
Tell me that we gotta rewind before we're both hurt
You still got my dirty sneakers
Oh, baby, fuck it, it's whatever

Watch you hit my phone (tell me how you dressed)
Act like you made of stone (but I know you the best)
Know how this plays, you're on your way
Can't stay too late, you'll always say

I got you on my brain
The shit you pull is really driving me insane
Been trying my best, ok, damn
Ain't getting no rest, look at you playing (ohh)

I got you on my brain
The shit you pull is really driving me insane
Been trying my best, ok, damn
Ain't getting no rest, look at you playing (ohh)

We back to baseline, it just took time
For you to call me often, Facetime, tensions keep rising
I'll pretend to pay it no mind (no mind, no mind)
Got me fucked up my whole night

Watch you hit my phone (tell me how you dressed)
Act like you made of stone (but I know you the best)
Know how this plays, you're on your way
Can't stay too late, you'll always say

I got you on my brain (on my brain)
The shit you pull is really driving me insane (me insane)
Been trying my best, ok, damn
Ain't getting no rest, look at you playing (ohh)

I got you on my brain
The shit you pull is really driving me insane
Been trying my best, ok, damn (trying my best, trying my best)
Ain't getting no rest, look at you playing (ohh)

On my brain, on my brain
Yeah, you drive me insane, me insane
Baby, I'm trying me best to keep myself awake
