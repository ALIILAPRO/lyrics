		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So run
Right, right back to school
Check it

Look back I sift through all the cliques
Roaming the halls all year, making me sick
While everyone's out tryin to make the cut, what?
And when you think you know me right I switch it up
Behind the walls smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
I hop a fence to catch a cab, ain't no one can stop us
Give me a break about some other mess
What were you? Act like it's everything you got

Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all, so

Stop that, quit, all that, quit
Who ruined it? You did, now grab a notebook and a pen
Start taking notes on me and everyone who's on the top
You think we're on the same page but I know we're not
I'll be the man, watch your backpacks, pens and pencils
Just like Keith, I'm flippin it while you just keep it simple
You just can't go on rocking' the clothes, coppin' the stance
'Cause really it's everything that you're not

Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all, so

Transpose, or stop your lies
It's what you do
Transpose, or stop your lies
So run

So why don't you run, so why don't you run
So why don't you run back to school
So why don't you run, so why don't you run

'Cause all you are, now I'm on the next page
All you are, it's time to close the book up
All you are, yeah, I'm on the next page
All you are, close the book up now

Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all

We are, we are the leaders of all
We are, we are the leaders of all 

So run
So why don't you run, so why don't you run 
So why don't you run back to school
So why don't you rush, so why don't you run
