		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drink with me to days gone by
Sing with me the songs we knew

Here's to pretty girls who went to our heads
Here's to witty girls who went to our beds
Here's to them and here's to you!

Drink with me to days gone by
To the life that used to be
At the shrine of friendship, never say die
Let the wine of friendship never run dry

Drink with me to days gone by
To the life that used to be
At the shrine of friendship, never say die
Let the wine of friendship never run dry

Here's to you
And here's To me 

Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea?
Life without Cosette means nothing at all
Would you weep, Cosette, should Mmarius fall?
Will you weep, Cosette
For me?
