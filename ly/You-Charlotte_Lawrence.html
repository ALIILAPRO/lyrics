		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go ahead, you can say it's my fault
Doesn't really matter at all
Ticking time bomb, watch it explode
It's not like we could stop it at all
Hold me closer, I'm your virgin
Only God can save us now
Go ahead, you can say it's my fault
It doesn't really matter

It's you, and all the things you do
I know it could be anybody
It should be anybody else
Loving you makes me hate you too
I know it could be anybody
It should be anybody else

But it's you, you
You, you
You, you, love

Waking up still wearing my clothes
You take a little piece of me home
When my mom says, "Where'd you get those?"
Just laugh and say, "You don't wanna know"
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Only God can save us now
Go to bed still wearing my clothes
Pretend it doesn't matter

It's you, and all the things you do
I know it could be anybody
It should be anybody else
Loving you makes me hate you too
I know it could be anybody
It should be anybody else

But it's you, you
You, you
You, you, love
But it's you, you
You, you
You, you, love

I'll try acting crazy
Knowin' that you'll save me
Laugh it off and take me home
Caught you saying, "Baby"
Something's different, lately
It's better if it's left alone

'Cause it's you, and all the things you do
I know it could be anybody
It should be anybody else
Loving you makes me hate you too
I know it could be anybody
It should be anybody else

But it's you, you
You, you
You, you, love
But it's you, you
You, you
You, you, love
Oh
