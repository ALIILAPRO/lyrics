		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her skin glowed green and blue
The starry sky dimmed by fiery hues
My white dress blew in midnight's view
Of the world reborn, begun anew

Two thousand years and twenty more
And she looked beautiful as ever before
As she pushed me down into the warm
Water deep below my clothes were torn

Lilith you siren
How could you do this to me?
Lilith I'm dyin'
Why won't you set me free?

I tried to scream but lilies clouded my mind
The petals softly floating into my eyes
I felt your fingers slowly crawl up my spine
We didn't have to sink for you to be mine

Her eyes were as red as dawn
As she held me down under the pond
Fireworks filled the sky beyond
I heard the cheers from above the lawn

Soft hands brushed through my thighs
You were evil everyone else had realized
Thought I was different thought I'd save your soul
Guess you can't save what isn't half of a whole

Lilith you siren
How could you do this to me?
Lilith I'm dyin'
Why won't you set me free?

I tried to scream but lilies clouded my mind
The petals softly floating into my eyes
I felt your hands as they wrapped around my neck
When did our love become this shallow shipwreck?

Two thousand years and twenty more and I thought I was weaker than I ever was before
But the moonlight's rays hit the water below and it was now or never to swim to the garden and oh,
Did she push and pull tryin' to get me to drown
But the lilies in my mind began to run aground
As I gripped and dragged myself along the dirt I turned back to face the girl I loved for all of my hurt
Said "my dear this is it, I have got to go"
And she faded in the deep and murky water below

Lilith you siren
How could you do this to me?
Lilith I'm cryin'
My pain will stay with me
Lilith you siren
You were so cruel and so mean
Lilith I'm tryin'
To love life now that I'm free
