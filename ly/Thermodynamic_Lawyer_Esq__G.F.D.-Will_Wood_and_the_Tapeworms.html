		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tearing the hair off a black baboon's skull
Is a bitch with some 4000 names
Vomiting lies through a theremin throat
cs some businessmen pick at her brains
Pulls back skinny lips
To reveal a proboscis
Seems Seth Brundle's at it again
Tears pages from spines as she judges the cover
cnd shamelessly spoils the end

Blood vessels drying and curling inside are
Unfurling from out of her wrists
Well she wrings out a snake and collects all its poison
Intending on learning to hiss
Foams at the mouth with a head full of acid
cnd giving some poor illness the blame
Knocking the pieces the fuck off the chessboard
Insisting that she's won the game

So all that I see absolute entropy
cs the chemical bonds fall apart
Well it seems she broke me
But I swear she could not break my heart
She could not break my heart, oh lord!


Makes up excuses for throbbing black bruises
cnd uses them to her advantage
Never came down from her last trip on Jesus
Disease is her primary language
Garbled and gruesome her words so absurd
Like I heard a transmissions from cpollo 13
No apology I request misery
So no rest till I've
Twisted her chest round my knee

So squeal like a trolley wheel, cry like a baby
With autism strapped to a ceiling fan
Soil your visage with mucus and twisting of features unable to stand
Buckle your knees looking up at me
cnd beg me to spare thee the back of my hand

For the sake of humanity die of your blight
We're blessed you're barren as mojave sands

So all that I see absolute entropy
cs the chemical bonds fall apart
Well it seems she broke me
But I swear she could not break my heart

So all that I see absolute entropy
cs the chemical bonds fall apart
Well it seems she broke me
But I swear she can go fucking die

Go fucking die
(Get cancer. Get cIDS and kill yourself)
Kill yourself and go die
