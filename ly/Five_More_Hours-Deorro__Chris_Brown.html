		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you wanna do baby?
Where you wanna go?
I'll take you to the moon baby
I'll take you to the floor
I'll treat you like a real lady
No matter where you go
Just give me some time baby, as you know

Even when we're apart
I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours till the night is ours and I'm in bed with you

This right here is my type of party
Five more hours, we're just getting started
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours, we're just getting started
(Five more hours, we're just getting started)

How you wanna feel baby?
What you wanna know?
Just pour another drink baby
Come on pour a little more
I'll treat you like a real lady
I'll keep you out the cold
I'll give you all my time baby, you know

Even when we're apart
I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours till the night is ours and I'm in bed with you

This is yeah
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours, we're just getting started

This right here is my type of party
(You know this is my type of party)
Five more hours, we're just getting started
Five more hours, we're just getting started

Just getting started

I follow the sound of your heartbeat
How it always calls me
Finding my way back to you
I'm feeling it more now than ever
I'll do this forever
Just to spend a night with you

This is yeah
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours, we're just getting started

This right here is my type of party
Five more hours, we're just getting started
(Five more hours, we're just getting started)
