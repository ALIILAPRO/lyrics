		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Bad bitches is the
(Mike WiLL Made-It) yeah

I don't got no type (nah)
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like (woo)
You ain't got no life (nah)
Cups with the ice and we do this every night (hey)
I ain't check the price (I got it)
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like (woo)
I'm just living life (hey, hey)
And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right (nope) (leanin')

Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse (hey, hey)
Extendo long as an extension cord (damn, cord)
Bitch, I ball like Jordan (Jordan)
And I play full court (I play full court)
And if you not my type then you know I got to keep this shit short
(Gotta keep this shit short with you, ayy)
What you know about a check? What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg? (Hey)
Why you wanna go flex like you all in the mix
Like you got some shit popping off? (Hey)
I got some models that you see up in the movies
And they want to make a flick for the camera (yeah?)
Wanna be Kim Kardashian (hey), heard I was living like a bachelor (woo)

I don't got no type (nah)
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like (woo)
You ain't got no life (nah)
Cups with the ice and we do this every night (hey)
I ain't check the price (I got it)
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like (woo)
I'm just living life (hey, hey)
And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right (nope)

Spend it how I like (yeah)
Sinning every night (yeah)
Push start the whip (hey)
Brought it straight to life (come to life)
Blowing on the Kush (blowing)
'Til I'm out of sight (I'm gone)
I don't check the price (bitch)
All I do is swipe (woo)
She say, "whats your type?" (Yeah)
I said, "I like what I like" (yeah)
I don't second guess (nah)
I just roll the dice (keep it movin')
Keep your two cents (hey)
Take your own advice (hey)
I've been living life (yeah)
Like I live twice

I don't got no type (nah)
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like (woo)
You ain't got no life (nah)
Cups with the ice and we do this every night (hey)
I ain't check the price (I got it)
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like (woo)
I'm just living life (hey, hey)
And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right (nope)

I don't got no type
I don't got no type
And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right
