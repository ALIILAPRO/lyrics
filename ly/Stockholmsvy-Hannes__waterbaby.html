		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be honest
I'll be honest for you, yeah yeah, yeah
And if we're talking
I'm gon' tell you the truth, yeah

You and me 
Made a lover of an enemy, yeah
Stockholmsvy
We're gonna make a memory

'Cuz you've been on the westside 
Showing 'em your best side
You've been wearing new 
Jeans and shoes
While I've been living less life
Sleepless get no rest nights 
Thinking 'bout us 
And how I do

You and me 
Made a lover of an enemy (yeah), yeah
Stockholmsvy
We're gonna make a memory (memory)

Okay
Do you remember when she lied to you? (I do)
Remember how she almost fooled me too? (I do)
You could do better I mean honestly (I could)
This is your city it's your Stockholmsvy
Light rain, izzy veins, diamonds on my face
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
You say you wanna go I wanna stay
Baby it's okay
Yeah, I'm okay by myself

You and me 
Made a lover of an enemy (yeah)
Stockholmsvy
We're gonna make a memory
