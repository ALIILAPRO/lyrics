		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the sons of Odin
Fire blood and steel
Kings of heavy metal
Fire blood and steel
We're brave, we raid, we're mad men
Brothers of heavy metal
Guardians of war

On the battlefield we are but one
Side by side, blood by blood
Dual-wield, armor so strong
Crushing the enemy down to the ground

Every man, woman, child and unborn
hear my roar, feel my wrath
Fuck you all, we will prevail
We will splinter your skulls into toothpicks and grains

We will fuck you up, cause we're brothers of metal

We are the sons of Odin
Fire blood and steel
Kings of heavy metal
Fire blood and steel
We're brave, we raid, we're mad men
Fire blood and steel
Brothers of heavy metal
Guardians of war

On your deathbed you'll cry out in pain
Steal your steel, stole your steel
Swing your axe, swing every sword
In my eyes there's no fear to be found

Burning down everything in our path
No regrets, no remorse
Our steel will never get cold
For raging and raiding will never grow old

We are the sons of Odin
Fire blood and steel
Kings of heavy metal
Fire blood and steel
We're brave, we raid, we're mad men
Fire blood and steel
Brothers of heavy metal
Guardians of war
