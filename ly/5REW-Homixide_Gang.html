You know my gang on ride-or-die, you know that shit fo' sure
You know my gang on ride-or-die, you know my gang won't fold (what? Homixide)
I'm keeping that muhfuckin' chopper everywhere I go (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
I'm keeping that muhfuckin' chopper, I cannot go, uh
We rockin' in bih', rock and roll, uh
We poppin' that pick, and I move (what? Homixide)
We rockstar trappin' all day, everything goes

And we got fishscale, huh, sit on the stove
And we got fishscale, huh, go for the low (huh, huh)

You know that the way we do it, huh
You know that we snottin' some lil' kids, had boogers inside of our nose
And now we got diamonds, they frozen
We overseas sellin' out shows, huh
Gang on me, now I bring my nig' wherever I go
Four door Jeep, yeah, we ridin' in the Trackhawks, go zoom
Yeah, we got Russian sticks
Run up on me, shit, we gon' boom
My boy got a switch on that Glock, yeah, that bih' clear a room
Promotin' the violence, just do it
Homixide ready to do it

It's Homixide
Yeah, shawty wan' hit my phone, what it do? Yeah (what?)
She meet me at the club, yeah, around 'bout two (what?)
Yeah, walk in that bih' with my brew, what it do? Yeah (yeah)
We drippin' in fashion, you know how we do, yeah, yeah
Homixide, yeah, my crew, I been on my .32 pole, I
You know my gang on ride-or-die, you know that shit fo' sure
You know my gang on ride-or-die, you know my gang won't fold (what? Homixide)
I'm keeping that muhfuckin' chopper everywhere I go (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
I'm keeping that muhfuckin' chopper, I cannot go, uh
