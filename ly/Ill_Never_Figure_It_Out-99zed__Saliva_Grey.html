		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  187 do the most
Don't want nothing but the smoke
Now I'm back up off the coke
Lines are filling up my dome
I ain't sober no more
I feel the venom in my bones
It's so motherfuckin' cold
I wear my sorrow as a coat
I been tryna figure out how Imma end my fucking life
I been wasting everyday away don't see no fucking light
I be comatose I don't even wanna fucking write
Got the noose in my sight pull it really fucking tight
I be so damn dead
In the shed
Got manilla fulla bread
I'm gon' flex
Man that shit so wack
Fuck a check
I still got a fucking hole
In my chest oh yah
Posted with Saliva smoking dutches at the river mane
Milo pulling bitches like he be pulling them triggers mane
I popped up out the vent so they ain't know I was the killer mane
These bullets make him dance like Michael Jackson up in Thriller mane
I'm spaced out on the couch with the Xanax in my mouth
I'm popping double what they recommend while smoking on the loud hoe
All I ever wanted was to make my papa proud
And now I'm lying face down while I'm dying on the ground
Cause I'm a fuck up, a waste
I'm shoving pills up in my face
If you want to disappear then allow me to demonstrate
I'm chopping up a lot of cocaine imma sniff it off a plate
I got my hand around the barrel to my head I contemplate
I don't hesitate, I grab the .38
I'm cocking it back and blast in your motherfucking face
I'm fucked up smoking a wood up in my grave
My existence is over my name forever erased bitch
