		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fill my own gasoline
Spend my time, that ain't cheap
In my head, on repeat
Things you said, but didn't mean
It's a little pathetic, honestly
And I shouldn't let it get to me

Oh, why have I been letting you live
Rent free in my mind?
Why have I been letting you win
Even when I'm right
You're never there, you never cared
Baby why should I let you ruin my life?
I want you out tonight (oh)

Forgot your card, guess I'll pay
Apologies you've never made
I'm so tired of feeling this way
All you took, all I gave
It's a little pathetic, honestly
And I shouldn't let it get to me

Oh, why have I been letting you live
Rent free in my mind? (Rent free in my mind)
Why have I been letting you win
Even when I'm right (even when I'm right)
You're never there, you never cared
Baby why should I let you ruin my life?
I want you out tonight (oh)

I don't want to think about
How we might've had it all
I don't want to think about
Everywhere that we went wrong
I'm ready to live without you
I'm ready to move along

Why have I been letting you live
Rent free in my mind? (Rent free in my mind)
Why have I been letting you win
Even when I'm right (even when I'm right)
You're never there, you never cared
Baby why should I? Oh I
I want you out tonight
