		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when you'd sing, just for the fuck of it
Any joy it would bring
Honey, the look of it was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song 
And all its words wouldn't claim to feel the same 
We felt as the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of making noise that brought you joy?

You don't have to sing it right
Who could call you wrong?
You put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you find a little remedy, at worst the world will sing along

So honey sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing

Remember when you'd sing
Before we moved to it and we'd scuff up our shoes
Honey, the groove of it was whatever you choose
I wan't to be your lover, or the fishermen's blues
You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
You put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you find a little remedy, at worst the world will sing along

So honey sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing

Who could ask to be unbroken or be brave again?
Or honey hope even on this side of the grave again?
And who could ask it to be sound or to feel saved again?
Or stick around until you hear that music play again

So honey sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing
So honey sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing (For the love of it)
Sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing (For the love of it)
Remember when you'd sing, just for the love of it
Any joy it would bring
