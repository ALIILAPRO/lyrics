I've got the power
Hey, yeah!

Like the crack of the whip, I Snap attack
Front to back, in this thing called rap
Dig it like a shovel, rhyme devil on a heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble
Radical mind, day and night all the time
Seven, fourteen wise divine
Maniac brainiac, winning the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Gettin' kinda heavy

It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda heavy

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts (I've got the power)
Oh oh oh

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts (I've got the power)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic

Quality I possess, some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they are Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice will cease
So please, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts (I've got the power)
Oh oh oh

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts (I've got the power)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Quality I possess, some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they are Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice will cease
So please, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts (I've got the power)
Oh oh oh

I've got the power
