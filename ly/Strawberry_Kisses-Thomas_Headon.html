		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got her t-shirt hanging down
To her knees where she lays down
And though her eyes don't meet mine
Her body's on me all the time

She isn't scared to make a move
She's left her handbag by her shoes
And I didn't think that she would like me
But now she wants to call me baby

I didn't think I'd end up here
Giving me strawberry kisses
And I didn't think she'd make it clear
Yet, here's my strawberry kisses from her

Eyes open in the dark
I'm waiting for her make a mark
Although she likes to hear the silence
I'll say her name to make her mine (strawberry kisses)

Yeah, I've been waiting for her to call
And now I'm next to her with nothing on
She's lighting cigarettes and drinking more
And now it's getting late, we're moving on

I didn't think I'd end up here 
Giving me strawberry kisses
And I didn't think she'd make it clear
Yet, here's my strawberry kisses from her
Strawberry kisses

How long is all night if you stay here all night and
How long is all night if she'd make it clear 
Giving me strawberry kisses

I didn't think I'd end up here 
Giving me strawberry kisses
And I didn't think she'd make it clear
Yet, here's my strawberry kisses from her
Strawberry kisses
Here's my strawberry, strawberry kisses (strawberry kisses)
Yeah yeah
Strawberry kisses
Yet, here's my strawberry kisses from her
