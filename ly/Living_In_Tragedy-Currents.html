		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you might try to chase me
You'll never know what lies beneath
One'll rise, the others fall
We've come to face our grief

Rotten and vile from the inside out
Living in tragedy
One chance to break the elegy
One shot to clip the wings of catastrophe

We only wander in our place
Without a doubt, there's become a price to pay
The only martyr with the means
They'll never speak for me

When the darkness comes
I beg you don't follow me
Pull me out from all I've known
Let it swallow me
I'm done making my own nightmares

Yeah, we have come to wash away the greed
Blurred lines break down the fabric

It's time, you have no choice to leave
Hesitation leaves us defenseless
It's time, command lines are breaking
With everything I have, I will find them
It's time, command lines are breaking
With everything I have, I will find them
It's time, command lines are breaking
Death is the only answer
Hate is nothing to a king

Pierce through the vitals, make them bleed
Contrition void in violence
Destruction of the gods
Victory costs everything

When the darkness comes
I beg you don't follow me
Pull me out from all I've known
Let it swallow me
I'm done making my own nightmares

With wings now cut, we spiral down
We're left with nothing and you call this peace
Please don't follow me
I'm done making my own nightmares, go
