		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a ghost inside my dreams
Calling my name 
I shiver as it speaks 

It draws me in
It's pitch black
I'm on a dark path in life
I have never been here before
Never been this far from the light

I need to find my way out
Can you be my light?
Lost myself in the dark
I cannot find the way out
Oh, this life is a maze
I'm unable to solve
Can you be my light

It takes me deeper and deeper
I'm falling faster and faster

I'm losing layer by layer 
My life is wasted, I'm weaker  
How am I supposed to recover
I'm losing grip, have no power

I need to find my way out
Can you be my light?
Lost myself in the dark
I cannot find the way out
Oh, this life is a maze
I'm afraid to solve
Can you be my light
