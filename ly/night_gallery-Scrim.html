		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)

Yeah, I've been on them drugs, I've been on the edge (edge)
Yeah, I feel like I'm dying, I feel like I'm dead (like I'm, like I'm, ayy)
Yeah, way too many percs, I can't feel nothing (yeah)
Yeah, maybe off this X I might feel something
Yeah, looking at the time like, "Where did it go?" (Go, go)
Yeah, tryna figure out what I'll never know (what I'll never know)
Will I empty out this clip or I overdose? (Will I overdose?)
Either way I'm 'bout to let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Lookin' at my bitch like, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Yeah, all this fuckin' money, it don't mean nothing (it don't mean)
Yeah, all this fuckin' money, just to mean something
Yeah, life passin' by at the speed of light (let's go)
Yeah, life passin' by, was it worth the price? (Was it?)

Yeah, searching all my life for the motherfucking wrong thing
Hoping it's the dopeman every time the phone ring (phone ring)
Sick of picking up the phone gang
I've been going somewhere, but it prolly won't be home, mane
(Okay, okay, okay, okay)
Yeah, pray for my mama, she losing her mind, yeah
Yeah, pray for my daddy he hopin' to die
Yeah, off of that addy, I'm off of that speed (speed)
All of that money it come wit' the greed
Full of that pain and I know what I need (I need)
I need that, dirty cup (cup)
Fuck it, fill it up (fill it)
I don't wanna hear sh-
I don't wanna hear nothing (don't wanna hear it)
I don't wanna feel shit
Looking for the kill switch
Only here 'cause them pills they help me live, bitch (let's go, let's go, let's go)
How could they understand with the world in my hands?
Can't even go outside and be just another man
Every girl I tend to meet, just another fan
Every girl I tend to leave with a hundred grand
Yeah, think I done found it with Sage, thinkin' 'bout marrying her too (my baby)
Yeah, just tell me that you're gonna stay, can't take you hurting me too (can't take it)
Yeah, sippin' on Fent with the water, wish it was hitting me harder (hit me harder)
Yeah, looking my dad in the eyes, but I still missing my father (missing my dad)
Yeah whipping that Rolls like I care, lookin' like I need a prayer (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, paint him up like he need Behr, then stain whoever his heir
Yeah, riding 'round when I'm impaired, feelin' like Steven McNair
Huh, tuning myself like I'm Cher, I put my soul in the air (yeah)

Life's passin' by at the speed of light
Yeah, life's passin' by, was it worth the price?

Yeah, I've been on them drugs, I've been on the edge (on the edge)
Yeah, I feel like I'm dying, I feel like I'm dead (like I'm dead)
Yeah, way too many percs, I can't feel nothing (I can't feel it)
Yeah, maybe off this X I might feel something
Yeah, looking at the time like, "Where did it go?" (Where did it go?)
Yeah, tryna figure out what I'll never know (what I'll never know)
Will I empty out this clip or I overdose? (Will I overdose?)
Either way I'm 'bout to let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Lookin' at my bitch like, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Yeah, all this fuckin' money, it don't mean nothing (it don't mean it)
Yeah, all this fuckin' money, just to mean something (just to mean it)
Yeah, life passin' by at the speed of light (at the speed of ligh)
Yeah, life passin' by, was it worth the price? (Was it?)

(It's a smash)
