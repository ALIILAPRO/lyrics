		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a cold December
You're almost here
I still remember
The first day of the year
When we

Kissed goodbye
And we thanked our lucky star
No nothing lasts forever
Like snowflakes in a jar

Cold cold nights
And I wonder where you are

Oh how I miss you
As days go by
Can't wait for Christmas time
When you come home
Where the heart is
In these arms of mine
Where would I be without you
I can't wait for Christmas time
I can't wait for Christmas time
I can't wait for Christmas time

Crystals on the window
Frozen city lights
Moonlight casts a shadow
In this starry starry night

Now I'm spending my time, counting the days
'Til we can talk all night around the fireplace
It's been a long time coming
You and I, we're close to Christmas time, mmhmm

Oh how I miss you
As days go by
Can't wait for Christmas time
When you come home
Where the heart is
In these arms of mine
Where would I be without you
I can't wait for Christmas time
I can't wait for Christmas time
Can't wait for Christmas time

Oh how I miss you
As days go by
Where would I be without you
I can't wait for Christmas time
