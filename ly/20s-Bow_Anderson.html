		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go out, get drink, be young and reckless
Show up for work, don't skip your breakfast
A functional member of society
Is that what you want from me?
Call up my mom, see how she's doing
Tell her I'm good, who am I fooling?
Got too many new responsibilities
Don't know what you want from me

'Cause I'm just guessing, overstressing
I'm way out of my depth

Only got until I'm 29
To figure out what I'ma do with my life
At 25, I'm sleeping on my friend's couch
At 21, my parents bought their first house
I miss the feeling on my 19th birthday
Before the world became so goddamn heavy
'Cause no one told me life would be messy
It's all so scary in your 20s

My friends back home stayed in the city
Now they're engaged talking about babies
And I can't even get a boy to text me back
What the fuck is up with that? (What the fuck?)
Leaving the club, sobering up, falling in love again
Every day's never the same, I wouldn't change for nothing
I'm just tryna figure all my problems out
Excuse me while I think out loud

'Cause I'm just guessing, overstressing
I'm way out of my depth

Only got until I'm 29
To figure out what I'ma do with my life
At 25, I'm sleeping on my friend's couch
At 21, my parents bought their first house
I miss the feeling on my 19th birthday
Before the world became so goddamn heavy
'Cause no one told me life would be messy
It's all so scary in your 20s

Getting drunk, better party in your 20s
It's all about making money in your 20s
But I don't feel like a grownup in my 20s
In your 20s
I only got until the end of this song
To figure out just what I'm doing wrong
'Cause no one told me life would be messy
It's all so scary

Only got until I'm 29 (29)
To figure out what I'ma do with my life (do with my life)
At 25, I'm sleeping on my friend's couch (sleeping on)
At 21, my parents bought their first house(ooh, ah)
I miss the feeling on my 19th birthday
Before the world became so goddamn heavy
'Cause no one told me life would be messy (no one told me life would be)
It's all so scary in your 20s
