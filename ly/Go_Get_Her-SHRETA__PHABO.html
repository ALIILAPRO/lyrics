		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Body so neat,
I got nothing underneath, dress
But I like to wear my motive, 
Is that something you can get behind, 
Behind? 
Ten fingers on the wheel, 
Make it 5, 
Let you ride the prettiest ride, 
No title but I like to test drive 


Heading to the party 
I want your body 
Top down on sunset driving 
We can take a detour back to...
Back to my place 
Leather seats crème like chocolate 
Know you got time 
We can really get into It 


Go go go get her 
Do you think you can fit her? 
Light drunk, brown liquor 
Waste no time 
Go go go go go go get her now 



You gon make my miss my exit in this car 
Cruisin all on your body
Feels so good to get naughty 
You ain't gotta make this a big production 
We ain't even gotta go to the function 
Pedal to the metal but I ain't rushing
It's probably best we slow down
You ain't gotta tell me how you feel
It's written on your face, you ain't say shit
Your friends gon hate how you flakin 
Costco sample, can I taste it? 
For dinner
Young but you ain't novice, no beginner 
cnd everything you told me I remember 
Go go go go go get her 



Heading to the party 
I want your body 
Top down on sunset driving 
We can take a detour back to...
Back to my place 
Leather seats crème like chocolate 
Know you got time 
We can really get into It 


Go go go get her 
Do you think you can fit her? 
Light drunk brown liquor 
Waste no time 
Go go go go go go get her
