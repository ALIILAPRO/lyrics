		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I put my bags down here?
How do I know you won't disappear?
Can I? Can I? Would it be okay to take it slow?
Just tell me if you don't, you don't want me here
I was, I was always quick to rush and always all or nothing
That's how it was, that's how it was
Shouldn't we just cut the cord?
If you could hurt me more than he ever did
This is no way to live

Got my feet on the ground but my heads up the stairs
And I'm spiraling down but I'm up in the, up in the air
I'm up in the air
And it's fine in the basement and on the first floor
Though my knees aren't shaking, my head's feelin' worse than before
Is it worse than before?

Don't think I can stand it, oh, yeah
There's panic in the attic, panic in the attic
You're not the one who did me damage, not yet
But there's panic in the attic, panic in the attic
It's not your fault

Can I make a burden shift?
Or will you leave me like my father did when I was a kid?
Can there be another way? Is it too soon to say?
Can it be what it is? Can you handle all this?

Got my feet on the ground but my heads up the stairs
And I'm spiraling down but I'm up in the, up in the air
I'm up in the air
And it's fine in the basement and on the first floor
Though my knees aren't shaking, my head's feelin' worse than before
Is it worse than before?

Don't think I can stand it, oh, yeah
There's panic in the attic, panic in the attic
You're not the one who did me damage, not yet
But there's panic in the attic, panic in the attic
It's not your fault
