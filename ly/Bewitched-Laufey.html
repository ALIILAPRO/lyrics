		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrapped me in your arms
Leaned in and whispered
"Keep me in your heart"
I'm so bewildered
What's this new desire called?
I didn't know that much at all
'Bout love before
But now, I think I'm learning

You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light
The world froze around us, you kissed me goodnight

You bewitch me
Every damn second you're with me
I try to think straight
But I'm falling so badly, I'm coming apart
You wrote me a note, cast a spell on my heart
And bewitched me
Bewitched me

You're not even gone
I already miss you
What's going on?
I've never been through
This all-consuming, fire fuming
Cursing at the moon and losing
All control and crying
'Cause I think I'm falling

You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light
The world froze around us, you kissed me goodnight

You bewitch me
Every damn second you're with me
I try to think straight
But I'm falling so badly, I'm coming apart
You wrote me a note, cast a spell on my heart
And bewitched me
Bewitch
You bewitched me
