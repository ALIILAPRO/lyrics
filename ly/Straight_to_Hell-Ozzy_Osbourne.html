		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright now
Come on now

You're flying higher than a kite tonight
You've took the hit and now you feel alright
Your dance be death so we must celebrate
I'll make you scream, I'll make you defecate

Straight to hell tonight
We're going straight to hell
Straight to hell tonight

I'll make you lie, I'll make you steal and kill
I'll make you crawl until your final thrill
Enjoy the ride, I'll plant my bitter seed
You'll kill yourself and I will watch you bleed

Straight to hell tonight
We're going straight to hell
Straight to hell tonight

Straight to hell tonight
We're going straight to hell
Straight to hell tonight

Something is missing and you don't know why
Deeper in the darkness you will hide

Alright now
Alright now

Straight to hell tonight
We're going straight to hell
Straight to hell tonight

Straight to hell tonight
We're going straight to hell
Straight to hell tonight
