		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, hello? 
Anybody there? 
Hello?

'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now
'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now

You've been replaying in my head
You make me feel like I can be myself instead 
But I know you don't want me around 
Your smile is irradiant, you make me feel like I can't quit 
So give me something to work
I'm sorry but I'm not giving up now
Woo

'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now
'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now

I know you're thinking the same thing 
So why are you denying all these new feelings?
'Cause I just wanted you around 
You make me feel so crazy, even though you're kinda lazy 
I just can't hide this grieving 
I'm sorry but I'm not giving up now 
Woo

'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now
'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now

"We're sorry the number you have dialed is not in service at this time"
"The number you have dialed has been changed, the new number is
The new number is, the new number is, the new number is"

Hello?

'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now
'Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now?
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now
