		  Sexy boys
Fancy boys
Playboys
Bad boys

I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot

Motherfuckers get buzzed off the sparks that I bring
Guess whose got the party jumping
Travel the dark and all the pumping

I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot

I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot

Hold up!
Whoah whoah whoah
Wait a minute minute Jesus Christ
Yo my man DJ Hi-Tek,
Shit this motherfucking beat is nice
Back in the day them wankies
Didn't wanna believe in us
Little did they know that they was in for a mutherfucker big surprise
Left on, locked in my Zef Zone

Ready for the diss, yo?

Motherfucker guess so
Overseas when the fucking heads get blown
When every thing will seem like
Dr. Dre beats headphones
When I get home I lounge on my zef throne, mate
Mom after me cause I get so great
making my money rapping over techno rave
I can take you underworld lets go babe
When I step up and do my thing put you in a trance
My Zef motherfucking clique got it going on
Fuck what you think I do what I motherfucking want
I can make a million little mutherfuckers jump

Jump motherfucker
Jump motherfucker jump

Jump motherfucker
Jump motherfucker jump

Jump motherfucker
Jump motherfucker jump

Jump motherfucker
Jump motherfucker jump

Increase the peace, don't wreck the party
And fuck da jol up for everybody
Ek's a laarney, jy's a gam
Want jy lam innie mang, met jou slang in a man

I fink u freeky and I like you a lot

Now why you loer en kyk gelyk?
Is ek miskien van goud gemake?
You want to fight, you come tonight
Ek moer jou sleg! So jy hardloop weg

God se Jesus, we come to party
Pump your speakers, yo rock your body
In God we trust, You can't fuck with us
We not taking kak, I'd like to say what's up

To my sexy boys, and my fancy boys
And my playboys, and my bad boys
And my pretty boys, and my ugly boys
And my naughty boys
We gonna have a nice time kids

I fink u freeky and I like you a lot
