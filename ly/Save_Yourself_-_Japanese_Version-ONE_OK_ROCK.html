		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
Waves this strong, just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
But you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself

I'm caught up in a current, babe
Heartbreak games, you won't play
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

I will trust my fate
You live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
Waves this strong, just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
But you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself

You're running from a hurricane
I set fire to the rain
I wanna be your lifeline, babe
I've got tired and you got brave

I will trust my fate
You live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me, no
Can you hear me (can you hear me, can you?)

Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt (never felt)
Waves this strong, just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
But you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt, save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt, just save yourself

(Save, save) save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt
Waves this strong, just save yourself
I learned to sink or swim
But you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drowning in your doubt
Save yourself
