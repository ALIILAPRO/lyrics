		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know and I'll be around
If you've got no place to go, when you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try

Take a chance on me
Take a chance on me

We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better
'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You wanted to leave me there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know and I'll be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try

Take a chance on me
Take a chance on me

Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, I know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
It's magic
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind
No I can't let go
'Cause I love you so

Hopping in
If you like what you're seeing take a chance with me, ya
You won't be grabbed, if you're feeling horny
Well, you've passes so you got to know this precious property
I don't know the lads, so call me MC K
Nobody sits, understand me clearly
However hard he try, could he never own me
We all fit nice and just move freely
Special K, what he says all said carefully
Me not sit all along and just wait by phone
Not call me 'cause me never, never home ya
Machine gun as we get the wrong one
Master Mark, Master Paul, mister Luke and John
If we like what we see we chance a situation
Nothing don't pay nothing, maybe see what follow on
What a Jill may do if the right man come?
Hey rock da boat, come we just have a little fun
Go now

Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
