		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought my life was done
when we broke up, and I
I kinda feel desperate
When we were separate
Without you
Without you
Connected to my pain
I try to understand
Sometimes I missing you but then I hating you
I miss you
I hate you


Talk to my mirror
Think I'm crazy,
Alone in a night, oh
If remembering you is hurt
I have to move on

Now I know
When you said to me I love you
You are perfect liar
Don't need to give anything
I can love myself better
Yes, I can love myself better
