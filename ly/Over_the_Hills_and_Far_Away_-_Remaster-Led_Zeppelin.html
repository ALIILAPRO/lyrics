		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling 
Walk a while with me
Ohh, you've got so much, so much, so much

Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream, and a pocket full of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh
You know I should, you know I should, you know I should, you know I should
