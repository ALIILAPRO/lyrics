		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm

I hear strings play
Every time you look my way
Don't you know that's what you do
Feels like ooh
Make my heart beat
Double time when you're on me
Don't you know that's what you do
What you do, what you do

Girl, you mute out all the nonsense, all the toxic
We can talk on any topic and never stop it
I know you got other options, a lotta prospects
But they only know the single, I want the box set
Pushin' buttons with your high heels or your high tops
Turnin' heads and give 'em all the feels way that you walk
Could be a sign, alright
Might be losin' my mind

'Cause I hear strings play
Every time you look my way, hey
Don't you know that's what you do
Feels like ooh (ah)
Make my heart beat
Double time when you're on me (on me)
Don't you know that's what you do (girl, you know that's what you do- ayy, yeah)
What you do, what you do

Girl, you sound just like the theme song, can turn my dreams on
You the start of a movie, I'm watchin' reruns
Wanna cut off all my options, put you on top them
We just stepped outside in public, the cameras poppin'
Hold on to me right now, I'll protect you
You can ruin my life, girl, I'll let you
Feel your heart when it's beating
You the one, girl, and I'm fiendin'
I hear symphonies when you speakin', it's true

'Cause I hear strings play
Every time you look my way
Don't you know that's what you do (hey, hey, hey)
Feels like ooh
Make my heart beat
Double time when you're on me
Don't you know that's what you do (girl, you know that's what you do)
What you do, what you do

Mm
What you do
