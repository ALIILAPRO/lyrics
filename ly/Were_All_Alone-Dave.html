		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when I used to be innocent, ain't shit changed
I'm a young black belligerent
Child of an immigrant, lifestyle frivolous
'Round here we keep bad company 'cause them people pay dividends
What's the point of bein' rich when your family ain't?
It's like flyin' first class on a crashin' plane
Dinners with the same niggas, just higher bills
And all the models Himalayan, they got higher heels

You know we're all alone in this together, right?
(Quiet on set, places everybody)
You know the seats in the Aston red leather, like
(And action) Yeah

I had dreams of doin' architecture
Or sittin' through a Harvard lecture
How the fuck I end up bein' Harvey Specter?
Young black art collector, I could take the pressure
Had the scales, now suits that come made to measure
I drew the thin line between love and hate
Double date, what you drinkin'? Let me cut the games
Backstab a man, I'd rather that you cut my face
If I ain't charmin' the women, it's all the fuckin' snakes
You idolize the girl, there's no way I'd wife her
She only fucks with rich niggas, that's the way I like it
I can't fabricate the truth, it's just the way I write it
You got points on your creative license
Ask Rapz, that's a criminal graduatin' in civil law
Nothin' ain't civil 'bout this Civil War
Grip a four, Gryffindor, this'll have you lyin' on your chest
I've got ninety-nine marks and wasn't trying on my test
I'm blessed (why?)
Because the pasta is gamberoni, the watch is a classic Rollie
The pussy is sacred, it's holy like matrimony
I'm payin' her alimony to numb all the acrimony
The flight is to Santorini, the car is a Lamborghini
The cheese, the cheddar, the mozzarella, the fettuccini
The only aim, look at my ego in the day in a life
And see what happens when you got the fuckin' game in a vice
We're all alone

I got a message from a kid on Sunday mornin'
Said he don't know what to do and that he's thinkin' of killin' himself
Me and him got more in common than he thinks
But I tell him to see a shrink so I can go on and live with myself
I knew that my life was a film
From when I had to share a bed with my mum and I was pissin' myself
I just want my flowers while I'm here
So I can put them at the front of the grave that I've been diggin' myself
I grew up in a two-bed flat with seven people livin' with me
You don't know what I did for myself
My mum's the one that gave me opportunities
And put me in positions that I couldn't have pictured myself
We're from Nigeria, Benin City, Sin City
Don't know what it's like? Take a trip for yourself
Poverty's killin' us, the government's killin' us
If they ain't killin' us, then we're killin' ourselves
I would die for the niggas I love
My life's full of plotholes, and I'm fillin' 'em up
I told mummy, "I ain't nothin' like my father"
I'ma show her there's a different definition to love
I tell my fans we're all alone in this together
You can trust me, all the shit that you been feelin'
You're feelin' with me
We all took the wrong turns in different streets
We all cry the same tears on different cheeks
I got a message from a kid on Monday mornin'
Said he's grateful I responded and he's feelin' at peace with himself
Me and him got more in common than he thinks
But I tell him it's nothin' big so I can go on and live with myself
I knew that God had cast me as the leader
Somethin' special when he messaged me and told me that I saved his life
In twenty-three years, I done so much wrong
But in that moment, I just felt like I had made it right

"Hey Dave, it's Mollie Cowen
Um, we sent to you a, um, movie
An NDA to sign, um, in an e-mail and also by DocuSign
For, um, a movie called-, um, which- is directing with-
And Nina Gold is casting
Um, there's very little info that we have
But, um, I think we definitely want to put our hat in the ring for and go for
If there is a way in which you could do a take out there
Please have a look and get back right away, thanks, bye"
