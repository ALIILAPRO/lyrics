		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me at midnight

Starin' at the ceilin' with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

I've been under scrutiny (yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (yeah, oh, yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal, I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep askin' me (all they keep askin' me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kind of girl they see (only kind of girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife

I find it dizzying (yeah, oh, yeah)
They're bringin' up my history (yeah, oh, yeah)
But you aren't even listening (yeah, oh, yeah)
(Ooh-whoa)

I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal, I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk (get it off my desk)
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
(Ooh-whoa)

I feel (I feel) the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal, I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say (oh, yeah)
No deal (no deal), the 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze 

Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze, I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
