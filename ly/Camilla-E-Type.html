		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I'm gone with the wind
I won't look back
When I head into the future
Set sail I'm all go

When to come I don't know
But now I feel I can do it all
But leaving you
It must be so

On my way now
At the turning point here
It's time now
I'm going into high gear
I know how
I'm gonna make it all clear
And leave without no fear

Now the time has come for you
you're on your way
You will change the world
whatever they might say
Camilla
All the things you ever want to do
You will change your life and make it all
come true
Camilla

Had to be done while I still
Had power left
To fulfil the promises
That I made long ago

On my way but
The road is long and winding
But I will find the path
I know it must be so

On my way now
At the turning point here
It's time now
I'm going into high gear
I know how
I'm gonna make it all clear
And leave without no fear

Now the time has come for you
you're on your way
You will change the world
whatever they might say
Camilla
All the things you ever want to do
You will change your life and make it all
come true
Camilla

Change your world now
I don't know how
I'm on my way
You always say
I'm gonna change
the world
If I just find a way

Now the time has come for you
you're on your way
You will change the world
whatever they might say
Camilla
All the things you ever want to do
You will change your life and make it all
come true
Camilla
