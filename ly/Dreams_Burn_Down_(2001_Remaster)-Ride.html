		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lying under sky
Laughing at everything I say
And pulls me under
There's no time to resist
Lying on the floor
The tears are falling down and more
Her eyes speak loud
But actions speak the best

Waiting, hoping for a sign
That what's forbidden can be mine
I just want what I can't have
'Til my dreams burn down and choke me every time

She's effortlessly cool
But circumstances can be cruel
And sometimes you must accept
That you can't always get what you want
We fill up our days and nights
We fill up the gaps in our empty little lives
But we know that we are doomed
The moment we walk out the room
Waiting, hoping for a sign
That what's forbidden can be mine

I just want what I can't have
'Til my dreams burn down and choke me every time
