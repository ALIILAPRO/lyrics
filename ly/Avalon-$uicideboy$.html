		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put the thang up to his brain (you did good, $lick)
Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to, the thang up to his brain
Lay you down, you, put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to, the thang up to, the thang up to his brain
Wah, wah

Psycho ward, to the mental, I'm a don (yeah, yeah)
In the ward's got the Fenty in my 'ron (yeah, yeah)
Skate the block off them Xannies, so I'm calm (wah, wah)
Cough a lot from that damage to my lungs, ayy (ayy)
Dope-smoker, gun-totin', I'm a killer's killer (wah)
Pill-popper, I don't know a lot who really sicker (ayy)
Full of liquor, Codeine-drinker, fuckin' up my liver (wah)
Pull the trigger, up the thriller to the highest bidder (ayy, ayy)
Ooh-la-la, what's the vibe, pussy boy? (Wah)
AK boom, put 'em in their tomb, take lives just because (brr, brr)
Say, "Nah, I'm on fire from the drugs" (yeah)
Bend that ho, gave that bitch some dick, she get off of my nut (ayy, ayy)
She gon' deepthroat it 'til she cry (cry)
Got my face tatted on her thigh (thigh)
Realest motherfucker from the five (five)
Every meal the last supper when you God (God)

Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to, the thang up to his brain
Lay you down, you, put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to, the thang up to, the thang up to his brain (aight, bet)

Send me the fuckin' addy and I'll see y'all in a second
Keys to the Fleetwood Caddy, push to start the 911 (vroom, vroom)
Drive these bitches crazy, yeah, they always tryna date me
Tryna save me, it's all because I suck her titties like a baby
Hate me all you want, better watch your back, I never front
You want problems? I got a bunch
Ain't nothing changed except the chunk, ah
Knock the piss out a pussy boy, trust
Snort a thirty off the .40, let it bust (baow, baow)
Gimme bread, watch how quick I start to duck (quack)
I put Fenty on her toes, she put Fenty in my cup, uh
What with all this racket? What the fuck with all this fuss? (Uh)
Ruby unapproachable, but still, they bum rush (yeah, yeah)
Oh my, $uicide, you're that guy (you're that guy)
You're that guy who wanna die, what's your sign? (Taurus?)
She a nine, personality borderline
She tried to stand me up but I dicked her down and bent her spine

Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to, the thang up to his brain
Lay you down, you, put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to his brain
Put the thang up to, the thang up to, the thang up to his brain
