		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, please
Woo, woo, woo

Ayy, the party is poppin' (ayy)
How she whip it, she mop it (yeah)
How she lick it, she top it (yeah)
The bitches, they swappin'
It's sloppy, it's slimy (slimy)
It's ratchet, it's grimey (ooh)
I'm sinnin', I'm winnin' (winnin')
I'm Dennis Rodman (Rodman)
Hit a bitch with a mean lil' fadeaway (fadeaway)
Ayy, bitch, you not my type, tell her "stay away" (stay away)
The party is poppin' (poppin')
She whip it, she mop it (mop it)
She lick it, she top it
The bitches, they swappin' (swappin')

Don't try me, it's by me (by me)
Feel me, it's on me (on me, yeah)
Super sonic (pew)
Don't play games like Sony (Sony)
Pocket (pew) rocket (pew)
Pop it (pop it), lock it (lock it)
Flex, fuck it (fuck it)
Simon Says don't stop it (stop it)
Benihana's, cookin' bodies on a Saturday (woo, cook it)
Heard you got a new chain, it's on layaway (yeah, layaway?)
You rappers, all you do is copy (copy)
And these bitches click my story 'cause they wanna watch me (watch me)

Ayy, she gon' send a text when it's gettin' late (woo, gettin' late)
Ayy, meet my security at the gate (at the gate)
Bitch, you lookin' at a star like we in a Wraith (in a Wraith)
Beat it like Billie Jean, moonwalk away

Ayy, the party is poppin' (ayy)
She whip it, she mop it (mop it)
She lick it, she top it (top it)
The bitches, they swappin'
It's sloppy, it's slimy (slimy)
It's ratchet, it's grimey (ooh)
I'm sinnin', I'm winnin' (winnin')
I'm Dennis Rodman (Rodman)
Hit a bitch with a mean lil' fadeaway (fadeaway)
Ayy, bitch, you not my type, tell her "stay away" (stay away)
The party is poppin' (poppin')
She whip it, she mop it (mop it) (ayy, ayy)
She lick it, she top it (ayy, ayy)
The bitches, they swappin' (swappin')

She mean, a queen, that's makin' bands
Her ass a fiend, potato yams
Put money on his hand, I call it head band
You die here, Dennis Rodman
It feel like we won the Final's, we got five rings (yeah)
We livin' in series, I'm thirty-for-thirty, I shake 'em like Kyrie
You niggas stuck on that bullshit, I ain't talkin' 'bout Dennis
We the ballers in the game (uh), feel like we runnin' a scrimmage
I'm the best, put a nigga in the Guinness
My bitches bad, Trinidad, red stripe in the Guinness
We paint our nails, hit Mimi for the manicure
Only thing we were duckin' is them Lambi' doors
The party is
Hold the fuck up, Tyga, run that shit
He with the Tiger King when I'm the king when it comes to this Rodman thing
All of my songs hit
Bada-bing, in a pandemic, but I do not feel a thing
Last week, bought four of them chains
Glowin' up until I'm tourin' the game
Restorin' the game, rappers is wildin'
Baptized 'em, now I drown 'em
Trap album, now they silent
Made a mil' talkin' 'bout violence
While on a island
Beautiful view from a palace
Talkin' 'bout shoes with my stylist
You is a coward
Not really valid
Mixin' the hustle with talent
Got your bitch browsin'
Her comment a thousand
Instagram emoji smilin'

The party is poppin' (ayy)
She whip it, she mop it 
She lick it, she top it 
The bitches, they swappin'
It's sloppy, it's slimy (slimy)
It's ratchet, it's grimey (ooh)
I'm sinnin', I'm winnin' (winnin')
I'm Dennis Rodman (Rodman)
Hit a bitch with a mean lil' fadeaway (fadeaway)
Ayy, bitch, you not my type, tell her "stay away" (stay away)
The party is poppin' (poppin')
She whip it, she mop it (mop it)
She lick it, she top it (top it)
The bitches, they swappin' (swappin')
