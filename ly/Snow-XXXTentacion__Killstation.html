		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's up?
ItWillAllBeOverSoon

I see black skies, and white lies, I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me, fueling my insecurities
As the ground right under me crumbles as if it wasn't there
It's too much, my heart's crushed, I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness 'cause it's all lies
I've seen the pain, I've run away so many times
Death and I are companions, it's here at all times
I won't love, won't trust, I won't die
I can't feel, but managed to steal your heart, love
Was dirt poor, now fuck whores and want love
It seems that anything offered could be enough but
As time, body falls
Don't know who to call
Alone, and my heart
Got tat' of it, broke
I'm so fucking numb
My life has succumbed
To hatred and death
Alone in the snow
