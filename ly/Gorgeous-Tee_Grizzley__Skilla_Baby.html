		  (Helluva made this beat, baby)

Ha, six figures for a Patek, it's gorgeous
Diamond links on my wrist full of pointers
Cuban link on my neck, this bitch gorgeous
We eat the most, bust tint, it's enormous
I love starin' at my bitch, she gorgeous
She love starin' at my kit, it's gorgeous
My lil' bitch say her favorite words is, "You gorgeous"
I keep talkin' to my wrist like, "You gorgeous"
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous

She know she bad, I'm still gon' tell her that she gorgeous (I am)
I hit once, then come back to my senses, bitch, you normal
Seven hundred horses on my Lam', it sit on Forgis (it's fast)
My boy gon' torch you if you touch me, I'm too important (Don't do it)
And, nigga, our ice and y'all ice look different
Unky in there cookin' up a brick, puttin' his foot in it (Skrrt, skrrt)
Tell your security to chill, brodie mush niggas (For real)
Clip long as a belt, bitch, we really whoop niggas

Ha, six figures for a Patek, it's gorgeous
Diamond links on my wrist full of pointers
Cuban link on my neck, this bitch gorgeous
We eat the most, bust tint, it's enormous
I love starin' at my bitch, she gorgeous
She love starin' at my kit, it's gorgeous
My lil' bitch say her favorite words is, "You gorgeous"
I keep talkin' to my wrist like, "You gorgeous"
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous

Six-figure watch, I could've bought a few two-family flats
Soon as I seen a skeleton, I said, "Man, hand me that"
It's two-ninety, I say it's three hundred with my petty ass
Ticket on in jewelry, really I shouldn't be outside with that
You know your bitches cold when you can't believe they fuck with you
Boy, you ain't a boss, 'cause ain't no decisions up to you
You be talkin' crazy 'bout me to the niggas that run with you
Then see me out and dick suck and now them boys uncomfortable

Ha, six figures for a Patek, it's gorgeous
Diamond links on my wrist full of pointers
Cuban link on my neck, this bitch gorgeous
We eat the most, bust tint, it's enormous
I love starin' at my bitch, she gorgeous
She love starin' at my kit, it's gorgeous
My lil' bitch say her favorite words is, "You gorgeous"
I keep talkin' to my wrist like, "You gorgeous"
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
Gorgeous, you gorgeous
