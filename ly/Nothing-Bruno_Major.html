		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you

There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you

Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine?
We'll watch "The Notebook"
For the seventeenth time
I'll say, it's stupid
Then you'll catch me crying

We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you

So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up
In a heap on the floor
(Mmm-mmm-mmm)

You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof 
And there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
(Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)

No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
