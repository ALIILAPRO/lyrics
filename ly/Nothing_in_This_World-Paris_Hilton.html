		  Da-da,
Da-da, Da-da, Da,
Da-da, Da-da, Da-da, Da

So I was thinking to myself when you passed me by
“Here's what I like”
And you were with somebody else but you can't deny
That's me in your eye

Do you know
What it's like
When it's wrong
But it feels so right?

Nothing in this world can stop us tonight
I can do what she can do so much better
Nothing in this world can turn out the light
I'm gonna make you feel alright tonight.
Da-da, Da-da, Da-da, Da, Tonight
Da-da, Da-da, Da-da, Da, Tonight

Baby, you and I, we got what will never be
You know I'm right
So tell me what you're waiting for when you're here with me?
Most guys would die

You should know
What it's like
When it hurts
‘Cause it feels so right


I gotta tell you somethin'
It's somethin' that you just might like
No, it's not the same thing
Yeah, you'll learn I'm not too shy
You and I, we can do this thing tonight
