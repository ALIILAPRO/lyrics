		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know if you know
But I feel you in me
Inside of my years
Inside of my bones

I remember the colors
In your mysterious eyes
Part of me stays
In the room where we met

And everything slows with my breath
As I watch you float cross the floor
And the night came as it went
I could swear that I knew you before
And maybe on another night, we were lovers in another life
Or maybe we were only strangers on mystery trains
And you were only a ghost that has stolen my heart away

I always wondered, if I knew you before
I feel like I had enough time on my hands

I know that you're with me still, I have this fear
One day I'll wake up and you'll be a dream

'Cause everything slows with my breath
And I watch you float cross the floor
And the night came as it went
I could swear that I knew you before
And maybe on another night, we were lovers in the moonlight
Or maybe we were only strangers on mystery trains
And you were only a ghost who has stolen my heart away

And now if you need me, you know where to find me
I'll be always falling under your spell

And everything slows with my breath
As I watch you float cross the floor
And the night came as it went
I could swear that I knew you before
Like maybe on another night, we were lovers in another life
Or maybe we were always strangers on mystery trains
And you were only a ghost that has stolen my heart away
