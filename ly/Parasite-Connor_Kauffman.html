		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I saw you in a photograph
Told you maybe you had crossed my mind
You said you always knew that I would be your other half
But I heard that you were bad at math

Why don't you tell me, tell me the truth
You're never changing
Why don't, why don't I move on
Here I am running right back to you
Winning the race, but I

I know you're nothing but a parasite, parasite
Draining my life out 'till I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
You tell your friends that you're in paradise, paradise
But little do they all know, your heart's gone so cold

'Cuz when there's no way out you'd be locking the door
You were the devil in disguise
I know you're nothing but a parasite, parasite
Draining my life out till I'm paralyzed, paralyzed

'Cuz I know there's no help in saving
What won't find good in changing
And I don't wanna hear you're forsaking
Before I could escape it

All you were to me
Gone, in history
But look who's crawling back again

Knew it was wrong,
But I believed
On, and on I'd see that
This was never meant to be

I know you're nothing but a parasite, parasite
Draining my life out 'till I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
You tell your friends that you're in paradise, paradise
But little do they all know, your heart's gone so cold

'Cuz when there's no way out you'd be locking the door
You were the devil in disguise
I know you're nothing but a parasite, parasite
Draining my life out till I'm paralyzed, paralyzed

I know you're nothing but a parasite, parasite
Draining my life out till I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
