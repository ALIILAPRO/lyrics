		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I had the time of my life
No, I never felt like this before
Yes, I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you

I been waiting for so long
Now I finally found someone to stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy

Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each others hand
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency

Just remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love

Because I had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes, I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

Hey, baby

With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no

Yes, I know what's on your mind when you say
"Stay with me tonight" (stay with me)
And remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love

Because I had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes, I swear it's the truth (yes, I swear)
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door (never felt this way)
'Til I found the truth
And I owe it all to you

Now I (I) had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before (never felt this way)
Yes, I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

I had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before (never felt this way)
Yes, I swear it's the truth (it's the truth)
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I had the time of my life (I had time of my life)
Searched through every open door (you do it to me, baby)
'Til I found the truth (you do it to me, baby)
And I owe it all to you
