(WhyJay) Alors, alors
(Sticky)
(Ayy, Lucid, turn that shit up) Alors on danse
I had to mend it without the spendin', can't comprehend it (alors, alors)
The gyal are sextin', my screen is hectic, I'm epileptic (alors, alors)

I copped a pendant, my clout ascendin', the gyal attendin' (alors, alors)
I had to end it without the endin', the gyal on pendin' (alors, alors)
I had to mend it without the spendin', can't comprehend it (alors, alors)
The gyal are sextin', my screen is hectic, I'm epileptic (alors, alors)

Dance slow, go low like limbo
Gotta buy low, sell high like Crypto
Me llamo, it's Benzz in the disco
Adios, Adeola, I wanna hit though
(In the-) In the back or the front, in a cab or the sun
Any which way, mans involved
(Heard the-) Heard there's an invasion, what's the info?
Dance to the left, to the right, out the window

Come and hold it, the gyal wan' show tits
I think I'm foldin', I'm claustrophobic
They gyal are hopin' that Benz's is strokin'
The mandem smokin', they're acrophobic
My stock is floatin', I'm aquaphobic
Uh, thinkin' I ran outta breath
I'm anaerobic, I need to hold it
The flow is potent (alors, alors)

I copped a pendant, my clout ascendin', the gyal attendin' (alors, alors)
I had to end it without the endin', the gyal on pendin' (alors, alors)
I had to mend it without the spendin', can't comprehend it (alors, alors)
The gyal are sextin', my screen is hectic, I'm epileptic (alors, alors)

Dance slow, go low like limbo
Gotta buy low, sell high like Crypto
Me llamo, it's Benzz in the disco
Adios, Adeola, I wanna hit though
(In the-) In the back or the front, in a cab or the sun
Any which way, mans involved
(Heard the-) Heard there's an invasion, what's the info?
Dance to the left, to the right, out the window

I might assist that, I'm left in wing back
I need to spin that, Hakim, Ziyech
I can't resist that, her wig got lift back
I wanna hit that like Olympians
We shoot, we curve it, like Raheem Sterling
The mandem earnin' (the mandem earnin')
Uh, uh, we had the whole of West in bricks
And my yard full of suburbans
We got the gyaldem, the girls are random
We made a anthem (alors, alors)
The hips outstanding, the mandem scanning
The whips are branded (alors, alors)
The yard abandoned, I got the hand ting
Attached attachments (alors, alors)
This ain't overnight success, now the girls undress

I copped a pendant, my clout ascendin', the gyal attendin' (alors, alors)
I had to end it without the endin', the gyal on pendin' (alors, alors)
I had to mend it without the spendin', can't comprehend it (alors, alors)
The gyal are sextin', my screen is hectic, I'm epileptic (alors, alors)
