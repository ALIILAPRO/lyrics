		  I be like fuck it at the same time I don't say fuck it
Now look what I'm stuck with
I don't care if I'm in the wrong, I don't get upset
I don't care if you in the wrong, I don't get upset
I be like fuck it at the same time (I know I can't trust it)
Now look what I'm stuck with
I don't care if I'm in the wrong, I don't get upset
I don't care if you in the wrong, I don't get upset

I like your style, but I know that you're the worst
But don't judge me
You lyin' in my bed now, it's above me
So don't get it off your chest, I know you love me
Don't judge me now now now, me now
I know it don't matter 'cause you'll dive, you'll dive in
I don't wanna draw the line, darling
You've come too far, you've come too far
You got your views, got your views
But I don't really think you got no social cues (oh, no)
Hangin' up round your neck, that's cheap perfume
I caught it from a thousand miles away

I be like fuck it at the same time I don't say fuck it
Now look what I'm stuck with
I don't care if I'm in the wrong, I don't get upset
I don't care if you in the wrong, I don't get upset
I be like fuck it at the same time (I know I can't trust it)
Now look what I'm stuck with
I don't care if I'm in the wrong, I don't get upset
I don't care if you in the wrong, I don't get upset

I just came back from a flight, feel crazy
Hope ya lil' mans don't get upset
Came a long way from the minimum wages
When I get paid, don't feel nothin'
I just came back from a flight, feel crazy
Hope ya lil' mans don't get upset
Came a long way from the minimum wages
When I get paid, don't feel nothin'
I just came back from a flight, feel crazy
Hope ya lil' mans don't get upset
Came a long way from the minimum wages
When I get paid, don't feel nothin'
I just came back from a flight, feel crazy
Hope ya lil' mans don't get upset
Came a long way from the minimum wages
When I get paid, don't feel nothin'

I be like fuck it at the same time I don't say fuck it
Now look what I'm stuck with
I don't care if I'm in the wrong, I don't get upset
I don't care if you in the wrong, I don't get upset
I be like fuck it at the same time (I know I can't trust it)
Now look what I'm stuck with
I don't care if I'm in the wrong, I don't get upset
I don't care if you in the wrong, I don't get upset
