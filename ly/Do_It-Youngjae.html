		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do it, do it, do it your way and move
원한다면 나와 just groove
All I think about is you
감히 너를 알고 싶어
I don't wanna let you go

Tatara-tara-ta, got me feeling like
Tatara-tara-ta
Do it, do it, do it your way and move
보여줄래, 네 맘? 
Baby, I don't wanna let you go

마치 영화 같아 movie
달콤한 넌 sugar cream
Yeah 노래 불러 줄게 Stevie's
뭘 원해? 'Overjoyed' or 'Isn't She Lovely'?

첨 느껴보는 feel, maybe I see unreal
딴 사람 안 보여 솔직히 you're unfair
I got to know 조금씩 너에게로
Can't you hear me there?

내 번호를 불러줘
언제라도 just call me
When you're lonely
All I need, all I need

Do it, do it, do it your way and move
원한다면 나와 just groove
All I think about is you
감히 너를 알고 싶어
I don't wanna let you go

Tatara-tara-ta, got me feeling like
Tatara-tara-ta
Do it, do it, do it your way and move
보여줄래, 네 맘? 
Baby, I don't wanna let you go

Ooh, wait 고개 돌리지 마
No wait, so that I know 
You're so rarity 딱 맞는 outfit 
언제나 널 바라볼 때 생긴 emoji

완벽한 outfit 볼 때면 can not wait
원하고 있잖아 everyday, everywhere
I got to know 조금씩 너에게로
Can't you hear me there?

준비했던 멘트마저
니 앞에선 immature
자꾸만 어색해져
All I need, all I need is your love

내 번호를 불러줘
언제라도 just call me
When you're lonely
바로 달려갈게 wait

Do it, do it, do it your way and move
원한다면 나와 just groove
All I think about is you
감히 너를 알고 싶어
I don't wanna let you go

Tatara-tara-ta, got me feeling like
Tatara-tara-ta
Do it, do it, do it your way and move
보여줄래, 네 맘? 
Baby, I don't wanna let you go

I'm just trying, I'm just trying
Every night, every morning
Forgive me, yes I'm crazy
Everything that I want is you

Do it, do it, do it your way and move
원한다면 나와 just groove
All I think about is you
감히 너를 알고 싶어
I don't wanna let you go

Tatara-tara-ta, got me feeling like
Tatara-tara-ta
Do it, do it, do it your way and move
보여줄래, 네 맘? 
Baby, I don't wanna let you go
