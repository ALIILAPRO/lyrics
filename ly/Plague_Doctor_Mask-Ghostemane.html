		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look 'em in the face say rest in peace
Blood on ya mouth and ya spittin out teeth
Now you tryna be tight when you
Used to wanna to beef
If you ain't gon fess muhfucka don't speak
Gotta whole lotta ex-teammates I'ma cremate
Stompin and pissin and spittin
All over yo remains i'm a dirty young Kreep
Fucked in the brain and I'm in ya back seat
Don't give a motherfuck what
They say about me
Weak ass bitch, livin' on IG
Suck another rapper dick like a real wannabe
You should get a life of your own maybe
See I'm really on some other
Shit hoe don't twist
Everybody thinkin' they can spit like this
Put em all in a coffin and ima bout
To hit the nail on the head
And bury these Motherfuckers in they own shit
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground

Groundin myself with my own 2
Feet down on the Flo
See the dirt in between all my toes
Thinkin bout shit that I know that
I shouldn't be thinkin about
But it come and it go
Should I be doin more with the
Gift that I was given
By Buddha and all his disciples
Some of the time I be thinkin so much
That it lead me to biting the tip of my rifle
But I really gotta say
That at the end of the day
When I got my Henny or Corona, and kick back
And think back, fuck
I wouldn't change a thang
And I'm a lucky mothafucka with
Alot on my plate and now I'm in the game
We shoot the shit about the same thing
Cause Schema da-posse puttin' on for my name
And when I look around, the underground
Shit's the same, maybe one day
You'll think outside the box
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground
Tired of this bullshit
Now I'm on the down-low
Creeping while you sleeping
Trick or treating with my lights low
Put em in a hole in the ground
