		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me with Perfection in your voice 
That you never really had a choice 
Place on me the burden of the past 
Offer me the future and take it back 

Show me what you never meant to show 
Tell me what I'm not supposed to know 
Contradict me when you're in the wrong 
Don't commit to anything at all 

My life is null and void 
Dismantled and destroyed 
My life is null and void 
My life is null and void 

Fill me with compassion and concern 
Thrill me with an unexpected turn 
Tempt me with the secrets that you hold 
Don't divulge until you're in control 

Show me what you never meant to show 
Tell me what I'm not supposed to know 
Contradict me when you're in the wrong 
Don't commit to anything at all 

My life is null and void 
Dismantled and destroyed 
My life is null and void 
My life is null and void 

My life is null and void 
Dismantled and destroyed 
My life is null and void 
My life is null and void 

My life is null and void 
Dismantled and destroyed 
My life is null and void 
My life is null and void
