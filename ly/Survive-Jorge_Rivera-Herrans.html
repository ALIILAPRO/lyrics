		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahh 

My brothers!
The rest of our fleet
They wait at the beach
And if we're defeated, they're good as dead
Straight ahead!
That is who we're fighting

No backup
No chance for support
So draw out your swords
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
Show me how great is your will to survive

Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey's over
No dying on me now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight

Surround him
(Surround him!)
Attack from behind
Keep distance in mind
And stay in his blind spot
And strike his heels
(Strike the heels!)
Show him that we're deadly (Ha! Ha!)

Exhaust him
(Exhaust him!)
Don't let him get close
He's strong but he's slow
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
Find a breach
Stand up and fight for your lives!

Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey's over

Push forward!

No dying on us now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so fight, fight, fight!

Captain?

Enough

He's got a club
He's got a club!

What are our orders?
Captain?
Captain!

You've hurt me enough

Six hundred lives I'll take
Six hundred lives I'll break
And when I kill you then my pain is over
You're dying here and now
Escape is not allowed
You won't live through this day now die!
Die
