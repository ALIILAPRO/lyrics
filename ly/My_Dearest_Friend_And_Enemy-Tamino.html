		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you leave me out
We were only trying to find out why
Love was passing by
In an echo's pressing sound

Doesn't matter now 
Stop the tears welling in your eyes
You're breaking up the sky
Like a widow's broken vow 

Here goes everything
You're my dearest friend and enemy
You belong with me
Like young love belongs to spring
Now don't tell me that I'm wrong again

I dream of living a life
Where neither of us fears looking behind 

Is your faith restored?
Now that every Heaven's out of reach
Thunder on the beach
Where you once would ask for more

Will it be the same?
When you build your family
With your next enemy
Tell me who'll be next to blame

Or could it be the start
Of something beautiful for you?
Where you can see it too
Either way we'd be apart
Either way it would break my heart 

I dream of living a life
Where neither of us fears looking behind

oh-ooh, no
ohh-ooh-ohh-ooh, no
ooh
ooh

Don't just look away
Let me know for once what's on your mind 
Leave some truth behind
If we go our separate ways 
Before I step into darker days
