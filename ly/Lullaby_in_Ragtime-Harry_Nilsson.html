		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Won't you play the music so the cradle can rock
To a lullaby in ragtime
Sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock
Play a lullaby in ragtime
You can tell the sandman is on his way
By the way
That they play
As still, as the trill, of a thrush, in a twilight high

So you can hear the
Rhythm of the ripples on the side of the boat

As you sail away to dreamland
High above the moon you hear a silvery note
As the sandman takes your hand
So rock-a-by my baby
Don't you cry my baby
Sleepy-time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby
So rock-a-by my baby

Don't you cry my baby
Sleepy-time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby
