		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The wind will start to blow at the end of this lone world
And again today, we'll close our tired eyes, catch a dream and rise above all the pain
Even if it is so small, it is our fragile hope
I believe that someday it'll change the times and become the light to guide us all

There is nothing to be burdened by, I'll hold it within me
Deep inside, I'll never let it go
And I'll embrace it no matter how much pain it's gonna cause
Let me go with you if all this comes true

I am screaming out, screaming out so loud, at the top of my lungs until my throat gets torn
And I invite you to create a future we can hold on to
Endlessly, right inside of me, my passion's overflowing, so I'll finally start walking
To feel my dream
