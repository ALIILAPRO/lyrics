		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh-oh-oh (feel the fire)
Ooh-ooh, feel the fire
Don't try to make mine closer, yeah
My-my, whoa

Why we greedy like wolves?
Adam, Eve with the fruit
Why we need new new? (Ah, ah)
Only got two seats (ah, ah), why we need new coupe?
Only got two feet (yeah, yeah), why we need new shoes?
Papa need new shoe, baby need new shoes
I'ma need new shoes, Birkenstock, fifty G's new shoes
Metro got this shit boomin' (boomin')
On the E like Q
Pearly Jesus pieces, what would Jesus do?

Rocky, why they wanna be like you?
Metro, why they wanna be like you?
Hello, why they wanna be like you? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Magazine like you (ayy, ayy, ayy)
GQ, yeah, I'm G like Q (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Shittin' on a smile, like P like U (you ain't know, there he go)
Switch it on 'em, we about to make a move (you ain't know? There he go)
Got a green light too (you ain't know? There he go)
On a G like five (you ain't know? There he go)
Watch it, green like slime (you ain't know? There he go)
I might G like slide (you ain't know? There he go)
She want me right now (you ain't know? There he go)
Hands up, show your diamonds (you ain't know? There he go)
Have a dance-off (you ain't know? There he go, bling)
Show yo' weapon, have a standoff (you ain't know? There he go, frrp, frrp)
Pussy poppin' on her handstand with her pants off

Mama told me, "Go and get it" (mama)
I was tryna get a ticket (get it)
Commas, commas, it's some digits (digits)
Been thinkin' 'bout it for a minute (yessir)
You lookin' at a lieutenant (lieutenant)
Ice and igloo on a pendant (ice)
She couldn't even finish her sentence
Every day, money get printed (frrp)
We the one they wanna be (be)
Like the letter after A (ayy)
I bought my bitch a new C (Chanel)
Then I took her to the D (let's go)
Said she wanna take a E (okay)
Don't go nowhere without my F&N (brrt)
No Givenchy, I'm a G (G)
They don't want smoke or the heat (ha)
I just count, stackin' like Money Mitch (Mitch)
Name a nigga, not me (I'll wait)
Out the country pushin' P (push)
It's quiet right now in the streets (shh)
Trick or treat? (Why?)
'Cause had bought her a V (skrrt)
Why wouldn't I when you got money to spend?
No sleep (nah), A$AP disease

Corner store, marketplace (what?)
The corner store how it start (uh)
High roller, high stakes (yeah)
Cluckin' chicken (yeah), gotta watch out for the pork (yeah, yeah, uh)
That's the most important part (yeah, uh)
Started out, we was only makin' art (yeah, uh)
Gotta say it from your heart (yeah)
Most of you niggas lack that, get past that
Body bag, toe tag, worst body parts in the cast
Smash that, Glock and gloves, mask that
Shorty asked my Apple Pay and Cashapp (hol' up)

Why we greedy like wolves?
Adam, Eve with the fruit
Why we need new new?
Only got two seats, why we need new coupe?
Only got two feet, why we need new shoes?
Papa need new shoe, baby need new shoes
I'ma need new shoes, Birkenstock, fifty G's, new shoes
Metro got this shit boomin' (boomin')
On the E like Q
Pearly Jesus pieces, what would Jesus do?
