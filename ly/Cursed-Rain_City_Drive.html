		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too sick and tired
Don't wanna wait a year
I fake a smile
Inside a broken mirror
You count the reasons why we'll never make it far from here
I'm gonna try to disappear
And when it rains down
You keep your hands out
I know you're wishing that one of your plans would pan out
Somebody told me
It's not in my control
I get the message but I still might take it personal

Our lucky stars are falling down so hard it hurts
I'm sick of being lost
And keeping fingers crossed

Lately I'm getting the feeling
Nothing works
Caused we're cursed
And she says so am I
I didn't wanna believe it
Each step forward
Puts us ten behind

Im waiting on a sign
Like it or not
We're running out of time
We look for signals but they burn up in the atmosphere
Close enough to make it clear

Our lucky stars are falling down so hard it hurts
I'm sick of being lost
And keeping fingers crossed

Lately I'm getting the feeling
Nothing works
Caused we're cursed
And she says so am I
I didn't wanna believe it
Each step forward
Puts us ten behind

Will we break or we bend
Just to lose it in the end
We're too old to play pretend
Should I go or should I stay
Will we ever be okay
Or am I just getting in your way

Lately I'm getting the feeling
Nothing works
Caused we're cursed
And she says so am I
I didn't wanna believe it
Each step forward
Puts us ten behind
