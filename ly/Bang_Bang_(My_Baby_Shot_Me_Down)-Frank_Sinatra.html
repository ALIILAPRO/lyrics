		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was five and she was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight

Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
And we grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

"Bang bang, I shot you down"
"Bang bang, you hit the ground"
"Bang bang, that awful sound"
"Bang bang, I used to shoot you down"

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang

Now she's gone, I don't know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
She didn't even say "goodbye"
She didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
