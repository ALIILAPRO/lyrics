		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I'm complicated
I don't have a lot to say in
The daylight
Maybe I'm uncomfortable
Little unpredictable, sometimes

Whatever it's worth, I know that it hurts
You are the ocean and I am the earth
Hide in my head, leave things unsaid
I am the needle and you are the thread

Will you wait?
Wait
Wait for me now
If you'll wait
Wait
Stay and you'll figure me out

I know that I'm difficult
But loving you is spiritual as
A night sky
I can be insensitive
And stubborn for the hell of it
When we fight

For whatever it's worth
I know that it hurts
You are the ocean and I am the earth

Will you wait?
Wait
Wait for me now
If you'll wait
Wait
Stay and you'll figure me out

I promise I'll get better with time
Do my best to make it alright
Be the one to kiss you goodnight
Forever

Will you wait?
Wait
Wait for me now
If you'll wait
Wait
Stay and we'll figure this out

(Wait, wait) promise you'll wait
(Wait) 
(Wait for me now) 
Promise you'll wait
