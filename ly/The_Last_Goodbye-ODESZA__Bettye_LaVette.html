		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

I know it's all over
But the last goodbye, oh
Let me down easy

Let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy

Let me
Let me down

When you pass by me
Say hello once in a while
When you pass by me, baby
Does it hurt so much to smile?

We promised that we'd still be friends
'Til the very end
Begging you, baby
Let me down easy

(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)

Let me
Let me down
Let me
Let me down
Let me
(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)
Let me
(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)

Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong
I know it's all over
But the last goodbye, oh
Let me down easy

Let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy
Let me down easy

Let me
Let me down
Let me

(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)
Let me down
(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)

(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, me down, oh)
(Me down, me down, me down, oh)
