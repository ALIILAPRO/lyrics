		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught in a never-ending game
Seems like the world's still trying to tame me
If that's tha way I will obey
Beautifully struggle everyday

Should we have a little kiss
While seeing both of our hourglasses
Let's make a plan to meet somewhere that is
Most far from 'goodbye'

Finally, the time has come
Everything up 'til yesterday was a prologue
Skimming through the days of old
It's my turn to bear the load

My experience and my skill
And all the courage I had let start to mildew
At an unprecedented speed I will
Dive right into you

And when I dozed off into a lukewarm can of soda I
Dreamed of a world so far from here
That's not on the map
Searching outside of the classroom window
Or in summer morning that's brought from the commuting train, oh

Words like 'tomorrow' or 'future' or 'fate'
No matter how far they extend their hands
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
In a timeless land that is far out of reach

Even the second, hour hands of the clock
They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
How I hope to have forever to spend
This life, no, all future lives
Right here in this world with you

Let's put away them far ahead
'How do you do's and all the 'Nice to meet you's
And breathe over a thousand year, cycle in a single day

How I hated lifeless world
That's made up entirely of dictionary words that
I saw through my kaleidoscope
On a monotonous August morn

When you appeared in front of me
You acted shy but I didn't miss your grinning face like
If it's the textbook of this world
Of how to make your smile on your face

I've been looking for 'incredible's, the meaning of 'unbelievable'
Even hope for tragedies if it goes with the thrill
But then you were standing in a front of my door
With every piece in your hand that I could ask for
Oh

Words like 'tomorrow' or 'future' or 'fate'
No matter how far they extend their hands
Let's breathe, and dream, we play together in this place
What do you say?

Even the way that you loved
I swear I could smell the scent of yours
And in the way that you walked
I could hear that bright laughter of yours

Since one day you will disappear
I'll keep every part of you
Make sure that it's burned into the back of my eyes
It's not a right that I'm due
My duty that is must have been kept

Words like 'tomorrow' or 'future' or 'fate'
No matter how far they extend their hands
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
In a timeless land that is far out of reach
Even the second, hour hands of the clock
They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
How I hope to have forever to spend
This life, no, all future lives
Right here in this world with you, oh, oh, ah
