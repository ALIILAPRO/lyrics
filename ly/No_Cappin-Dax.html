		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I mean, me personally, I've never been about the internet beef
Hm, just not for me, mhm

See me in the street, aim 'bout action
Nigga won't beef, put it in a caption
Nigga won't tweet, never 'bout rapping, I bring heat
Nigga I'm blastin', every beat
Nigga I'm snapping, bars on fleek
Nigga Kardashian, no retweet
Nigga no passin', get no sleep
Yeah nigga no cappin', no cappin', no cappin', no cappin'
Yeah nigga no cappin', no cappin', no cappin', no cappin'
See me in the street, aim 'bout action
Nigga won't beef, put it in a caption
Nigga won't tweet, never 'bout rapping, I bring heat
Nigga I'm blastin', every beat
Nigga I'm snapping, bars on fleek
Nigga Kardashian, no retweet
Nigga no passin', get no sleep
Yeah nigga no cappin'

Everyday I been on the road
Promised to my mama I would never sell my soul
To my dying day, 'til the boy got old
I don't give a fuck 'bout no silver or no gold
I'ma go back, no more I won't roll back
These niggas know that, they don't wanted no cap
I will not hold back, I been in my whole back
They made me so mad, fuckin' niggas so trash
Yeah, I been at you working, flippin' burgers
Mickey D's and dollar million service
Niggas used to flex on me, the same ones who be lurkin'
Cleaning up the game I changed the tide just like detergent
Trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
How you getting bodied by a janitory teeny nigga?
Should be bigger, ain't no co-sign but I still be killin' niggas
Check the figures yeah, you can check the figures (hm-hm)

See me in the street, aim 'bout action
Nigga won't beef, put it in a caption
Nigga won't tweet, never 'bout rapping, I bring heat
Nigga I'm blastin', every beat
Nigga I'm snapping, bars on fleek
Nigga Kardashian, no retweet
Nigga no passin', get no sleep
Yeah nigga no cappin', no cappin', no cappin', no cappin'
Yeah nigga no cappin', no cappin', no cappin', no cappin'
See me in the street, aim 'bout action
Nigga won't beef, put it in a caption
Nigga won't tweet, never 'bout rapping, I bring heat
Nigga I'm blastin', every beat
Nigga I'm snapping, bars on fleek
Nigga Kardashian, no retweet
Nigga no passin', get no sleep
Yeah nigga no cappin', no cappin', no cappin', no cappin'
Yeah nigga no cappin', no cappin', no cappin', no cappin'

Holy shit bro, that was hard
