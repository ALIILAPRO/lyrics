		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said, I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me, and I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry

Well, this ain't over
No, not here, not while I still need you around
You don't owe me, we might change, yeah
Yeah, we just might feel good

I wanna push you around
Well I will, well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for granted
Well, I wanna take you for granted, yeah
Yeah, well I will
I will

She said, I don't know why you ever would lie to me
Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me when my face don't seem to wanna shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty

Oh well, don't just stand there
Say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged
And you, you don't know me, yeah
Well, I can't change, no
Well, I won't do anything at all

I wanna push you around
Well I will, well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for granted, yeah
I wanna take you for granted, yeah
Yeah, well I will

Oh, but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute, well it kinda fell apart
Things get so crazy, crazy
Don't rush this, baby
Don't rush this baby, baby

I wanna push you around
Well I will, well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for granted, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna take you, take you
Yeah, well I will, I will, I will, I will, yeah
Well I will, I will, I will, yeah
Push you around and drag you down
I wanna push you around
Yeah, I will
