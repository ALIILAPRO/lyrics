		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember how I loved you?
Remember how you cared?
The space that's left between us
The distance makes me scared
Sometimes I'm left to wonder
How could we toughen up?
Sometimes I'm left to worry
We could have made it out
We could have made it out
Somehow my heart keeps sayin'
""I've never loved you more""
Tell me why my body's achin'
Tell me who I'm livin' for
Remember how you loved me?
Remember what we made?
Despite the who, you loved me
I'd be happy if you stayed
Somewhere in my mind
There is all the pain I left behind in your arms
It's where I'm meant to be
Somewhere in my mind
There is all the pain I left behind should have known
You've been my only home
You've been my only home
Somewhere in my mind
There is all the pain I left behind in your arms
It's where I'm meant to be
Somewhere in my mind
There is all the pain I left behind should have known
You've been my only home
You've been my only home
