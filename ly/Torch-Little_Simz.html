		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How you wanna try to beat the force?
I wanna try to feed the lore
You wanna be with me, of course
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?
See some more, see some more
See some more, see some more
Soul gonna rise when I leave this corpse
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?

Don't be afraid of the bounce
See when your tings level, gotta change the amount
How can I walk in doubt?
Never been a beg, never been a loudmouth
Pen can go for days
I'm obsessed with it, can't change my ways
So blessed with it, what can I say?
Top form, stayin' in shape (in shape)

How you wanna try to beat the force?
I wanna try to feed the lore (lore)
You wanna be with me, of course
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?
See some more, see some more
See some more, see some more
Soul gonna rise when I leave this corpse (yeah)
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?

I'm gonna run it up, don't you know your fun is up?
James knew back when I was comin' up
Didn't wanna then, now I bet they lovin' us
No more "um" and "uh", R&Rs, the bar is raised
If you know me, know I can bar for days
Nothin' left to prove 'cause I done enough, done enough
Lights out, still gonna keep the torch
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?

How you wanna try to beat the force?
I wanna try to feed the lore
You wanna be with me, of course
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?
See some more, see some more
See some more, see some more
Soul gonna rise when I leave this corpse
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?

Way, way, way, way back when
Back when
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?
(See some more, see some more, see some more, see some more)
They really wanna see shit from me now, yeah
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?

How you wanna try to beat the force?
I wanna try to feed the lore
You wanna be with me, of course
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?
See some more, see some more
See some more, see some more
Soul gonna rise when I leave this corpse
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?

See some, see some (yeah)
I never mind if people change
I wanna try and heal my pain
How do you buy what can't be sold?
How can you lie to me in my face?
In my face, in my face, in my face, in my face
Lights out, still gonna keep the torch
Show you likkle piece, wanna see some more?
