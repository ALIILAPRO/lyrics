		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go get angry at my honesty
Don't do too well with apologies
Run out of time, call a referee
I need one more shot at forgiveness
Made these mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean a hundred times
Let me redeem myself tonight
I need one more shot at forgiveness

Ah, is it too late to say sorry?
I need more than, I need more than your body
Is it too late to say sorry?
Is it too late to say sorry now?

(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh) too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh)
Too late to say sorry now
(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh) too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh)
Is it too late, too late?

I take the blame if you want me to
No innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, you'll go
I think we spill the truth
Say we forget this

Is it too late to say sorry?
I need more than, I need more than your body
Is it too late to say sorry?
Is it too late to say sorry now?

(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh) too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh)
Too late to say sorry now
(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh) too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh) too late

(Oh oh, oh) too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry now
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry now
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry now
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry now
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry now
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late to say sorry
(Oh oh, oh, Too late to say, too late)
Too late
