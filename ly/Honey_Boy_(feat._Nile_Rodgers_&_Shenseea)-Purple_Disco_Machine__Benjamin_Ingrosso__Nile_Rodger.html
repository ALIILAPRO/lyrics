		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and let me dive?
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and play me all night, night? All n-night
We could do whatev' you like
My-my, oh, my-my
Gimme something, gimme something

I was young, I never danced, would never dare
Because I thought I wasn't good enough
I never said a single word to any girl
I was afraid that I would mess it up
But then one day I saw her face
And the old me would walk away, but then I took a chance
Then she said, "Honey boy, you're too young
But let me give you a night you won't forget" (won't forget, oh, oh)

I can feel the magic every time I see her dance
Bet you like, bet you like how it's feeling, oh
Everyone around us watching as she takes my hand
I don't know, but I need it

My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and let me dive?
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and play me all night, night? All n-night
We could do whatev' you like (whatever you like)
My-my, oh, my-my
Gimme something, gimme something
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and let me dive?
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and play me all night, night? All n-night
We could do whatev' you like (whatever you like)
My-my, oh, my-my (yeah)
Gimme something, gimme something

When I woke up, I never knew
That it was you that I would see this early summer night (a summer night)
'Cause all my friends, they kept saying
"Ben, just wait, you know it ain't, it ain't your time tonight," yeah (time tonight)
You should have seen the jealous look on Danny's face
When she came and I walked up to her (you know I like it like that)
And then she said, "Honey boy
All your friends will never know the things that you will learn" (uh, you will learn)

Everyone around us watching as she takes my hand
I don't know, but I need it

My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and let me dive?
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and play me all night, night? All n-night
We could do whatev' you like (whatever you like)
My-my, oh, my-my
Gimme something, gimme something (yeah)
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and let me dive?
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and play me all night, night? All n-night
We could do whatev' you like (whatever you like)
My-my, oh, my-my (yeah)
Gimme something, gimme something

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

Everyone around us watching as I take your hand
Can't believe what I'm feeling

My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and let me dive?
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and play me all night, night? All n-night
We could do whatev' you like (whatever you like)
My-my, oh, my-my (yeah)
Gimme something, gimme something
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and let me dive?
My-my, oh, my-my
Won't you come and play me all night, night? All n-night
We could do whatev' you like (whatever you like)
My-my, oh, my-my (yeah)
Gimme something, gimme something
