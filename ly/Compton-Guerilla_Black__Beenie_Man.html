		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Zagga Zo
Ona-na-na-na
Guerilla Black where you from
Zagga

I'm strictly business, just like EPMD
I'm B-L-A-C-K from the C-P-T
Where they dip them cigarettes in P-C-P
And them broads they believe in me (Zo)
C-I-B, the magnum toting
Keep my enemies on I-V, once I toast them 
Just like my bagels
Have them like Christians over they head smoking halo 
Call me Plato, I philosoph-y
By the brick, then divided it up amongst my guys 
Then I called Lionel, the prince of the vinyl
Slow up and charge the game like a wild rhino
I know, no one else can do it better
Is you stupid nigga? Get your shit together

Badman 
Guerilla Blacks comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
Sending my message across the nation
'Cause I'm original Badman 
Yo, I'm original Badman 
And Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
'Cause we're original Badman

I like mine all black and like M&M
Not the regular ones, the one that's feminine
Entering my dojo, you lose your mojo
My karate chops in slow-mo
Fuck around and knock the hair up off your chest 
My shocks from your brain, threw a fucked up mess
Unless, I put the potato on the end of the barrel
And watch your soul fly with the sparrow 
Call me Pharaoh Guerilla, apparels is mink
And sometimes I wear Chinchillas (Zo)
Yes I'm the thriller
Whether I pop Cristal or drink Miller's
Turn wine coolers back to whine chillers
Yes I'm the illest, no one is like me
Naw, that's unlikely 

Badman 
Guerilla Blacks comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
Sending my message across the nation
'Cause I'm original Badman 
Yo, I'm original Badman 
And Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
'Cause we're original Badman

Meshach and Abednego
Me Black, wear Fendi clothes
Yes, they're many hoes 
Yes, they're many flows
The start of the destruction
Assisted by call of some percussion
To usher in a new millennium
My mind process raps like a Pentium
Anyone, anyhow, and anyway
Niggas get fucked up when the mini spray
Yes he went away with shells stuck up in his back
He fucked up with Black
Got hit up with the Mack
Best to stick to act, don't act nonchalant
Yeah I keep that hardware like I'm DuPont

Badman 
Guerilla Blacks comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
Sending my message across the nation
'Cause I'm original Badman 
Yo, I'm original Badman 
And Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
'Cause we're original Badman
Guerilla Blacks comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
Sending my message across the nation
'Cause I'm original Badman 
Yo, I'm original Badman 
And Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beenie Man is a Jamaican 
'Cause we're original Badman
