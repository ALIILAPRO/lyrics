		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watch it all change
Take the news of the day
And throw it away
Time will kill all the pain
Faith will cure the decay
Of all this blind ambition
The greed brings us together

Stay strong, stay true
Be brave, it all comes down to you

Try to just let it go
Know that justice moves slow
But it comes in the end
Rise the guilty will fall
Stay they can't take it all
They want the unimportant
It's love they leave behind

Stand up, aim true
Keep heart, the future looks to you

Every second you throw away
Every minute of every day
Don't get caught in a memory
'Cause life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

I'm watching the change
Who will carry the flame
It all feels very strange
Dreams of men can be good
Faith to live as we should
And know we're all connected
We give ourselves the power

Stay strong, stay true
Be brave, it all comes down to you

Every day that you wait you're falling faster
No sleight of hand, no twist of fate, no ever after
When it's gone it's gone, a fight to the bitter end
Life won't wait for you
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
