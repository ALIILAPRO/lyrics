		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The State, the government, the supreme, the eternal
The aggressor against the persons and property of the mass of the public
All states, everywhere
Whether democratic, dictatorial or monarchical
Whether red, white, blue or brown
The State

For centuries, the State has robbed people at bayonet point
and called it taxation
For centuries, the State has enslaved people into its armed battalions
and called it conscription

The State
The State

For centuries, the State has robbed people at bayonet point
and called it taxation
Coercion and violence by the direct threat of confiscation or imprisonment
This is taxation

The State

For centuries, the State has robbed people at bayonet point and called it taxation
For centuries, the State has enslaved people into its armed battalions and called it conscription

The State
The State
