		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Downtown, Saturday night
Haven't been here in a while
Strangers, neon lights
Jen is turning 25
c friend sees a friend and
Leaves me alone
c tap on my shoulder
You say hello

You already know my name
So we don't need an introduction
I already know where you're from
Once upon a time we were something
I knew you like the back of my hand
But everything has changed since then
So it's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you again

Backwards baseball cap
I guess you like the Mets these days
Rocks glass, are you drinking Jack?
I thought you didn't like the taste
It feels like the first time
cll over again
But this ain't the beginning
Cause we've seen the end

You already know my name
So we don't need an introduction
I already know where you're from
Once upon a time we were something
I knew you like the back of my hand
But everything has changed since then
So it's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you again

I wanna ask you about your family
But I don't know if it's my place
I wonder if you still hate small talk
But I don't know what else to say

You already know my name
So we don't need an introduction
I already know where you're from
Once upon a time we were something
I knew you like the back of my hand
But everything has changed since then
I know we can never be friends
But it's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you 
Yeah it's nice to meet you again
