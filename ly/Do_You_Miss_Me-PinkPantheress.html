		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, yeah
I can't let go of your hand
I can't even breathe without you
I don't think you understand
Oh, oh, yeah
Love to watch you as you speak
When you say the words I love you
Tell me when you fall asleep

Do you miss me, miss me? Ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah

Oh, oh, yeah
And we don't even get in fights
Went downstairs to make a coffee
In the morning how you like
Oh, oh, yeah
And all I wanted was to scream
When I saw one of her messages
That popped up on your screen

Do you miss me, miss me? Ah
Does she miss you too?
I can be discreet if you don't want her seeing you
With me on your arm 'cause I know you can't tell her yet (yeah)
Practice my I do's when I'm home 'cause I know I still want you

Do you miss me, miss me? Ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah
Miss me, miss me, ah

(Miss me, miss me, ah)
