		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey! Is this thing on?

I saw him dancing there
By the record machine
I knew he must have
Been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song
I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah, with me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah, with me

Singing I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take the time
And dance with me, owh

He smiled, so I got up
And asked for his name
"But that don't matter" he said
"Because it's all the same"
I said: "Can I take you home
Where we can be alone?"
And next we were moving on
And he was with me, yeah, with me
And we were moving on
And singing that same old song
Yeah, with me

Singing I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take the time
And dance with me, owh

I love rock and roll yeah
'Cause it soothes my soul yeah
I love rock and roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said, "Can I take you home
Where we can be alone?"
And next we were moving on
And he was with me, yeah, with me
And we were moving on
And singing that same old song
Yeah, with me

Singing: I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take the time
And dance with me, owh
I love rock and roll
(I love rock and roll)
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take the time
And dance with me (dance with me)
I love rock and roll (rock and roll)
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
(I said) I love rock and roll
(So dance with me)
So come on, take the time and
Dance with me (dance with me, oh)
I love rock and roll (rock and roll)
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take the time and
(Dance with me) Dance with me
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take the time and
Dance with me
