		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
It could be exciting
Excuse for a change
If we don't like the way we were

Oh
But nothing seems inviting
Except the image of your open arms
Calling back to me

I take you back
Yeah, I know it seems surprising
When there's lipstick still on the glass
And the full moon rising
But it's me who makes myself mad
I take you

Oh
My body does deceive me
Just as did yours
Though we're fighting different wars 
In our ways

Oh
But there's no pleasure in this resisting
So go ahead and kiss me

I take you back
Yeah, I know it seems surprising
When there's lipstick still on the glass
And the full moon rising
But it's me who makes myself mad
I take you

Once more
Once more
Once more
Once more
Once more
Once more
Once more

You know nothing would've needed deciding
Had you just simply asked

But the full moon rising
And it's me

I take you back
Yeah, I know it seems surprising
When there's lipstick still on the glass
And the full moon rising
But it's me who makes myself mad
I take you
