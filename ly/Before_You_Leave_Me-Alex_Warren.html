		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, handle me with care
Cover me in bubble wrap
I'm scared you really mean it
That you're never comin' back
See your bag right by the stairs
I guess you already packed
Know I can't change your mind
But how could you just leave like that?

Oh-uh, oh-uh, oh-oh
I'm not ready to let you go, so

Just give me one more night
Hold me like you're still mine
Oh, love me for right now
Before you leave me
I know it's gonna hurt
Watching your footsteps turn
So, love me for right now
Before you leave me

Oh, oh
Oh, love me for right now
Before you leave me
Oh, oh
Oh, love me for right now

I'm so used to getting damaged
And you know I hate this part
So, I gotta take advantage
Of a fully-broken heart
Won't you stay a little longer
Even if it's all pretend?
And maybe by the mornin'
I'll be ready for the end

Oh-uh, oh-uh, oh-oh
I'm not ready to let you go, so

Just give me one more night
Hold me like you're still mine
Oh, love me for right now
Before you leave me
I know it's gonna hurt
Watching your footsteps turn
So, love me for right now
Before you leave me

Oh, oh
Oh, love me for right now
Before you leave me
Oh, oh
Oh, love me for right now

Whoa-oh, got one foot out the door
Whoa-oh, 'cause you don't need me anymore (oh-oh-oh)
Whoa-oh, got one foot out the door
Whoa-oh, 'cause you don't need me anymore
You don't need me anymore
You don't need me anymore

Just give me one more night
Hold me like you're still mine
Oh, love me for right now
Before you leave me
I know it's gonna hurt
Watching your footsteps turn
So, love me for right now
Before you leave me

Oh, oh
Oh, love me for right now
Before you leave me
Oh, oh
Oh-ooh, love me for right now
