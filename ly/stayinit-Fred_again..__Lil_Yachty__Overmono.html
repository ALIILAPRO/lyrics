		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you
Gotta let the pain see more rain than most do
Realize every moment won't be perfect, but I do
Try all the mistakes that I made with you, with you
You do, you do, you do

You've got a life
You've got a life
You've got a life
Stay in it
You've got a life
You've got a life
You've got a life
Stay in it

You've got a-
You've got a-
You've got a-
You've got a-

I know you
Live by the sun, but always run into rain
Those opioids don't heal your pain, alright
Your pain, ah

You've got a life
You've got a life
You've got a life
Stay in it
You've got a life
You've got a life
You've got a life
Stay in it

Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
Stay in it, stay in it, stay in it, stay in it
