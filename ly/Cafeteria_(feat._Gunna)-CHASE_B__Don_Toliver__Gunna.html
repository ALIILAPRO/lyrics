		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A'ight, let me get, uh, the spicy yellow tail, need that, need that
What you said Don, you need the Wagyu tacos?
Let him get that
Uh, lobster tempura, always need that
You know what? Fuck it
Just bring a whole bunch of shit out 
And I'll tell y'all if I like it or not, come on

(Yo, Chase B)

I like my women in two, twos (two)
I get distracted, pockets fat with a new boo (baby)
At the cafeteria, call it Nobu (no cap)
Lil shawty sloppy, she ask for the Bluetooth
Ran into a wild dog, young Don got a loose screw (yeah, yeah)
I was gettin' the head, dawg, while lookin' for the Bluetooth
I made her blog about it, lil' shawty on YouTube (yeah, yeah)
Two freaks in one room, nigga, what would you do? (Get it)

Officer, I'm sorry, baby, I was throwin' those hundreds (I'm sorry)
Smoke blown in your face, I know you want all my money (I'm sorry)
Better read me my rights, you know Don ain't no dummy (I'm sorry)
I'm sorry (ooh), I'm sorry (ooh), I'm sorry (ooh), I'm sorry (ooh)
I get checks and I'm hard to impress, I dislike police, please
I'll be honest, I love my block (block) Don back in the streets (please)
The way my shit be rumblin', hungry, you need one of these (yeah, yeah)
Took me long enough (oh), lil' baby, to find all my keys (yeah)

I like my women in two, twos (two)
I get distracted, pockets fat with a new boo (baby)
At the cafeteria, call it Nobu (no cap)
Lil shawty sloppy, she ask for the Bluetooth
Ran into a wild dog, young Don got a loose screw (yeah, yeah)
I was gettin' the head, dawg, while lookin' for the Bluetooth
I made her blog about it, lil' shawty on YouTube (yeah, yeah)
Two freaks in one room, nigga, what would you do? (Get it)

Went and bought a new ring, set it on some new shoes (new shoes)
I kicked her out like Liu Kang, I couldn't play the fool (couldn't play the fool)
Young Wunna spittin' propane (ah), no way I can lose (way I could lose)
Hope I don't go insane (ah), we floatin' on 'shrooms (God)
Feel like somebody spinned the room (spinned the room)
I might try make an exit soon
Someone slipped me a X or two (X or two)
Pill go straight to my head
I don't know what I headed to (headed to)
Took the foreign and spin (let's go)
Look my nigga, my hands are pulled (hands are pulled)
Like her pussy, I'm wet (yeah)
She wan' come to the spot and have sex (yeah)
I know rappers, they mention Lenox (on God)
You a bird that ain't made it out the nest (yeah)
Hustle more, it'll bring you lots of stress (they did)
You're my ho, I'ma treat you to the best (yeah, yeah)
Marble floor, my house'll cost a jet (jet)
Feel like Floyd, hit backends on the jet (what you doin'?)
Ballin' hard like I play for the Knicks

I like my women in two, twos (two)
I get distracted, pockets fat with a new boo (baby)
At the cafeteria, call it Nobu (no cap)
Lil shawty sloppy, she ask for the Bluetooth
Ran into a wild dog, young Don got a loose screw (yeah, yeah)
I was gettin' the head, dawg, while lookin' for the Bluetooth
I made her blog about it, lil' shawty on YouTube (yeah, yeah)
Two freaks in one room, nigga, what would you do? (Get it)

(You do, you do, you do, you do)
(You do, you do, you do, you do)
(You do, you do, you do, you do)
What would you do? 
What would you do? 
M.W.A. Music
What would you do?
