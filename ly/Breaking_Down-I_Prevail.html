		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking down

Hate, every single second, minute, hour every day
Person in the mirror, they won't let me feel a thing
Keep me focused on my problems, I'm addicted to the pain
(Everybody's out to get you)

I guess I never noticed, how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion, but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless
They give me medicine
They give me medicine
They give me medicine

I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down (I think I'm breaking)
Down (I think I'm breaking)
I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down

Lies, every time they ask me, I just tell em that I'm fine
Try to hide my demons but they only multiply
Keep me runnin' from the voices on repeat inside my mind
(Everybody fucking hates you)

I guess I never noticed, how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion, but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless
But no one's listening
But no one's listening
But no one's listening

I think I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down (I think I'm breaking)
Down (I think I'm breaking)
I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down

I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself

I think I'm breaking down
