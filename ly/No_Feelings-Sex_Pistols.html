		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen you in the mirror
When the story began

And I fell in love with you.
I love yer mortal sin
Yer brains are locked away
But I love your company
I only ever leave you
When you got no money
I got no emotions for anybody else
You better understand
I'm in love with myself, myself
My beautiful self

I've no feeling, no feeling, no feeling
For anybody else

Hello and goodbye
And a run around Sue
You follow me around
Like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head
You got nothing to say
Get out of the way
'Cause I gotta get away
You never realize
I take the piss out of you
You come up and see me
And I'll beat you black and blue okay
I'll send you away

I got no feeling, no feeling, no feeling
For anybody else
Except for myself
My beautiful self-ish

There ain't no moonlight
After midnight
I see you selling people
Out looking for delight
Well I'm so happy
I'm feeling so fine
I'm watching all the rubbish
You're wasting my time
I look around your house
And there's nothing to steal
I kick you in the brains
When you get down to kneel and pray
You pray to your God

I've no feeling, no feeling, I got no feeling
For anybody else
I've no feeling, no feeling, no feeling
For anybody else
Except for myself
Your daddy's gone away
Be back another day
See his picture hanging on your wall
