		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it back to the start
No, I can't tell you apart
When we lost one another
That's when I rediscovered
My memories in the clouds
But no feet on the ground
'Cause I know I should forget you
Why can't I just regret you?

We were fighting fires every night when you met me
And it's not fair at all
So after everything

Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe
And forget about the mess we made?
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you
But you left me with the good stuff, babe
And I know that it's a crying shame
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you

Oh, I try to rewind
Every scene in my mind
And for you, I've got tunnel vision
And I've blocked out every collision
And in another life, yeah
Do me a favour and try
To leave me broken and bitter
So moving on's a little quicker

We were fighting fires every night when you met me
And it's not fair at all
So after everything

Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe
And forget about the mess we made?
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you
But you left me with the good stuff, babe
And I know that it's a crying shame
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you

Let me ask you why
I wonder if you're going through the same 
As I tonight

Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe
And forget about the mess we made?
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you

Oh, why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe
And forget about the mess we made?
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you
But you left me with the good stuff, babe
And I know that it's a crying shame
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you
When I don't hate you
