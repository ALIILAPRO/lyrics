		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over an ocean on a string
One more red-eye and I'll find my way
Back to Melbourne, was it LA?
Tap my window, wonder if you're awake

Lower me down
But don't let me land
Holding you now
Is just like holding water
Is just like holding rain

Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire 'til nothing is left
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire to come back again

I'm pure devotion, I'm gonna break
You spin a plastic lighter on my suitcase
Did you notice that you've changed?
Quiet while your eyes give you away

Lower me down
Don't let me land
Holding you now
Is just like holding water
Just like holding rain

Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire 'til nothing is left
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire to come back again

Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire 'til nothing is left
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire to come back again

Lowering me down, me down
Following myself into oblivion (throw it in the fire, throw it in the fire)
Lowering me down, me down (throw it in the fire, throw it in the fire)
Following myself into oblivion
