		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  you're pushing away and you're pulling me back in
you call it your love but it's somewhere you've never have been
you like to play games and you like to compete
But you know it doesn't work with me
i'm sorry that somebody left you feeling like this
and turned your world into apocalypse
if you'd let me i'll come closer
i'll show you we're all a bit broken yeah

How can someone make me so shy
Lost in the words and I’m tongue tied
believe me i wait for you
Still telling me beautiful white lies
No ocean is deeper than ur eyes
Believe me I wait for you

I keep on singing the same song
keep on repeating the same wrongs
Stuck in my head
Like you never left
Should let you go but I hold on
still keep on hearing the same song
going to bed with the lights on
Stuck in my head
I’m seeing red
Should let you go but I hold on

you know that I'm done and right now I just gotta Choose me
Sick of the shame when I make u Priority
Ur fake shit, I hated it , it’s all tattooed on my brain shit
Nah

How can someone make me so shy
Lost in the words and I’m tongue tied
believe me i wait for you
Still telling me beautiful white lies
No ocean is deeper than ur eyes
Believe me I wait for you

I keep on singing the same song
keep on repeating the same wrongs
Stuck in my head
Like you never left
Should let you go but I hold on
still keep on hearing the same song
going to bed with the lights on
Stuck in my head
I’m seeing red
Should let you go but I hold on
Same Song x 6
