		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I fall too deep, will I come back 'round?
I can barely see, but I hear the sound
When you're up so high, you can't find the ground
Yeah, it's hard to breathe when you're upside down

When you're upside down

When you're up so high, you can't find the ground
Yeah, it's hard to breathe when you're upside down

If I fall too deep, will I come back 'round?
I can barely see, but I hear the sound
When you're up so high, you can't find the ground
Yeah, it's hard to breathe when you're upside down
When you're upside down
When you're upside down
When you're upside down
When you're upside down
When you're upside down

When you're upside down

When you're upside down
