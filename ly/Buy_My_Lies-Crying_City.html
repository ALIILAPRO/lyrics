		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Countless times I have died
Saw you alone again
Waiting as the world moves past us
You've never been alone for long
Crying all day won't make you strong
Maybe it's time to say goodbye
Please move on now
Let's go back to being strangers

Can't you hear me breaking away
I hate it when you kiss me when I'm not even alive
Tried to lie that I got better
You don't buy my lies like they do
I can't deny that I mind
I cried myself to sleep again
I cried myself to sleep again to see the way it ends

I know you never mind
When I don't text you back
Don't you see what's wrong with that
Care to join me one last dance
Tell me did it hurt you bad

I still whisper your name all day
Hoping you will find me again

Can't you hear me breaking away
I can't deny that I mind
I cried myself to sleep again
