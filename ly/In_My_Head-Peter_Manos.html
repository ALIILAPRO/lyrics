		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's not the same
But I feel it any way
Tell me if that's okay
No, I'll be on my way
Should've known, now I feel insane
Am I insane?

I've waited way too long
Yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong
I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame, you see

Ooh-ooh you're in my head
And I keep on forgettin'
Ooh-ooh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-ooh I know, I know you've changed
You don't feel the same
Ooh-ooh, you're in my head

You say it's all alright
But you're not who's up at night
You'll probably say "we tried"
This feels like all a lie
While you tend to try and hide
Your hold has got me tight

I've waited way too long
Yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong
I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame, you see

Ooh-ooh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgettin'
Ooh-ooh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-ooh I know, I know you've changed
You don't feel the same
Ooh-ooh, you're in my head

And nothing else is right
You're laced inside my mind
I'm holding on, I know it's wrong
But I can't see your side
And everything has changed
You're only in my brain
I can't seem to let this be
But I guess I'll refrain

Ooh-ooh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgettin'
Ooh-ooh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-ooh I know, I know you've changed
You don't feel the same
Ooh-ooh, you're in my head
