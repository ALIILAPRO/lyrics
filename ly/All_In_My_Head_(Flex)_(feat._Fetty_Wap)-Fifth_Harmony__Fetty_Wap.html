		  Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head

I wanna flex with you baby
I'm tryna chill with you
Throwing bills at you
While we flexing boo, baby
Show me some different moves
And I love your groove
'Cause it's meant to be baby
Ayy, make history baby
And you the one for me
And I'm the one for you
So come flex with me, baby

Curtains like waves closing in all around us
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us
So tongue and cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin and it's leavin' me hopeless

I wanna feel you un- feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un- feel you un

Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah

Curtains like waves closing in all around us
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us, no no
So tongue and cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin, and you're leaving me hopeless

I wanna feel you un- feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un- feel you un

Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing (it's all in my head, yeah)

I want you to come flex with me, baby
You got what I want and I need it
Said you're a bad motherfucker and I'm sayin'
They can't flex with us and you know it
I take a hundred thousand and blow it
Ayy, another hundred tho' on that Rover
Ayy, come flex with Zoo till it's over
Ayy, come flex with Zoo till it's over

I wanna feel you un- feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un- feel you un

Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah

I wanna flex with you, baby
Hey, it's all in my head
Zoovier, baby
It's all in my head
I wanna flex with you, baby
It's all in my head
Baby
It's all in my head
