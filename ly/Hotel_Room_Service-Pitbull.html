		  DJ (Lil Jon)
I want everybody to stop what they're doing (Mr. 305)
Now if you know you're with somebody 
That you gon' take the hotel room tonight
Make some noise

Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend 
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends 
And meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend 
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends 
And meet me at the hotel room

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

She like that freaky stuff
Two in the O, one in the eye
That kinky stuff, you nasty
But I like your type 
And like T.I., it's whatever you like
Bring your girls, it's whatever the night
Your man just left
I'm the plumber tonight
I check your pipes
Oh, you're the healthy type
Well, here goes some egg whites

Now gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Let me tell you what we gon' do
Two plus two, I'm gonna undress you
Then we're gonna go three and three 
You gon' undress me
Then we're gon' go four and four
We gon' freak some more, but first

Forget about your boyfriend 
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends 
And meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend 
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends 
And meet me at the hotel room

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

After party in the hotel lobby
Then we off to the room like vroom
Put them fingers in yo' mouth 
Girl open up yo blouse
And pull that G-string down south, ooh 
Okay shawty
One's company, two's a crowd
And three's a party
Ya girl ain't with it, I got somebody (haha)
And by nature she's naughty (wooh)

Now gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Let me tell you what we gon' do
Two plus two, I'm gonna undress you
Then we're gonna go three and three 
You gon' undress me
Then we're gon' go four and four
We gon' freak some more, but first

Forget about your boyfriend 
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends 
And meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend 
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends 
And meet me at the hotel room

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
