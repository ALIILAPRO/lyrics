		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two girls kissing in the kitchen, bottles on the way
An empty house that you don't live in but it's where you stay
In the city of some angels but the devils in LA
You throw some money on the bed so they know where to lay

Used to
Dream of nights where you would
Be up in the hills
Flirting with your fate or just a nightmare wearing heels
I can get you higher
Than every single pill
No, we won't get to heaven but I'll show you how it feels


And it
Feels like this night keeps going but it's only been hours
Want you in my bed on the floor to the counter then the shower
Baby won't be there when you need me most
Maybe you should treat me like I'm solid gold


Tell me how you like it
Money, power, fame and more
I can leave my clothes right by the mattress on the floor
You've been cutting corners but be useful, cut some lines
He tells me that he loves me
I told him I'd rather die.

Dream of nights where you would
Be up in the hills
flirting with your fate or just a nightmare wearing heels

I can get you higher
Than every single pill
No, we won't get to heaven but Ill show you how it feels


Feels like this night keeps going but its only been hours
Want you in my bed on the floor to the counter than the shower
Baby won't be there when you need me most
Maybe you should treat me like I'm solid gold
