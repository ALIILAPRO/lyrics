		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Half away from having dreams
On a Sunday, Sunday night
Walking all alone in the streets
On a Sunday, Sunday night

But then an angel passed me by
A little angel made me sigh
Just when I wanted you
A dream came true called love

I want to hear your heartbeat
Want to feel what you need
Let me stay tonight
By your side, by your side

I want to hear your heartbeat
Share your dreams when you're asleep
Let me hold you tight
In the night, in the night

I don't want to waste one second
Without your lovin'
Without you Sunday girl
You only got to reach out

Reach out to taste my lovin'
Want you so Sunday girl
Oh, I really want you
Heaven sent you down to me

On a Sunday, Sunday night
To rescue me from misery
On a Sunday, Sunday night
You made me leave the past behind

I've got you always on my mind
Just when I wanted you
A dream came true called love
I want to hear your heartbeat

Want to feel what you need
Let me stay tonight
By your side, by your side
I want to hear your heartbeat

Share your dreams when you're asleep
Let me hold you tight
In the night, in the night
I don't want to waste one second

Without your lovin'
Without you Sunday girl
You only got to reach out
Reach out to taste my lovin'

Want you so Sunday girl
Oh, I really want you (want you)
Want to hear your heartbeat
Want to feel what you need

Let me stay tonight
By your side, by your side
I want to hear your heartbeat
Share your dreams when you're asleep

Let me hold you tight
In the night, in the night
I don't want to waste one second
Without your lovin'
Without you Sunday girl

You only got to reach out
Reach out to taste my lovin'
Want you so Sunday girl
Oh, I really want you (want you)
