		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wanna keep it a secret, and hold it to her ear
But she invading all my space yeah
But I like it when you here
Girl there's some reasons, you love it when I'm there
So don't fall asleep yet, Ima show you how I care

I'm what you want, and what you need
Won't tell a soul,
Its safe with me me me
Its safe with me me me
It's safe with me me me
It's safe with me me me
I'm what you want, and what you need

I'm popping in my city, don't be acting silly
She said fuck me like you miss me, kiss me like you need me
cin't nobody watching I know how you like to freak me
Dancing on the ceiling, play it like a CD
Candles and some feelings, It's a sauna how it's steamy
Water like it's Fiji, Ima tag it like graffiti girl
I know I know,
Ima show you how I care

I'm what you want, and what you need
Won't tell a soul,
Its safe with me me me
Its safe with me me me
It's safe with me me me
It's safe with me me me
I'm what you want, and what you need
