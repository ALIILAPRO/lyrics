		  (Brrat, brrat)
(Brrat, brrat)
(Yeah, brrat)
(Yeah, I'm on shit, okay, okay)

Yeah, I'm on shit (go, go)
I was taking trips to LA, tryna hit (hit)
That money getting spent (fah)
I'm on shit (yeah)
Hoes on me, they think I'm the shit (I'm the shit, go, I'm the shit)
I'ma keep it player (Yeah)
Come through popping shit off, hell yeah (hell yeah, yeah)
I'm not with them niggas, don't catch me there (don't catch me there, go)
I went and dropped that bag, 'cause I don't care (I don't care, yeah)

Don't give a fuck about them (yeah)
No, we not living like them
Flex, like I'm at a gym (yeah)
I'm really feeling like him (yeah)
I don't got time for nobody (go)
Fashion all on my body (let's go)
Action, niggas gon' slide (go)
Niggas pulled up, niggas slide (slide)
Niggas pulled up, niggas slide (slide)
Niggas pulled up, niggas slide (yeah)
Niggas pulled up, niggas slide (yeah)
Niggas pulled up, niggas slide (go)
I know it's gon' be alright (go)
I don't believe in the hype (nah, nah)
Remember that money was tight (yeah)
And that's when my money got right (yeah)

Yeah, I'm on shit (yeah, shit)
I was taking trips to LA, tryna hit (hit)
That money getting spent (okay, fire)
I'm on shit (grah, go)
Hoes on me, they think I'm the shit (I'm the shit, go, I'm the shit)
I'ma keep it player (brah)
Come through popping shit off, hell yeah (hell yeah, yeah)
I'm not with them niggas, don't catch me there (don't catch me there, go)
I went and dropped that bag, 'cause I don't care (I don't care, yeah)

I went and dropped that bag, 'cause I don't give a damn
Ain't gotta drop that bag, 'cause I know my boys go ham
I'm in L.A. , fuckin' up on a bitch, tryna catch it on cam
These niggas, they hate because I got all of this and they still sellin' gram
And I got a milf bitch with a Lamb'
She wanna fuck, I'm like, "Yes, ma'am"
I'm swagging it up, I'm feeling like Bam
My Glocky untucked, no, my shit don't jam
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a damn
If a nigga try me, better watch his whole fam
I got demons by me and I'm ready to blam
I been testin' these niggas, feel like Uncle Sam
In L.A. everyday, like I play for the Rams

Yeah, I'm on shit (go)
I was taking trips to LA, tryna hit (hit)
That money getting spent (okay, fah)
I'm on shit (grra, go)
Hoes on me, they think I'm the shit (shit, go)
I'ma keep it player (bwaa)
Come through popping shit off, hell yeah (hell yeah, yeah)
I'm not with them niggas, don't catch me there (don't catch me there, go)
I went and dropped that bag, 'cause I don't care (I don't care, go)

Go
