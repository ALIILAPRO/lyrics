		  (BL show 'em how it's done)

Big fish
Probably see me out in public with the wifey, she a thick bih
How you livin', I've been checking everything off the wish list (check, check, check)
Never telling what I'm on, you might end up on a hit list
Hundred fifty in a week, boy, I came up on a big league

Ain't been on radio in years how the fuck a nigga still rich
Keep it low and get the money, mind your business and your life shift, I'm outchea
You claiming that it's your year, 'til I appear
Stackin' I gotta feed the babies, and feed the people
Everything that I drop is ether, they want the secret
Hold up, you know we out the country, I'm smokin' shisha
Politickin' with pretty women, it's intermission

You so crazy

Big fish
Probably see me out in public with the wifey, she a thick bih
How you livin', I've been checking everything off the wish list (check, check, check)
Never telling what I'm on, you might end up on a hit list
Hundred fifty in a week, boy, I came up on a big league

Put that simple shit aside I'm gon' pull up in some big shit
Over lit, praying on my downfall, get over it
'Fore you count up the 4, 5, I'm in the 6
Play with me or you play with mine, I gotta blitz
Young and just out here doing me, it's to the T
Sippin' on Pino gri', like mami you ven aqui
Pulling back all the curtains and all you see is the beach
Wire just got the clearance, I'm tryna' fuck up the streets
Shorty say it's a river I'm tryna' fuck her to sleep
She calling me, she call a nigga

Big fish
Probably see me out in public with the wifey, she a thick bih
How you livin', I've been checking everything off the wish list (check, check, check)
Never telling what I'm on, you might end up on a hit list
Hundred fifty in a week, boy, I came up on a big league

Big fish

(Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant)
