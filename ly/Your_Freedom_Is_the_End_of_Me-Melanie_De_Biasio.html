		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I own you, damn you
How could you go
Twist it sick
But I'm on the floor
Come rescue me

Tears ain't blood but, oh, how they flow
Reason's pleading, "tell me no more"
Get it to me

I should have carried a leash to your soul
But now I've lost control
In there, you wander aimlessly

For you, that freedom's your goal
But I'm telling you
Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)
Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)

Ducking, dodging, stalking your prey
Such a kidder, just another day
No sympathy

No sleep, can't eat, I'm skin and bones
I feel the jones, please come home
It's getting late

Can't eat enough, I just swallow them whole
And at the scene of every crime you leave
I'm an accessory

For you, I see that freedom's your goal
But I'm telling you
Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)
Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)

I see you refused right by the stove
Conquests, exploits, I'm still alone
Warm cup of tea

And so I rise to claim what is mine
You'll get the drop every time
This kind of evil has a recipe

For you, I see that freedom's your goal
But I'm telling you
Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)
Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)

Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)
Your freedom is the end of me
(Your freedom is the end of me)
