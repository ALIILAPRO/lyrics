		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  End post floatin' on a southbound breeze
Somewhere between heaven and tall pine trees
Heartland I'm missin' you

Guitar playin' through the night
It felt pretty good yeah I'm feelin' alright
As good as one for the price of two

It's been along time gone
Since the truths been told
And I've seen my home

Hey Curtis Loew
Come on save my soul
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd

Buy me a ticket Lord put me on a train
Don't matter how I go I'll even walk through the rain
Southland I'm missin' you

Well the sky is high and the moon is low
I found some country tunes playin' on the radio
And I know that I'm there, Lord I know I'm there

It's been a long time gone
Since the truths been told
And I've seen my home

Hey Curtis Loew
Come on save my soul
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd

It's been a long time gone
Since the truths been told
And I've seen my home

Hey Curtis Loew
Come on save my soul
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd
With a bar, guitar and a honky tonk crowd
