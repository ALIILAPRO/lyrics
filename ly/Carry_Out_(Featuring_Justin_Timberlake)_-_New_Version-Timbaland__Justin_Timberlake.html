		<p>
		  Eh eh eh
Baby, you're looking fire hot
I'll have you open all night like an Ihop
I take you home baby let you keep me company
You gimme some of you, I give you some of me
You look good, baby must taste heavenly
I'm pretty sure that you got your own recipe
So pick it up, pick it up, yeah I like you
I just can't get enough I got to drive through
Cause is me, you, you, me, me, you all night
Have it your, way, foreplay
Before I feed your appetite
Let me get my ticket baby, let me get in line
I can tell the way you like, baby, super size
Hold on, you got yours, let me get mine
I ain't leave until they turn over the close sign
Check it

Take my order cause your body like a
Carry out
Let me walk into your body until you
Hear me out
Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out
Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out
Take my order cause your body like a
Carry out
Let me walk into your body until this
Light's out
Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out
Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out

Number one, I'll take two number three's
That's a whole lot of you and a side of me
Now is a fool of myself to want you full of me
And if its room for dessert then I want a piece
Baby get my order right, no errors
I'm a touch you on the right areas
I can feed you, you can feed me
Girl deliver that to me, come see me
'Cause is me, you, you, me, me, you all night
Have it your, way, foreplay
Before I feed you appetite
Do you like it well done, 'cause I do it well
Cause I'm well seasoned if you couldn't tell
Now let me walk into your body until you hear me out
And turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out say
Take my order cause your body like a (carry out)
Let me walk into your body until you (hear me out)
Gimme all

Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out
Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out
Take my order cause your body like a
Carry out
Let me walk into your body until this
Light's out
Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out
Turn me on, my baby don't you
Cut me out
Cut me out

What's your name?
What's your number?
I'm glad I came
Can you take my order?
