		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come ride with me
Through the veins of history
I'll show you a God
Who falls asleep on the job

And how can we win
When fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time
Or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
