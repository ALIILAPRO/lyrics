		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go, go, go, go, go
I just go, racks, pick up that load, uh
Swag, designer my clothes
These niggas don't want no smoke, yeah
All of my niggas on go
Fuckin' on all of these hoes, yeah
All of these bitches on go
I got all of these bitches on go

I got all of these bitches on lit
Shawty fell in love with my swag
now she rockin' Balenci' and Rick
I just fell in love with this cash
she like, "Ooh, that young nigga rich"
And my hundreds blue like Lilo and Stitch
You make a wrong move, my guy got a switch
I won't hesitate, I'ma let that bitch go
Bitch, we shoot first, we ain't fightin' no more
If we can't get 'em, we kidnap his ho
Hold 'em for ransom, ain't lettin' 'em go
All of these niggas be stealin' my flow
Hold up, these niggas kidnappin' my swag
Catch a fuck-nigga outside, down bad
Bitch, I'm rockin' an upside down cross
Yeah, this how I get down, this ain't no swag
It's Opium gang, yeah, we do no flagging
But if it was, I'd be red ragging
My Piru partner pulled up, he like, "What's brackin'?"
He gon' send at your skull if you ask him, "What's crackin'?"
Bitch, I'm off that G6, yeah, that's why I'm jet laggin'
Bitch, I'm too high, yeah, that's why I'm jet laggin'
Got a new vibe, she pull up in G Wagons
Bitch, she too fire, yeah, she into fashion

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, uh
I just go, racks, pick up that load, uh
Swag, designer my clothes
These niggas don't want no smoke, yeah
All of my niggas on go
Fuckin' on all of these hoes, yeah
All of these bitches on go
I got all of these bitches on go
