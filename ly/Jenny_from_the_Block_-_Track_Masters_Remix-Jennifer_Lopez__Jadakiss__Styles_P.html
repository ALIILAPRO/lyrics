		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Children grow and women produce and
Men go working, some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

L-O-X, yeah (Southside Bronx)
J Lo, yeah (Southside Bronx)
Yo, yo

We off the block this year
Went from a little to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Yeah, we at the airport out
D-Block, from the block where everybody Air Forced out
With a new white tee, you fresh
Nothin' phony with us
Make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us (Southside Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)

From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J.Lo to this, headline clips
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told you (I'm real)
I'm really been on Oprah (I'm real)
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got (Southside Bronx)
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)

I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing, kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real (real)
To me it's like breathing (Southside Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from

It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, they're assets
You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while, you'll know who to blend with
Just keep it real with the ones you came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J.Lo (Everyone's got to make a living)
They act like they don't but they know

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx)
