		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes
Come to me
Feel all right
Just dance with me all through the night

Turn it out
Close to you
I feel good
Cause I just know feeling of you
Give it to me baby

Feel all right
I feel good
Just want you to step with me dance with me
Here with me feel all right
I feel good on you
All right
To make a groove all night

Close your eyes
Come to me
Feel all right
Just dance with me all through the night

Turn it out
Close to you
I feel good
Cause I just know feeling of you
Give it to me baby

Feel all right
I feel good
Just want you to step with me dance with me
Here with me feel all right
I feel good on you
All right
To make a groove all night

Feel all right
I feel good
Just want you to step with me dance with me

Feel all right
I feel good on you
All right
To make a groove all night

Close your eyes
Come to me
Close your eyes
