		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born a fool
Broken all the rules
Huh

Seeing all null
Denying all of the truth
Huh

Everything has changed
It all happened for a reason
Down from the first stage
It isn't something we fought for

Never wanted this kind of pain
Turned myself so cold and heartless
But one thing you should know

Kowe ra iso mlayu saka kesalahan Ajining diri ana ing lathi

Pushing through the countless pain
And all I know that this love's a bless and curse

Everything has changed
It all happened for a reason
Down from the first stage
It isn't something we fought for

Never wanted this kind of pain
Turned myself so cold and heartless
But one thing you should know

Kowe ra iso mlayu saka kesalahan Ajining diri ana ing lathi
