		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh
I won't let it control me
I won't let it control me

And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let her control me
No, I won't let her control me
And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
And I won't let her control me
No, I won't let her control me

Now I'm just a ghost in my own life
So make the most of this goodbye
Do you still dream about me late at night?
Or are you out there livin' better times?
You know it's killin' me to let go
I see your face but it's someone I don't know
Everything was perfect just an hour ago
Will you remember me tomorrow?

And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
And I won't let it control me

And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
And I won't let it control me
Oh, I won't let it control me
