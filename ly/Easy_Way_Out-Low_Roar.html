		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard you call my name
While I'm passing out
The mistake I've made
It can't be turned around

I took the easy way out
I took the easy way out
I took the easy way out

I went one for one
Before casting out
The mistake I've made
It can't be turned around

I took the easy way out
I took the easy way out
I took the easy way out

I wanna feel something again memorable
I wanna feel something again memorable

I wanna feel something again memorable
I wanna feel something again memorable
