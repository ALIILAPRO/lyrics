		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can have a sound of the thousand voices calling your name
You can have the light of the world blind you, bathe you in grace
But I don't see so easily what you hold in your hands
'Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall and turn into sand

You can be an angel of mercy or give in to hate
You can try to fight it, just like every other careless mistake
How do you justify? I'm mystified by the ways of your heart
With a million lies, the truth will rise to tear you apart
Whoa

No one gets out alive, every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love, how did you love?
It's not what you believe those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love, how did you love, how did you love?

Nothing ever feels the quite same when you are what you dreamed
And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see
How we forget ourselves, lose our way from the cradle to the grave
You can't replicate or duplicate, gotta find your own way 

No one gets out alive, every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love, how did you love?
It's not what you believe those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love, how did you love, how did you love?

This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury, we are the judge and jury

No one gets out alive, every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love, how did you love?
It's not what you believe those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees

How did you love, how did you love?

This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury

How did you love, how did you love?
How did you love, how did you love?
How did you love, how did you love?
How did you love, how did you love?
