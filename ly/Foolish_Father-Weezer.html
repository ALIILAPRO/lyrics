		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Simple love songs
Drenched in poisons
I've been out of long

Hesitate to throw your stones
When criminals are victims
Looking back into our past
There's no cause for these symptoms now

Forgive your foolish father
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter
He'd do anything for you

Think of how destroyed he feels
Walking to his grave plot
Knowing that the one he loves
Hates him with all of her heart

Forgive your foolish father
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter
He'd do anything for you

Please Remember your dad
Although he's been astray
How comical
The stuff that makes a man

Forgive your foolish father
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter
He'd do anything for you

Anything for you, anything for you
Anything, anything, anything for you
Anything for you

Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
