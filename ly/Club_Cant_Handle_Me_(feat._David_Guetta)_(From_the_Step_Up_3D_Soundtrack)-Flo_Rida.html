		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
The club can't even handle me right now

Hey
I own the night and I don't need no help
Gotta be the feeling that Scarface player
Stuntin' go wild can't handle this plan
Life of the club arrogant like, yeah
Top like money all the girls just melt
Want so many all know me like Twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, Models, standin' on chairs
Fall out cause that's the business
All out it's so ridiculous
Zone out so much attention
Scream out I'm in the building (hey)
They watchin' I know this
I'm rockin' I'm rolling
I'm holding, I know it
You know it

You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
The club can't even handle me right now

Hey
Still feelin' myself I'm like outta control
Can't stop now more shots lets go
Ten more rounds can I get a K-O
Paparazzi trying to make me pose
Came to party 'til I can no more
Celebrate cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin' off their clothes
Grand finale' like Super Bowl
Go hard run the show
That's right wild out got money to blow
More lights more ice when I walk in the door
No hype I do it big all over the globe
Yeah!
I said it
Go tell it
Confetti
Who ready?
I'm ready
You ready?
Let's get it

You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)

You got me watchin' now (hey)
Got my attention now (hey)
Got everybody in the club wanting to know now
I am a ladies man
Come be my lady and
We can ball, so, ah
Bring ya body here let me switch up your atmosphere
Take you out of this club and in my new Lear
Fly you all around the world
What you want, baby girl
Are you ready to go now

You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
Let's celebrate now
(Put your hands up)
You know who shut it down
