		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I lost my head
And fell right back into your love
I lay intoxicated while angels circled high above

Deep in a perfect moment
All at once it feels so right
But when I wake I see reality turn back and bite

Ah, hah-ah hah-ah
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah

Your heartbeats ticking
And your cool starts dripping
And your tongue tied up on the phone

Your backbones breaking
And your smooth starts shaking
Like you can't stand being alone

Your cot starts rocking
Little doubts start knocking
Like the whole worlds slipping away

Attentions killing
But the ride is thrilling
But you can't help going again

What you want is what you don't know
Turn me on and watch your ego
What you want is what you don't need
Stand up when your talking to me

I can't start giving you up
I'm lost without you
Can't stop tickin' the tock
I can't start giving you up
I'm mad about you
Can't stop slipping it off

I can't start giving you up
I'm lost without you
Can't stop tickin' the tock
I can't start giving you up
I'm mad about you
Can't stop slipping it off

A girls got to suffer for fashion
She knows what her body can do-ooh-ooh
She finds a man and she makes it her passion
I'm happy trying all the time with a boy like you

A girls got to suffer for fashion
She knows what her body can do, ooh-ooh
She finds a man and she makes it her passion
I'm happy trying all the time with a boy like you

I can't start giving you up
I'm lost without you
I can't start giving you up
I'm mad about you

I can't start giving you up
I'm lost without you
Can't stop tickin' the tock
I can't start giving you up
I'm mad about you
Can't stop slipping it off

I can't start giving you up
I'm lost without you
Can't stop tickin' the tock
I can't start giving you up
I'm mad about you
Can't stop slipping it off

Ah, hah-ah hah-ah
