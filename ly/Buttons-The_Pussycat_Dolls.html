		  I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)

Typical
Hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me asking for more
I'm a sexy mama (mama)
Who knows just how to get what I want and (want and)
What I want to do is spring this on you (on you)
Back up all of the things that I told you (told you)

You been saying all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off
Baby, can't you see
How these clothes are fitting on me
And the heat coming from this beat?
I'm about to blow
I don't think you know

I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)

You say you're a big boy
But I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had
Ain't been put on me
I wonder
If I'm just too much for you
Wonder
If my kiss don't make you just
Wonder
What I got next for you
What you want to do? (do)

Take a chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see, just like most guys that your game don't please
Baby, can't you see
How these clothes are fitting on me
And the heat coming from this beat?
I'm about to blow
I don't think you know

I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)

Come on, baby, loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Baby, won't you loosen up my buttons, babe?
Loosen up my buttons, babe

Come on, baby, loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Baby, won't you loosen up my buttons, babe?
Loosen up my buttons, babe

I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)

I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, baby (uh huh)
But you keep fronting (uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (uh)
