		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't lie
But your bodies got me feeling under pressure
Under pressure babe
Tell me lies, tell me lies
It don't matter when I'm drowning in your pleasure
It feels electric, babe

So deep
It's in my veins I feel the pain
So, please
Don't play those games, don't play with me

Yeah
I need just a bit of sweet love
And not your bittersweet love
I need just a bit of sweet love
Not your bittersweet love
Give me just a bit of sweet love
Not your bittersweet love
I need just a bit of sweet love
Not your bittersweet

Yeah, and I could eulogize
About the way look in the red light
You're a killer (you're a killer)
Yeah, it's a thriller, babe (it's a thriller)
Tell me why, tell me why
Do you feel the need to run me through the ringer
When I'm hook line and sinker, babe

So deep
It's in my veins, I feel the pain
So, please
Don't play those games (don't play)
Don't play with me

Yeah
I need just a bit of sweet love
Not your bittersweet love
I need just a bit of sweet love
Not your bittersweet

I need just a bit of sweet love
Not your bittersweet love
I need just a bit of sweet love (just a bit of love)
Not your bittersweet love
Give me just a bit of sweet love (sweet love)
Not your bittersweet love
I need just a bit of sweet love (bit of sweet love)
Not your bittersweet
I need just a bit of sweet love (I need a little bit, just a bit of your love)
Not your bittersweet love (oh, just a little bit of love)
I need just a bit of sweet love
Not your bittersweet love (just a bit of your love)
Give me just a bit of sweet love (give me, just need a bit of your love)
Not your bittersweet love (oh, just a little bit of love)
I need just a bit of sweet love (oh, your bittersweet love)
Not your bittersweet, ooh
