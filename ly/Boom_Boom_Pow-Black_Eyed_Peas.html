		  Gotta get that
Gotta get that
Gotta get that
Gotta get that-that-that, that-that

Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)

Boom boom boom
That boom boom boom
That boom boom boom
Boom boom

Yo
I got that hit to beat the block
You can get that bass on below
I got that rock 'n' roll
That future flow

That digital spit
Next level visual shit
I got that (boom boom boom)
How the beat bang (boom boom boom)

I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 3008
You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now

Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)

Boom boom boom
That boom boom boom
That boom boom boom
Boom boom boom

I'm on that supersonic boom
Y'all hear that spaceship zoom
When-when I step inside the room, them girls go apeshit, uh
Y'all stuck on Super 8 shit
That lo-fi stupid 8-bit
I'm on that HD flat
This beat go boom boom bap

I'm a beast when you turn me on
Into the future, Cybertron
Harder, faster, better, stronger
Sexy ladies, extra longer, 'cause
We got the beat that bounce
We got the beat that pounds
We got the beat, that 808
That boom boom in your town

People in the place
If you wanna get down
Put your hands in the air
will.i.am drop the beat now

Yep, yep
I be rockin' them beats (yep, yep)
I be rockin' them beats (yep, yep, yep, yep, ha, ha, ha)

Here we go, here we go
Satellite radio
Y'all getting hit with the (boom boom)
Beats so big, I'm steppin' on leprechauns
Shittin' on y'all with the (boom boom)
Shittin' on y'all with the (boom boom)
Shittin' on y'all with the
This beat be bumpin', bumpin'
This beat go boom boom

Let the beat rock
Let the beat rock
Let the beat rock

This beat be bumpin', bumpin'
This beat go boom boom

I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 3008
You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now

Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)

Boom boom boom
That boom boom boom
That boom boom boom
Boom boom boom

Let the beat rock (let the beat rock)
Let the beat rock (let the beat)
Let the beat rock (let the beat rock, rock, rock, rock)
