		  Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da
Wish you the worst
Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da
Wish you the worst

I think you owe me an apology, yeah
Ever since I was a little kid been giving me shit
Always calling me a wannabe
Saying I'm a loser, I don't have to prove myself to you

And I know, I know
That I should just forget about you
But oh, oh-oh
I've got something that I'm dying to say

When you're out on a date and you order dessert
I hope you spill and it stains on your favorite shirt
And when you're trying to pay, I hope your card doesn't work
Yeah, I wish you the worst, I wish you the worst
And I hope I never ever see you again
Yeah, fuck you and all of your friends
You can all go to hell, I'll be driving the hearse
Toss a coin in the well and I wish you the worst
Yeah, I wish you the worst

Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da
Wish you the worst
Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da
Wish you the worst

Thing about you is your ego, you're so damn evil
You try to get to me by talking shit to other people
On a keyboard, not the real world when I see ya
'Cause you're you're just another diva talking shit behind a screen

And I know, I know
That I should just forget about you
But oh, oh-oh
I've got something that I'm dying to say

When you're out on a date and you order dessert
I hope you spill and it stains on your favorite shirt
And when you're trying to pay, I hope your card doesn't work
Yeah, I wish you the worst, I wish you the worst
And I hope I never ever see you again
Yeah, fuck you and all of your friends
You can all go to hell, I'll be driving the hearse
Toss a coin in the well and I wish you the worst
Yeah, I wish you the worst

Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da
Wish you the worst
Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da

When you're out on a date and you order dessert
I hope you spill and it stains on your favorite shirt
And when you're trying to pay, I hope your card doesn't work
Yeah, I wish you the worst, wish you the worst
And I hope I never ever see you again
Yeah, fuck you and all of your friends
You can all go to hell, I'll be driving the hearse
Toss a coin in the well and I wish you the worst
Yeah, I wish you the worst

Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da
Wish you the worst
Da-la-da-la-da-la-la
Da-la-da-la-da
Wish you the worst
