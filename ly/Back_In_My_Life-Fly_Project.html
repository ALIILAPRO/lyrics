		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll never see your smile again
You'll never be my friend
Sailin' on the seas
Hiding in a trees
Cryin' on my knees

I'll never see your smile again
You'll never be my friend
Sailin' on the seas
Hiding in a trees
Cryin' on my knees
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone

Give me your love and I will give you my sunshine
Open the red wine
I want you back in my life...
Oh-oh
Back in my life...

Give me your love and i will give you my sunshine
Open the red wine
I want you back in my life
Oh-oh
Back in my life...

Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
Stay with me, stay with me
I'll never be alone
