		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sit alone and watch the clock
Tryin' to collect my thoughts
All I think about is you
And so I cry myself to sleep
And hope the devil I don't meet
In the dreams that I live through

Believe in me
I know you've waited for so long
Believe in me
Sometimes the weak become the strong

Believe in me
This life's not always what it seems
Believe in me
'Cause I was made for chasing dreams

All the smiles you've had to fake
And all the shit you've had to take
Just to lead us here again
I never have the things to say
To make it all just go away
To make it all just disappear

Believe in me
I know you've waited for so long
Believe in me
Sometimes the weak become the strong

Believe in me
This life's not always what it seems
Believe in me
'Cause I was made for chasing dreams

It's my life, it's my choice
Hear my words, hear my voice
And just believe

I sit alone and watch the clock
Tryin' to collect my thoughts
And all I think about is you

If you believe in me
Life's not always what it seems
Believe in me
'Cause I was made for chasing dreams

Believe in me
I know you've waited for so long
Believe in me
Sometimes the weak become the strong

Believe in me
This life's not always what it seems
Believe in me
'Cause I was made for chasing dreams
