		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a world full of nothing, you make it make sense
In a room full of mistakes, you have no regrets
In my dreams you're an angel that lies in my bed
But when I wake up you're sleeping right next to my chest
Cause I could never love no one like this
I promise that I'll be there when's nothing left
Life after life after life ya we'll do this again
Life after life after life ya we'll do this again
Even if the world was ending, I'd never let you go cause
Life after life after life ya we'll do this again
When I was a stranger you gave me your hand
You picked the pieces, you took them and ran
And everything I'm not you still love who I am
And I'll always keep falling wherever you land
Cause I could never love someone like this
I promise that I'll be there when's nothing left
Life after life after life ya we'll do this again
Life after life after life ya we'll do this again
Cause even if the world was ending, I'd never let you go cause
Life after life after life ya we'll do this again
Cause I could never love no one like this
I promise that I'll be there when's nothing left
