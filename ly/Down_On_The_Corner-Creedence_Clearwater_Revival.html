		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early in the evenin' just about supper time
Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner tryin' to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poor Boy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo
And Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
