		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm trying so hard to forget you.
And leave the life we had behind.
And there are times I feel the day has come,
I've chased you from my mind.
But I'm afraid there's allways something,
That sets me back and makes me see.
You're more than just a memory in the past,
You're still a part of me.
So how do I stop loving you?
Forget things that we used to do?
Forget all the dreams that we shared?
And how my life was knowing you cared?
Why do I end up where I start, each time I try?
Just tell me how I can forget,
So I can say goodbye...
I'm tired of all the lonely evenings,
And all the many times I've cried.
I'm tired of wondering what I might have done to keep you by my side.
And reaching out across your pillow,
I start remembering you're gone.
And though I know that we can never be,
The pain in me goes on.
So how do I stop loving you?
Forget things that we used to do?
Forget all the dreams that we shared,
And how my life was knowing you cared?
Why do I end up where I start, each time I try?
Just tell me how I can forget,
So I can say goodbye...
So how do I stop loving you?
Please tell me why...
I find it so hard to forget.
And hard to say... Goodbye.
Goodbye...
