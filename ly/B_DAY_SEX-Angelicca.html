		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me your feelings baby
You get me nervous every time
I see you I'm on clouds
You're the one I dream about
Bet you I'm more than ready
To give you all my daisies
When I'm with you we're divine
Taking pictures of me bound yeah
I wanna feel you be intimate
Just get it into me
Feed it babe
You know I live for these secrets
I wanna be in it with no one else
Don't feel it with no one else
Don't live it with no one else
When I'm all up in my mind
You come over through the night yeah
Birthday sex baby
Feel the heat go up and
Burn these tapes with me
Let me give you one more time with me yeah
All you need is to feel right with me yeah
Oh
Oh yeah
Oh
They can hear from across the beat baby
I've been put on repeat
Yeah don't save me for later
Eat it while it's saver
I know you want it baby
Open me up like Sadie
You know that I'm your favourite flavour
Save it as desert for later
I wanna feel you be intimate
Just get it into me
Feed it babe
You know I live for these secrets
I wanna be in it with no one else
Don't feel it with no one else
Don't live it with no one else
When I'm all up in my mind
You come over through the night yeah
Birthday sex baby
Feel the heat go up and
Burn these tapes with me
Let me give you one more time with me yeah
All you need is to feel right with me yeah
Oh yeah
Birthday sex baby
Feel the heat go up and
Burn these tapes with me
Let me give you one more time with me yeah
All you need is to feel right with me yeah
Oh yeah
