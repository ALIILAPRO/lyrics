		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dont like nobody
I dont trust what they do      
Could you be without me?
I could be without you 

I said I'll be fine 
Please just keep your distance
I wish you would die 
You could be my victim 

Please dont kill my vibe 
Or ill kill you first 
Think im getting high 
From the gunsmoke 

I dont like nobody
I dont trust what they do      
Could you be without me?
I could be without you 

They say life is time thats borrowed
What if I had died tomorrow?
Whos gonna cry the tears of sorrow?
My brains everything, but hollow 

Everybody's out to get me
Fuck that shit, it dont offend me
Thats why ima keep it ready 
Lock and load a dozen semi's

I dont like nobody
I dont trust what they do      
Could you be without me?
I could be without you
