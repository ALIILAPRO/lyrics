		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the silence of the side street
In the whisper of the night
From the darkness of the empty hours
To the early morning light
From the hustle down on Main Street
With all its lights so bright
To the trucker on the highway
Pressing through the night

I can hear your heartbeat
I can hear your heartbeat
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet

I'm in a European disco
And it's thumping out the beat
There's a jukebox in a cafe
Where the younger ones can meet
We got freezing Coca-Cola
We got anything you want
I can feel the back beat, yeah
Girl, but it's you that sings the song

'Cause, I can hear your heartbeat
Yes, I can hear your heartbeat
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet
To me

And I'm sailing on your wind storm
Oh, I can feel the summer breeze
You've got me walking on my tiptoes
You've got me standing on my knees
From the mills way down in Pittsburgh
To the clubs of gay Paris
Ah, no matter where I roam, girl
You can always get to me

'Cause, I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, I can hear your heartbeat
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet
To me

Oh, I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, I can hear your heartbeat
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet
To me

Yeah, I can hear your heartbeat
Oh, I can hear your heartbeat
Girl, the sound of you is so sweet
To me
