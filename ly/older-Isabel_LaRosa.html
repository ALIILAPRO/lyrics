		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I need someone older
Just a little bit colder
Take the weight off your shoulders
Think I need someone older

Baby
Am I your little secret?
18
I'm old enough to keep it

Yeah, guys my age just aren't the same
I'm young and that's okay

Think I need someone older
Just a little bit colder
Take the weight off your shoulders
Think I need someone older

Darlin'
Hold me while you wipe my tears
Fallin'
You say I'm wise beyond my years

Yeah, guys my age just aren't the same
I'm young and that's okay

Think I need someone older
Just a little bit colder
Take the weight off your shoulders
Think I need someone older

I know I'm younger
As your lover
But I've always wanted a man
For the summer
Age is a number
My dear, I know you'll understand

(Think I need someone older)

Think I need someone older
Just a little bit colder
Take the weight off your shoulders
Think I need someone older
