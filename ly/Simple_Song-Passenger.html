		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking
Here's a simple song
It's never gonna turn this day around
Stood the earth from shaking
It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Well, I know it's not been easy
But easy ain't worth singin' about
Yeah, I know, I know
The time goes slow
But it's always running out

Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking
Here's a simple song
It's never gonna turn this day around
Stood the earth from shaking
It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Well, I know it's far from simple
But simple ain't worth worryin' about
Yeah, I know, I know
It's time to go
I think I keep on finding
Everything seems to be about timing

Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking
Just a simple song
Never gonna turn this day around
Stood the earth from shaking
It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Whoah, it's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to
