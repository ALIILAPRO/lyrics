		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

I ain't no hero, I guess I'm a villain
I got the kilo, I stretch it, I bend it
She got the pre-roll, I snatch it, I lit it
I got an ego and sex, you should get it
Fuck her in public, that's Sex and the City
Bust me a nut, then step back, hit my griddy
On an opp, I roll up like a pack of that sticky
If the opp try to run, hit his back up like Ricky, blaow
All of my guns hold a hundred
Blunt full of gas, all my cars, motor runnin'
All y'all boys know who run it
Real pimp shit, turn all y'all hoes into money
All y'all owe me some money
Rich nigga still kill all y'all over some money
Wake up taped up, I turn all y'all boys into mummies

I ain't no hero, but I'm still a legend
I go from 0 to 187
I feel like Tebow, I'm ballin' forever
I feel like Reno, I bust with the desert
I keep me a kilo on top of my dresser
I fuck me a freak ho on top of my dresser
Yeah, eat the ho out and digest her
Yeah, keep the ho out of my dresser
I ain't no hero, but I'm still a legend
I go from 0 to AK-47
I'ma carpido, you follow directions
It's Murder She Wrote in capital letters
I put the dreams in the bag, and I sell 'em
Look like Magneto, came back with his metal
I got machine guns, my matchin' machetes
I ain't no hero, I guess I'm the villain

I ain't a hero, but I'm still a villain
I got some hundreds that stuck to the ceilin'
Hop on the beat and I'm causin' a killin'
I'm with the squad, they don't care 'bout your feelings
Tunechi just said it, he said Tecc a killer
I be worried 'bout Benjis, I'm worried 'bout digits
If I step on your block, then we spin it like fidgets
Better watch how they hoppin' right up out the Civic
Two tone bag, I'm steady winnin', oh, you so mad
She givin' top and my phone on flash
I'm in some shit they ain't know about yet
Heard she a thot, I don't know about that
Movin' funny how I go about that
Watch your back, I don't know about that
Never lack, we ain't goin' outside, yeah, yeah
Better just mind your business, yeah
Quiet around here, no visits, yeah
She fell in love how I'm living, yeah
I ain't a hero, but I'm still a villain, yeah
Hundreds they stuck to the ceiling, yeah
Broken, I cannot heal it, yeah
Stolen, I do not feel it, yeah
Know when I'm in the building, yeah

I ain't no hero, I guess I'm a villain
I got the kilo, I stretch it, I bend it
She got the pre-roll, I snatch it, I lit it
I got an ego and sex, you should get it
Fuck her in public, that's Sex and the City
Bust me a nut, then step back, hit my griddy
On an opp, I roll up like a pack of that sticky
If the opp try to run, hit his back up like Ricky, blaow
All of my guns hold a hundred
Blunt full of gas, all my cars, motor runnin'
All y'all boys know who run it
Real pimp shit, turn all y'all hoes into money
All y'all owe me some money
Rich nigga still kill all y'all over some money
Wake up taped up, I turn all y'all boys into mummies

I ain't no hero, but I'm still a legend
I go from 0 to AK-47
I'ma carpido, you follow directions
It's Murder She Wrote in capital letters
I put the dreams in the bag, and I sell 'em
Look like Magneto, came back with his metal

Better watch how they hoppin' right up out the Civic (bitch)
