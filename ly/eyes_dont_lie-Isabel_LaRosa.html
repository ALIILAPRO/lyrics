		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie
Say you're mine
Eyes don't lie

Can't lie to you, baby
I wanna feel your body close
You say that you hate me
Then tell me shit nobody knows

Yeah, you're beautiful don't have to try
Darlin', you look divine

Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie
Say you're mine
Eyes don't lie

You tell me your secrets
You keep your life between your lips
You know you're my weakness
Tell stories with your fingertips

Yeah, you're beautiful don't have to try
Darlin', you look divine

Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie
Say you're mine
Eyes don't lie

I swear friends don't get this close
Pull you in, exchanging souls
Trace my skin, losing control
(Control, control, control)

(Eyes don't lie)
(Eyes don't lie)
(Say you're mine)
(Eyes don't lie)

Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie
Say you're mine
Eyes don't lie
