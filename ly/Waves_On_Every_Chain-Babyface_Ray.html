		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One of one, one of none
Wavy Gang shit forever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I just need my space right now

Make a top model pick the money off the floor
Keep my cup, pour some more, I'm a junkie, bitch, I know
Man, this shit ain't fair, my homie jumpin' on the dope
Trill nigga, eyed some bills, so she love me even more
Rockstar lifestyle, beans, spend some ripped jeans
Life for me been normal, but they told me I'm a big thing
Two phones, gonna know it's money if this bitch ring
Best you pray to God, ain't no runnin' from this Infa beam
Just threw it in her bag, I ain't read the tag
Someone got two-thousand pills on a Neiman's ad
Four pourin' through the night, I just think and rap
Top dog, outlaw, yeah, I drink and drive
You can smell it in the air, taste it in my cup
Relationship kind of toxic, fell in love with drugs
Fell through with the mob, they ran out of ones
Stackin' paper, coppin' watches, pass 'em to my sons
Then I know who love me and who don't, I can feel this shit
It ain't hard to put this shit on wax, 'cause I'm livin' it
Smellin' like my hobby and it's us at the dealership
Come and ride with me for a day, so I can show you just how real it get
Always on meds for the pain, stand up so I don't feel this shit
I done been up, went down, got back and I'm still the shit
Always told the gang still the gang, never change, I never switch
Pops say he prayed, then I came, turnt it up, I feel heaven-sent
Shooters on go, ain't callin' shit off once the cheddar spent
Tears in my eyes, 'cause I know some niggas died who ain't ever leavin'

For real, nigga
All music aside, you gon' stand front line
Or you gon' fade away and try and run, go hide
Gotta pay attention, enemies in disguise
Walkin' in, sunrise, clocked in on the job
Shorty think she special, she ain't even saved
Play the cards you dealt, still ain't show the spade
Tell I never had shit, top down in the rain
Still'll fuck a fan, seen a pretty bitch way
Come with me for the night, dreams come true
I just made her cum twice, tell your friend, "Come too"
Hood preacher, street gospel, givin' gems to youth
I just walk into the booth where it's all on the crew

I just need my space right now
Yeah
