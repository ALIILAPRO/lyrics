		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's play a game
A circuit to your brain
Your soul online
We'll turn back time
And take away the pain

I shared a secret
You wanted more
I've seen your sickness
I've got the cure
Your own existence
Is on the line
We'll save your soul
And all we need is your mind

Can't feel fear if it's not real
Can't feel pain if it's all healed
No such thing as a nightmare
I know your friends will be right there
Our kind is becoming a toxin
It's not like we have other options
Submit or succumb to the virus
There's no other way to survive this

Humanity in chains
The faithful sect
Awarded death
Your work was not in vain
Let's play a game

Let's play a game
Let's play a game
Let's play a game
Let's play a game
Let's play a game

Let's play a game
