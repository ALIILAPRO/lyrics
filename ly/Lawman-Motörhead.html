		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cancer!

Your evil eye, in the night
Cruising slow, flashing white
There together, in the dark
But it ain't no friend, just another scared nark
I know you
Lawman
Lawman
Lawman, lawman, I think you're a poor man, lawman

Every time you speak to me
Makes it plain that you don't see
What's really happening here
You just confuse respect with fear
I know you
Lawman
Lawman
Lawman, lawman, I think you're a poor man, poor man, get it!

I know you

See you in the Crown Court
Seems to me it's like a blood sport
I know you live by the book of rules
But anyone who needs a book is a fool
I know you
Lawman
Lawman
Lawman, lawman, I think you're a poor man, lawman
