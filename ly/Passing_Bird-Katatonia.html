		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got black hair
And she has got a black dress
She's pretending
That her life is a mess
But I cannot rest
With so many worries
I can't lie down
And say I am done

I live 'cause I need more light
I hope I can change today
She would never think of changing
Too much fucking emo, it's false (I know)

She stops me in the street
And asks me to follow

I would if I could
If I wouldn't mind breaking her.
