		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You turned our song down baby what for 
You had lit candles on the dashboard 
Red roses growing out of the door 
Wanna say something ya never said before 

We were driving down Sunset
You know I like fast cars
Past by where we first met 
Damn we made it so far 
Red eyes from the red light 
And that just set the mood 
You say you're obsessed with me 
So I took a second and I said me too 

I'm obsessed with me as much as you 
Say you'd die for me I'd die for me too 
And if I lost you I'd still have me I can't lose
When you say that you're obsessed with me, me too 

I did my hair like waves on the beach
This dress so tight you can't even speak
My heels so high might get a nose bleed
Music's so loud but I hear your heartbeat

We were driving down Sunset
You know I like fast cars
Past by where we first met 
Damn we made it so far 
Red eyes from the red light 
And that just set the mood 
You say you're obsessed with me 
So I took a second and I said me too 

I'm obsessed with me as much as you 
Say you'd die for me I'd die for me too 
And if I lost you I'd still have me I can't lose
When you say that you're obsessed with me, me too 

I'm obsessed with me as much as you 
Say you'd die for me I'd die for me too 
And if I lost you I'd still have me I can't lose
When you say that you're obsessed with me, me too
