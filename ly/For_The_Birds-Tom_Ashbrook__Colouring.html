		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come talk to me
I'll show you another track
Oversight, over my part
It's hard to see it
When you're in the black
You're so loved
Let's slow it down
The way the world's now
We've just got find our axis
You always make light of these moments
Lights burning golden
Yeah, it can feel like that
It can feel like that
 
Don't let go
Don't let go
And say it's all for the birds
When there's light, life
Realign
Realign with me now
Time's gonna show
Light a way home
 
Come find your feet
Nothing's everlasting
Can I show you a way, show you a way out?
Don't let it get too much    
A space to let it out
The colour you'll find again
When memories form us
We're balancing forces
You're so much more what you think 
We'll turn still life into motion
Lights burning golden
Yeah, it can feel like that
It can feel like it
 
Don't let go
Don't let go
And say it's all for the birds
When there's light, life
Realign
Realign with me now
Time's gonna show
Light a way home
