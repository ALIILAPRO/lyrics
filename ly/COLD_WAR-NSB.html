		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don’t trust myself when i’m missing you
moved on can’t help yeah it’s sad but true
yeah
yeah it’s sad but true
yeah
I ask myself am I doing too much?
This burns like hell cause i’m missing your touch 
yeah i’m missing your touch

Our love is like a cold war
and i can’t take it no more

It’s in your eyes
there’s no more lies
is it so wrong to feel alive?
if it’s so wrong then what is right?

I hate this place 
take me away
is it’s so wrong to feel alive?
if it’s so wrong then what is right?

Far from nirvana
drowning in bottles 
i’m black and blue
i love you regardless
no matter what happens
i come back to you

we’re both stuck in a game
and i don’t wanna waste our time we spent
And maybe one day it would all make sense 
and someday we will know 
and maybe it’s for sure
that

Our love is like a cold war
and i can’t take it no more

It’s in your eyes
there’s no more lies
is it so wrong to feel alive?
if it’s so wrong then what is right?

I hate this place 
take me away
is it’s so wrong to feel alive?
if it’s so wrong then what is right?

Cold war
and i can’t take it no more
your love is like a cold war
and i can’t take it no more

It’s in your eyes
there’s no more lies
is it so wrong to feel alive?
if it’s so wrong then what is right?

I hate this place 
take me away
is it’s so wrong to feel alive?
if it’s so wrong then what is right?
