		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I did it for love)
Ride the highway, ride the bus (rock it, rock it)
Walk my house, look like I'm impressed (radio, radio)
Walk in the strip, she gon' make it bust (bust it, bust it)

I do damage (bust it)
A nigga can't stand it (bust it)
Psycho bandit (bust it)
Like it's Marilyn Manson (bust it)
Got the cash, advance it (bust it)
Get the Sprite and enhance it (bust it)
Pour the Wock' out the pantry (bust it)
Take a sip and I'm dancin' (bust it)
She pop it like a Plan B (bust it)
Know she lit like a candle
Booted up in the car seat
Hold a nigga up for ransom 
Want her back? Better call me (bust it)
It's whatever, I'm geeked 
Buyin' the punch at the party

You niggas ain't fly, this shit lookin' dummy (yeah)
I'll probably get fried, I look like a mummy (bust it)
I'm gettin' this cash, it's Monday to Sunday
I guess you won't talk if it ain't about the money (bust it)
My boys in the shop, and they jump like a bunny
Got pounds and pills, it ain't nothin' funny
I fuck from the side and I keep the bitch cummin'
If I gotta reach up, I'ma keep the bitch dummy
When I slide in that coupe, boy, I keep that bitch hummin'
We don't reroute that bitch, all the way to the sun
Get deep in the pipe, yeah, get deep like a plumber
Why would I keep it, I never went loved her
I just went fucked her and gave to my brother (yeah, yeah)
Eat it for dinner, oh, eat it for supper (yeah, yeah)
Why would you keep it, oh nigga, you sucker?
Why would you keep it, oh nigga, you suck?

(I did it for love)
Ride the highway, ride the bus (rock it, rock it)
Walk my house, look like I'm impressed (radio, radio)
Walk in the strip, she gon' make it bust (bust it, bust it)

I do damage (bust it)
A nigga can't stand it (bust it)
Psycho bandit (bust it)
Like it's Marilyn Manson (bust it)
Got the cash, advance it (bust it)
Get the Sprite and enhance it (bust it)
Pour the Wock' out the pantry (bust it)

You niggas ain't fly, this shit lookin' dummy
I'll probably get fried, I look like a mummy
I'm gettin' this cash, it's Monday to Sunday
I guess you won't talk if it ain't about the money
My boys in the shop, and they jump like a bunny
Got pounds and pills, it ain't nothin' funny
I fuck from the side and I keep the bitch cummin'
If I gotta reach up, I'ma keep the bitch dummy

Run up the bi- got a TV huh
Hit on that boy like a BB, huh
Hide in the bush you won't see me, huh?
Put you on the wock like Siri, huh
White-lil' nigga wanna be me, huh
Four-five, whippin out creepin', huh
Drive-by, screamin' the demon, huh
Fuck is you sayin, I'm geekin', huh
