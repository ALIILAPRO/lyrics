		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? What's been happening?
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? What's been happening?
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face I can see passion
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face I can see passion

It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
You're my girl, you're my
You're my girl
You're my girl, you're my girl

Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? What's been happening?
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? What's been happening?
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face I can see passion
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face I can see passion

It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine

Think it's time we got this straight, let's sit and talk face to face
There's no way I could mistake, the girl is mine
Think it's time we got this straight, let's sit and talk face to face
There's no way I could mistake, the girl is mine

Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
