		  Bye baby, they ain't fly baby
Looking at the whip frame, that's a nice 'Cedes
Used to throw it to me, like Tom Brady
With the long blonde hair, that's Marcia Brady
I'm all about your Lately Chelsea high Handler, handle her
Got your legs racing hard on vacation
No exaggeration, said you amazing
Moving too fast, can't pace it

Hey boy, when I first met you
Thought it was special
I told you that
Hey boy, up at Two Lover's Point
When I kissed you I meant it
I wanna go back (I don't wanna go)
I wanna go back (but if you wanna go)
Can we go back? (I'll make it happen though)
Boy can we go back? (let's do it soon boo)

It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
Let's do it again

Hey baby, are you sure that you want it
Or caught up in the moment? (Let me know now)
Oh baby, it got a little crazy on the first night
So I'mma have to do you better than the first time
I'm lovin' how you scratchin' and you grittin' your teeth
I'm lovin' how that booty shake when it's on me
You gotta nigga blowing up your caller ID
Guess it was all a set up, you got me

It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
Let's do it again

I wanna go back (one more time)
Wanna go back (let's do it again)
Can we go back? (can you take me baby)
Boy can we go back?

I wanna go back (one more time)
Wanna go back (let's do it again)
Can we go back? (can you take me baby)
Boy can we go back?

It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Pia let me know
