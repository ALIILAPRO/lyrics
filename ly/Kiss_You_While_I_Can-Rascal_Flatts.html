		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know this tan is gonna fade
I'm gonna have to lose these knockoff shades
Baby, all because of you that we will never be the same
I'll always see you and me just being us again

Time is ticking, I won't waste another minute
But my ocean view still has you in it

I'm gonna dance with you like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm gonna hold you like there ain't a flight 'bout to steal you away
In the morning light, the sun will hit the sand
And the summer days will wash away
So, I'm gonna kiss you while I can
Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can

Don't waste a word, let the radio sing
Let's pop the top and pour one more drink
Before your baby blues are gone on the silver wings
Ain't no time for talking
Like nobody's watching

I'm gonna dance with you like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm gonna hold you like there ain't a flight 'bout to steal you away
In the morning light, the sun will hit the sand
And the summer days will wash away
So, I'm gonna kiss you while I can
Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can

Gonna miss that dress hanging off your shoulder
Gonna miss your shade of red on my cheek
Girl, I can't believe this night is almost over
Woman, what a memory

Dancing with you like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm gonna hold you like there ain't a flight 'bout to steal you away
In the morning light, the sun will hit the sand
And these summer days will wash away
So, I'm gonna kiss you while I can (kiss you while I can)
Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can

Dance with you like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm gonna hold you like there ain't a flight 'bout to steal you away
In the morning light
Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can
Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can
Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can
Kiss you while, kiss you while, kiss you while I can
