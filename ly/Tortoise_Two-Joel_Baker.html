		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go for a walk love
Tell you all these things that I thought up
Singing out your name like a chorus
You breathed life into my sawdust
I don’t know it’s more just

Why would I be touring
If you’re not on the tour bus
We should spin a globe
And just go where he calls us
Ordinary paupers
Backpacks borders
Wander like your tortoise

Take me to a higher place
You set fire to my fireplace
Give me all these things that I was tryna chase
I got all this time that I’m not tryna waste

If someone had told me back at 21
I’d met you now I wouldn’t bothered anyone
You’re not like anyone that i’ve ever met along
The way you glide around this life is like twenty swans

You’re way more than I could dream up
Me and you should team up
Know you love your free stuff
Fleabag reruns, Jesus
Me and him been talking bout you
If we told you how we feel you wouldn’t believe us

It might be hopeless now
But I wrote this down
Just to show you how, that I’m so in love
Since you showed up wow
I’ve been grinning all day and I’ve been floating round

I wanna give you all my love
I wanna give you all my stars
I wanna give you all my love
I wanna give you all my heart
I wanna give you all my love
I wanna give you all my stars
I wanna give you all my love
I wanna give you all my heart

Lets go for a walk love
Tell you all these things that I thought up
singing out your name like a chorus
….You breathed life into my sawdust
