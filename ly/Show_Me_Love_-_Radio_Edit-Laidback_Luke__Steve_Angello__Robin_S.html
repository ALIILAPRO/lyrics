		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you feel me?
If you're looking for devotion
You've got to show me love
You've got to show me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
You've got to show me love
Heart breaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And gettin' nowhere (nowhere)

What I need is somebody
Who really cares
I really need a lover
A lover that wants to be there

It's been so long since I've touched a wanting hand
I can't put my love on the line
This I hope you'll understand

So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words aren't so easy to say, oh I
You've got to show me love

Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody
Who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
All that I've already heard
This time around for me, baby
Actions speak louder than words

If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words aren't so easy to say, oh I
You've got to show me love
