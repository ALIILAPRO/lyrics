		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wipe the make-up from your face
Tie your hair and gently fall from grace
Until I come again
Take the disaffected life
Men who ran the company ran your life
You could have been his wife

I want to love you but my hands are tied
I want to stay here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise

Wipe the sweat from off your brow
All that you believe is here and now
You could have had more doubt

Wipe the shadow from your eyes
Rest your daughter while your mother cries
You could have let him fly

I want to hold you but my hands are tied
I want to stay here but I've been denied
I want to lie here til we've killed this bitter doubt

I want to hold you but my hands are tied
I want to stay here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise

I want to hold you but my hands are tied
I want to sleep here but I've been denied
I want to stay here til we've killed this bitter doubt

I want to hold you but my hands are tied
I want to sleep here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun comes out
