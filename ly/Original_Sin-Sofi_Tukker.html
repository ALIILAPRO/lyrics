		  So I think you've got something wrong with you
Something's not right with me too, it's not right with me
But the state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin anyway?

So I think you've got something wrong with you
Something's not right with me too, it's not right with me
But the state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin anyway?
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Anyway, anyway, anyway

So I think you've got something wrong with you
Something's not right with me too, it's not right with me
But the state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin?

A hurting hand
Is just connected to a hurting soul
It's not your fault if you're a hurting heart
Sometimes it happens with the more you know

So I think you've got something wrong with you
Something's not right with me too, it's not right with me
But the state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin anyway?

Oh, I think you've got something wrong with you
Something's not right with me too, it's not right with me
But the state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin anyway?
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Anyway, anyway, anyway

A hurting hand
Is just connected to a hurting soul
It's not your fault if you're a hurting heart
Sometimes it happens with the more you know (check)

So I think you've got something wrong with you
Something's not right with me too, it's not right with me
But the state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin anyway?

Oh, I think you've got something wrong with you
Something's not right with me too, it's not right with me
But the state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin anyway?

The state that you're in is innocent
I just can't believe in, what the fuck's original sin?
