		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do I sabotage everything I love?
It's always beautiful until I mess it up

It's like you don't believe in love, so we lost the touch
It's like you wanna cross wires just to cut 'em up
It's like you made the metal just so you can see the rust
Like you want the tick, tick, boom, just to self-destruct
And I ain't sitting here waiting for you to detonate
Pulling pins on hand grenades and going in for a hug
Building bridges so you can blow 'em up
I can't be your life support if all you do is really wanna pull the plug
I put myself into the spiral, but you the one that's twisted
It gets hard 'cause I see poison mixed up with a vixen
But listen, it's my fault 'cause I love the chase
All you do is give me three letters, you go MIA

Why do I sabotage everything I love?
It's always beautiful until I mess it up
Why do I sabotage everything I love?
The walls are closing in because I built them up

There's a part of me that thinks you love being broken
You built the walls up then tear them down just to see the motion
And that train of thought really put me off-track
Had me thinking 'bout my ex like we talking 'bout maps
Three strikes, but you still wanna throw a curveball
This here my turn off, leave the car turned on
I'ma hop out 'cause I'm sick of wasting my breath
Clip my wings, tell me to fly, that's your butterfly effect
That cocoon broke out in that room, no sound
Your silent thoughts can't tell me what to do right now
Chinese whispers gon' make it hard for me to ever listen
You sabotaged the image, so don't ask me for forgiveness

Why do I sabotage everything I love?
It's always beautiful until I mess it up
Why do I sabotage everything I love?
The walls are closing in because I built them up

So don't let me hope too high
Don't let me hope too high
'Cause I will find a way to tear it down every time
Don't let me hope too high
When everything is right
'Cause I will find a way to tear it down every time

I sabotage (why you sabotage?)
Everything I love (everything I love)
It's always beautiful until I mess it up

Why do I sabotage everything I love?
It's always beautiful until I mess it up
Why do I sabotage everything I love?
The walls are closing in because I built them up

Why do I sabotage?
