		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Daylight, and the night that flows away
Chase the light
Send it back to the day
(Soon the day will fade to gray
Watch the light slowly fade away)

You in my memories
Like the wind
Stir the autumn leaves
(You must be on your guard
Watch the dark when we will part)

I will send for you
Chase the clouds
Throw them up to the sky
(I will be by your side
Like the wind
Stir the autumn leaves)

Call for the wind to blow the moon
Hold her face, long for her embrace
(There will be much to fear
Guard your heart
Keep it by your side)

I call for daylight
I will call for daylight

I have need of the light
Bring it soon
Call the ones we know
(There will be a time to choose
Choose it well
This will be your path)

Hold the light in your heart
See the night
Let it glow
(Shape a bird to fly away
Send it far
Tell it where to go)

I will call the moon
(I will hold the moon)

See the day begins again
Find the truth hold it close to you
(There will be a time to choose
Hold your heart
Throw it up to the sky)

I call for daylight
I will call for daylight

I call for daylight
I will call for daylight

Daylight will show…
