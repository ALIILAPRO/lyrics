		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm not as hot as the flame
That burned here before me
I've been flipping through all your moments
And tearing out memories

How long how, long can you carry this note?
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole?
Until we come out on the other side

Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side?
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side?
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

Trying to wash all of my sins clean
I've gotten too filthy
The drain is full but still circles beneath me
Like a fool to sanity

How long, how long can you carry this note?
How low, how low can we keep digging this hole?
Until we come out on the other side

Crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side?
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side?
The other side
The other side
Where you come out alone

Will you come out alone?
Will you come out at all?
Will you come out alone?

Yeah, yeah, crawling through mud, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side?
Falling from grace, what's the difference
When you come out on the other side?
The other side
The other side
On the other side, the other side
Where you come out alone
