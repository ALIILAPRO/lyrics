		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh

You are fine
You are sweet
But I'm still a bit naive with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak
I feel sparks

But I don't wanna be into you
If you're not looking for true love, oh, oh
No, I don't wanna start seeing you
If I can't be your only one
So tell me 

When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away?
(Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay)
Say okay

When you call, I don't know if I should pick up the phone every time
I'm not like all my friends who keep calling up the boys, I'm so shy
But I don't wanna be into you
If you don't treat me the right way
See, I can only start seeing you
If you can make my heart feel safe (feel safe)

When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (say alright)
Will you say okay? (say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away?
(Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay)
(Don't run away, don't run away)

Let me know if it's gonna be you
Boy, you've got some things to prove
Let me know that you'll keep me safe
I don't want you to run away so
Let me know that you'll call on time
Let me know that you'll help me shine
Will you wipe my tears away?
Will you hold me close and tight?

When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (say alright)
Will you say okay? (say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away?
(Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay)
Say okay
(Don't run away, don't run away)
(Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay, don't run away)
Will you say okay?
(Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay, don't run away)
