		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Harry Truman was our president
A coke and burger cost you thirty cents
I was still in love with Mavis Brown
On the night Hank Williams came to town

I Love Lucy debuted on TV
That was one big event we didn't see
'Cause no one stayed at home for miles around
It was the night Hank Williams came to town

Mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night Hank Williams came to town

A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper hey, that's him
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
It was the night Hank Williams came to town

On and on he sang into the night
'Jambalaya', 'Cheatin' heart', I saw the light
How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
On the night Hank Williams came to town

Mavis had her picture made with Hank outside his car
She said he sure is humble for a Grand Old Opry Star
Mavis said why don't we hang around
It ain't often that Hank Williams comes to town

While Hank signed his autograph on Beaulah Rice's fan
Mavis got acquainted with the Driftin' Cowboys Band
The effect on all our lives was quite profound
On the night Hank Williams came to town
