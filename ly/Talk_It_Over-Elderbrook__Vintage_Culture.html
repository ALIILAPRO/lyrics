		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can talk it over
Anytime you want
We can talk it over till we both can see the sun
And I say
We can talk it over
Anytime you want
We can talk it over till there's nothing left at all
And I say

We can talk, we can dance
We can move, we can blend
We can talk it over
We can talk, we can dance
We can move, we can blend
We can talk it over

Buddy, I don't mind
Buddy, I don't side
Buddy, I don't mind
At all, at all
And I say

We can talk it over
Anytime you want
We can talk it over till we both can see the sun
And I say
We can talk it over
Anytime you want
We can talk it over till there's nothing left at all

We can talk it over- ver- ver- ver-
We can talk it over- ver- ver- ver-
We can talk it over- ver- ver- ver-
We can talk it over- ver- ver- ver-
We can talk it over

We can talk it over
Anytime you want
We can talk it over till we both can see the sun
And I say
We can talk it over
Anytime you want
We can talk it over till there's nothing left at all

Buddy, I don't mind (We can talk, we can dance)
(We can move, we can blend)
Buddy, I don't side (We can talk, we can dance)
(We can move, we can blend)
Buddy, I don't mind
At all, at all

And I say
We can talk it over
