		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There can be one only you, woah-oh
And, baby, God could never make two, woah, na-na-na-na
And I know you came here with your crew, woah-oh
But I promise you that it feels like it's just us two, uh-huh

Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
But I just wanna be the one to do you right, right
And we're standin' here lookin' at each other, baby, eye to eye
And I'm hopin' that you're thinkin' 'bout leavin' with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby (yes)
Love me, love you crazy (yes)
Tell me if you with it (yes)
Baby, come and get it
Maybe try a new thing (Usher, baby)
And let's spark a new flame 
(Breezy, let me holla at her 
Yeah, man, listen)

I can't believe you came here all alone 
Baby girl, where's your lover?
Oh, it don't really matter 
'Cause I got plans to get to know you better, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Let's make what we got here last forever, uh
Girl, 'cause I don't wanna let you go, never

I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
Girl, I just wanna be the one to do you right (right)
And we're standin' here lookin' at each other, baby, eye to eye
Baby, I hope that you're thinkin' 'bout leavin' with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club? (Love, oh)
'Cause I wanna tell them they wrong (oh, whoa-oh, tell them that they wrong)
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing (try a new thing, hey)
And let's spark a new flame (oh yeah, yeah)
You gon' be my baby (oh)
Love me, love you crazy (crazy)
Tell me if you with it (with it)
Baby, come and get it
Girl, just try a new thing (gonna spark it up) (baby, try a new thing)
And let's spark a new flame
(She know what time it is, Chris, yeah)
(M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Home plate, World Series, how a nigga slidin' in her (ugh)
Baby, I'm a boss, I'm talkin' George Steinbrenner
Panamera, Yogi Berra, my two-seater, Derek Jeter
Got more stripes than all these niggas
Babe Ruth ballin' in a Beamer (woo)
Collar on my Polo (woo), kisses on my necklace (ah)
All my diamonds watchin', now my watches gettin' jealous (haha)
Smokin' on a bomb in my autographed LeBron's
Yeah, she told me I'm the one, that's when I only hit it once (M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Who said you can't find love in a club? (No)
'Cause I wanna tell them they wrong (baby)
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing (new thing, baby)
And let's spark a new flame (baby)
You gon' be my baby (yes) (be mine)
Love me, love you crazy (yes)
Tell me if you with it (yes)
Baby, come and get it
Baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
