		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?

He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors
He'll open doors

Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?

These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors
These open doors

Why does my heart feel so bad?
Why does my soul feel so bad?
