		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This little beast went out in the world
Found out he had brothers, was finally heard
And this little beast was nature's own error
Grew like a tree, born to spread terror

This little beast went out in the world
Found out he had brothers, was finally heard
This little beast was nature's own error
Grew like a tree, born to spread terror

For every speck of light, in a clouded blind, shines a knight in the forest
Watching and waiting, as soon as you sleep we come out
You've got your time, we have our patience, in the end you're a number
We all can see you, and deep down you know we're right there

Eyes open wide
Open your mind
We can take it
We can take it
With tooth, beak and

Claw our way through feathers and flesh
We have to fight to our last breath
Nothing can hurt those who never return

Take in the silence, smell all the world
We awoke to defend it
You will not hear us
But once you can see it's too late

Eyes open wide
Open your mind
We can take it (we can take it, we can take it)
We can take it (we can take it, we can take it)
With tooth, beak and

This little beast went out in the world
Found out he had brothers, was finally heard
This little beast was nature's own error
Grew like a tree, born to spread terror

This little freak went out in the world
He also found sisters, a world full of hurt
This little freak was nature's own error
Grew like a tree, born to spread terror
Ahh

Eyes open wide
Open your mind
We can take it (we can take it, we can take it)
We can take it (we can take it, we can take it)

With tooth, beak 
And claw
