I smoke a lotta gas, drink a lotta syrup
Did a lot of dirt, flipped a lot of work
Walk up in the spot, they like baller alert
Jump up out the drop, got residue all on my shirt (damn)
I smoke a lotta gas, drink a lotta syrup
Did a lot of dirt, flipped a lot of work
Walk up in the spot, they like baller alert
Jump up out the drop, got residue all on my shirt (woah)

I heard you beefin', ain't nobody got shot yet?
Four hundred thousand dollar coupe parked in the projects
A half a million dollar wardrobe in the closet
Only nigga in the city 488 'Rari
I wen't from sellin' bales to sellin' out shows, nigga
Who cut the lights on? Got all my ice on
Fuck a record deal, fuck a co-sign
I signed to the plug, nigga, back in oh-five (aye)
Made a quarter million sellin' dope in North Memphis
Made a whole ticket, nigga, just in South Memphis (for real)
Remember all the bad bitches stay in East Memphis (for real)
But I think my black haven bitch was the thickest (for real)
But I swear my California bitch was the littest
I just flew a bad bitch in from Philly
She said she just wanna fuck and go to Wet Willies
I just had a smoke session in the back of the Bentley (hey, give me a lighter)
I might send twenty to your doorstep for Christmas (Merry Christmas)
They don't want us to ball, they want us in prison (damn)
I spend a bank roll in the mall every time that I visit
I'm on tour 'cross the country, bunch of skreet niggas with me
Them niggas rappin' them fake gangsta stories in the way
I can show you how to get eighty pounds in one day
They can teach you how to hate, I'mma show you how to get paid
I put 20K dirty money in the collection plate
Aye, nine-hundred bands in my old-school Chevrolet (yeah)
Racks on top of racks, everyday I elevate (yeah)
Dodged a fed case, so everyday I celebrate (say what?)
Dodged a fed case, so everyday I celebrate (whoo)
God keep blessin' me, so everyday I meditate (thank you)
Them bitches, I don't trust 'em, tell a hater I say "fuck 'em"
Aye, aye, I be fresh as fuck when you see me donnin'
Tell the truth fuck nigga, you wanna be me donnin'
Doin' donuts in a coupe that costs a house (skrr)
Aye, be quiet, you can't hear 'em, smokin' loud
This lil' bad bitch with me poppin' perkies
I say "What that is?", she say "That's a thirty"
I woke up this mornin' in a penthouse
Turnin' down bad bitches, I'm the shit now
I'm geeked up, Facebook
Twenty Glocks, three carbons, eight Dracos
At the stash at the house stackin' money like it's Legos
Smokin' big blunts, rubber bendin' pesos
She mad at me just because I never text her back (damn)
She just want me to come over and kill her from the back (back)

I smoke a lotta gas, drink a lotta syrup
Did a lot of dirt, flipped a lot of work
Walk up in the spot, they like baller alert
Jump up out the drop, got residue all on my shirt (damn)
I smoke a lotta gas, drink a lotta syrup
Did a lot of dirt, flipped a lot of work
Walk up in the spot, they like baller alert
Jump up out the drop, got residue all on my shirt (woah)
