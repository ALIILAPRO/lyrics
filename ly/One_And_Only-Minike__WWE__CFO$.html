		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Minike is the number one and one and only, I will kick your ass and there will be no phony
Number one mother puncher feeling like Tony, tryna talk about Minike and they say that I'm phony

Smokin' the blunt in the backstage and I'm stony, when I drunk some rubbing alcohol my mouth was foamy
I will RKO your ass for real, homie, Minike is number one champion, only
When I pin your ass on the floor, make you eat bologna, then I call my homeboy on the phone, his name is Joey

Pray to the lord, cause what he do is holy
When I embarrass you on live TV, you'll be lonely, my hobby is to beat the chill out of people
you know mostly

Then I triple X your mom real slowly, give me a trophy, yeah, I said I gotta win, Minike
will beat your ass like there's two of me, but ain't no twin
I beat that boy's ass, got him sayin' no like Ben, he was laughin' at me cause I look sped
Then I kicked his ass in the head, he was no real spin

I upper cut him in the head, he know I hit the chin
No, I did not touch him in the backstage, I am lyin'
No, I did not smoke the blunt, but you know I'm real high
Minike is number one mother puncher don't you ask why
Okay, cause I'm that guy
