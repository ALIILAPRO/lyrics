		  (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
La-la, la, la
La-la, la, la (yeah)

Met her at a party
She drove a red Ferrari
When we went to get naughty
Didn't care I was steppin' over bodies

Some might say, some might say
I found a new religion
Some might say, some might say
I made a bad decision
Said you could have my heart
If I'm good when the rapture starts

You sold me
There's no way that I could resist it (la, la)
Control me
It's startin' to sound realistic (la, la)
If you think I have a soul to save
I might have a little faith
Take that shit for a ride
You sold me
If your love is a cult, then I'm in it (sign me up)

I couldn't see it coming
There ain't no point in running
I'll even cut off all my hair and change my clothes
Ain't even call my mother
For love, you gotta suffer
I'm gettin' pretty good at doin' what I'm told

Some might say, some might say
I found a new religion
Some might say, some might say
I made a bad decision
Said you could have my heart (heart)
If I'm good when the rapture starts

You sold me
There's no way that I could resist it (la, la)
Control me
It's startin' to sound realistic (la, la)
If you think I have a soul to save
I might have a little faith
Take that shit for a ride
You sold me
If your love is a cult, then I'm in it (sign me up)

But I knew the party was over
When she tried to take my alcohol

You sold me
There's no way that I could resist it (la, la)
Control me
It's startin' to sound realistic (la, la, sign me up)
If you think I have a soul to save
I might have a little faith
Take that shit for a ride (for a ride)
You sold me
If your love is a cult, then I'm in it (sign me up)

La-la, la, la
La-la, la, la
