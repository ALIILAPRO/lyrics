		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I be bloody fellow
As my skin come yellow
You say I no sabi hustle
I no sabi hustle

You were sleeping well o
I was out here writing songs
And I was working double
I was working double

As you no dey for me
I carry my cross go cavalry
It's in the rhythm and melody for me
The reason mo fi ijo si mo fako si

You no dey for me
I carry my cross go cavalry
It's in the rhythm and melody for me
The reason mo fi ijo si, mo fako si

Ay, ah emi mimo o
E jor e jor o
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

Emi mimo o
I've been working hard o
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

Emi mi o
I've been working hard o
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

Emi mi o
Iwo ni kin ma danwo
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

I just duppy two shows, killed that on the same night
The same night I was thinking 'bout date nights
With shawty and you know it's her favorite
Her fine face and her body on skin tight
Skin tight so you know it all fits right
Man this year I was giving them fist fights
Fighting all my demons at midnight
While blowing bare gas through my windpipe
I told 'em not to sleep on my shit, right?
Now I'm at the O2 past midnight
I'm playing two nights and I'm outside
Feels right and you know it all feels right

(Don't sleep on me)
I told them not to sleep on me
(You wan see me)
I tell them you go see something
(You go pay money o)
You wan see me you go pay money

(Don't sleep on me)
I told them not to sleep on me
(You wan see me)
I tell them you go see something
(You go pay money o)
You wan see me you go pay money

Emi mimo o, emi mimo o
E jor e jor o
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

Emi mimo o
I've been working hard o
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

Emi mimo o
E jor e jor o
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

Emi mimo o
Iwo ni kin ma danwo
Make I no go fall o
I too pray o

(Don't sleep on me)
(You wan see me)
(You go pay money o)
I too pray o

Make I no go fall o
I too pray o
