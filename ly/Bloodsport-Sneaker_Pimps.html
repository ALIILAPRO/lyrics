		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to be a kid again
Come down having Sunday best
See me staying home bunking school
Knowing wrong from right just rules

I wish I'd never seen your face
Better done wonder phase
I need an echo, not your praise
Straying from the god you nailed

My mother, my mother, my mother never told
My mother, my mother, my mother never told me
Love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport

'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport

Sex and love is not a game
A game is something you can win
Maybe something kind of fun
'Cause love is just a bloodsport, son

My mother, my mother, my mother never told
My mother, my mother, my mother never told me

Never told me
Never told me

'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport
'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport

'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport
'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport
