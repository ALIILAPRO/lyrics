		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we agree to disagree?
It's not bad timing
Asking you honestly, "How'd you get this good at lying?"
Since loving you's not gonna work
What if leaving makes it worse?
If one of us is getting hurt
I don't wanna be first

How'd you go from being somebody
That loves me?
To treating me so bad
I miss your hands down my body
But trust me
I'll never take you back
One small fight and you left so quick
Two more, God, I'm over falling for somebody
Just somebody

Is it just me that thinks you act like you're two-sided?
I bet your ex agrees there's no way she likes it
Since loving you's not gonna work
What if leaving makes it worse?
If one of us is getting hurt
I don't wanna be first

How'd you go from being somebody
That loves me
To treating me so bad
I miss your hands down my body
But trust me
I'll never take you back
One small fight and you left so quick
Two more, God, I'm over falling for somebody
Just somebody

Honestly, I think it's hurting me
No longer good for me
Keeping your lies from me
Should probably
Find someone good for me
Will be a mystery
Or maybe he's just

Somebody
That should've loved me
I hope he finds somebody
Just somebody
