		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your mislaid trust in me is broken with the kill
Permission stolen with hands shaking in the still
With frozen breath in lungs clenched ever so tight
My eyes cannot see beyond this lament tonight

You're taking comfort in the grave
Finding closure as the dirt covers your face
You're taking comfort in the grave
Betrayal buried here forever in this place

Exhaled the sudden scream your blood sings your goodbye
Kept to the shadows and laid memory to die
Placed on the altar of my deep despondency
Forgiveness cast assunder in death's liturgy

You're taking comfort in the grave
Finding closure as the dirt covers your face
You're taking comfort in the grave
Betrayal buried here forever in this place

And as the wind cries out your name
Words kissed on palid lips can never be the same
And as the wind cries out your name
Words kissed on palid lips can never be the same

You're taking comfort in the grave
Finding closure as the dirt covers your face
You're taking comfort in the grave
Betrayal buried here forever in this place
