		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you get the fever down in your heart
I'm sure that fever is gonna be hitting you hard, uh
You say it makes you feel you're alive
You call your father the moment that fever arrives, uh

It comes easy to, comes easy to you
Just like I do, too
Ooh
Ooh

You say your money means nothing to you, uh
But to be honest, your money was all that I knew
Great, another rich kid topping the charts
But then I heard it and it hit the soft spot in my heart

'Cause it comes easy to, comes easy to you
Just like I do, too, yeah
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)
(No more rushing)

I get the fever (no more rushing)
Every time you cross my mind (no more rushing)
I get the fever (no more rushing)
Every time you cross my mind (no more rushing)
I get the fever (no more rushing)
Every time you cross my mind (no more rushing)
I get the fever (no more rushing)
Every time you cross my mind (no more rushing)

I get the fever every time you cross my mind
I get the fever every time you cross my mind
I get the fever every time you cross my mind (ooh)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind (ooh)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind (ooh)
I get the fever every time you cross my mind (ooh)
