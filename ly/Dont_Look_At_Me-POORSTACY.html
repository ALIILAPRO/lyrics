		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we die tonight, get buried next to me
(Next to me)
I'm not afraid to cry,  but I don't like
It when you look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me don't look at me

I go where the wind blows, I can't let go
Baby, don't let go, don't wanna be alone
Girl, let's stay up
(Stay up) , don't wanna go home
Drugs make me feel alive
Like there's nothing wrong
I go where the wind blows, I can't let go
Baby, don't let go, don't wanna be alone
Girl, let's stay up
(Stay up) , don't wanna go home
Drugs make me feel alive
Like there's nothing wrong

If we die tonight, get buried next to me
(Next to me)
I'm not afraid to cry, but I don't
Like it when you look at me
Don't look at me

Don't wanna go home stay up
Don't wanna go home stay up
Don't wanna go home stay up, stay up
Don't wanna go home

I go where the wind blows, I can't let go
Baby, don't let go, don't wanna be alone
Girl, let's stay up
(Stay up) , don't wanna go home
Drugs make me feel alive
Like there's nothing wrong
I go where the wind blows, I can't let go
Baby, don't let go, don't wanna be alone
Girl, let's stay up
(Stay up) , don't wanna go home
Drugs make me feel alive
Like there's nothing wrong

If we die tonight, get buried next to me
(Next to me)
I'm not afraid to cry, but I don't
Like it when you look at me
Don't look at me

If we die tonight, get buried next to me
(Next to me) don't wanna go home
Stay up don't wanna go home
Stay up don't wanna go home
