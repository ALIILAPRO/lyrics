		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I walk on by
Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

And I was walking on your floor
Begging to get more
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to ask for, yeah

So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
For me to sit around in, yeah

Every time I walk on by
Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
For me to sit around in, yeah

So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
For me to sit around in, yeah 

Don't you know?
Don't you know what to say?
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know?
Don't you know where to stay?
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know?
Don't you know what to say?
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know?
Don't you know where to stay?
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again
