		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you lay me down?
Make our hearts the only sound
Throw my fears all to the ground
Will you hold me?

Will you serenade me
With the song you used to play?
'Til the night turns into day
Will you hold me?

'Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I'm so tired, I can't even sleep

Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
Oh

'Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along
When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me

So sing to me
So sing to me

I'll be there when you're down
'Cause forever, I am bound
For my love, I shout it out
Let me hold you

No journey is too far
For the one who healed my scars
You're my saviour, you're my star
Let me hold you

'Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I'm so tired, I can't even sleep

Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
Oh

'Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along
When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me

So sing to me
