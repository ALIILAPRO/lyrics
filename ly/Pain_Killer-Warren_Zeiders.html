		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, my stars have all burned out
And I'm the bad your mother warned you about
Before you take my hand, you better understand
You're dancing with a broken man

My heart's in a thousand pieces
Ain't found no cure for the pain
Right now honey, all I need is
Somebody to take it away, take it away
You can be my pain killer
Baby, be my pain killer

You've got that same kinda look in your eyes
Making me wonder if it's your place or mine
Let's get out of here, blame it on our tears
Watch our devils disappear

My heart's in a thousand pieces
Ain't found no cure for the pain
Right now honey, all I need is
Somebody to take it away, take it away
You can be my pain killer
Baby, be my pain killer

Take it (take it), take it (take it)
Just take it away
Take it (take it), take it (take it)
Baby, take it away

You can be my pain killer
Baby, be my pain killer
You can be my pain killer
