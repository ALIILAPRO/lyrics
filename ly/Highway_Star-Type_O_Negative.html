		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
It's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power big fat tires
And everything

I love it and I need it
I bleed it yeah it's a wild hurricane
Alright hold tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my girl
I'm gonna keep her to the end
Nobody gonna have my girl
She stays close on every bend
She's a killing machine
She's got everything
Like a moving mouth body control
And everything

I love her I need her
I seed her
Yeah She turns me on
Alright hold on tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody gonna steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again
I'm in heaven again I've got everything
Like a moving ground an open road
And everything

I love it and I need it
I seed it
Eight cylinders all mine
Alright hold on tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground 
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
It's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power big
Fat tires and everything

I love it and I need it
I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
Alright hold on tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
