		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Without shame
Two outfits then to my name
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go
And every desire for going there

I heard once
It's the comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor
And wake up feeling like a millionaire

Wish I'd known it was just our turn (we just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (but we tried)
You and I had nothing to show (we didn't know)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands (anything, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

One time we would want for nothing (one time we had it all, love)
We knew what our love was worth (when we had nothing)
Now we're always missing something (I miss when)
I miss when we did not need much

Oh, if the car ran, the car was enough
If the sun shone on us, it's a plus
And the tank was always filled up
Only enough for our getting there

That first car was like wings on an angel (and you flew away) 
Before the whole wide world got too thin (from me then)
I swear goodwill kept up the engine 
You were steering my heart like a wheel in your hands (turn back, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

And if we never run
Before our chance was gone
And if we never run
Before our chance was gone

All I needed was someone (and if we never run)
When the whole wide world felt young (before our chance was gone)
All I needed was someone (and if we never run)
When the whole wide world felt young (before our chance was gone)

And if we never run
Before our chance was gone
