		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In times of turmoil
In times like these
Beliefs contagious
Spreading disease
This wretched mischief is now coursing through your souls
Never to let go, never to let go

Them rats (rats, rats, rats)

Into your sanctum
You let them in
Now all your loved ones
And all your kin
Will suffer punishments beneath the wrath of god
Never to forgive, never to forgive

Them rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa
Rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa
Rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa
Rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa

This devastation left your cities to be burnt
Never to return, never to return

Them filthy rodents are still coming for your souls
Never to let go, never to let go

Them rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa
Rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa
Rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa
Rats (rats, rats, rats)
Ooh whoa

They're still coming after you 
(Ooh whoa)
And there's nothing you can do
(Ooh whoa)
They're still coming after you
(Ooh whoa)
And there's nothing you can do
(Ooh whoa)
Rats (rats, rats, rats)
