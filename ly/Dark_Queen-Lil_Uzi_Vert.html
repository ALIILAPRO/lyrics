		  Dear mama
Love you mama
I ain't goin', mama
That be Maaly Raw

Dear mama
I don't wanna sign off (no way)
Out here getting commas (commas)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (oh yeah)
She don't want me locked up (locked up)
Mama, I'm gon' wash up (wash up)
Whip my wrist, it lock up (yeah)
All my diamonds rocked up (oh yeah)
I don't wanna sign off (woah)

Mama love me so I can do no wrong (do no wrong)
Mama in the trap so this her favorite song (favorite song)
I'm gon' get them racks lil baby they some more
Said I wasn't nothing but I can destroy
You got the best advice but I won't call (no way)
I know I'm grown so I do not need ya'll (I got it)
And if I get locked up, mama change the law (oh yeah)
You fix everything so that's what I thought
When I was small mama made me tall (made me tall)
Even though I'm daddy pup she still gon' wipe my paws
Don't care about this money, don't care about them cars (she drivin')
Lose my mama, that's a problem you can't solve

Dear mama
I don't wanna sign off (no way)
Out here getting commas (commas)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (oh yeah)
She don't want me locked up (locked up)
Mama, I'm gon' wash up (wash up)
Whip my wrist, it lock up (yeah)
All my diamonds rocked up (oh yeah)
I don't wanna sign off (whoa)

Now I got the game in a headlock (headlock)
Never catch me lackin' run a red light (no lackin' shorty, skrrt)
Bitch, we talkin' codes we the red slugs (on folk n'em)
They tried to break my safe I had a deadlock (deadlock)
Mama used a bag in the day time (day time)
Mama got that bag by the night time (night time)
Was on 32nd Street, I was like everything (I ain't crumblin')
Moved to FrancisVille and met my real friends (bah)
Mama said, "stay down there 'fore you get hurt"
That was way before I was Lil Uzi Vert (1600)
Mama saw me in action, it could've got worse (1600)
I know that my mama know I'm shootin' first

Dear mama
I don't wanna sign off (no way)
Out here getting commas (commas)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (oh yeah)
She don't want me locked up (locked up)
Mama, I'm gon' wash up (yeah)
Whip my wrist, it lock up (yeah)
All my diamonds rocked up (oh yeah)
I don't wanna sign off (whoa)

Dear mama
Love you, mama
That's my mama (1600 block)
