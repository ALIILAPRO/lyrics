		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say you miss me, say wanna kiss me
I liked it better when you improvised the story we had
If you adore me, why do you ignore me?
I liked it better when you sent me sorry when I was sad

Stop saying, "It's my bad"
You're acting like your deadbeat dad 
I know, you know, you're better than that
But you can't respond when you react

I'm tired of dumb boy talk
Of getting close
You say you won't, you do
And act as though you don't
You're not a ghost
I'm not afraid of you
I started letting go
You let me know
That you were just confused
And I still think that you're cute 
But I need you to remember that
Good girls don't get used
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Good girls don't get used
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Good girls don't get

Say you want me, actually you want me
Did you wanna ribbon?
'Cause I'm gonna need to hear more than that 
Gotta show me
If you wanna know me
Maybe you would know by now
I'm the greatest thing that you could have

Stop saying it's my bad
Forgetting everything we had
I know, you know, you're better than that
But you can't respond when you react

I'm tired of dumb boy talk
Of getting close
You say you won't, you do
Then act as though you don't
You're not a ghost
I'm not afraid of you
I started letting go
You let me know
That you were just confused
And I still think that you're cute 
But I need you to remember that
Good girls don't get used
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Good girls don't get used
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Good girls don't get

Who's the girl in your story?
Hard to believe that you really care at all if
When you're bored or you're horny
I wanna hangout but you're busy hunting down a booty call
Hate it, how you ignore me
Like for a weekend, but then pretend nothing happened, is that so?
'Cause I asked to come over
But supposedly a girl that's just your friend was in your home

I'm tired of dumb boy talk
Of getting close
You say you won't, you do
Then act as though you don't
You're not a ghost
I'm not afraid of you

You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do

You say you won't but then you do

You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
You say you won't but then you do
