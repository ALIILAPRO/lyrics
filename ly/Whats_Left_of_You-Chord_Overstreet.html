		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say what you say, push me away
Fuck my head up, beg me to stay
How could I be better off without you?
When I'm not better off without you
Lie that you're done, like you gon' run
Like you don't love, I'm calling your bluff
Say the water's too rough
But I won't leave you when you're sinking

You say you're such a mess
I like the mess you make
Think you're too hot-headed
You're not that hard to tame
When your puzzled heart's
Missin' a piece or two
That's good enough for me
I love what's left of you

Oceans away, emotionally
Running in place, lying awake
You say your past is gonna cut me
Yeah, I can take a little beating

You say you're such a mess
I like the mess you make
Think you're too hot-headed
You're not that hard to tame
When your puzzled heart's
Missin' a piece or two
That's good enough for me
I love what's left of you

You say you're such a mess
I like the mess you make
Think you're too hot-headed
You're not that hard to tame
When your puzzled heart's
Missin' a piece or two
That's good enough for me
I love what's left of you

I love what's left of you
I love what's left of you
I love what's left of you
I love what's left of you

How could I be better off without you?
When I'm not better off without you
No, I'm not better off without you, yeah

You say you're such a mess
I like the mess you make
Think you're too hot-headed
You're not that hard to tame
When your puzzled heart's
Missin' a piece or two
That's good enough for me
I love what's left of you

I love what's left of you
I love what's left of you
I love what's left of you
I love what's left of you
