		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the song that just keeps playing on the radio
And you know I haven't seen you for a while
I lie awake at night and wonder how you are
And I wish that I could see you again

Is it fate, or is it luck that brings us back
Or is it just a common point of view
Time has put a spell on you, you never seem to change
I wish that I could see you again

[Chorus:]
I'll be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after all come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

It's the light that just keeps shining day after day
And other loves have come and gone
And I'll be here with open arms to take you in
I wish that I could see you again

[chorus]

And in between, and when I need to see you again
All I have to do is close my eyes
Are the pictures comin' in my friend
I'll hold you again, but until then

[chorus repeats out]
