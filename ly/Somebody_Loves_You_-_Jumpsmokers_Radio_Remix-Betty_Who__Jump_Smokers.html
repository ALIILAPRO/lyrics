		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's around when the days feel long
Who's around when you can't be strong
Who's around when you're losing your mind
Who cares that you get home safe
Who knows you can't be replaced
Who thinks that you're one of a kind

Somebody misses you when you're away
They wanna wake up with you everyday
Somebody wants to hear you say
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you

I'm around when your head is heavy
I'm around when your hands aren't steady
I'm around when your day's gone all wrong
I care that you feel at home
'Cause I know that you feel alone
I think you're going to miss me when I'm gone

Somebody misses you when you're away
They wanna wake up with you everyday
Somebody wants to hear you say
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you

Why don't you come on over
Why don't you lay me down
Does the pain feel better
When I'm around
If I am good to you
Won't you be good to me
That's how easy this should be

Somebody misses you when you're away (Somebody misses you baby)
They wanna wake up with you everyday (They wanna wake up with you)
Somebody wants to hear you say (Oh they want you to say)
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
