		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was standing at the Pearly Gates
I was looking for a man of faith
I had questions pressing on me more than not
I was looking for some answers on the spot, ah

Two girls walked in, paperwork in hand
They were tanned from the trip
They'd seen the judge, he'd heard 'em out
Wasn't lookin' good, wasn't lookin' good for us
What about us?

But like some roadside vet with a bag in hand
I could do anything St. Peter asked
For one chance to be an angel in his eyes
It seemed to be the safe bet, so I closed my eyes
And I opened my gates wide
And St. Peter came inside

"Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter
Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter"

I promise, this is not a rumor
I asked for nothing but to stop it short
I guess he didn't hear a word I said
And after he acted as if I hadn't been in his bed
I was definitely in his bed

But Peter bragged he was good at pulling out
He always knew the right time to take a bow
He practiced it every single night
It hadn't failed him yet
He'd been doing it a long, long time
And Peter just does whatever Peter likes

"Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter
Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter"

Even if you're at the Pearly Gates
Even if you're at the Pearly Gates
Even if you're at the Pearly Gates
Even if you're at the Pearly Gates
Pearly Gates

Even if you're at the Pearly Gates (never be at the gates)
Even if you're at the Pearly Gates (never be in there) 
Never be safe, Pearly Gates
Never be (never, never be) at the Gates
Never, never be safe
Never, never be safe
Never, never at the Pearly Gates
Never be (never, never be) at the Gates
Never, never be safe
Never, never be safe
Never, never at the Pearly Gates
Never be (never, never be) at the Gates
Never, never be safe
Never, never be safe
Never, never at the Pearly Gates
