		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's only my heart that you're taking
But you're so alive, it's amazing
Before we begin, I wanna make it
Go on and on and on
It's only my hate that you're killing
'Cause you're so alive, it's thrilling
I wanna succumb, take me beyond

Come together 'cause I'm ready for you
Nothing matters, all I want is you
Just say you'll eat me alive
Just stay, I'm ready to die
Give me everything I never could have
Show you everything I know that I am
Just one more time tonight
I promise, in the morning, everything is alright

Write this down and mark my words
I would tear myself apart for you
Find me when the lights go down
And I'll show you what I see

It's only my heart that you're taking
But you're so alive, it's amazing
Before we begin, I wanna make it
Go on and on and on and on
It's only my hate that you're killing
'Cause you're so alive, it's thrilling
I wanna succumb, I wanna take you beyond

All I wanted was a dream come true
All I wanted was a woman like you
With a fire in your heart, smoke in your eyes
All I wanted was a place for you and I

Write it down and mark my words
I will tear myself apart for you
Find me when the lights go down
I'll show you what I-
I'll show you what I see

It's only my heart that you're taking
But you're so alive, it's amazing
Before we begin, I wanna make it
Go on and on and on and on
It's only my hate that you're killing
'Cause you're so alive, it's thrilling
I wanna succumb, I wanna take you beyond

It's only my heart that you're taking
But you're so alive, it's amazing
Before we begin, I wanna make it
Go on and on and on

It's only my heart that you're taking
But you're so alive, it's amazing
Before we begin, I wanna make it
Go on and on and on and on
It's only my hate that you're killing
'Cause you're so alive
I wanna succumb, take me beyond
