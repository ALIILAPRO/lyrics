		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't get out
No, no, I can't out
No, I can't out
This pattern, it's maddening
Making a tragedy happen
That's not even real
Oh, no, I can't get out
Oh, oh

Stop looking at me as if I'm your friend
And, please, stop talking to me like I'm what you'll win
With everything that I take, I spiral around
And around and then down and I'm not ever fighting back
Against the intrusive thoughts
Clarity can't creep up
Oh, no, I won't get out
I won't get, I won't get

Need ya
Need ya

I can't get out
No, no, I can't out
No, I can't out
This pattern, it's maddening
Making a tragedy happen
It's not even real
Oh, no, I can't get out
Oh, no, I can't get out

Stop looking at me as if I'm your friend
And, please, stop talking to me like I'm what you'll win
And every word that you say, I'll twist it around
And around and then down until I can't recognize you
Give into intrusive thoughts
Clarity can't creep up
Oh, no, I won't get out
I won't get, I won't get

Need ya
Need ya

I can't get out
No, no, I can't out
No

I've been run, run, run, run
Running, I'm running
I'ma run, run, run, I'm running, I'll run
I'll run forever, I'll run
Run, run
And I'ma run, run, run, I'ma run, run
And I'ma run, run, run, I'ma run, run
And I'ma run, run, run, I'ma run, run
I'll run forever, I'll run
I'ma run, run
And I'ma run, run, run, I'ma run, run
And I'ma-
I don't wanna leave
But I don't wanna stay (I don't wanna stay)
No, I don't wanna leave (I don't wanna leave)
But I don't wanna stay (I don't wanna stay)
I don't wanna leave
But I don't wanna stay (I don't wanna stay)
No, I don't wanna leave (I don't wanna leave)
But I don't wanna stay (I don't wanna stay)
I don't wanna leave
But I don't wanna stay
