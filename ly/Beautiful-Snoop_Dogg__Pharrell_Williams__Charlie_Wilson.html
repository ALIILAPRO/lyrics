		  Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

Beautiful, I just want you to know 
You're my favorite girl 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Beautiful, I just want you to know 
You're my favorite girl 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop shit
Come on, baby boo, you gots to get into it 
Don't fool wit the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, lemme put you in the mood and 
Lil' cutie lookin' like a student
Long hair, with ya big fat booty
Back in the days you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it 
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mami, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless 
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know who girl that you is

Beautiful, I just want you to know 
You're my favorite girl 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Beautiful, I just want you to know 
You're my favorite girl 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it 
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow 'dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin' 
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out "Snoop!" and
Hootin', hollerin', hollerin', hootin' 
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long and black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Beautiful, I just want you to know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my favorite girl 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Beautiful, I just want you to know
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're my favorite girl 
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

See, I just want you
To know that you are really special (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I just want you
To know that you are really special (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in
You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and 
Girls be complainin' you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you, and
You don't ask why I roll wit a crew, and
Twist up my fingers and wear dark blue, and (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothin' I do is new to you 
I smack up the world if they rude to you (yeah)
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Beautiful, I just want you to know 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're my favorite girl 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Beautiful, I just want you to know 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're my favorite girl 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

See, I just want you
To know that you are really special (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I just want you
To know that you are really special (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I just want you
To know that you are really special (yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why

Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you (uh)
Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you (uh)
Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you
