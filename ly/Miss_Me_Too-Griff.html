		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was something so bitter and gold in my eyes then
Like a lucid dream, like a rosy tint on a glass lens
And I thought I would be, oh, so
Old again

Oh, and what a time we had
I drunk the drinks, I shook the hands
And I believed the plan, oh

But it broke my heart in a million ways
Then I fell apart in a foreign place
And all I wanna do is find a way back to you
'Cause I'll miss me, I'll miss me too
And the empty lanes that I would chase for miles
'Cause I felt something, yeah, I felt alive
Oh, I miss me, I miss me too
Yeah, I'll miss me, I'll miss me too

Now, I miss talking to the bathroom floor
I miss staring at the ceiling 'cause it felt so tall
I miss sleeping to the sound of the kids next door, I do
I'll miss me, I'll miss me too

And there's just something so bitter and cold in the air tonight, oh
So if time is a healer, is there a waiting list I can find? Yeah

Ooh, and what a time we had
I drunk the drinks, I shook the hands
And I believed the plan (oh)

But it broke my heart in a million ways
Then I fell apart in a foreign place
And all I wanna do is find a way back to you (I will find a way back)
'Cause I'll miss me, I'll miss me too

And the empty lanes that I would chase for miles
'Cause I felt something, yeah, I felt alive
Oh, I'll miss me, I'll miss me too
Yeah, I'll miss me, I'll miss me too

Now, I miss talking to the bathroom floor (I miss talking to)
I miss staring at the ceiling 'cause it felt so tall (I miss sleeping to the sound)
I miss sleeping to the sound of the kids next door, I do (I do)
I'll miss me, I'll miss me too

Now, I miss talking to the bathroom floor
And I miss staring at the ceiling, 'cause it felt so tall ('cause it felt so tall, it felt so tall)
I miss sleeping to the sound of the kids next door, I do
I miss me, I miss me too
