		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby
Thats all right people
I know thats all right
Oh when we love, oh each other
I know thats all right
Oh feel it, feel it, oh everybody
Feel it
God knows thats all right, yeah

Some of us were born with
Money to spend
Some of us were born with
Races to win, oh yeah
Some of us are aware that its
Good to fuss and care, oh yeah
Some of us feel the icy wind of
Poverty blowing in the air

But those of us who simply
Like to socialize
For those of us who tend the
Sick and heed the peoples cry
Let me say to you: right on
Right on, feel it, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, people and I say right on
Right on honey, right on

For those of us who live yeah,
Well peace is craved
For those of us who live with hatred is enslaved
For those of us who live a life
Surrounded by good fortune and
Wealth, talk about it
For those of us who live a life
(hey, hey, hey) enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned
In the sea of happiness
For the soul who takes pride in his
God and himself and everything else
Thats all it is. 

We need love
Love, love, sweet love
Wonderful love
Oh, true love, love
Love for your brother and love,
Love for god
Love pure love
Oh, true love can cover hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
My darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
