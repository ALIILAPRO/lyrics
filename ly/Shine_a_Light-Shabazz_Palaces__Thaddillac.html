		  Shine a light
It's seven, it's heavy, it's heaven
It's seven, it's heavy, it's heaven
It's seven
It's heaven, it's seven, it's heavy
It's seven, it's heavy, it's heaven

Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all

Street profit, sweets geeked off it
Seek profit, cook styles eat off it
Think unique, tires squeak, jewels blink
Defy critique, high peaks, comped suites
She said I'm too deep, then she fell asleep
How that llama repeat sound hella sweet
Gorgeous dashing
Waves crashing, mind elastics
Smooth action
The Cadillacs was backed in (Why?)
You may need to get in the trunk or in the wind (Fast)
Lost friends, floss for them gloss gems
Often it's thought that I'm lost in
Weighing out what all this chance takings costing
Sliding cornered by more law enforcements
Feeling like I'm ridin' with The Four Horsemen

Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all
Shine a light on the fake
This way my peeps can have it all

Shout out my pops Big Reg
Love you baby
Shout out all the old heads
As time whispers in your ear
Know we love you baby
