		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say, say, say what you want
But don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
But don't leave me with no direction

All alone, I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby
Through the years
How can you stand to hear
My pleading for you dear?
You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh

Go, go, go where you want
But don't leave me here forever
You, you, you stay away
So long girl, I see you never

What can I do
Girl to get through to you?
Cause I love you, baby
Standing here, baptisted in all my tears
Baby through the years
You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh

You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face
These tears ain't drying

You, you, you can never say
That I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray every day
That you'll see things, girl like I do

What can I do girl, to get through to you?
Cause I love you baby
Standing here baptised in all my tears
Baby through the years
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
