		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleeping with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleeping very gently so now they're starting to enter it
And now they're starting to mentor me, geekin' like Brittany
Tweaking my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry, infamy
Come alive mentally, and love, die physically
My love cry miserably
Hugs getting looser, her tongue tied kissing me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity
Demons got memories, I had a lil' revenge in me
So now I'm at sentencing, 'bout to start giggling
And then I start sizzlin'

A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand, yeah yeah yeah
I'm a demon, I demand you, brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
The demon out the man
Brought the demon out the man, ooh

You done pulled the demon out the man
Pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth
Then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands
Asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand, yeah yeah yeah
I'm a demon by demand too, bought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too, you done brought the demon out the man ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too

Sleeping with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleeping very gently so now they're starting to enter it
And now they're starting to mentor me, geekin' like Brittany
Tweaking my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry, infamy
Come alive mentally, and love, die physically
My love cry miserably
Hugs getting looser, her tongue tied kissing me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity
Demons got memories, I had a lil' revenge in me
So now I'm at sentencing, 'bout to start giggling
And then I start sizzlin'

A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

You done pulled the demon out the man
Pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth
Then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands
Asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

Brought the demon out her ass too
You done brought the demon out her ass too
Demonic, demonic, demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic, demonic, demonic, demonic
Demon with demands, demon with demands
Demon with demands, demon with demands
