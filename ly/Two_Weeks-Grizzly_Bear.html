		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Save up all the days 
A routine malaise
Just like yesterday 
I told you I would stay (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Would you always?
Maybe sometimes? 
Make it easy? 
Take your time 

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Think of all the ways
Momentary phase
Just like yesterday 
I told you I would stay

Every time you try
Quarter half a mile
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time 

Would you always? 
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy? 
Take your time 

Always, sometimes
Easy, time

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
