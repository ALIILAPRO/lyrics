		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please tell me where life is
I'm feeling scared like this
Why do you ask?
Sadness
Why should you care?
This madness kills
You're talking like one of those reasons, baby, oh
Insignificant
You're looking like one of those dreams, baby
You're acting like one of those moments
You can't fool me

I'd like to see spring
When will you be with me?
Why should you care? Baby, oh
Madness, madness
Why do you ask? Baby
This sadness kills

You're lying
You're lying, baby, oh, oh
You're lying, whoa, whoa (lying, lying)
You're lying, come on

Our moments, dreams and reasons
Moments and dreams
Our love comes in seasons
Seasons

Where do we go from here?
These lonely roads I fear
Wipe your tears, baby, oh
Don't you worry, don't you worry
I'll always be here for you, baby, oh

You're lying
You're lying, baby, oh, oh
You're lying, whoa, whoa (lying, lying)
You're lying, come on

Your face, face
You're talking like one of those reasons, baby, oh
You're crying
You're looking like one of those dreams, baby
Your face, face
You're acting like one of those moments
You can't fool me, no, no, no, no, no
