		<p>
		  Ah

I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, mmm-mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it all, mmm-mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I get it all the way
I want it all, mmm-mmm

We came here to run it, run it, run it (uh-huh)
We came here to run it (yup), run it (uh), run it

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'ma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

And people like to laugh at you 'cause they 
Are all the same, mmm-mmm (uh)
See I would rather we just go our different way (yup)
Than play the game (uh-uh), mmm-mmm
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing (no)
About a thing (not a thing), no (ha)

We came here to run it (yup), run it (uh), run it (mhm-mhm)
We came here to run it (run it), run it (uh), run it (oh)

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'ma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling (hey), what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire (run it), fire (run it)
Run it (oh)
We came here to run it, run it, run it (uh, uh)

So look, I came here to run it (yup)
Just 'cause nobody's done it (uh-huh)
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I've been here, I've done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come on, come on with me
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(Yeah, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Mmm, what's a girl to do?

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day (one day)
Watch this madness, colorful charade (hey, hey)
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'ma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire (run it), fire (run it)
Run it (uh)
Just like fire (we came here to run it, run it, run it)
