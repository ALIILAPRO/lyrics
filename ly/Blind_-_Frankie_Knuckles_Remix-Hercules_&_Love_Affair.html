		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As a child, I knew
That the stars could only get brighter
And we would get closer
Get closer
Mmh

As a child, I knew
That the stars could only get brighter
That we could get closer
Leaving this darkness
Behind

Now that I'm older
The stars should lie upon my face
When I find myself alone
Find myself alone
Ooh

Now that I'm older
The stars should lie upon my face
And when I find myself alone
I feel like I, I am blind

Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Like I, I am blind

I wish the stars could shine now
For they are closer, they are near
But they will not present my present
They will not present my present

I wish the light could shine now
For it is closer, it is near
But it will not present my present
It makes my past and future painfully clear

To hear you now
To see you now
I can look outside myself
And I must examine my breath and look inside
Ooh

To see you now
To hear you now
I can look outside myself
And I must examine my breath and look inside
Because I feel blind
Because I feel blind

I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it like I, I'm blind

And feel it
Mmh and feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it

Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
