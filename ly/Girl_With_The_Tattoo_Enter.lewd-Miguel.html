		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Those innocent eyes (eyes) 
That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you 
If they only knew 
The girl with the tattoo, like I do 
Doin' what you doin' 
Just to get to where you goin'
Yeah, I see it, baby 
Just don't lose yourself along the way, no 
'Cause you're doin' what you doin' 
Just to get you where you're goin' 
And I see it, baby 
Ain't too many others gon' have shit to say, I do 
But I knew
The girl with the tattoo, yeah 
Oh yeah, I knew 
The girl with the tattoo 
I used to know
