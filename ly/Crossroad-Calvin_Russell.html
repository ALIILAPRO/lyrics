		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm standing at the crossroads
There are many roads to take
But I stand here so silently
For fear of a mistake
One path leads to paradise
One path leads to pain
One path leads to freedom
But they all look the same

I've traveled many roads
And not all of them where good
The foolish ones taught more to me
Than the wise ones ever could
One path leads to sacrifice
One path leads to shame
One path leads to freedom

But they all look the same

There were roads I never traveled
There were turns I did not take
There were mysteries that I left unraveled
But leaving you was my only mistake

So I'm standing at the crossroads
Imprisoned by this doubt
As if by doing nothing
I might find my way out

One path leads to paradise
One path leads to pain
One path leads to freedom
But they all look the same
