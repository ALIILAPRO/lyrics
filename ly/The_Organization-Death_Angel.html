		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Within the depths of darkness
Amidst the delusive fog
There waits a path to nowhere
Forthright be stepped upon
Walking through the heinous forest
The panic and rush of fright
She feels them coming nearer
Hereon will lead the rite

Shadows overwhelm her soul
Exceeding anxiety
Their shadows overtake her thoughts
Thick in obscurity

Organize to control
The power compels your soul
Organize to control
Speak the incantation
Follow the ordination
Enter the Organization

Convene outside the temple
Hear the responsive roar
The prayers of deprivation
Foretell what lies in store
Running from the grave believers
Try to evade the chase
They see she's growing weary
And now it is too late

Organize to control
The power compels your soul
Organize to control
Fall to your knees and crawl
Organize to control
The power compels your soul
Organize to control
Speak the incantation
Follow the ordination
Enter the Organization
