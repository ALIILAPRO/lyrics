		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know when it's twelve o'clock in Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I wake up, I don't know
And I think about you though, everywhere I go
And I've done everythin' and I've been everywhere, you know

I've been fed gold by sweet fools in Abu Dhabi
And I've danced real slow with Rockettes on dodgy molly

But I've had no love like your love, ooh, from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday (yeah)
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise
The excitement of a thousand, or the soothing of your voice

At first chance, I'd take the bed warmed by the body, woo
I once warmed my hands over a burning Maserati, woo

Still I've had no love like your love, oh, from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

And on the other side, why should we deny the truth?
We could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do, I've had no love like your love
