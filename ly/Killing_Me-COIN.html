		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Searching, but I'm not tough to find
Lonely, but you can't let it go
Promise, and I looked right through your eyes
So I guess you were just making it up
When you said that you loved me

Can I hear you say it all night to me?
'Cause I feel you falling out of love more and more
And it's been killing me (killing me, killing me, yeah, it's been killing me)

Uh-huh, that's right
Just hit me right where it hurts
And leave me there to die (oh, oh-oh)
Uh-huh, that's right
Just hit me right where it hurts
And leave me there to die (oh, oh-oh)

Learning how to kiss good love goodbye, na na na
Lonely, but I can't be alone
Ooh, ooh, you got your two brown eyes and nothing to show
Honey, I don't mind and you don't know
So I guess you were just making it up
When you said that you loved me, yeah

Can I hear you say it all night to me?
'Cause I feel you falling out of love more and more
And it's been killing me (killing me, killing me)
Can I hear you say it all night to me? (all night)
'Cause I feel you falling out of love more and more
And it's been killing me (killing me, killing me, yeah, it's been killing me)

Uh-huh, that's right
Just hit me right where it hurts
And leave me there to die, oh, oh-oh
Uh-huh, that's right
Just hit me right where it hurts
And leave me there to die, oh, oh-oh

Uh-huh, that's right
Uh-huh, that's right
