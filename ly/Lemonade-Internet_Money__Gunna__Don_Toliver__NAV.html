		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches they hate and you can't miss what you never had
Hey, hey

Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped the coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missing (yeah)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

Addy boys, got some 60's in my bag (Addy)
Lips sealed, ain't pillow talkin', I'm no rat (no)
In my earlobe, got two karats, VVS (bling)
Got a penthouse near Rodeo off of stress (stress)
All this money, when I grew up, I had nothing (nothing)
Filled with backstabbers, my old life was disgusting (disgusting)
Can't believe it, gotta thank God that I'm living comfortably (thank God)
Gettin' checks, I don't believe her, she say she done with me
Burnt some bridges, and I let the fire light the way (oh-whoa)
Kickin' my feet up, left the PJ's on a PJ (PJ)
Yeah, I'm a big dawg, and I walk around with no leash (oh)
I got water on me, yeah, everything on Fiji

Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches they hate and you can't miss what you never had
Hey, hey

Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped the coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missing (yeah)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

I'm a rockstar, play guitars, sippin' Wock', ayy (hey)
Adderall, fentanyl, Xanax bars, ayy (yeah)
I was fifteen, I sip codeine with my dawg, yeah (codeine)
Did a Percocet, promethazine, I feel gnarly (promethazine)
Put up a stick and I hop on a plane
Still in my war ways (war ways)
Shit is so risky, I gotta be gifted
He blessed me with fortune and fame (fortune and fame, nice)
I made my first fifty, I couldn't go back empty
I knew I was stuck to that game, uh (stuck)
Loyal and I'll never change, yeah
I'm never gon' go against the grain (go 'gainst the grain)
Never gon' be one to turn on my brother when police has got him detained (nah)
I won't ever love a bitch more than my mother
And that's on my government name (nah)
I can't be no sucker, ain't hating on no one
I wish everybody get paid (paid)
'Cause we counting up everyday (everyday)
Getting high 'til I land in the grave

Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches they hate and you can't miss what you never had
Hey, hey

Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped the coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missing (yeah)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
