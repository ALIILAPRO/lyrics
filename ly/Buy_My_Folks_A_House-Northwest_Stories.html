		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Of all the places you could go
How'd you end up in the snow
Never made it to the foothills
I'd stay home so I could throw

Broke the fence till it broke me
Wasn't very neighborly
I will make it up to you
One day

Oh I can still see this play out
And I will buy my folks a house

Now that I'm older
And still haven't figured out
What I should do with all these younger dreams
Do I just give up?
Because I haven't made it yet
And write it off as immaturity

I can still see this play out
And I will buy my folks a house

Thought I'd rocket to the moon
And be the busiest in June
But someone scribbled on my pages
And wrote in a different tune

If you told me I'd be here
I'd assume you didn't hear
All the plans I had
But I'm not mad

Oh I can see still see this play out
And I will buy my folks a house

Now that I'm older
And still haven't figured out
What I should do with all these younger dreams
Do I just give up?
Because I haven't made it yet
And write it off as immaturity

Oh I can still see this play out
And I will buy my folks a house

I can see
I can see it
I can see
I can still see it
I can see
I can see it
I can see
I can still see it

Oh I can see still see this play out
And I will buy my folks a house

Now that I'm older
And still haven't figured out
What I should do with all these younger dreams
Do I just give up?
Because I haven't made it yet
And write it off as immaturity

Oh I can still see this play out
And I will buy my folks a house
