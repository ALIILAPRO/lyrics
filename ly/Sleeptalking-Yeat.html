		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Racks out yes, I went to sleep when
I brung my racks out
Yes, I went to sleep and then
I brung my racks out
I was sleepwalking around my house
Pulling it all out

Let me tell you how my night went
Tell you how my night went
First thing I did was take some
X to make it vibrant
Second thing I did was pour a
Three of Wock' to slide in
And the last thing I did was
Take a fifth to the head, we flying
Now you know the recipe, a
Bean help you get high, man

Now, I always wanted to fly
Sometimes I want to be gliding
I already know you want to die, if he slide
That boy dropping
They asked me what car I'm driving
I said the Cayenne
I'm sliding, before I slid to Miami
The high-end dealership
Copped it, the brand new, I'm sliding in it
The Z06, yeah
I ain't go to sleep in so many damn days
I think I'm sleepwalking
I been in the stu' for so many days
I think I'm sleeptalking
Ask me if I wanna do some
Shit, said "Nah, hell, nah
Don't need talking"
Bitch, was sucking the dick so long
She woke up with a knee problem
I been sober way too long
Know this E calling called up Eliantte
Told him all my diamonds need V on it
Stand on my money, 6'11" like I'm Giannis
Call my dresser a toilet 'cause it
Got so many P's on it

Go, yeah (Brr) go, yeah

Racks out yes, I went to sleep when
I brought my racks out
Yes, I went to sleep and then
I brung my racks out
I was sleepwalking around my house
Pulling it all out

Let me tell you how my night went
Tell you how my night went
First thing I did was take some
X to make it vibrant
Second thing I did was pour a
Three of Wock' to slide in
And the last thing I did was
Take a fifth to the head, we flying
Now you know the recipe, a
Bean help you get high, man
