		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Line, times, pain
Such strange love
Line, times, pain
Such strangle love

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

Go, there I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speeding by like a train, like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
In this room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun

Here comes the sun
Ah, ah, ah

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
I said come with me outside
I need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can
Once again, I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been
