		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see you from ten miles from here
Stretching out your spine like a cheetah
I know you're not okay, but never need it
I know you're not okay, so so so so so so so

A Joan of Arc archetype, but dirty version
And you came to cause a disturbance
Shoulder high, the black wave that's coming
Coming to swallow you whole, so so so so so so so

Tick, tock
Tick, tock

Don't ask me to stay
I would have had it in my own day
Don't ask me to stay
I was right there but lost my way
You were right

You were right, I might not be able
To keep the fire from your stable
To keep the rats from your table
To keep your demons at bay, so so so so so so so

Tick, tock
Tick, tock

Don't ask me to stay
I would have had it in my own way
Don't ask to stay
I was right there but lost my way
You were right
