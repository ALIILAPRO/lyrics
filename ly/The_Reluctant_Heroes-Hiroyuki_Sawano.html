		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day by day
We have lost our edge
Don't you know?
Forgotten is the life we led
Now it seems
You don't care what the risk is
The peaceful times have
made us blind
Can't look back
They will not come back
Can't be afraid
It's time after time
Once again
I'm hiding in my room
The peaceful times have
made us blind
So you can't fly
if you never try
You told me,,, Oh, Long ago
But you left the wall
Out side the gate
So more than ever, It's real
It was like a nightmare
It's painful for me
Because nobody wants to die
too fast
Remember the day of grief
Now it's strange for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice
Remember the day we met
It's painful for me
Because nobody wants to die
too fast
Remember a day we dreamt
It's painful for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice

Song for the reluctant heroes
Oh Give me your strength
Our life is so short
Song for the reluctant heroes
I wanna be brave like you
From my heart
Song for the reluctant heroes
Oh Give me your strength
Our life is so short
Song for the reluctant heroes
I wanna be brave like you
Can't look back
They will not come back
Can't be afraid
It's time after time
Once again
I'm hiding in my room
The peaceful times have
made us blind
So you can't fly
if you never try
You told me,,, Oh, Long ago
But you left the wall
Out side the gate
So more than ever, It's real
It was like a nightmare
It's painful for me
Because nobody wants to die
too fast
Remember the day of grief
Now it's strange for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice
Remember the day we met
It's painful for me
Because nobody wants to die
too fast
Remember a day we dreamt
It's painful for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice
It was like a nightmare
It's painful for me
Because nobody wants to die
too fast
Remember the day of grief
Now it's strange for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice
Remember the day we met
It's painful for me
Because nobody wants to die
too fast
Remember a day we dreamt
It's painful for me
I could see your face
I could hear your voice
