		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living fast without a good reason, like the leaves
Change with the seasons, I drift away, so far away
Lie awake, watching the night sky
In the clouds, see my life go by
I sleep alone, nobody's home

They say it's better to burn out
Than slowly sink and drown
But I don't wanna die today

We are, we are the lifeless stars
Shining in the dark
We all, we all have teenage scars, defining who we are
Don't let nobody break you down
Even if they wanna make your light go out
We live, we die, the lifeless stars
Shining in the dark

Growing up, I made it through tough times
Looking back, the world hasn't been kind
But I'm alive and I feel fine

They say it's better to burn out
Than slowly sink and drown
But I don't wanna die today

We are, we are the lifeless stars
Shining in the dark
We all, we all have teenage scars, defining who we are
Don't let nobody break you down
Even if they wanna make your light go out
We live, we die, the lifeless stars
Shining in the dark
Shining in the dark

They say it's better to burn out
Than slowly sink and drown
But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die today
They said I would burn out
And slowly sink and drown
But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die today

We are, we are the lifeless stars
Shining in the dark
We all, we all have teenage scars, defining who we are
Don't let nobody break you down
Even if they wanna make your light go out
We live, we die, the lifeless stars
Shining in the dark, shining in the dark
Shining in the dark
