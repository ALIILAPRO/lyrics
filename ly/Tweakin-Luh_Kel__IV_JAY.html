		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me tweakin' (tweakin')
All in my feelings
Ohh but I like it (yea)
I can't deny it (yea)
You know what you doing 
Brain Like a Bruin
Ohh you be wildin
When I'm inside it

No cappin you got me
Your face and your body
It drive me insane
I'm sending your pictures
To all of my n****s
Like that's my bae
And I never felt  this way
Ohh bae

Ohh she got me open
Her Nina fully loaded
The way it's killing me
Ohh Murda yea she wrote it
I'm swimming to the bottom 
Uhh when I'm in your ocean
And don't you ever leave
No I can't see you going

Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it 
Girl you got me feenin'
And you got me tweakin
And all your love yea you know ooo I need it
It's all day and all night
You stay on my mind
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know ooo I need it
 
Tell me you going to ride for me
spend some time with me 
Say you trynna be my everything
then thats fine with me
I aint never going to lie to you 
so don't you lie to me
know you can have my heart if 
you just treat it properly 
cause I aint never felt this way
you really doing something to me
im feenin, im  tweaking ,im  doing the most tonight 
im not going to lie , im scared that you aint mine
baby keep it real , do you run the game 
tell me if theres other girls up in your face
cause they could never have you cause I have you 
and I aint one to brag boo but I have too

Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it
Girl you got me feenin'
And you got me tweakin
And all your love yea you know I need it
It's all day and all night
You stay on my mind
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it

Bridge
When I feel alone I know baby you'll help
know that you don't need nobody else I know you well 
Sometimes I be tweakin and don't trip on how you feel
I rather be with you because I'm no good by myself 

Boy you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it
Girl you got me feenin'
And you got me tweakin
And all your love yea you know I need it
It's all day and all night
You stay on my mind
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it
