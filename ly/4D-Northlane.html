		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what it was like to lose someone who raised you
Did they still love you when they lost their grip in overdose
Facing doors I'd never hold a key to
Searching for gold in a broken home

I know what it was like to have a gift to give away
I know what it was like to prove to them you had something

But someone just like me
Took the world away from you

Just like me
Took the world away from you

Someone just like me
Took the world away from you
Away from you

Searching for gold in a broken home
I'm drawing blood, blood from a stone
I have nothing 
No silver lining
Just the guilt of surviving 

I have nothing but the guilt
Left in me 

But someone just like me
Took the world away from you

Just like me
Took the world away from you

Someone just like me
Took the world away from you
Away from you

(I'm still trying, your will dying
I'm still trying, your will dying)
