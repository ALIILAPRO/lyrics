		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hope is an underrated word
That I heard when I was younger
Before the anger
Now the pain is like a rope
'Round my hands, you'd understand
If you've been hurt like I was
If you had bad neighbors
The year I forgot what a smile was

Just when I'm breaking free
I can't quite hold it all together
I, I

Thoughts beating on a talking drum
That is forever what I feel like
I was a disconnected red hoodie
Living for the highlight reel
Like oh my God, she's going down
She is most beautiful when drowning
I was always counting
But no one ever found me

Just when I'm breaking free
I can't quite hold it all together
Just when I'm breaking free
I can't quite hold it all, hold it all
And I, I

In my dreams we're going down
Oh my God, we're going down
In my dreams we're going down
Oh my God, we're going down

Just when I'm breaking free
I can't quite hold it all together
Just when I'm breaking free
I can't quite hold it all
