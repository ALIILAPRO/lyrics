		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good guys only win in the movies
Evil women telling stories
There will never be another you
It's true
Down and out in Paris city
All the things are tough and pretty
Stay with me until the night is gone

Just we two
Mona Lisa breaks my heart
Just we two
You are a lovely work of art
Baby, just we two
You want me and I want you
Baby, just we two
I don't want to lose for you

Everybody loves their lover
Everybody's undercover
Half a million miles I'll be from home
Heaven must be missing an angel
You're the hottest child of the city
I can ask for anymore than you
It's true

Baby, just we two
I'm a first class fool
Baby, just we two
All my dreams come true
