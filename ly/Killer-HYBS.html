		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your heart is cold
Is there anything I need to know?
They told me so
That I better stay away from you

Look so innocent
Who would have known
That you would be the death of me?
Thought you were the one
Who would believe
You'd be the one who kills me?

Baby, you were born as a killer
Born as a killer
When you call me, babe, you're never alone
'Cause you were born as a killer
Nothing but a sinner
Oh, I'm better off on my own

You got a real mean streak, baby
Ain't nothing but a crime scene lately
Ripped out my heart in cold blood, lady
Oh think I better stay away from you

Look so innocent
Who would have known
That you would be the death of me? 
(Death of me, death of me)
Thought you were the one
Who would believe
You'd be the one who kills me?

Baby, you were born as a killer
Born as a killer
When you call me, babe, you're never alone
'Cause you were born as a killer
Nothing but a sinner
Oh, I'm better off on my own

Baby, you were born as a killer
Born as a killer
When you call me, babe, you're never alone
'Cause you were born as a killer
Nothing but a sinner
Oh, I'm better off on my own

Born as a killer (why you kill me?)
Born as a killer (why you do this?)
Born as a killer (why?)
Born as a killer (why you kill me?)
Born as a killer (why you do this?)
Born as a killer
