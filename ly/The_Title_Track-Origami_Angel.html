		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it gets hard to be alive
And you know that better than I do, better than I do
Sometimes you need somewhere else to go
Somewhere that nobody can find you, no one will find you 

But if you wanna be somewhere you don't have to be alone
Or distraught or anything at all
Baby you don't have to be
Pack all your things and we'll move to Somewhere City
If you want to be someone that you never have to hide
Or keep bottled up on the inside
Baby you can set it free, just come with me and I'll show you
Somewhere City's waiting for you 

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

The city's never far away, I'm telling you
I know that you won't be the same, the same
The city's never far away, I'm telling you
The secret is it's in your brain, your brain
The city's never far away, I'm telling you
I know that you won't be the same
Once you see how the sun hits the water
At six in the morning on every single day 

The city's never far away, I'm telling you
The secret is it's in your brain
I know you're gonna stay
