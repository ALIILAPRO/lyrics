		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things are shaping up to be pretty odd
Little deaths in musical beds
So it seems I'm someone I've never met

You will only hear these elegant crimes
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth

And everybody gets there, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way (hey)
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I'm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I want to go where everyone goes
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same
I never said I'd leave the city
I never said I'd leave this town
A falling out we won't tiptoe about

Well, everybody gets there, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I'm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say

Well, things have changed for me
Come on, everybody, let's dance and sing
I'm singing it all night long
Come on, everybody, yeah, join along
I'm singing, well, things have changed for me
Come on everyone, let's dance and sing
Well I'm singing it all night long
So come on everybody, yeah, sing along

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I'm on my way, and I'll say

Things have changed for me
