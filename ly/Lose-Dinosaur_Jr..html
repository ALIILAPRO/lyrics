		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't believe a single word I've said
And every subject's the only one that's dead
And there's nothing from my side
Just yourself
You'll split
I'll began
'Bout to fight
Greatest stories pass, in my mind
Must be a better way to pass my time
To think the focus just belongs to me
Selfish man, I know I'm nothing to me
So when I thought I had more to say
Swimmin' in my head
Chained to this corpse
For one more day
Little lies start around
Not a show, feel so down
And I struggle right inside out
Reach the wall, spiral down
Wretchedness
I'm hardly standing still
I'll be there
Sometimes thinking right
I can't believe I was chosen to exist
Cause only Jesus Christ can slit his wrists, he says
So though we kill this need to always understand
Cut the world and tell me it fits on the back of your hand
