		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's poetry in motion
She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

Mm, but she blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
And failed me in biology, yeah-yeah

Now-uh, huh-huh
When I'm dancing close to her
Blinding me with science, science
Science

I can smell the chemicals
Blinding me with science, science
Science
Science

Mm no, but it's poetry in motion
And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

She blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
And failed me in geometry

When she's dancing next to me
Blinding me with science, science
Science

Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm

I can hear machinery
Blinding me with science, science
Science

Huh, it's poetry in motion
And now she's making love to me
The spheres are in commotion
The elements in harmony

She blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
And hit me with technology

Good heavens Miss Sakamoto, you're beautiful

I, I don't believe it
There she goes again
She's tidied up and I can't find anything
All my tubes and wires
Careful notes
And antiquated notions

But, it's poetry in motion
And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

Uh, she's blinding me with science
She blinded me with science
She blinded me with
