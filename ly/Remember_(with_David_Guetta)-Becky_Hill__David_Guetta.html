		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm doing just fine now it's over
I've been moving on and living my life
But occasionally I lose composure
And I can't get you out of my mind

If I could go back in time
I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice
I'd distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me

It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember

Every time I walk past your house in the rain
And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake
And just when I think I'm finally doing okay
That's when I remember, that's when I remember

My friends tell me I shouldn't listen
To the voices that go 'round in my head
So I try to delete all the memories
But you're really hard to forget

If I could go back in time
I'd do things differently, I wouldn't think twice
I'd distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me

It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember

Every time I walk past your house in the rain
And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake
And just when I think I'm finally doing okay (I'm finally doing okay)
That's when I remember, that's when I remember

I'm missing you
You (I'm missing, I'm missing)
I'm missing you
You

It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
