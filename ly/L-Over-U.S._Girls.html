		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

My lover has no heart
Magic moving blood around that body
He's cool to the touch
I don't see him much
But when I do, he does nothing for me
Persona-driven pleasure
And that's how he gets around
He placed me right before the fire
But I didn't want to
I knew how quickly my skin would burn

Fire on stone versus fire on flesh
My lover wins the contest
Can you imagine trying to get
Some satisfaction out of a stone?
One would have to wait their whole life and
I resent you for that
A swing and a miss
I weighed all the risks
When I agreed to this charade in the night

My lover, the time has come
I hate to break it to you in this way
Don't ask me
Stop snooping around
Spare me any talk of your future life
I don't know what I'll do without you
Take up worship at some mile's end?
But you said betrayal and pride
And then you took your time
And now I gotta spell it out for you

O, I'll only say this once
V, I'm very sensitive
E, everything's a mess
R, I'm repenting that L 'cause, 'cause it's over
My lover, it's over because

Early is early, late is late
My lover, I got no faith
Can you imagine trying to get
Some satisfaction out of a stone?
One would have to wait their whole life and
I don't got time for that
A swing and a miss
I tried for the hit
I got my thrill
Now get me off of this ride
