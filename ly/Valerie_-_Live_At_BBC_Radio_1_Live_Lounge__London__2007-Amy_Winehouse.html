		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you
And are you shopping anywhere? (Oh, oh)
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy? (Oh, oh)
And did you have to pay that fine (oh, oh)
That you was dodging all the time (oh, oh)
Are you still dizzy? 
(Oh, oh)

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Oh, Valerie
Oh, Valerie
Oh, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
