		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the meek shall inherit the earth
We've taken care of everything
The words you hear the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes

It's one for all and all for one
We work together common sons
Never need to wonder how or why

We are the priests, of the temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the priests, of the temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

Look around this world we made
Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the brotherhood of man
Oh, what a nice contented world
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the red star proudly high in hand

We are the priests, of the temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the priests, of the temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
Priests praise my name on this night

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Yes, we know it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan

No
I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here that's as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Don't annoy us further
Oh, we have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan

I wandered home though silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream, can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planets long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the temples down
Home, to change

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh, no

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over

Attention all planets of the solar federation
Attention all planets of the solar federation
Attention all planets of the solar federation
We have assumed control
We have assumed control
We have assumed control
