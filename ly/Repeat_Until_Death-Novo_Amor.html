		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Low, a part of me now
A palm to my mouth
I said it, almost

Snow, brother, I'll bet it all gold
Shudder with blood in my nose
I had it, almost

Don't go, you're half of me now
But I'm hardly stood proud
I said it, almost

Oh, I've been low
But dammit, I bet it don't show
It was heaven a moment ago
Oh, I had it almost
We had it almost

Oh, I can't seem to let myself leave you
But I can't breathe anymore
Oh, I can't seem to not need to need you
And I can't breathe anymore
