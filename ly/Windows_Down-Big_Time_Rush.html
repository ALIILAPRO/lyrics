		  Throw it up! woo hoo!
Woo hoo! Woo hoo!
Yeah, yeah woo hoo! yeah,yeah

You're pretty baby,but you know that
Wish I could bring ya
Across the map, yeah

I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Petal to the metal baby hold me tight
Anything you want I can get that girl
If you're with that girl

Everybody knows that I want ya
If you want me, baby show me
Roll the windows down let your hair flow
Let it all go tonight

Party people!

Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah, (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah

You drive me crazy, but you know that
Feel the breeze girl, let's take a lap(Yeah)

I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Petal to the metal baby hold me tight
Anything you want I can get that girl
If you're with that girl

Everybody knows that I want ya
If you want me, baby show me
Roll the windows down let you hair flow
Let it all go tonight

Party people!
Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah, (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah

It's on tonight
It's on tonight
It's on, tonight

Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah,woo hoo
Saying yeah yeah

Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah

Woo hoo!
