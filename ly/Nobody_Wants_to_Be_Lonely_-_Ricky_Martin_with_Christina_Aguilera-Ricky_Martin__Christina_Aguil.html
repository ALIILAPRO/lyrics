		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why, why, why

There you are,
In a darkened room
And you're all alone,
Looking out the window
Your heart is cold and
Lost the will to love
Like a broken arrow
Here I stand
In the shadows

In the shadows

Come to come,
Come to me

Can't you see that

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing
To hold you
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and
It's slipping away
And I've been waiting
For you all of my life
(Oh)
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (why),
Why don't you
Let me love you

Why (ooh oh yeah),
Why (oh why), why

Ooh ooh, yeah
Can you hear my voice,
Do you hear my song
It's a seranade,
So your heart
Can find me, oh
And suddenly you're
Flying down the stairs
Into my arms,
Baby, oh

Before I start going crazy

Going crazy, oh

Run to me

Run to me

'Cause I'm dying 

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
(I don't want to cry)
My body's longing
To hold you
(I'm longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and
It's slipping away
And I've been waiting
For you all of my life
(Oh)
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why

Why, why don't you
Let me love you

I want to feel you need me

Feel you need me

Just like the air
You're breathing

Breathing, I need you
Here in my life

Don't walk away,
Don't walk away
Don't walk alay,
Don't walk away
No, no, no, no 

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
Yeah yeah

Nobody wants to be lonely
(Yeah oh ooh)
Nobody wants to cry
(Nobody wants to cry)
My body's longing
To hold you
(Is longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside
(Hurts inside)
Time is precious and
It's slipping away
And I've been waiting
For you all of my life
(Oh)
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (why), why don't you
Let me love you
Let me love you 

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
(Nobody wants to cry)
My body's longing
To hold you
(I'm longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside
(So hurt inside)
Time is precious and
It's slipping away
And I've been waiting
For you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (why),
Why don't you
Let me love you

Why (why),
Let me love you
Why don't you
Let me love you
Why, love you,
Let me love you

Why (why)
