		  I wear my crown
My hair, my, my
My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown
My, my hair, my, my
My hair, my crown

It don't matter how I wear it
It's beautiful in every color
Long, short, straight or curly
I love what I see in the mirror, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

There's no other way I'd rather be (Yeah)
Confidence is all I see (Yeah)
When and whoever I please
Say it loud

I wear my crown
Show it off, go on, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
My hair, my crown
Wear it how you want, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
I wear my crown
My, my hair, my, my
My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown
Wear it how you want, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
My hair, my crown

My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown

People gon' talk, always got opinions
Gon' let my hair down, I ain't gotta hear 'em
Ooh, so boss, every time I pull up
Show 'em I'm the realest, realest, realest
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

There's no other way I'd rather be (Yeah)
Confidence is all I see (Yeah)
When and whoever I please
Say it loud

I wear my crown
Show it off, go on, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
My hair, my crown
Wear it how you want, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
I wear my crown
My, my hair, my, my
My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown
Wear it how you want, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
My hair, my crown

My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown

We so fabulous-lous
Look at, look at us, us
We so fabulous-lous
Look at, look at us, us
We so fabulous, lous (Ooh, fabulous)
Look at, look at us, us (Look at us)
We so fabulous-lous (Ooh)
Look at, look at us (Oh, whoa, oh)

I wear my crown
Show it off, go on, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
My hair, my crown
Wear it how you want, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
I wear my crown
My, my hair, my, my
My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown
Wear it how you want, girl
Show it off, go on, girl
My hair, my crown (Yeah, oh, oh)

My hair, my crown (Yeah, oh, oh)
My hair, my crown
My hair, my crown (Yeah, oh, oh)
My hair, my crown (Yeah, oh, oh)
My hair, my crown
