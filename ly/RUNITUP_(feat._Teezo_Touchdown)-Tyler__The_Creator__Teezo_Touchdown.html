		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see as a kid
I felt alienated by the niggas who look just like me
Niggas treat my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance so
So I was like, I was like "fuck 'em, fuck 'em"
I did my own shit and now I'm up
And now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous
I ain't never had anxiety
I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
And you talk about that nigga? I'm him
I'm him, I'm that nigga

(Right)
It's funny, right? (Right)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gonna be here (whoa)
See for y'all, the sky is the limit
For us, the sky is just what we stand on to reach the beyond
High above the clouds as you see us (Gangsta)
Catch up, niggas

Bitch, I'm runnin' up a check like I got Rafs on (right)
And I'm runnin' outta shit 'cause I got Rafs on me (right)
Bitch, I'm runnin'
Bitch, I'm runnin'
We gon' run it up (bitch, I'm runnin')
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up (bitch, I'm runnin')
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up

I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all(we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)

He off the dope (yah)
We off it, we off the boat, true story (okay)
The heat off, we tee off, like G-olf, we (phew-phew-phew)
We be off the scope, so I
Brand new, Bunnyhop been zoomed in
Ever since I hit two tens
Of the faces with the blue skin
With the green background, don't know how to act now
But I need you like you're my bluefin
Fiends moonwalk when I come
Deaf ho speak when I'm here
The dead hit sprints when I hum
Why you actin' so dumb? Bitch, you know I got the fuss
I'm live from the 310
You ain't got bling, it been tired (oh)
No lattes and foes, I sell wires
Gumballs cool me down, I'm on fire
Can't fuck with' 'em
Wrap (run, run, run)
Help us see clear when the lighting was dim, dim
We ain't nothin' to you but we somethin' to them, them
When you in your room, then you starin' at the ceilin'
Dreamin', I want you to know it's no ceilings
I want you to notice that feelin'
I want you to leave and go for it
I want you to reach with no fearin'
Throat clearin', scream it, let 'em hear
Run that shit off, baby

Yeah (we gon' run it up, we gon' run it up)
Let's go, baby (we gon' run it up, we gon' run it up)
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up, we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up

I'm runnin' like a politician
I'm runnin' like, I'm runnin' like
I'm runnin' like the water on the dirty dishes
I'm runnin', I'm runnin' like there's roaches in the kitchen
I'm runnin' like the
I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
I'm runnin' like you're not tryna catch it with me
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like (I'm broke)
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like (nah, I told you)
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like

We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it, we gon' run it
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
