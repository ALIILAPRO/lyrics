		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'll know when I rise to the 6
Grabbin that knife and I'll cut yo bitch
I'll put you in a fucken ditch
Just listen
cll that fucken talk is toxic
Holdin all your homies pockets
You don't want the beef so homie stop it
Don't wanna dig your grave, just drop it
Go home
Grab your gun and cock it
The reaper waiting by your fucken rottin corpse
Blood and flesh has stained the floor
But you said you that you wanted war
Thought I'd never find out
I'll cut your fucken eyes out
Bein a bitch in the back
With a call out
Doesn't matter what you say
Cause we all gettin paid
You once had clout but it all gone fade now
I'm stayin heartless in the mind just to play
cll that talk you can't relate
Just take a walk
You can't complain
There's a lot im leavin out
c lot of doubt you given out
So fuck your feelings
Here and now
We're sick of dealin with these Clowns

Pussy mothafucka wanna talk about our numbers
But we know that you the one who be hiding undercovers
Bitch boy
Better watch your mothafuckin mouth
When I pull up with a stick
Bouta take a nigga out
You lookin like typical mothafucka
That's lookin for a handout
Shit there's bouta be a man down 
Mama should've told you to never run your mothafuckin mouth
Now she gotta see you laying in a ditch now
You don't wanna start no beef with me
You trying act hard, bitch boy you sweet 
You know what they say, that talk is cheap 
Depressed ass drunk boy trying to reach 
Watch yo fuckin mouth and your damn tone
Until we in person
Until then keep on suckin that dick
cnd keep on fuckin lurkin hoe
Mossberg pump to the chest
cnd I don't give a fuck if i'm making mess 
Lost in dark while I'm choppin up bodies
I do this shit blindly
The devils impressed 
Better think twice who you fuck with 
I can see through you posers you nothing 
Got your shitty name written on my black list 
If you wanna step up
You gon find out quick
That you ain't shit
