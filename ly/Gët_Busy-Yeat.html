		  Yeah, pull up now, we finna get busy, yeah, yeah (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Pull up now, we finna get busy, yeah (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, pull up now, we finna get busy (yeah, yeah)
Got surround sound inside this tizzy (whew)

Bitch want white inside her nose, finna get Lizzy (yeah, finna call Lizzy)
I really just want a Percocet, I'm finna get pissy (ooh, yeah, pissy)
Yeah, brought a dub inside Chanel, I'm finna go crazy (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, crazy)
Pull up, who that is? (Errt, errt)

My bitch 'bout to pull up on me then drink my kids (up, up)

Everything I imagined in my mind, I done accomplished it

Yeah, how you want the double C but no Chanel? (Yeah, what the fuck?)
I'm on this Perc', it got me stupid, I'm a snail (bitch, I'm stuck)
In the club, this bitch ride on me, I'm a rail (yeah, yeah)
If my brother get locked inside the jam, I got his bail (bail)
Bitch, we too legit (no cap), everything I said is real as hell (yeah)
They can't even tell the real from the fake, I wish 'em well (say)
Yeah, this song already was turnt, but here's a bell (yeah)
Everyone that I know is rich as hell (yeah)
I just poured an eight, I feel like Yams
We not books to read, we not Cat in the Hat, no Sam-I-Am (told him, go)
I cook that lil' shit up, Green Eggs and Ham (told him, go)
Most importantly, my brother pull up with (brrt), yeah, blam

Yeah, pull up now, we finna get busy, yeah, yeah (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Pull up now, we finna get busy, yeah (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, pull up now, we finna get busy (yeah, yeah)
Got surround sound inside this tizzy (whew)
I, I got Tose' on the way, finna get dizzy (Tose', yeah)
Bitch want white inside her nose, finna get Lizzy (yeah, finna call Lizzy)
I really just want a Percocet, I'm finna get pissy (ooh, yeah, pissy)
Yeah, brought a dub inside Chanel, I'm finna go crazy (ooh, yeah, crazy)
Pull up, who that is? (Errt)
