		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I used to wake and run with the moon
I lived like a rake and a young man
I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds
My laughter the devil would frighten

The sun she would come and beat me back down
But every cruel day had it's nightfall
I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars
Full of fire and forgetful

Well, my body was sharp, the dark air clean
And outrage my joyful companion
And whisperin' women how sweet did they seem
Kneelin' for me to command them
And time was like water but I was the sea
I wouldn't have noticed it passin'
Except for the turnin' of night into day
And the turnin' of day into cursin'

They look at me now, don't think I don't know
What all your eyes are sayin'
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies?
They're just tricks that his brains been playin'
A lover of women he can't hardly stand
He trembles, he's bent and he's broken
I've fallen it's true but I say to you
"Hold your tongues until after I've spoken"

I was takin' by pride in the pleasure I'd known
I laughed and said I'd be forgiven
But my laughter turned around, eyes blazing and
Said, "Friend, we're holdin' a wedding"
I buried my face but it spoke once again
Night to the day we're a bindin'
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blinding
Now the dark air's like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blinding
