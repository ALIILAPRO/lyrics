		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tasted the blood in my mouth
And left you there to bleed out
It didn't feel like a dream
Woke up and you looked so cute
Don't think I could love you more
So what the hell does it all mean?

I'm takin' everything I see as a sign and
I know it's crazy
But what if it's right

I'm here again
Talking myself out of
My own happiness
I'll make it up 'til I quit
I wonder if we should just sit here in silence 'cause

Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much

If I see a blue car today
We'll probably have to break up
So I close my eyes while I drive
And if it rains, then it rains
And we'll be over by May
That's just the deal that I made
In my head

I'm taking everything I see as a sign and
I know it's crazy
But what if it's right

I'm here again
Talkin' myself out of
My own happiness
I'll make it up 'til I quit
I wonder if we should just sit here in silence 'cause

Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much

Okay, having said all that
Do you still wanna be with me? (Do you still wanna be with me?)
'Cause, like, I wanna be with you 
Like, like, maybe even forever (forever) 
Holy shit, okay, maybe not forever (forever)
I mean, like, I'm, I'm not saying not forever
I, I actually have no idea what I'm saying (I have no idea)
Are you mad at me?
'Cause, 'cause it's cool if you are 
Right? Like, I don't care
But like, if, if you are then I'm gonna resent you (I don't care)
Okay? I'll forgive you but (I'm gonna resent you)
I'm just wondering, like, okay, like, is this a sign? (I'll forgive you)
Do I actually hate you? (I'm taking everything I see as a sign)
I, I just wanna be honest, right? (I know it's crazy) 
Like, do you still love me? (But what if it's right?)

I'm here again
Talking myself out of
My own happiness
I'll make it up 'til I quit
I wonder if we should just sit here in silence 'cause
Ooh
Ah, just shut the fuck up!

Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much
Ooh, I think I talk too much
