		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep your hands right there
I popped two more, she's in my mind somewhere
Won't let my mind go there
I took too much, don't let me drive nowhere, oh
Keep your eyes on mine
And if you want, I'll tell you lies
Tell you I'm yours for life
And tell your friend she's next in line

Ohh
Should've listened to them
Ohh
Don't you know what I am?
Ohh
Didn't you listen to them?
Ohh
Don't you know what I am? Ohh

Keep the drugs real close
One more line before I overdose, ohh
And no one ever knows (ever knows)
She's on my mind when I'm on yours, ohh
I'm not here for games
I told you what it is, you chose to stay, ohh
Baby, you chose the pain
'Cause you don't know me, you just know my name, ohh

Ohh
Should've listened to them
Ohh
Don't you know what I am?
Ohh
Didn't you listen to them?
Ohh
Don't you know what I am? Ohh

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
