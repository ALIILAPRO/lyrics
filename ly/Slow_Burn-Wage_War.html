		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never give myself the time to heal
I bury all my flaws and failures so it won't feel real
Don't wanna think about what I regret
But now I think that I'm too deep, I'm in over my head

I admit I'm a mess, nothing's picture-perfect
I confess, I've misled, thought it'd all be worth it
But now I see that I've been holding back
The things that I should've felt all along

I wanna feel the slow burn
Make sure I feel everything
'Cause I'll never learn
If I don't face myself and finally let it hurt
No matter what's killing me
I stay numb to everything
I wanna feel the slow burn

I know I'm not who I'm supposed to be
I've got skeletons in closets, locked away, and lost the keys
But now I'm working on a better me
But being honest with myself is so much harder than it seems

I wanna feel the slow burn
Make sure I feel everything
'Cause I'll never learn
If I don't face myself and finally let it hurt
No matter what's killing me
I stay numb to everything
I wanna feel the slow burn

Now I see that I've been holding back
The things that I should've felt all along

I wanna feel the slow burn
Make sure I feel everything
'Cause I'll never learn
If I don't face myself and finally let it hurt (let it hurt)
No matter what's killing me
I stay numb to everything
I wanna feel the slow burn

Make sure I feel everything
'Cause I'll never learn
If I don't face myself and finally let it hurt
No matter what's killing me
I stay numb to everything
I wanna feel the slow burn
