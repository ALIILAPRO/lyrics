		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey girl, I'm waitin' on ya, I'm waitin' on ya
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the windows down

Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool and we know it, too
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh and live while we're young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

Hey girl, it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't over-think just let it go
And if we get together, yeah, get together
Don't let the pictures leave your phone

Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, wanna live while we're young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

And girl, you and I
We're about to make some memories tonight
I wanna live while we're young
We wanna live while we're young

Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

Crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

Wanna live, wanna live (wanna live while we're young)
Come on, young
Wanna live while we're young
Wanna live, wanna live (wanna live while we're young)
Tonight let's get some, and live while we're young
