		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it hard to go on
Make them believe you are strong
Don't close your eyes
All my nights felt like days
So much light in every way
Just blink an eye

I used to be someone happy
You used to see that I'm friendly

All your smiles ,all is fake let me come in
I feel sick ,gimme your arm
From the shadow ,to the sun only one
Step and you'll burn
Don't stay too high

I used to be someone happy
You used to see that I'm friendly

Is it why in your tears,
I can smell the taste of fears
It's all around
All my laughs ,all my wings
They are engraved inside your ring
You were all mine

I used to be someone happy
You used to see that I'm friendly
