		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got something to say
I've acquired a taste for watching you in pain
It's pretty hard to admit; it makes me feel like shit
But I mean it
And I know that I am wrong
The weaker you get, the more I feel strong
So I want you to leave, wipe your face on your sleeve
And beat it

This doesn't end with you
I walk around, and I think of people other than you
That I wish they were cursed
That I wish them the worst
I really wish 'em the worst
But I'm doing my best
And I hope you forgive me now that I've confessed
'Cause I'm tryin' to resist my heart becomin' a fist forever

[Chorus:]
Because you can't, you can't, you can't stop a bullet
I'm givin' you my trigger but you better never pull it
You can't, you can't, you can't stop a bullet
I'm givin' you my trigger but you better never pull it

You've got something to say
You've acquired a taste for watching me in pain
It's pretty hard to admit it makes you feel like shit
But you mean it
What the hell can we do?
I'm a different face of the man you knew
I'm a hole you'll fill 
For the rest of your life

[Chorus]

You can't, you can't, you can't stop a bullet
I'm givin' you my trigger but you better never pull it
You can't, you can't, you can't stop a bullet
I'm givin' you my trigger but you better never pull it
You can't, you can't, you can't stop a bullet
I'm givin' you my trigger but you better never pull it
You can't, you can't, you can't stop a bullet
I'm givin' you my trigger but you better never pull it
