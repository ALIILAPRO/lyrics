		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear the rhythm of waves hittin' on the shore
And I can swear they're speaking, speaking, speaking
They're telling me to relax, I'm not good at that
But now I know I need it, need it, need it

'Cause I, ooh, now what you do, nothin' lies, tell the truth (that's right)
Yeah, on Venice beach, got sand all in my shoes (tonight)
Ooh, unlock me, loose, see the sunset from the roof (that's right)
Yeah, that crystal blue, and it came out someone new

Yeah (good), I'm in my summer feelings
And I'm trying to keep it cool
Wait (up), here in my summer feeling
And I found a piece of me that I never knew

You got my heart and I'm head over heels in love
In California, dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', yeah
Touchin' the stars and then draggin' them down to earth
That California, feelin', feelin', feelin' (that's right)

Oh, now what you do, your brown eyes tell the truth (that's right)
Yeah, down on the beach, I'm stayin' out late for you (tonight)
Oh, unlock you, loose, see the sunset from the roof (that's right)
Yeah, you got to me and it came out someone new

Hey, gettin' in my summer feelings (summer feelings)
(And I) I'm trying to keep it cool
Wait (up), here in my summer feelings
(And I) I found a piece of me that I never knew

I'm meltin' like ice cream
The stress is gone for me
Nowhere I'd rather be (oh)

Hey (yeah), I'm in my summer feelings
And I, I'm trying to keep it cool
Wait (up), here in my summer feelings
And I found a piece of me that I never knew
Hey, gettin' in my summer feelings
(And I) I'm trying to keep the cool
Wait (uh), here in my summer feelings
And I found a piece of me that I never knew
