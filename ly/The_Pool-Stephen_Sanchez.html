		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To fall in love isn't easy 
When you're afraid of heights
But, I can't help but fall when 
I look into your eyes
So blue, I love the hue
But more than that 
I do love you and

Every night I'm in bed 
I fight to keep you 
From my mind and almost every day 
That's how I spend most of my time
It's true, there is no use
I can't escape the thought of you, so

Would you trust me to catch you 
At the bottom of the pool?
If I told you my whole heart
That I loved you that
I loved you that, I loved you
But I'm afraid, I'm scared
Of those romantic words, you see?
Ain't it ironic how those 
Are just the songs I sing about
My lovely, do you really love me?
When I hear you whisper under your breath
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I lost you when I lost me
Didn't mean to at the time
All the hurt I was feeling 
In my heart it made me blind to you
What you'd been through
I paid no mind
Though I meant to and

All the fire I felt within 
My bones became eclipsed
Just the touch of your hands
You're heart and oh my God, your lips
Oh, I just wish that
I just wish that you would

Would you trust me to catch you 
At the bottom of the pool?
If I told you my whole heart
That I loved you that
I loved you that, I loved you

But I'm afraid, I'm scared
Of those romantic words, you see?
Ain't it ironic how those 
Are just the songs I sing about
My lovely, do you really love me?
When I hear you whisper under your breath
"I love you"
I love you
I love you, ooh, ooh
Oh, it's true, oh

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Would you trust me to catch you 
At the bottom of the pool?
If I told you my whole heart
That I loved you that
I loved you that, I loved you

But I'm afraid, I'm scared
Of those romantic words, you see?
Ain't it ironic how those 
Are just the songs I sing about
My lovely, do you really love me?
When I hear you whisper under your breath
