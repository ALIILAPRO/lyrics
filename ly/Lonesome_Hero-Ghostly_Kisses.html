		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's feeling like her inner world is turning inside out
Always feeling like her voice is lost within the crowd
Even though her smile can't hide the quiet of the sound
Only deep inside she knows, love's nowhere to be found

She's feeling like, she's all alone
Invisible, a lonely hero
Lonesome hero
She's feeling like, she's all alone
Invisible, a lonely hero
Lonesome hero

And if you stay in this war within,
You dig your way in the depths of shade
You lose your way in the depths of shade
Where the shadows wane
Where everything will slowly fade away

She's feeling like her entire world is turning upside down
Always lost within a swirl that only spins around
Even though her smile can't hide the misery in her eyes
Only deep inside she knows, love's nowhere to be found

(Is it what you wanted?)
She's feeling like, she's all alone
Invisible, a lonely hero
Lonesome hero
She's feeling like, she's all alone
Invisible, a lonely hero
Lonesome hero

And if you stay in this war within,
You dig your way in the depths of shade
You lose your way in the depths of shade
Where the shadows wane
You dig your way in the depths of shade
You lose your way in the depths of shade

She's feeling like, she's all alone
Invisible, a lonely hero (Is it what you truly see now?)
Lonesome hero

(Is it what you wanted?)
She's feeling like, she's all alone
Invisible, a lonely hero
Lonesome hero (you know that it's not true)

Where the shadows wane
Where everything will slowly fade away"
