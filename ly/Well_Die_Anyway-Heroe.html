		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up
It's a new day
Get your coffee
Don't be too late
Get to work
Don't go insane
Talk to people
Or you'll fade away
Try some new things
We'll die anyway
Hurry up
Don't miss your train
Don't read the news
The world is okay
I'm a bad liar
It is on fire
You know i'm right
And i know you're tired
But live today
We'll die anyway
Step up
Don't be afraid
Don't let your fears
Make it your way
Just go have fun
And get away
From the bad things
You'll be okay
But live today
We'll die anyway
Catch up
With your old friends
They might be weird now
But they're still the same
Just don't be fake
And be yourself
Don't try to be
Something you can't
Because someday
We'll die anyway
We'll die anyway
We'll die anyway
We'll die anyway
Anyway
Get up
It's a new day
Another
Before
We'll die anyway
