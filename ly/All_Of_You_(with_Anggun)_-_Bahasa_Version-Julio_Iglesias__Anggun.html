		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never had this feeling before
I never wanted anyone more
And something in your eyes tells me
You feel the way that I do 

I feel like you do
If you would like to stay here all night
You know that I would say
It's all right
'Though I'm saying yes, I confess
I've got more on my mind
'Cause I want more of you
Than your time)

All of you, your body and soul
Every kind of love you can express
All the secret dreams you've never told

(I want everything
And I'll take nothing less)

All of you as long as you live
Everything you've never shared before
I want all of you that you can give

(All your joys and all your sorrows)

Your todays and your tomorrows

How I long to feel the warmth of your touch
And then if I'm not asking too much
I'd like to spend my life wand'ring through
All the wonders of you (all the wonders of you)

And when we're lying close in the dark
So close I feel each beat of your heart

(I want you to reveal what you feel)

All you hold deep inside
There is nothing I want you to hide

All of you, your body and soul
Everything you want this love to be
I want all of you
All that you can give
And in return for all your giving
Let me give you all of me

All of you, your body and soul
Every kind of love you can express
All the secret dreams you've never told

(I want everything) everything (everything)
All of you as long as you live (as long as you live)
Everything you want this love to be
I want all of you
All that you can give
(In return) in return I wanna give you
