		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on, way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't have been too much more than ten (just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
But, it don't take too much high IQ's 
To see what you're doing to me

You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think) 
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Oh, freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom)
Oh, freedom, yeah, freedom
Freedom (freedom), oh, oh freedom (freedom)
Freedom, oh freedom

Hey, think about it, think about it

There ain't nothing you could ask 
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
But I was gonna change, but I'm not 
If you keep doing things I don't

You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Oh Lord, think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walking around everyday 
Playing games, taking scores
Trying to make other people lose their minds
Ah, be careful you don't lose yours, oh

Think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me, ooh
Think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (need me) 
And I need you (don't you know)
Without each other there ain't nothing people can do, oh

Oh, hey, think about it, baby (What are you trying to do me)
Yeah, oh baby, think about it now, yeah
(Think about forgiveness, dream about forgiveness)
Think about forgiveness 
Think about it, baby, baby
Think about forgiveness 
Think about forgiveness 
Think about forgiveness
