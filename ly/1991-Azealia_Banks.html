		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Excusez-moi
Est-ce que vous savez
Où est un bon restaurant par ici?

Ooh, là là là
Flirting with a cool French dude named Antoine
Wanna taste the pastry, chocolate croissant
Ce soir with the bitch, Café au Lait
Voulez-vous, nigga mad Francois
Who are you, nigga? Hahaha
Miss one, miss young, miss cutie pie
Young Nubi, young coochie tight
Young juicy, young Uzi-might
Rata-tat-tat-tat, nick-nack pitty-pat-pat-pat
Silly cat, you don't have that scratch?
How you do that? Do that? Do-do, that-that-that?
1-9-9-1 my time has come
Oh nah nah, ma, your time is done (what?)
Pre-madonna Mama, like a virgin
Private jets, my flights, no fly Virgin
I sell, you buy, that's my version
Mommy tie these rhymes it's my verses
Oh me, oh my, Illumina princess
Pyramid, one eye on my assets
Here it is, multi, peep my progress

Peep my progress
Here it is multi, peep my progress
Peep my progress
Here it is multi (what?)

He took her to the Louvre in Paris
You want a chance with a youngin'
Wanna ruin her weave, you wanna
Want a Juniper Breeze
I get the grands and the hundreds and the shoe with the bleed
I fit the grands and the hundreds in the Lou to the V
High class, no school, the tuition was free
Lil Bamb no fool, intuition is G
Gimme the gem or the jewels, I'll commission a fee
I make hits, motherfucker, never do it for free, ha
Young tender from the NYC (what up? What up?)
No contender none in my league
Young kill-em-in-the-denims, young venom on the M-I-C
Young villain been developing, the heat, that stick
Elite rap bitch, I cut and send that beat back quick
Tip-tip and all his niggas, suck a D-I, dick
'Cause you gonna be a bitch nigga, I'ma be that bitch, what?

Best believe that shit, you gon' be a bitch nigga
I'ma be that bitch (what?)
And believe that shit, believe that shit
Nigga, I'ma be that bitch, what?

Come around, come around
Let the little Bambi run it down, run it down (uh)
Went from sippin' Bailey's, sipping champys on the isles
Nineteen number naughty, baby, press it on your dial
Sex kitten honeys no cougars in the house
I'ma hush the rumors and the doubt
Came in the game with a beat and a bounce (what? What?)
Never for the fame, my feet on the ground
Cloud number nine, headed to the stars
Baby I ride with my mic in my bra
Maybe I recite in the raw, the appetite for life 
And the hunger for the more, the island of Manhattan
I was born in New York, city never slumbers
I would always dream but never sleep to the hundreds
Cocoa want the cream in abundance
Million dollar baby, you can get it if you want it, what?

Ny rose me, Most High chose me
Let me know what I can, can, can, can do for you
If you don't speak, boy, you know you won't see none
Let me know what a man man, man, man, man you are

Ny rose me, Most High chose me
Let me know what I can, can, can, can do for you
If you don't speak, boy, you know you won't see none
Let me know what a man man, man, man, man you are
