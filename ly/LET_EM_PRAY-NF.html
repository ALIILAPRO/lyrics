		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Delegating isn't one of my strong suits
I've seen it take a toll and be harmful
I've seen what it can do when I got both of my arms full
But still to continue to pile more on my back though
I learned at a young age if you wanna do something impactful
Then you gotta be willing to sacra-
-Fice and really go after it
With everything that you have
'Cause if you don't it ain't never gon' happen
Listen

Gotta prevail
Gotta excel
Think I hit my peak? Nah, I just started climbin' the hill
Kill or be killed
Well if that's the way that you feel
I hope you know you 'bout to get the raw end of the deal
I need to meditate
I ain't got no room to grow, I would never say
Conversations with the Lord should be everyday
Reconnectin' with my core get my head on straight
Prayin' on my downfall, let 'em
Pray

Resumé
Check the resumé
Set the pace, I don't hesitate
Yeah just get it done let me demonstrate
Demonstrate, demonstrate
Let it soak in, let it resonate
Blood, sweat, and tears on the 808s
See 'em prayin' on my downfall
Let 'em pray

Let 'em pray
Let 'em, let 'em pray
See 'em prayin' on my downfall
Ay, let 'em pray
Yeah let 'em, let 'em pray
Let 'em, let 'em pray
See 'em prayin' on my downfall
Let 'em pray

Sentimental
Influential
Every step I've ever taken in the wrong direction
Helped me get to where I am today
And led to monumental moments in my life
That I would not have got to Experience
If I'da let the mi-
-Stakes that I made
Rob me of my full potential
Life will test you
Don't forget to
Remember the fundamentals

I gotta get back to those
Be surprised what you find when you climb out your comfort zone
I get uncomfortable
When I get too comfortable
You corner me and that's all she wrote
I'm in a headspace I ain't never been before
You don't bring nothin' to my life then I exit yours
Let's get right to it, yeah, I ain't with the back and forth
You either with me or against me, a easy choice

The momentum buildin'
I can feel it
My resilience cannot hide it, can't conceal it
Made me suffer some but also made me brilliant
Pass my brilliance down and teach my children
Life is precious, life is treacherous, life is filled with
Dead-end roads, keep on pushin'
Keep on healin'
See you prayin' on my downfall
Go on, keep on prayin'
God ain't listenin' to ya

Resumé
Check the resumé
Set the pace, I don't hesitate
Yeah just get it done, let me demonstrate
Demonstrate, demonstrate
Let it soak in, let it resonate
Blood, sweat, and tears on the 808s
See 'em prayin' on my downfall
Let 'em pray

Let 'em pray
Let 'em, let 'em pray
See 'em prayin' on my downfall
Ay, let 'em pray
Let 'em, let 'em pray, yeah
Let 'em, let 'em pray, aye
See 'em prayin' on my downfall
Let 'em pray
