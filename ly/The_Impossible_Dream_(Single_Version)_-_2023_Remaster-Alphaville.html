		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it feels so strange
The way I feel for you
It makes my life so quiet and free
And when you smile at me
It's just that special love
A kind of liberty I've never felt before

And I don't need to be a poet
I don't need to be a hero
When all I need to do is keep on
Loving you

I just have to be me
And I don't need to be
The stranger anymore I used to be
In my impossible dream

I keep my fingers crossed
I never want to lose
This new found world that's so alive, Angel
I'm so in love with you

My heart has circled in the past
The demons of deceit but now
Aside I've cast

And I don't need to be a poet
I don't need to be hero
When all I need to do is keep on
Loving you

I just have to be me
And I don't need to be
The stranger anymore I used to be
In my impossible dream
