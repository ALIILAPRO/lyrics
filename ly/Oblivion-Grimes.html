		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another walk about after dark
It's my point of view
'Cause someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you, always coming and you'd never have a clue

I never look behind, all the time
I will wait forever, always looking straight
Thinking, counting, all the hours you wait

(Ooh, ah) (la, la, la, la, la)
See you on a dark night (ooh, ah)
See you on a dark night (ooh, ah) (la, la, la, la, la)
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night

And no, I'm not a jerk, I would ask
If you could help me out
It's hard to understand
'Cause when you're really by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand

And now it's good to be tough with me
But I will wait forever
I need someone now to look into my eyes and tell me
"Girl, you know you gotta watch your health"

To look into my eyes and tell me
La, la, la, la, la
To look into my eyes and tell me
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night (oh)
See you on a dark night (oh)
See you on a dark night (oh)
See you on a dark night (oh)
See you on a dark night (oh)
See you on a dark night (oh)
See you on a dark night (ooh, ah)
See you on a dark night (ooh, ah)
See you on a dark night (ooh, ah) (la, la, la, la, la)
See you on a dark night (ooh, ah) (oh, oh)
