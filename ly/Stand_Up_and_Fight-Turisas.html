		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The pouring rain, 
Sticks my hair to my face, 
An empty gaze is all I have left, 

The stars that once lit my way have dimmed, 
The sky turned grey, 
The path once so clear
Faded away, 

Blessed are the days when life is intent and clear, 
No falter or doubt, 
I know the way, 

They are the days, I hoped, 
I have never stepped from this road, 
The spark I once had, 
Seems to have died, 

Stand up and fight, 
Stand up and look into the light, 
Pushing the clouds away
Stand up and fight, 
Stand up and see the sky turn bright, 
Fight for a better day

What a relief it would be to end this all, 
How easy to fly the white flag and give up, 
But would I run today just to die another day, 
Give up now and every fight has been in vain, 

Stand up and fight, 
Stand up and look into the light, 
Pushing the clouds away
Stand up and fight, 
Stand up and see the sky turn bright, 
Fight for a better day

Get up
You've made it this far
No loser you are
One more time
One more try

The pouring rain, 
Sticks my hair to my face, 

Stand up and fight, 
Stand up and look into the light, 
Pushing the clouds away
Stand up and fight, 
Stand up and see the sky turn bright, 
Fight for a better day

Stand up and fight! 

Fight fight
Stand up and fight
