		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome in fights
Go build the cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims gone nowhere
And millions of cars
They guise a dream in the distance
From promises he'd leave behind
When there was no harvest
He missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep and beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
Say it's alright, child, it's alright

In Africa
We dance in the water and hold each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say it's alright, child, it's alright

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Dreamed of his queen by his side
There will be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride
