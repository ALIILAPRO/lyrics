		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walk down alameda shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyone
Like some precious only son
Face down, bow to the champion

You walk down alameda looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
Thinking about your friends
How you maintain all them in a constant state of suspense

For your own protection over their affection
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own because you can't finish what you start

Walk down alameda brushing off the nightmares you wish
Could plague me when I'm awake
And now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relate

For one or two minutes she liked you
But the fix is in
You're all pretension
I never pay attention

Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own because you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own because you can't finish what you start

Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own because you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
If you're alone it must be you that wants to be apart
