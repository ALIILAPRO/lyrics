		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't come around
Please don't come around
Please don't come around
Please don't, please don't

I was trying to
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
If you were 22 forever, would be nice (would be nice)
Would be nice 
Why you dare to take that away
I don't understand (I don't understand)
I could name a thousand different reasons you could fight (could fight)
All your might, I know I'm right

I could feel the change (feel the change)
The way you sing your song (the way you sing your song)
I could feel the waves (I could feel the waves)
You send from kingdom's sun (you send from kingdom's sun)

I will find a way
Ooh yeah
I will find myself
And I will love you
With my soul
You're all I've ever wanted
I know that I love you
Still driving
Take my hands in yours, please don't go
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I will find a way
I will find a way
