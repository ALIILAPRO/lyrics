		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go,
So bring your passport girl, I'm trying to show you the world
I know your ex did you bad, but I'm your new perfect man
Dignity where you stand, with just a touch of my hand
I'm trying to show you my plan, you got me girl I'm a fan

From the minute that you walked right through the door
Thoughts are racing in my mind, time to explore
I tell my friends that I just gotta have him
But don't look now, 'cause I see you staring at him

Tunnel vision had him locked on in my sight
On a mission, for position by the end of the night
It's like a prey, playing games with the hunter
You better run boy, time to surrender

And all I need is to feel you
All I want is to feel you

Reach out and touch me
Before I go insane
Reach out and touch me
Boy don't you make me wait
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
And all I need is to feel you
Reach out and touch me

Like a prayer, your touch can take me there
In my mind, you and me in a secret affair
Oh boy you're killing me and, you don't even know it
Try to hold back but I can't control it

So, I'm stepping to ya', skip the "How ya doing?"
Grab your hand and pull you closer to me, yeah
Out the door we're slipping, then we start to kissing
Boy you're invited to my fantasy

And all I need is to feel you
All I want is to feel you

Reach out and touch me
Before I go insane
Reach out and touch me
Boy don't you make me wait
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
Reach out and touch me
Oh, before I go insane
Oh boy don't make me wait
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
And all I need is to feel you
Reach out and touch me

Let's go
I'm here to play with fire, you're body's my desire
The time to flirt across the room, done expired
'Cause you a superstar, get in my super car
The paparrazi watchin' us, too bizarre
I know I took you far, but look how good you are
And look how good you look, one touch I'm supercharged

Baby can't you see how you're affecting me
Baby sensual, physical, fantasy
Maybe, fate brought the two of closer now
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna? Don't you wanna?
Reach out and touch me

Reach out and touch me
Before I go insane
Reach out and touch me
Boy don't you make me wait
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
Reach out and touch me

Reach out and touch me
Before I go insane
Reach out and touch me
Boy don't you make me wait
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
And all I need is to feel you
Reach out and touch me
