		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
Still look good for you, good for you, oh-oh

I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
Still look good for you, good for you, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Hold up, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't tryna fuck your image up
More than likely mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't tryna fuck your business up
And I ain't tryna get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck a signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried 'bout no press, and ain't worried 'bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad miss without the ass shots, haha
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it? (Haha)

I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you, oh-oh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
Still look good for you, good for you, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
