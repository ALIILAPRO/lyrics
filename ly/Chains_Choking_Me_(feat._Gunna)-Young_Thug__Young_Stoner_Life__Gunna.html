		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ye, ye
Yeah
Wheezy Beats

I might die from all these chains choking me in my sleep
I been traveling with the 'chete like 'lil savage
Last night I had a 15, it was 12, on me
Tried to grip me but I won't go
Baby girls just knows who we sets in
Baby, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-oooh-oh-oooh (mmm)

Put a lear inside the sky, hunnid' thousand some feet
Pour my cup and in my eye, Yeezy boosts on my feet
We could hotbox through the crowd, I'm as high as can be
Forgiatos on my ride, gettin' that money like Meech
Diamonds all under my chin, you gon' know these VV's
I been cashin' out on drip, this Supreme Louis V
I just popped another pill, pour that lean in the peach
Hope my cousin get his appeal, make it back to these streets
Floating through the atmosphere, I am out of your reach
I ain't have to sign no deals, they got hunnids' on me
Couple 24 inch rims on that big Bentley B
Furnished out the crib, treat this bitch like a suite
I might die from all these chains choking me in my sleep
I keep stacking all these backends, keep my bitches on fleek
Last night, I had a 15, so there was 12 on me
Now-ooh-ooh, bring the love right back, yeah

Got millions off a bando, ooh
I got the team rich now, ooh
I'm tired of riskin' my soul
Plain Jane, not a bust down
Rep the set, I'm gon' get down
I make sure your weight cut like a bachelorette
Tripping on the tour bus, get used to that
Napping on a jet, 'cause we barely rest
Plain Jane AP, I put ice in that
Running on x and that angel dust
I got a little a coke, what you want
But you gotta use your nose
Light round diamonds on my wrist like I'm Gordo
I hold the jet down with a stick
We big as the law when we rich
My pilots are doin' the dash
I be in jets, and the aves
I put a ten on the tag
I don't do the clearance tags
Won't wear the same thing, I'm a brat
I ran up this money, don't lack
I'm tired of the backstabs
Put that dick in her abs like
Oooooh (Wheezy Beats)
Won't you bring on my loving back here
You-you see that hoe, you better not fall in love with me
Ain't got a caution tape, round all this hoe, baby girl
You better not fall in love with me
I'm running back just how she backflips
Oh baby, I know she back there looking like
Ooh-ooh-oooooooh
Do not fall in love with me
