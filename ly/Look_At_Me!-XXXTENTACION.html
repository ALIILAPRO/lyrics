		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yah, ayy
Yah, ayy, yah
Yah, yah
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy

I'm like, "Bitch, who is your mans?" ayy
Can't keep my dick in my pants, ayy
My bitch don't love me no mo', ayy
She kick me out, I'm like vro, ayy
That bitch don't wanna be friends, ayy
I gave her dick, she amen, ayy
She put her tongue on my dick, ayy
Look at my wrist, about ten, ayy
Just got a pound of the boof, ayy
Brought that shit straight to the booth, ayy
Tommy my Hilfiger voots, ayy
She said, "Wan' fuck?" Bitch, I do, ayy
You put a gun on my mans, ayy
I put a hole in your parents, ayy
I just got lean on my Ksubis, ayy
I got a UZI, no Uzi

Fuck on me, look at me, ayy
Fuck on me, yah, look at me, ayy
Look at me, look at me, yah
Fuck on me, yah, aye
Look at me, yah, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me, yah
Look at me, fuck on me
Yah, ayy

Tell these fuck nigga voot me up, pipe up
Ayy, shouts-out Bans and them
Ayy

I took a white bitch to Starbucks
That little bitch got her throat fucked
I like to rock out like I'm misfit
My emo bitch like her wrist slit
Curly hair bitch like I'm Corbin
Got, like, three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head

Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah, aye
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah
