		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you're given
What you live in
Darling, it finds a way to live in you
And your heart, love
Has such darkness
I feel it in the corners of the room

(If I was any closer) after the gloom
(I could only lose me) I wanna lose me
(If I fade away, let me fade away) I
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer) if I was any closer
(I could only lose me) I could be lost
(If I fade away)
No more than I was or than I (let me fade away)

Want to be when you fall on me like night
Every time
And I want to be so far from sight and mind
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

Let all time slow
Let all light go
I don't need to know where we begin and end
I'd still know you
Not being shown you
I only need the working of my hands

(If I was any closer) you understand
(I could only lose me) I wanna lose me
(If I fade away, let me fade away) I
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer) if I was any closer
(I could only lose me) I could be lost
(If I fade away)
No more than I was or than I (let me fade away)

Want to be when you fall on me like night
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done
