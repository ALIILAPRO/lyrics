		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, one, two, three, four

Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

Said "Woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine"
All we need is just a little patience
Said "Sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine"
All we need is just a little patience 
(Patience) ooh, yeah

I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

Said "Woman, take it slow and things will be just fine"
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said "Sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright"
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, oh, I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it

(Little patience, yeah, yeah)
(Need a little patience, yeah)
(Just a little patience, yeah)
(Some more patience, yeah) I've been walking the streets at night
Just trying to get it right (a little patience, yeah)
It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd (could use some patience, yeah)
And the streets don't change but maybe the names
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (gotta have more patience, yeah)
Yea-yeah, but I need you (all need more patience)
Oh, I need you (all need some patience)
Oh, I need you (just a little patience)
Ooh this time (is all you need)
