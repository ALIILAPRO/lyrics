		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what you want me to say
So I'm giving you the right of way
You used to dance up in my attic with your clothes off
And sing me songs stuck in your head that you were fond of
Left you a note out on your tabletop
Open it up when you want the pain to stop
Want the pain to stop

If this is friendship then don't count me in
And girl I'm sort of sick of being just friends
I see you hurting and I'm losing my shit
Cause I just keep on thinking

They had their chance with you
But if you were mine I'd dance with you
Just give me a sign when you're trying to
Stop wishing for someday and look right in front of you
For something better

So baby let me get this straight
You'd rather sit up in the attic justifying crying all day
Then go driving in my Civic just to fix your stupid heartache
I think that you should probably come downstairs
Fix your makeup, take a shower, maybe brush your hair
And I'm sick and tired of seeing all the ways you staring
At losers that just played you baby
You know they're all the same

If this is friendship then don't count me in
And girl I'm sort of sick of being just friends
I see you hurting and I'm losing my shit
Cause I just keep on thinking

They had their chance with you
But if you were mine I'd dance with you
Just give me a sign when you're trying to
Stop wishing for someday and look right in front of you
For something better

They had their chance with you
But if you were mine I'd dance with you
Just give me a sign when you're trying to
Stop wishing for someday and look right in front of you
For something better

They had their chance with you
So just give me one dance with you
They had their chance with you
So just give me one dance with you
