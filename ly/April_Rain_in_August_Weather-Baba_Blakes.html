		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  hands down
there we go again, you say you want me too
but your heart plays a different tune

you’re april rain in august weather
while i’m here in the cold, still waiting
for you to come around and rest your soul

you are running crazy like the seasons, come and go, uhh
still you give me 100.000 reasons, not to throw this love away, 'cause
every touch feels wild
like a fever dance when we’re together
you are running crazy like the seasons, baby hold me on the way

stay up
late into the night and kiss out on the roof
i take your words as my proof

but you’re april rain in august weather
while i’m here in the cold, still waiting
for you to come around and rest your soul

you are running crazy like the seasons, come and go, uhh
still you give me 100.000 reasons, not to throw this love away, 'cause
every touch feels wild
like a fever dance when we’re together
you are running crazy like the seasons, baby hold me on the way
