		  (Pranksters, uh)
G's up, mm oh, haha, oh, ha
G's up, ha, oh (pop a collar to this)
Haha oh, ha (if you a player, pop a collar to this)
Yeah, yeah, come on (gangsters)
You know how we do (pop a bottle for this)
Uh, uh (if you pimpin', pop a bottle for this)

I'm the kind of brother
Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career, uh
And every lover, oh
In and out my life, I've hit, love, then left in tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl (met this girl) who turned (turned) the tables around
She caught me by surprise
And I, I never thought I'd be the one breaking down (oh)
I can't figure it out, why

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted (but she's got me twisted)
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me, yeah

Oh, now 
Let me go, baby 
Now, listen 

My mama told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
Same old song, nah
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

This girl was mean (so mean), she really (she really) turned me out
Her body was so tight
I'm looking for her in the daytime with a flashlight, yeah
My homies say this girl is cramping my style (oh, she's cramping my style)
And I can't figure it out, but

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
(Hey) I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

(Pop a collar to this)
And I think I like it, baby (if you a player, pop a collar to this, gangsters) 
Oh no, oh no (pop a bottle for this, if you pimpin', pop a bottle to this) 
Oh, yeah (pop a collar to this) 
Oh my, oh my (if you a player, pop a collar to this, gangsters) 
Oh (pop a collar to this, if you pimpin', pop a bottle to this) 

This girl was mean, she really turned me out 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sugar
My homies say this girl is cramping my style, now

I'm so (caught up)
I'm feeling it, yeah (caught up)
I don't know what it is (what it is)
But it seems she's got me twisted (she really got me twisted)
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold
I'm so (caught up)
I'm so (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me
