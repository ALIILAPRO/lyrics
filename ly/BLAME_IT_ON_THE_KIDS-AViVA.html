		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home in bed or out at night
Don't think twice
Just don't think twice
Make a choice, one you won't regret
This is your life
This is still your life

Never gone get away, never gone get away
Never gone break their chains
Watching me patiently, watching me patiently
Watching me take the blame
Never gone get away, never gone get away
Never gone break the chains
I'm running out of options, and they know

Oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh
I'm tired of holding on
Oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh
Hear me when I say

Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids

Say their names, we won't forget
This is not your fight, not your fight
You played games, but we can forgive
Put down the knife, put down the knife

Never gone get away, never gone get away
Never gone break their chains
Watching me patiently, watching me patiently
Watching me take the blame
Never gone get away, never gone get away
Never gone break the chains
I'm running out of options, and they know

Oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh
I'm tired of holding on
Oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh
Hear me when I say

Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)
Don't blame it on the kids, kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)
Don't blame it on the kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)
Don't blame it on the kids, kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)

Come out, where your pretty faces hiding
Come out, I don't see no point in lying
No doubt, you have questions I can answer
But first come out with your hands up
Come out, where your pretty faces hiding
Come out I don't see no point in lying
No doubt, you have questions I can answer
But first come out with your hands up

Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)
Don't blame it on the kids, kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)
Don't blame it on the kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)
Don't blame it on the kids, kids (oh woah, oh oh, woah oh, oh)
