		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will it come to me ? will it come to me ? 
And I saw you it's the hardest thing for me 
I started shakin' wonderin' where could you be from 
And it figures that the only thing I want is already 
Taken cut  him off let's get it done I know

I know will it come to me ? will it come to me ? 
And I know you are the one I miss I try to figure how I get out of this I know, 
I know will it come to me will it come to me? 

And I know about the way you tried to tell me it was sticky 
And settled in their tea so I freaked out blank stared into my heart 
Just like you killed me thinkin' they're still 
The key don't know how to break it to me don't know how to take it 

To me will it come to me ? will it come to me ? 
And I know you are the one I miss I try to figure how I get out of this I know,
Ow will it come to me ? will it come to me ?
