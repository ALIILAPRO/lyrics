		  Help the cause
Bring me some rum with your sweet talk
Summer is here and my request is quite clear
You've been on my mind all year

Where you going? Don't go
No no no no stay right here
I'm more sincere when I drink

Cause you were right all along i'm drunk

But I can tell, I can tell, I can
Tell you're my type of girl
All I want, all I want
Is for you and I to ride love's ferris wheel

Where you going? Don't go no no no no
Please stay back here

Cause I can tell, I can tell, I can
Tell you're my type of girl
All I want, all I want
Is for you and I to ride love's ferris wheel

Where you going? Don't go no no no no
Please stay

And help the cause
Bring me my robe with your sweet talk
Summer is here and my request is quite clear
You've been on my mind all year
So don't go

Cause you were right all along i'm drunk
