		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My father is called Miranda these days
She's a proud transgender woman
And my resentment has started to fade
Because it was never about who she was
Just the way that he behaved
And now my father is Miranda and we're ok

In all the years we were estranged
I was always hoping that you would find a way to change
And after everything that we've been through
Miranda, it's lovely to meet you

When I was young he always seemed so filled with rage
He was angry at my clothes, my hair, my music, my teen age
But one sunny afternoon, she was dancing next to me on stage
I felt my anger drain away from inside my rib cage

In all the years we were estranged
I was always hoping that you would find a way to change
And after everything that we've been through
Miranda, it's lovely to meet you

The problem with carrying hate
For someone who doesn't know
Is you're the only one carrying the weight
Best to just let it go

And get to know you for who you are
Who you really are
Who you really are
And who you've always been
Who you've always been

In all the years that we have left
Let's be our best selves, and let's be friends
I'll be me, promise me that you'll be you
Oh, Miranda, it's lovely to meet you
Oh, Miranda, it's lovely to meet you
It's lovely to meet you
