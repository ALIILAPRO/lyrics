		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good evening, my people up in the chandeliers
The wining and dining, the menu is blood, sweat and tears
Everybody ready, raining down confetti
Champions are born right now
Ain't about the glamour, click goes the hammer
Run when you hear that sound

Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I won't believe it, underdog dreamin'
Don't need no cheers, world's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line

Their dreams just keep dripping out of their golden cups
I'm starting, I'm starving, leftovers ain't enough
Ain't about the royals, they do nothing for ya
All you got is you right now
Who is gonna falter? Who is gonna conquer?
Better never count me out

Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I won't believe it, underdog dreamin'
Don't need no cheers, world's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line

Gonna make, gonna make
Gonna make it to the finish line
Every day, every day
Gonna make it to the finish line
Gonna make, gonna make
Gonna make it to the finish line
Every day, every day
Gonna make it to the finish line

Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I won't believe it, underdog dreamin'
Don't need no cheers, world's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
