		  (LexNour) no reason to be mad at me
Hah, hah it's Dax
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't get tired, no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
No, I can't stop, oh, no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
Now I'm on top and in my zone
I keep going like all night long
Like all night long, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't get tired, no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
No, I can't stop, oh no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
Now I'm on top and in my zone
I keep going like all night long
Like all night long, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't got time for the sleep
(Brr) , no, I do not get no rest (Rest)
Word about flow on the streets
Saying that Dax is the best
Niggas do wanna lil' beef
I know that here 'bout the flex (Flex)
Murda, I kill every beat
I swear to god that I'm next (Bah bah bah)
No cappin', niggas don't rap, real talk
Better know that
Murda, body bag with a toe tag
No cash, nah nigga, no collab
Must kill, nah nigga, can't hold back
Won't cole that now niggas better know that
Y'all niggas better know that (yeah)
Y'all niggas better know that, know that
Ya know that swear I won't stop, yeah
I'm tryna be the best (Tryna be the best)
Take the world by 2020
Put an S up on my chest, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

I don't get tired, no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
No, I can't stop, oh no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
Now I'm on top and in my zone
I keep going like all night long
Like all night long, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't get tired, no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
No, I can't stop oh no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
Now I'm on top and in my zone
I keep going like all night long
Like all night long, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was broke, they weren't talking to me
And now I got my cash
And where I wanted to be and sometimes
I wish they would start a problem with me
Because I, because I
Started off as a janitor
Now rapping on stage, got a manager
Bars high, and you know they would damage ya
Hey Drake, I'm the boy, been a fan of ya
Can I get you on a song off in Canada?
Tory Lanez in my line, you an animal
Everything that I touch go flammable
We the beat like a freak, I'm a cannibal
(Gang) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't get tired, no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
No, I can't stop, oh no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
Now I'm on top and in my zone
I keep going like all night long
Like all night long, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't get tired, no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
No, I can't stop, oh no, no, no
I keep going like all night long
Now I'm on top and in my zone
I keep going like all night long
Like all night long, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you let them control your mind
You're a star
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like all night long
Like all night long yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, like all night long
Yeah, like all night long
