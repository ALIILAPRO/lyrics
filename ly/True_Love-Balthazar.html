		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait here my friend
This is the end
Got tired to pretend
And well, the days are so few
Who is to say
And where do we pray
And who is it will pay
For all the things we do?
Look further no more
Got nothing in store
On everyone we swore
Well they aren't here no more
You know our deal is done
And no one has won
The scene that is dead
Won't lead us to our bed
You were so easy
Down from the start
And bound to part
But that's something we both should know
You were so easy
Down from the start
And bound to part
Wait here my friend
This is the end
Got tired to pretend
And well, the days are so few
You know who is to say
And where do we pray
And who is it will pay
For all the things that we do?
So easy
Down from the start
And bound to part
But that's something we both should know
You were so easy
Down from the start
Been round to part
That's easy
