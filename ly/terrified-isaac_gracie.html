		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I sleep all day
And drink all night
Just give me one good reason
And I'll turn out my light

Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified

And I've heard all the people
Calling my name
But they'll never just see just
How I've changed

Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified

But I don't wanna' be your boy, I wanna' be your man
But something's got me wrong inside
And I'm looking for the answer I don't understand
And, darling, I am terrified
I'm terrified
Maybe I wasn't cut out for this
You know, I'm terrified that maybe 
I wasn't cut out for this

Well, it's hard to explain
How it got this way
And people only wanna' know why
I wish I had an answer that would make it okay
But, the truth is I'm just terrified
And I don't need to remember
But I wanna' forget
Cause there's a hole in my head where
I hide my regret
Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified

But I don't wanna' be your boy, I wanna' be your man
But something's got me wrong inside
And I'm looking for the answer I don't understand
And, darling, I am terrified
I'm terrified that maybe, I wasn't cut out for this
You know I'm terrified that maybe, I wasn't cut out for this

You know, you can come and save me
But you have to take a risk
'Cause I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
