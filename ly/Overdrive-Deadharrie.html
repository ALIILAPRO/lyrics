		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you wanna have it
Come on baby grab it
I won't let them shine
If you wanna have it
Come on baby grab it
I won't be no mind

Any black bird
That I meet
On the outside
Any blackbird
In my eyes
Any blackbird
That I meet
On the outside
Any blackbird
In my eyes

I'm headstrong
I know I'm wrong
But my love
It wont go on
A thin fret
I do my best
With what I get
And fuck the rest

If you wanna have it
Come on baby grab it
I won't let them shine
If you wanna have it
Come on baby grab it
I won't be no mind

Any blackbird
That I meet
On the outside
Any blackbird
In my eyes
Any blackbird
That I meet
On the outside
Any blackbird
In my eyes

Come on let it shine
Right on top of mine
I won't be surprised
No way
Take a piece of mine
I'm hoping that you might
Take me for a ride
Cruise control
Overdrive
Away
