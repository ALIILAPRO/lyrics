		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I'm a ninja, yo
My life is like a video game
I maintain when I'm in the zone
One player, one life on the mic limited time (Yo Ninja, go!)
No fucking around I'm cutting down anyone in my path
Trying to fuck with my game with razor sharp lyrical throw stars
Here my flow's hot
Hosstyle
Wild, out of control
Ninja skop befokte rof taal
Rough rhymes, tough times
Met fokol kos, skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast
When you living on the razor edge
Stay sharp sharp
Rolling with the $0$
High energy
You never seen Zef so fresh
Uh! When we mic check Hi-Tek flows flex
Yo we optimistic, not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
I'm hard to miss
"You can't do this, you can't do that"
Yo, fuckin' who said so?
I do what I like
Too hot to handle
Too cold to hold
You can't fuck with the chosen one
I-I-I-I-I want the knife
Yo I'm a Ninja

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Ninja is poes cool
But don't fuck with my game, boy
Or I'll poes you
Life is tough when I get stuck
And my time is up I push through
Till I break-break-break on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker
Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain it's not sore
Don't ask for kak or you'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive
My blades swing free
Decapitate a hater
With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek, Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Fuck this is like
The coolest song I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
They said I was a loser
They said I was a no-one
They said I was a fucking psycho
But look at me now, all up in the interweb, world wide
2009, futuristic
Enter the Ninja
Yo-Landi Visser
DJ Hi-Tek
Die fokken Antwoord
Dis mooi ne? (I'm a ninja!)

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai (yo I'm a ninja!)
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection (yo I'm a ninja!)

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai (a motherfucking ninja!)
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection
