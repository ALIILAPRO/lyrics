		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He told me that much and now he's dead
Told me to kill my indulgences
With a sharp blow to the temple
Pick up the phone call and do everything he says
I could take a plastic camera
We could make such a pretty picture
Oh, so happy, oh, oh, so happy
I'm pretty cool once you get to know me

I feel at some point I broke my mind
I'm always searching the silent type
How do you all make it look so easy?
You open your hearts up so quickly, it scares me

She's an artist, paints across my chest
Goes to parties, act like hotel guests
Wake up Monday, now it's over
Don't you know no one gets what they came here for?
I could paint her, wrapped around her
We could make such a pretty picture
Oh, so happy, oh, oh, so happy
I'm pretty cool once you get to know me

But I'm just the same
I've got a boring name
Across the world from what you want and what you came here for
So I'll wait here for you
Said, "Please, just let me stay"
Oh, just let me stay, oh

I guess you know now what to expect
He lives your own life in retrospect
You know it bores me? These insecurities
Breaks you down just to act as the architect
I could wait here, by the west pier
Watch the flotsam float, slowly disappear
Oh, so happy, oh, oh, so happy
If only you knew just how much better things could be

Another week of action
Another hypoglycemic reaction

But I'm just the same
I've got a boring name
Across the world from what you want and what you came here for
So I'll wait here for you
I said, "Please, just let me stay"
Oh, just let me stay
Oh, just let me

I'm sorry, it's all so predictable
I'm sorry, it's all so predictable, I know
