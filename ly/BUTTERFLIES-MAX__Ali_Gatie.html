		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm-mmm

You could give me chills
On a summer day, yeah
When we're laying still
But you make my heart race
Gonna keep me young
When we're old and grey
I know that time moves on
But some things don't change

I won't stop getting butterflies
I get 'em every time
I look into your eyes
You won't stop running through my mind
For the rest of both our lives
You give me butterflies
And I keep on getting
Butterflies

I still fall in love with you
Every time I see your eyes
It takes me back to the first time
I saw you smile
They told us we were young and dumb
We didn't know about love
Now look at all the things we've become

I won't stop getting butterflies
I get 'em every time
I look into your eyes
You won't stop running through my mind
For the rest of both our lives
You give me butterflies
I keep on getting (keep on getting)
Keep on getting (keep on getting)
I keep on getting (keep on getting)
Butterflies

When you walk into the room
I'm as nervous as the day I met you
I've seen that dress on you before
But every time I do
I swear it only makes me love you more

And I won't stop getting butterflies
I get 'em every time, yeah
I get 'em every time

I won't stop getting butterflies
I get 'em every time
I look into your eyes
You won't stop running through my mind
For the rest of both our lives
You give me butterflies
I keep on getting (keep on getting)
Keep on getting (keep on getting)
I keep on getting (keep on getting)
Butterflies

I keep on getting
Butterflies
