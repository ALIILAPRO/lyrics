		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ay, J1, that's flames, my bro)
How you shell the high notes? (YJay made this)
(Chee on the beat)
Yo, yuh haffi shell 'em switch on a wah? Some street, man (Josh)
Yo, yo

She only dance to Reggae and Calypso (foot)
She want gunman in her tight hole (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
See the killers make racks, it's vital (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
B-bare boom bang for a rival (feet)
HK, I'm claimin' that title
They hear W.O.T say, "Crud" and slide through

Too bad, got it burnin' again
I just hit your one, it don't make no sense
Coulda picture me swervin' again
I got bail, one time, hit the same spot again
See me, I ain't the normal type
I ain't talkin' wass, I'm just warnin' them
Bro just would've have war with them
Tryna tell you the truth, I keep evil friends
Got your shorty tryna roll with me, and
Killydem wanna make man decamp
Hit your bitch right where you sleep at
And a yute, I would hate to be man
This shit be expensive, know they offended
Arch it and bend it, grab an extension
And did I mention that it get dreadful
Take your girl rental
YV go mental, why?

Never bought me a Canada Goose or a Moncler
Man got a heat from the street 'cause I'm from there
Throw up your 2's or P's if you're from here 
Man think he clear 'cause he just bought Moncler
Penge boy made your girl tip-toe
Spilled that juice like wine or Calypso 
M splashed that, left pavement like Vimto
Popped that door then popped it like pimple
Cute and petite, that's kinda my taste
The bats are on wire, fire on blades
Can't forget Crims, I can't forget Face
J22 got life in the cage
If Chase didn't snitch, I would've said Chase
CH still on PB Estates
Cute and petite, that's kinda my taste
Two hands on her waist, Controlla like Drake (Controlla)

She only dance to Reggae and Calypso (foot)
She want gunman in her tight hole (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
See the killers make racks, it's vital (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
B-bare boom bang for a rival (feet)
HK, I'm claimin' that title
They hear W.O.T say, "Crud" and slide through

She only dance to Reggae and Calypso (she dance)
Carni time, she wiggle to Soca
Mexican one, she bad
Spicin' it up, man give her the salsa (spice)
Don't give my badman chat
Whack with the bottle, man give him Corona (whack, whack, whack)
What's with the vibe right now?
Send me the addy, I will slide in an owner (ayy, send me the addy)
Rumors that I ran from somebody
False fact, I ain't ran from nobody (never)
Times change, why the hell now she call me hunny?
'Cause she saw me on the tune with Russ and Buni
Don't care how many man I bring
Bring in the heat like it's autumn, spring
Oh, she nice, let me try my ting
She winked and gave me a cheeky drinker

J'déboule en BSB, j'déboule en Céline
Vide mon Glock et j'grick, paw
Pull up sous filtré, lean, splash
Laissez mes opps dans big flaques
Fais le fou que quand c'est au phone
Mais t'es différent quand t'es plus dans ta zone, nan
Confiance en personne
Pour ça qu'on est armés comme dans Warzone
Eux, c'est des snitchs, ils ont même pas d'hood
Revends des kil', revends par beaucoup
J'm'allume au shit, smoke ma Backwoods
Smoke ma
Eux, c'est des snitchs, ils ont même pas d'hood
Revends des kil', revends par beaucoup
J'm'allume au shit, smoke ma Backwoods
Smoke ma

I remember back in the day how I did them niggas
You alright, man? You must be triggered (facts)
If you really wanna catch this get-back
Don't blame him, got room for swimmers
Can't lie when I push his head back
Man get back in auto dingers (bap)
Man ride with the shh and the passy get hit
Like Ricky when he caught that drillin'

She only dance to Reggae and Calypso (foot)
She want gunman in her tight hole (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
See the killers make racks, it's vital (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
B-bare boom bang for a rival (feet)
HK, I'm claimin' that title (aye)
They hear W.O.T say, "Crud" and slide through
