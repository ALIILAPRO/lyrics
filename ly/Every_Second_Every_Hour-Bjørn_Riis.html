		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day and every night
Every second every hour
Always on the run
Always on the move

Time is passing by
Time is catching up on me
Don't know where I've been
Or where I'm going to

Lay down don't make a sound
Hold still and keep the line
Day in and day out
Every second every hour

Wake up and go to sleep
Sit down and do your job
Always do what you're told
Day in and day out

Down by the river 
On my knees I fold my hands
And I prayed to someone 
To something 
To help me understand
But the silence caught me
And I fell
I fell into the deep
 
Never enough
Never satisfied
Only question yourself
Always doubt when you're right 

Don't be afraid
Just do what you're told
Every second every hour
Day in and day out
