		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't sleep, I've been staying up for weeks
Watching movies on my screen
Total silence where I'm at
But I'm praying for better days
All i want is some new friends
And i love the attention
Switch my mood, it always blends
But I'm praying for better days
Love my clothes, I love myself
I did all this by myself
I don't need nobody else
But I'm praying for better days
Sick of living life this way
Why can't I just find a way?
Everything seems so fake
But i'm praying for better days
Can't control me, cannot stop
Bet you're missing me alot
Poison headed for the top
Why can't god give me a break?
Every choice I'll ever make
Every road I'll ever take
Hope it's ready for my sake
'Cause I'm praying for better days
I can't sleep, I've been staying up for weeks
Watching movies on my screen
Total silence where I'm at
But I'm praying for better days
All i want is some new friends
And i love the attention;
Switch my mood, it always blends
But I'm praying for better days
Love my clothes, i love myself
I did all this by myself
I don't need nobody else
But I'm praying for better days
Sick of living life this way
Why can't I just find a way?
Everything seems so fake
But i'm praying for better days
