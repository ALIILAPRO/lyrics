		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The desert air was sharp as a knife
The late autumn sky delivered the night
As far as I could see the road looked dark
The only life I knew was about to fall apart

Times ticking and I can't escape
The pin pulled on a hand grenade
White flags start to raise

I wonder how it got this way
I swear it felt just like yesterday
We were fearless and unafraid

Take me back to younger dreams
When times were easy and we believed
Take me back to revive my memory
I'm digging deep but I am scared that I have lost
My younger dreams

Sick and tired of just trying to survive
I've forgotten how it feels to be alive
I can only hope that I'm remembered by
The fearless heart that I once had inside

Times ticking and I can't escape
The pin pulled on a hand grenade
White flags start to raise

Take me back to younger dreams
When times were easy and we believed
Take me back to revive my memory
I'm digging deep but I am scared that I have lost
My younger dreams
(Given I have lost my younger dreams)

I wonder how it got this way
I swear it felt just like yesterday
We were fearless and unafraid

Take me back to younger dreams
When times were easy and we believed
Take me back to revive my memory
I'm digging deep but I am scared that I have lost
My younger dreams
(Given I have lost my younger dreams)

I'm never turning back until I've found
My younger dreams
