		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh life, oh barren wasteland
A wandering callous dream
We are rising and transcending
these dreamless gods, never-ending

The shackles of your demons fall
silent

A maelstrom of silvery light breaks the simulation
And the dark face of Eve paints the Sethian sky
 
Oh life, so frail
rests your body in decay
Now surpassing the corporal
One final horrid astonishment

The shackles of your demons fall
 silent

You brought death, heartbreak and pain
Your mother wept and welcomed the rain
For the lives we've led, for the songs we've sang
Like one last breath on the sacrificial flame

Soul Matter Spirit Desire
The Achamoth raped on the funeral pyre
Soul Matter Spirit Desire
Earth Wind Water and Fire
The Achamoth raped on the funeral pyre

And here, each flower, each flame
every new-born child
wears a garment of sorrow
For peace cannot ascend
with blood on my hands
and war throughout our lands

Cause here, this bountiful Earth -
The harvest static and bound
Cause here, under Achamoth skies
Where you assembled our confinement

I raise my head from the Water
The unknown has no filter
Oh Lord - Oh dreadful Watcher
Your ruin will only scratch my skin

The shackles of your demons fall
 silent

You brought death, heartbreak and pain
Your mother wept and welcomed the rain
For the lives we've led, for the songs we've sang
Like one last breath on the sacrificial flame
