		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, here we are again
I've been here before, but I couldn't tell you when
Now every step I take is on the line
And each move right wipes out what's left behind

Well, here we are this time
It starts again but I really don't know why
A misplaced step, a single slip or fall
It's back to one-dash-one, I've lost it all

If I'm stuck, I'll call you (down with the king, down with the king)
With each stage, I'll move through (down with the king, down with the king)
Well, I'll know just a little more (you are so cruel, you are so cruel)
Each step alone brings us closer to that old throne (you are so cruel, you are so cruel)

So now I'll set the pace
With such short time, yeah, I really must make haste
But I don't know what's ahead, or what the ending will bring
I just need to take a minute and then try again to take out the king

If I'm stuck, I'll call you (down with the king, down with the king)
With each stage, I'll move through (down with the king, down with the king)
Well, I'll know just a little more (you are so cruel, you are so cruel)
Each step alone brings us closer to that old throne (you are so cruel, you are so cruel)

If I'm stuck, I'll call you (down with the king, down with the king)
With each stage, I'll move through (down with the king, down with the king)
Well, I'll know just a little more (you are so cruel, you are so cruel)
Each step alone brings us closer to that old throne (you are so cruel, you are so cruel)
