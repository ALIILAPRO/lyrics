		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Away out in Egypt in the Valley of Kings
Where the mummified Pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep

Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

Now if you breaking the seals
And disturbing the peace
Then you're startin' up a curse
Bringin' evil disease

Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Or just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady

Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
