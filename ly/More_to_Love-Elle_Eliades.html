		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know
The movies lie
But I hope
There is more to love than this
This can't be all of it, no
It doesn't feel right
Don't know what to say no ones to blame
But it doesn't feel right
We're in the same place and so far away
And it doesn't feel right
Don't know what it takes
But it doesn't feel right, no
There's got to be more
There's got to be more
Got to be more
Got to be more
So why (why)?
Do I keep fighting?
For a love that's not providing, no
They say you'll know when you know
So I keep on waiting with hope
But all I know is
It doesn't feel right
Don't know what to say, no ones to blame
But it doesn't feel right
We're in the same place and so far away
And it doesn't feel right
Don't know what it takes
But it doesn't feel right, no
There's got to be more
There's got to be more
Got to be more
Got to be more
More
Got to be more
Got to be more
Got to be more
Got to be more
