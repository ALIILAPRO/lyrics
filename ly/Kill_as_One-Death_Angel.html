		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strangers beware but come if you dare
You've entered their sacred domain
Keep to yourself or with them you'll be dealt
The thrashers will put you to shame

Fight for your life but you have not a chance
Violence runs in their blood
Tear you apart as they rip out your heart
You've come to the wrong neighborhood

Kill as one

Come take a chance in the unholy dance
Where blood on your face is a treat
Dive off the stage your mind filled with rage
You're lucky to land on your feet

Jocks come along and they think they're so strong
Looking to start up a fight
They don't play fair jocks outnumbered and scared
Death will occur on this night

Kill as one
