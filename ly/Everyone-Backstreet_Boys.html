		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been through days of thunder
Some people say we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together in the new year strong

Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to

[Chorus]
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone
This one goes out to you,
Everyone
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done
This one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around will always stay the same
Oh yeah 

Let's get on with the show
(Oh let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are 
(we know who you are)

[Chorus]

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

Here
We're standing stronger from what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you... yeah

[Chorus: x2]
