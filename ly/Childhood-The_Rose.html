		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staying up late at night
Imagining all kinds of settings
Dreaming about my life
Everything seemed so possible then
Now I don't even dream
Sick of feeling low again

Saying that I'm the one
Thinking the world revolved around me
Hoping for someone
To come and save me from this story
Now I don't even lean
Sick of waiting on my dreams

Don't forget when you were a child
시간이 흘러도
Let it stay in your mind
Don't live your life like you have a thousand years
Ready for you to waste your time
On regrets
Don't you ever you will never

잊고 살지마
네 머릿속에 있던 꿈들
더 때묻지마
세상이 너를 더럽혀도
빼앗기지마 그
맑고 순수했던 동심을

Don't forget when you were a child
시간이 흘러도
Let it stay in your mind
Don't live your life like you have a thousand years
Ready for you to waste your time
On regrets
Don't you ever you will never

Should've never given up
Should've never said I can't
Judging me for who I am
Should've never listened no
Should've followed my own dreams
It's better late than never yeah

Don't (don't) forget when you were a child (forget when you were a child)
시간이 흘러도 (ooh)
Let it stay in your mind
Don't live your life like you have a thousand years
Ready for you to waste your time
On regrets
Don't you ever you will never
