		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say "I love you" while you're with somebody else 
I should have known that you were only in it for yourself 
I hate to tell ya but he isn't with you for your brain (No, no) 
I bet you probably even have to have this song explained 

I saw you hold his hand and walk across the street one day 
You and your lover never made it out of the way 
So I guess you'll never dance again 

I kinda thought you'd be a little quicker on your feet 
Being graceful doesn't help ya, baby, when you cheat (No, no, no) 

You ate the pavement after all the little games you played 
And met the bumper of the driver that you betrayed 
So I guess you'll never dance again
