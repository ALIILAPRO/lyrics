		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away
Losin' my faith today
We're fallin' off the edge today
I am just a man, not superhuman
I'm not superhuman
Someone save me from the hate

It's just another war
Just another family torn
We're falling from my faith today
Just a step on the edge
Just another day in the world we live

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero
To save me now
I need a hero to save my life
A hero will save me
Just in time

I've gotta fight today to live another day
Speakin' my mind today
My voice will be heard today
I've gotta make a stand, but I am just a man
I'm not superhuman
My voice will be heard today

It's just another war
Just another family torn
My voice will be heard today
It's just another kill
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero
To save me now
I need a hero to save my life
A hero will save me
Just in time

I need a hero to save my life
I need a hero just in time
Save me just in time
Save me just in time

Who's gonna fight for what's right, who's gonna help us survive?
We're in the fight of our lives
And we're not ready to die
Who's gonna fight for the weak, who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero
I've got a hero
Livin' in me
I've gotta fight for what's right, today I'm speakin' my mind
And if it kills me tonight
I will be ready to die
A hero's not afraid to give his life
A hero's gonna save me just in time

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero
To save me now
I need a hero to save my life
A hero will save me
Just in time
I need a hero

Who's gonna fight for what's right, who's gonna help us survive? 
I need a hero
Who's gonna fight for the weak, who's gonna make 'em believe?
I need a hero
I need a hero
A hero's gonna save me just in time
