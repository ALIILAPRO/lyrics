		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to count the stars in the sky
Now I count the ones in your eyes
I used to think that my paradise
Was somewhere waiting on the other side
But you take me higher than I've been
Laying hands on my skin
It's true, nothing compares to you

So tell me why
What good is life
If we're all just waiting to dance in the sky?
I'm already there, here in your eyes
We climb the gates every time that you lie down next to me
I rest in peace
They say it's better, but how could that be?
If everyone had a love like us
They wouldn't call that place above heaven

Waking up to you feels like a pinch myself moment
If we're only here for a while
I wanna spend all of it holding you
Take me higher than I've been
Got me questioning everything I knew, ooh
'Cause nothing compares to you

So tell me why
What good is life
If we're all just waiting to dance in the sky?
I'm already there, here in your eyes
We climb the gates every time that you lie down next to me
I rest in peace
They say it's better, but how could that be?
If everyone had a love like us
They wouldn't call that place above heaven

Nothing comes, nothing comes close to this
Looking up, looking up even if it exists
My heaven is on your lips

So tell me why
What good is life
If we're all just waiting to dance in the sky?
I'm already there, here in your eyes
We climb the gates every time that you lie down next to me
I rest in peace
They say it's better, but how could that be?
If everyone had a love like us
They wouldn't call that place above heaven
