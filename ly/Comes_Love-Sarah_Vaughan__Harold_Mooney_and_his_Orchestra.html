		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Comes a rainstorm
Put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snowstorm
You can get a little heat
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a fire
Then you know just what to do
Blow a tire
You can buy another shoe
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Don't try hiding
'Cause there isn't any use
You'll start sliding
When your heart turns on the juice

Comes a headache
You can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache
See your dentist right away
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a heatwave
You can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons
You can hide behind the door
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes the measles
You can quarantine a room
Comes a mousy
You can chase it with a broom
Comes love
Nothing can be done

That's all, brother
If you ever been in love
That's all, brother
You know what I'm speaking of

Comes a nightmare
You can always stay awake
Comes depression
You may get another break
Comes love
Nothing can be done
Comes love
Nothing can be done
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes love
Comes love
Comes love
Comes love
