		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you like to gamble
I tell you, I'm your man
You win some, lose some
It's all the same to me

The pleasure is to play
Makes no difference what you say
I don't share your greed
The only card I need
Is the Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades

Playing for the high one
Dancing with the devil
Going with the flow
It's all a game to me

Seven or eleven
Snake eyes watching you
Double up or quit
Double stake or split
The Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades

You know I'm born to lose
And gambling's for fools
But that's the way I like it, baby
I don't want to live forever
And don't forget the joker

Pushing up the ante
I know you got to see me
Read 'em and weep
The dead man's hand again

I see it in your eyes
Take one look and die
The only thing you see
You know it's gonna be
The Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades, uh
