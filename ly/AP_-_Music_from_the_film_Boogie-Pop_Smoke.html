		  AP (Rico's going crazy again)
AP, yeah (ah, haha)
Ayy, turn it up in the headphones (this is a Melo beat)
Look

AP, spicy (spicy)
I bust a check in my Nikes (I bust a check)
Am I a killer? Might be (might be)
Two tone, icy (icy)
AP, spicy (spicy)
I bust a check in my Nikes (I bust a check)
Am I a killer? Might be (might be)
Two tone, icy (icy)

Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Or don't talk at all, uh (or don't talk at all)
I make a call and it's war (I make a call)
I'm off that Adderall (I'm off that Adderall)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Or don't talk at all, uh (or don't talk at all)
I make a call and it's war (I make a call)
I'm off that Adderall (I'm off that Adderall)

Get to sprayin' niggas 'cause I hate niggas
Fuck niggas, I ain't playing with 'em
I don't really wanna hear niggas
I don't got nothing to say, nigga
I'm with bae eatin' steak dinner
Just know he got a K with him
And my little mama got it in her purse
All I gotta say is, "Bae get 'em"
If I run down, it's a drum round (brrt)
All you gonna hear is gun sounds
Niggas know I bring them guns out
I make it hot when it's sundown, uh
Fever, shawty wanna act like a diva
Shawty wanna suck on my nina (nina)
I leave that shit wet, Aquafina

AP, spicy (spicy)
I bust a check in my Nikes (I bust a check)
Am I a killer? Might be (might be)
Two tone, icy (icy)
AP, spicy (spicy)
I bust a check in my Nikes (I bust a check)
Am I a killer? Might be (might be)
Two tone, icy (icy)

Talk to me nice
Or don't talk at all, uh
I make a call and it's war
I'm off that Adderall
Talk to me nice
Or don't talk at all, uh
I make a call and it's war
I'm off that Adderall

Look, I got fifty-two shots in this Glock
And a infrared up on a opp if he let off
Trey Suvy hold a chop
Yellow tape when it pop, knock his head off
Load up the chop, it go dumb
Nigga see me and he run
Silencer up on the gun
Niggas'll shoot you for nothin'
Trey Suvy
Boy playin' with the toolie
I bet he'd make a movie
Woo, woo
Pop dripped up in Louis
Couple hundred in some jewelry
Spent fifty-five on her booty
Touch her ass and niggas shootin'

AP, spicy
I bust a check in my Nikes
Am I a killer? Might be
Two tone, icy
AP, spicy
I bust a check in my Nikes
Am I a killer? Might be
Two tone, icy

Talk to me nice
Or don't talk at all, uh
I make a call and it's war
I'm off that Adderall
Talk to me nice
Or don't talk at all, uh
I make a call and it's war
I'm off that Adderall
