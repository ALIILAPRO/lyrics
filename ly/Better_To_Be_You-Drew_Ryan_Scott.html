		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you tell someone you love
That everything about them makes
You feel that you're not good enough
They're better in every single way
Or at least in things of this world
That seem to matter anyway
There's no one I can go to
There's no one I can turn to
There's nothing I can say
Coz it's not your fault
You're the source of my insecurity
You're the boy she will
Always choose not me
It's a cold and a strange reality
When you can't escape
The truth that in this life
It's better to be you
It's better to be you
I don't want you to meet my friends
Coz if you meet the girl
I'm into that's the end
But she already knows who you are
And I don't want you to be
The cause of another broken heart
There's no one I can go to
There's no one I can turn to
There's nothing I can say
Coz it's not your fault
You're the source of my insecurity
You're the boy she will
Always choose not me
It's a cold and a strange reality
When you can't escape
The truth that in this life
It's better to be you
It's better to be you
There's nothing that's wrong with me
There's nothing that I can do
There's nothing
I can say to be free from you
So when it comes to me
They're just not impressed
There's nothing wrong with me
It's just a case of good better and best
You're the source of my insecurity
But I won't let it get the best of me
It's time that I let go of jealousy
When you can't escape the truth
That in this life
It's better to be me
It's better to be me
It's better to be me
