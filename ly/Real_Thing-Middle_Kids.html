		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two trains and a bus to get home
Sleeping on each other's shoulders
Three clicks and the magic is gone
Our big dreams have turned us into
Hopeless romantics
Anxiety magnets
These streets are pulling at my memories
Pulling out my teeth

Don't it ever make you feel sad?
Ooh, is this the real thing?
Are you like me?
Do you lie awake thinking
Ooh, is this the real thing?
Ah, ooh, ah, ooh

It's the job of the young to collect ours
Afraid of our parents
And preparing to freak them out
You were my lifetime lover-ghost back then

Don't it ever make you feel sad?
Ooh, is this the real thing?
Are you like me?
Do you lie awake thinking
Ooh, is this the real thing?
Ah, ooh, ah, ooh

You said you were fine
You said you were fine
You said you were fine
You said you were fine
Ah, ooh, ah, ooh
Ah, ooh, ah, ooh

And don't it ever make you feel sad?
Ooh, is this the real thing?
Are you like me?
Do you lie awake thinking
Ooh, is this the real thing?

Don't it ever make you feel sad?
Ooh, is this the real thing?
Are you like me?
Do you lie awake thinking
Ooh, is this the real thing?
