		  Hey, slow it down
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Yeah, I'm afraid
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

There might have been a time
When I would give myself away
Oh, once upon a time
I didn't give a damn
But now here we are
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

Yeah (yeah), it's plain to see (plain to see)
That, baby, you're beautiful
And there's nothing wrong with you (nothing wrong with you)
It's me, I'm a freak (yeah)
But thanks for lovin' me
'Cause you're doing it perfectly (yeah, perfectly)

Yeah, there might have been a time
When I would let you slip away
I wouldn't even try 
But I think you could save my life

Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, what do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)

Just don't give up on me
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

So
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, what do you want from me?

Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, what do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)
