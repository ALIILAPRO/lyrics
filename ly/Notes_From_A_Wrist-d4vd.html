		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't wanna have to break it off
But you got my back up against the wall
I could take it back, but it's all my fault
And all I know is I'ma make it worse
I'm burning down, but I burn it all
I never wanna have to take a loss
Only wanted you to take my soul
But you left it with me in the name of love

Run away from home again
I'm carving these notes into bloody arms
Alone with my soul impaled
Run away from your loving arms
Why am I so afraid?
I don't care, I'm not coming home
Why am I crying if this is what I wanted all along?

They don't wanna, they don't wanna
They take advantage of the lonely ones
I'm washing my hands in this bloody water
I miss the way that I thought it was
You, me, against the world
And now the whole world is just against me (yeah, mm)
Can't take it, nah, can't take it all
You don't wanna have to lose it all
But I would rather lose it anyway
I swear, I knew I'd lose it anyway
I use your picture as a Band-Aid
To cover every single hurting place
And I don't think that I can take it all
I really wish that I could take it all
It's so cold

Run away from home again
I'm carving these notes into bloody arms
Alone with my soul impaled
Run away from your loving arms
Why am I so afraid?
I don't care, I'm not coming home
Why am I crying if this is what I wanted all along?

I don't even know where I'm going, but I'm going there fast, uh
My actions only matter in the present, I don't care about the past (no)
And I don't got the answers to your questions
So can you please stop asking me? Stop asking me
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Why am I so afraid of you?
Your stare makes me so uncomfortable, uh
'Cause I see myself in your eyes, uh
Your eyes, uh

Run away from home again, I've tried
So many lives that I've died in
Why am I so indecisive?
