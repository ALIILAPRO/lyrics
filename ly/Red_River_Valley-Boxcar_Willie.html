		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (D) From this valley they say you are going,
I will miss your bright eyes and sweet (A) smile,
For they (D) say you are taking the (G) sunshine,
That has (D) brightened our (A) pathway a-(D)-while,

Come and sit by my side if you love me,
Do not hasten to bid me a-(A)-dieu,
Just re-(D)-member the Red River (G) Valley,
And the (D) one that has (A) loved you so (D) true,

Far along by my dear I've been waiting,
For those words that you never would (A) say,
But at (D) last all my fond hopes have (G) vanished,
For to-(D)-day, you are (A) going a-(D)-way,

Come and sit by my side if you love me,
Do not hasten to bid me a-(A)-dieu,
Just re-(D)-member the Red River (G)Valley,
And the (D) one that has (A) loved you so (D true,

Won't you think of this valley you're leavin',
And how lonely and sad it will (A) be,
And (D) think of the heart you are (G) breakin',
And the (D) grief that you are (A) causing (D) me,

Come and sit by my side if you love me,
Do not hasten to bid me a-(A)-dieu,
Just re-(D)-member the Red River (G) Valley,
And the (D) one that has (A) loved you so (D) true.
