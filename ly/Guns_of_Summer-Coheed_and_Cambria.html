		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this is my last chance, keep it
I don't need your jokes
I'm better off without the misunderstanding
If I am displeasing, then leave me
The reason to all our worth
Would I truly care if we truly mean nothing?

Oh, have we been fed crazy
Or will the curtains save me
From my final call?

No one will save us
You think that somebody cares why the water is rising up?
Let the cleansing begin
Mother, will they ever thank you?
Instead we hide behind these foolish lies
Ambition has told us otherwise

Cold as winter's guns of summer
Point and watch them run
Summer's will and debris in the sun
If this is your last chance, will you give up?

But in my turning towards the new
And disregarding in these old ways
Will we gain some truth or suffer again?
Allow it as it breaks
And showers us all
Rain down fire, burn us all

No one will save us
You think that somebody cares why the water is rising up?
Let the cleansing begin
Mother, will they ever thank you?
Instead we hide behind these foolish lies
Magicians have told us otherwise

Cold as winter's guns of summer
Point and watch them run
Summer's will and debris in the sun
If this is your last chance, will you give up?

(There is only one judge)
(It is, it is, it is yourself)

Cold as winter's guns of summer
Point and watch them run
Summer's will and debris in her son
This is your last chance, will you give up?
Run, Summer's will and debris in her son
This is your last chance, will you-
This is your last chance

(Cold as winter's guns)
Oh, this is your last chance, will you give-
(Cold as winter's guns)
Oh, this is your last chance, will you-
(Cold, cold)
Oh, this is your last chance, will you give-
(As winter's guns)
Oh, this is your last chance, will you-
