		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sexy, hot, I love your style girl, put it on me
Brian and Tony Gold let the ladies know, they got it goin' on
Uh Shaggy

Hey sexy lady, I like your flow
Your body's bangin', out of control (uh)
You put it on me (that's right) ceiling to floor
Only you can make me, scream and beg for more

Her body's callin' bawlin' got me crawlin' up the wall and
My size ain't small it's tall and catch a glimpse her clothes be fallin'
Her neighbor's callin' bawlin' all this noise is so appallin'
They must believe we're brawlin' headboards bang 'til early mornin'

Hey sexy lady (uh) I like your flow (y'all dig me)
Your body's bangin' (yo) out of control (a big tune)
You put it on me (uh) ceiling to floor girl (ceiling to floor girl)
Only you can make me (uh) screamin' back for more

I was hers for the choosin', performance left her snoozin'
Rug burns her knees were bruised and she's hooked ain't no refusin'

I knew it all along (uh) she was the perfect one (wah?)
She really put it on (on me) I had to write a song

Hey sexy lady (she's drivin' me nuts) I like your flow (uh uh)
Your body's bangin' (sexy lady) out of control (sweet and nice)
You put it on me (you know you got that figure) ceiling to floor 
(that hourglass ship girl) Only you can make me (wow) screamin' back for more

Hey sexy lady you be fine drive me crazy movin' on, and on, and on
Hey sexy lady you be fine drive me crazy movin' on, and on, and on

Gyal your extra sexy like (whoa) and you make me want to say (hi)
When you shake, you shake it down (low)
Gyal you wicked to ras it nah (lie)
Gyal I like the way how you (flow) every time you passing me (by)
Gyal you wiggle it, jiggly and (oh) and you wicked to ras it nah (lie)

Hey sexy lady (uh) I like your flow (what up?)
Your body's bangin', out of control (see what I'm talkin' girl)
You put it on me (put it on me baby) ceiling to floor (uh)
Only you can make me screamin' back for more

Uh, moist, ha ha ha ha ha ha
