		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't remember when we met 
Because she didn't have a top on (top on)
I improvised a little bit 
She said my references were spot on (spot on)
"Can I take you for a drink?"
She said, "Oh God, I'll have to think
Because we're mates, it doesn't feel right" (feel right)
And I said, "It's cool" and, "I was messin'"
But it's true, yeah, it's you
You're the one that makes me feel right

I've been in love with her for ages 
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life

I had a dream where we had kids
You would cook, I'd do the nappies (nappies)
We went to Winter Wonderland
And it was shit, but we were happy (happy)
I'm sorry that I'm kinda queer
It's not as weird as it appears
It's 'cause my body doesn't stop me (stop me)
Oh, it's okay
Lots of people think I'm gay
But we're friends, so it's cool
Why would it not be? (Not be)

I've been in love with her for ages
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life

And there's been no way for me to say
That I felt a certain way
In stages, oh
I think the story needs more pages, yes

I've been in love with her for ages
(For ages) and ages
I've been in love with her for ages
(For ages) and ages
I've been in love with her for ages
For ages and ages
I've been in love with her for ages
For ages and ages, yeah
I've been in love with you for ages
For ages and ages, yeah
I've been in love with you for ages
For ages
I've been in love with you for ages
