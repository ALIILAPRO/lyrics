		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was always hard to pin you down
And it was only natural for me to hope you'd come around
But please take your reservations and forget them
You know things could be so easy if you'd let them

And I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever
No, I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever

And there's a darkness in the way you sing
And something curious in how you walk as if you've got a broken wing
That makes me wanna help you find a way to throw your shadow
We can even sing songs about your past loves at my piano

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever
No, I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever

And I can always feel it
When you're getting set to run
Like you're halfway through the chorus
And you think the song is done
But baby take a minute 
Or take a beer out from the fridge
So maybe we can try this time to make it past the bridge

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
Or ever
No, I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever
Baby, I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever
No, I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever, oh no
