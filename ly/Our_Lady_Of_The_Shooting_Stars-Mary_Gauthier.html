		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our Lady of the Shooting Stars was that you last night?
Did we dance a whispered waltz, did I hold you in my sight?
When morning came with open arms she lifted you from me
The sunlight burned my eyes away now I cannot see

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars as I face the early light
All that I can think of now is joining you in flight
But I have followed gypsy's girl, I've lost my way back home
I've held the phoenix to my chest and ended up alone

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars teach me how to know
I want to feel my thoughts go dark and rest inside your flow
I'll awaken without fear and breathe the cool clean air
With your words upon my lips your will becomes my prayer

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars look what you have done
You've led me to the water's edge, running from sun
Are you in the briny mist? Do Seagulls scream your name?
Their wings suspended by your love, or do I reach for you in vain?

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?
