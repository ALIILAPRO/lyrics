		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time you lick my hand
My heart begins to kick
Towards the fire we start to dance
Burning with each kiss

Tears like a virgin
The first time from your eyes
You turn out to be all I desire

When I want love, I call on you
When I want love, I run to you
You're something more than a sweet romance
I just get one taste of you, bang go the bells

Your dreams have become as mine
Mine have become yours
Like two ships, we sail the night
Down to the distant shore

Eyes of blue, velvet touch
She's got what I want
'Round and round on the wheels of love
Drivin' me right outta control

And all is well
When I look in those eyes, bang go the bells
Yeah, you got something, baby
I just can't deny, bang go the bells

When I want love, I call on you
When I want want love, I run to you
You're something more than a cheap romance
I just take one look at you, bang go the bells

And all is well
When I look in your eyes, bang go the bells
Yeah, you got something, baby
I just can't deny, I just can't deny
I just can't deny, bang go the bells

Bang go the bells, bang go the bells, bang go the bells
Bang go the bells, bang bang bang go the bells
Bang go the bells, bang go the bells, bang go the bells
Bang go the bells, bang bang bang go the bells

Bang go the bells, bang go the bells, bang go the bells
Bang go the bells, bang bang bang go the bells
Bang go the bells, bang go the bells, bang go the bells
Bang go the bells, bang bang bang go the bells
