		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you take a look over your shoulder
Saw me standin' there, would you give me a wave?
And if I part this ocean in between us
Would you even care or would you walk away?

Fightin' for affection from you never been easy
Givin' me impressions that I gotta work hard
If I could pick you up, we'd be in Malibu speedin'
You show me directions 'til I don't know where you are

Ooh, yeah
Give me the chance
To prove that I can
Give you the world
If I was your man, yeah
Give you the world on a silver platter
Wouldn't even matter
Give you the world on a silver platter
Wouldn't even matter
It'd matter to you
Don't ever seem to mention all the things that I'd do

And can we talk about
Promises and love that we make?
And can we talk now
I oughta put a smile on your face

Ooh, ooh
Give me a chance
To prove that I can
Give you the world
If I was your man
Give me the chance (babe)
To prove that I can (to prove that I can be)
Give you the world
If I was your man, yeah
Give you the world on a silver platter
Wouldn't even matter, ah, ah
Give you the world on a silver platter
Wouldn't even matter
Give me the chance
To prove that I can
Give you the world
If I was your man, yeah

If I was your man
