		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Far on the road before us lie the mountains
Tall and mighty where they rose long ago
Hear the echoes of a melody rise
A song of those who do not live anymore

Cold and dormant in the hold of centuries
Lie the warriors of the army of stone
Waiting for the time to rise again
To stand together at the call

We're reliving now
The sparking forge melting iron
We're reliving now
The story of a kingdom awakened
Rekindle now with force
Rekindle now forevermore
We're reliving now
The rising force for a long time denied

A song of winter cold
Will storm the empty halls
As you hear the voices of dwarves
Rising from the mines
The stories have been told
The legend will live on
In the adventures that are yet to come
A song of winter cold
Will storm the empty halls
As you hear the voices of dwarves
Rising from the mines
The stories have been told
The legend will live on
Within the dwarves of the mountain reborn

Runes of magic shining on the boulders
Telling stories that were born from afar
The guardians do not fear the winter night
They wait together for the storm

In the mountains
Where the legend was born
We're the warriors
Of the army of stone

We're the dwarves
of the Mountain reborn
We're the warriors
of the army of stone
