		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a dream I saw you walkin'
Like a kid alive and talking, that was you
In the classroom you were teachin'
On the streets you were policing that was you

To the one I now know most
I will tell them of your ghost like a thing
That never, ever was
And all that ever mattered
Will some day turn back to batter like a joke
Behind thin walls you hid your feelings 
Takes four legs to make a ceilin', like a thing

In a dream I saw you walkin'
With your friends alive and talking, that was you
Well I saw it in your movement 
And even though you never knew it
Well, I knew, just how sweet it could be
If you'd never left these streets
You had me worried! So worried 
That this would last
But now im learning
Learning that this will pass
