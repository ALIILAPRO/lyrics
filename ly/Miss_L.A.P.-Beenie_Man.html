Well yuh done know a wah day mi a go dung di road
And buck up miss L.A.P (yuh nuh)
Lovely awesome person (yuh nuh)
Mi just touch her pon her shoulder one time and tell her this 

Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you, you gotta be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you, you gotta be mine

Miss World, me a eyes you for a long time
It seems like everywhere you go that's where the sun shine
I want to penetrate your mind with some strong rhyme
And entertain your thoughts with the right line
Baby cut the crap I want to make you mine
I can't take a nap until the dealy sign
Me want your body but it's like a new design
Hear me one more time 

So me go so 
Dem cute girls dem got me hurting
Is just to find the right gem
But dat a when months upon months of searching
Still can't find the right blend
So me go so den de doctor lucky when him find you lurking 
Away from de ballas dem
So me tell you den, how you have me whole body workin
Willing fi start over again 

So me go so 

Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you, you gotta be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you, you gotta be mine 
You are the product of a good mama teachin'
I gotta come correct on my preachin'
Have to be up front and no screechin'
Cause me want you up front when we go beachin'
Baby you body fine, you have me weepin'
Find me self up on your avenue screechin'
Embedded in your love I am deep in
Intellect speakin' so me go so 

I hope you know say you drive me crazy
Just by the way how you wine
But dat a when to how much girl me have a chase me
And a you stuck pon me mind
So me go so den, girl everyting just amaze me
How comes you look so fine
So me tell you den when my friends a go praise me
When me get you to be mine 

L.A.P.

Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you, you gotta be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you, you gotta be mine

Miss World, me a eyes you for a long time
It seems like everywhere you go that's where the sun shine
I want to penetrate your mind with some strong rhyme
And entertain your thoughts with the right line
Baby cut the crap I want to make you mine
I can't take a nap until the dealy sign
Me want your body but it's like a new design
Hear me one more time 

So me go so

Dem cute girls dem got me hurting
Is just to find the right gem
But dat a when months upon months of searching
Still can't find the right blend
So me go so den de doctor lucky when him find you lurking 
Away from de ballas dem
So me tell you den, how you have me whole body workin
Willing fi start over again 

So me go so

Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you, you gotta be mine
Baby you look fine, I want you to be mine
