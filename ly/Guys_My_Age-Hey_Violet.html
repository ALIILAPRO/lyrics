		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven't seen my ex since we broke up
Probably 'cause he didn't wanna grow up
Now I'm out and wearing something low-cut
'Bout to get attention from a grownup

'Cause you hold me like a woman
In a way I've never felt before
And it makes me wanna hold on
And it makes me wanna be all yours

Guys my age don't know how to treat me
Don't know how to treat me, don't know how to treat me
Guys my age don't know how to touch me
Don't know how to love me good
Guys my age don't know how to keep me
Don't know how to keep me, don't know how to keep me
Guys my age don't know how to touch me
Don't know how to love me good

All he ever wanted was to go down
What we supposed to do with all his friends around? (yeah)
Smoking weed, he'd never wanna leave the house
Got an empty cushion on that sofa now

Told him, "good luck with the next one"
Maybe she'll be just as immature
Gotta thank him, he's the reason
That I'll find out what I'm looking for

Guys my age don't know how to treat me
Don't know how to treat me, don't know how to treat me
Guys my age don't know how to touch me
Don't know how to love me good
Guys my age don't know how to keep me
Don't know how to keep me, don't know how to keep me
Guys my age don't know how to touch me
Don't know how to love me good

So I'm never going back (never going back, never going back)
No, I'm never going back (never going back, never going back)

Guys my age don't know how to treat me
Don't know how to please me, don't know how to read me
Guys my age don't know how to touch me
Don't know how to love me good
Guys my age don't know how to tease me
Don't know how to leave me, don't know how to need me
Guys my age don't know how to touch me
Don't know how to love me good

So I'm never going back
Don't know, don't know, don't know (don't know, don't know)
No, I'm never going back
Don't know how to touch me, don't know how to love me good
So I'm never going back (never going back, never going back)
No, I'm never going back (never going back, never going back)
