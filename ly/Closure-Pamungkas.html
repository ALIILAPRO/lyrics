		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel small again
Same old story
Don't you call again
I'm not sorry
I am better off without you
I am better off without you

I give up trying
At least for today
Lying is lying
It's never okay
Bend it all you want
Hide it all you can

I give up trying
I give up trying
I am better off without you
I am better off without you
So much better off without you
I'm so different when I'm with you

I'll take time again
War on worry
Don't you call again
I'm not sorry
I am better off without you
I am better off alone

I give up trying
At least for today
Lying is lying
It's never okay
Bend it all you want
Hide it all you can

I give up trying
And though I'll be sad
Lying's still lying
And I'll settle with that
Bend it all you want
Hide it all you can

I give up trying
I give up trying
I give up trying for you
I give up trying

Hu

I give up trying
At least for today
Lying's still lying
It's never okay
Bend it all you want
And hide it all you can
I promised
You trying from my mistake
And I'm hurthing

I'm better off without you
I am better off without you
So much better off without you

Only give up when its start
Still hitting and its burning
Onto you but not working
Never settle for (not yet finish)
