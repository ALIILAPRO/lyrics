		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Throw me in a landfill
Don't think about the consequences
Throw me in the dirt pit
Don't think about the choices that you make
Throw me in the water
Don't think about the splash I will create
Leave me at the altar
Knowing all the things you just escaped

Push me out to sea
On a little boat that you made out of the evergreen
That you helped your father cut away

Leave me on the tracks
To wait until the morning train arrives
Don't you dare look back
Walk away
Catch up with the sunrise

'Cause this is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
'Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts, I hate you

So leave me in the cold
Wait until the snow covers me up
So I cannot move
So I'm just embedded in the frost
Then leave me in the rain
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Wipe away your tear stains
Thought you said you didn't feel pain

Well this is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
'Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I want you so much
But I hate your guts

Well this is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
'Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I want you so much
But I hate your guts
