		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
This could be my last chance

His boss said to him now listen boy
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition you won't get very far
Sammy boy don't you know who you are
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar

So honey
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
Come on honey
