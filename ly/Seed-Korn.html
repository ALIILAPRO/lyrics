		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day it gets a little harder
Can't seem to get away
And I remember there's a certain place
A place I wish I'd stay

I feel so lost within, pressured
I'm headed for that day
Just one thought in my head, really
Do I need this fame?

Every time goddamn I look at my seed
I see something I can't be
Beautiful and carefree
That's how I used to be

Like some goddamn fucking freak
I'm so pressured, I'm so weak
Something takes a hold of me
Something I can't believe

I lay in bed at night and wonder
Should I go on this way?
It's the only thing I really got for now
And it's called fame

Every time goddamn I look at my seed
I see something I can't be
Beautiful and carefree
That's how I used to be

Like some goddamn fucking freak
I'm so pressured, I'm so weak
Something takes a hold of me
Something I can't believe

So I see this face so innocent and fine (so fine)
So I see this face and I realize it's mine

So I see this face so innocent and fine (so fine)
So I see this face and I realize it's mine

Every time goddamn I look at my seed
I see something I can't be
Beautiful and carefree
That's how I used to be

Like some goddamn fucking freak
I'm so pressured, I'm so weak
Something takes a hold of me
Something I can't believe

Like some goddamn fucking freak
Like some goddamn fucking freak
Like some goddamn fucking freak
Like some goddamn fucking freak
