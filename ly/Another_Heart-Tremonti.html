		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a shame you sold your lies before God
What our eyes have seen, oh, have you forgot?
Where's your values? Were they all thrown away?
Where's the reason you will suffer today?

Today
Today

Hard on the brain
Tear at the walls to find it
Toss it away
Find me another heart
Break the inside
Hurt in a way you'll like it
Eager to find
Find me another heart

Learn a lesson from the words that you speak
Feigned forgiveness 'cause the wounds are too deep
The end's a lonely place and now it is here
You live your final days alone with your fear

Your fear
Your fear

Hard on the brain
Tear at the walls to find it
Toss it away
Find me another heart
Break the inside
Hurt in a way you'll like it
Eager to find
Find me another heart

It's a shame
Such a shame oh

Hard on the brain
Tear at the walls to find it
Toss it away
Find me another heart
Break the inside
Hurt in a way you'll like it
Eager to find
Find me another heart

Find me another heart
Find
Find me another heart
