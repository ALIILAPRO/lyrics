		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I make the space, make the space for you
And you rearrange when I need you to

Look at how far we got
I would of never thought
Look all around you (you)
Lucky I found you (you)

Look how you made your way
Wasn't it worth the wait?
Look all around you
Lucky I found you

Let me take it off of you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

Trying something new with you
I'm gonna trust you
'Cause I want to
'Cause I want to
'Cause I want to
'Cause I want to

We good and we good for each other
I won't put no one above ya
I won't put no one in front of ya

We good for each other
I won't put no one above ya
Like look all around you
Damn, I'm so lucky I found you

Let me take it off of you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

Trying something new with you
I'm gonna trust you
'Cause I want to

'Cause I want to
I don't have to
But I want to

Trust, trust
Trust, do you trust?
Trust, trust
Trust, can you trust me?
Like, really trust me?
