		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down a peg or two we all go
Behind a wall of eyes
Of your own device
Is that still you?
With hollow eyes
Changed to black and white
Strap yourself in

I try, but it don't go away
I try, but it don't go away

Let us raise our glasses
To what we don't deserve
Or what we're not worthy of
So rich and white
To the grains of sand
Slipping through our hands

(One, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
I try, but it don't go away (one, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)

Is that still you? (One, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
Through hollow eyes (one, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
Changed to black and white (one, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
So strap yourself in (one, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
(One, two, three, four, five)
