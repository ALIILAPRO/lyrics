		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said the voice from afar
Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard
Waiting for everyone else around to agree
Might take too long
Might take too long

Then it won't be so hard (it won't be so hard)
Well it's true yes but you
Won't get far telling me
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do

Oh, alter ego

Get them to love you
While they may, depending on your words and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else, nobody else

If I could part, it wouldn't be so hard (it won't be so hard)
Well, it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me

That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do

Oh, alter ego
