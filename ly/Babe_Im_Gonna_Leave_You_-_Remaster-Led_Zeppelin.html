		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along

Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
Baby, I wanna leave you
I ain't jokin', woman, I've got to ramble
Oh yeah
Baby, baby, I be leavin'
We really got to ramble
I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do
I can hear it callin' me back home

Babe, oh
Babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby
You know, I've really got to leave you
Oh, I can hear it callin' me
I said don't you hear it callin' me the way it used to do?
Oh

I know, I know
I know I never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I gotta go away from this place
I gotta quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Don't you hear it callin' me?

Oh, woman, woman, I know, I know
It feels good to have you back again
And I know that one day, baby, it's really gonna grow, yes, it is
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away
Oh

So good, see, baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now, I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh

Baby, baby, baby
That's when it's callin' me
I said that's when it's callin' me back home
