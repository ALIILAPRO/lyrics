		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you've been going so crazy 
Lately, nothing seems to be going right 
So low, why'd you have to get so low?
You're so
You've been waiting in the sun too long 

But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing 
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing 

Colder, crying over your shoulder 
Hold her, and tell her everything's gonna be fine 
Surely, you've been going too early
Hurry, 'cause no one's gonna be stopped 
Now, now, now, now, now

But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Baby, there's something going on today 
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing 
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
So, now, now, now, now, now

But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing 
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Ah, baby, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
