		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, woah
I never been scared
I tell you that I don't care
Really I do care
I hope that you care (You know it's Mitch Mula)
I never been scared to love (Drop that bombaclot)

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love just scared of love
Not enough I'm not enough
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still I'm not getting enough

You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
No, I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked out
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love just scared of love
Not enough I'm not enough
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love just scared of love
Not enough I'm not enough
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still I'm not getting enough
