		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sinkin' low, highs and lows
Nothin' to cure it, I'm losin' faith (woah)
Sinkin' now, swim for shore
Ready to prove it, my love, baby
I've been shipwrecked, stole my heart of gold (oh)
My soul (woah) is stuck healin' here (oh-oh)
Will you find me before I'm skull and bones?
S-O-S, fire, ayy-yeah, I'm outta time, I am

No one looks like you, no one walks that way
And I say, "Who are you? Who are you? What's your name?" (Oh, yeah, yeah)
If I lose, I lose (oh, yeah, yeah), I'll get you someday
S-O-S, fire, ayy-yeah, S-O-S, fire, ayy-yeah

The one thing 'bout your love
I always fall for it
When you're fire, you see smoke (oh-oh)
Shooter, shooter, light it up, light it up
Girl, you're my favorite
Why don't you want love? (Oh-oh)
Shooter, shooter

Careful with you (you), be careful with me (me, me)
Don't tell me to decide when we fightin', woah (woah)
Careful with you, watch what you're speakin'
I'll see your true side
How do I get home, sweet home?
How long have I been gone? Who knows?
Tell me, where do we go from here?
I know that you love me, but you act like you confused

No one looks like you (oh-oh), no one walks that way
And I say, "Who are you? Who are you? What's your name?" (Oh, yeah, yeah)
If I lose, I lose (oh, yeah, yeah), I'll get you someday
S-O-S, fire, ayy-yeah, S-O-S, fire, ayy-yeah

The one thing 'bout your love
I always fall for it
When you're fire, you see smoke (oh-oh)
Shooter, shooter, light it up, light it up
Girl, you're my favorite
Why don't you want love? (Oh-oh)
Shooter, shooter

And if you leave here, don't come back again (don't come back), yeah
And if you leave here, don't come back again (back again, oh, I), yeah
I love how your skin on coco
Ooh, baby, don't know your worth
Only fuck tings with choco
Hurry up, I need you to hurry up
Wrap me up in your love like fanta
Your heart can heal my scars
Hurry up, I need you to hurry up
Hurry up, hurry up

One thing 'bout your love (one thing about)
I always fall for it (oh)
When you're fire, you see smoke
Shooter, shooter, light it up, light it up
Girl, you're my favorite
Why don't you want love?
Shooter, shooter, shooter
