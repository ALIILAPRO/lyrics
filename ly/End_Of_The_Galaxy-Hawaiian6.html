		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Sun rises above
the horizon and
The gears are starting
to go around today
Making a lot of noises,
Loading a lot of things
It runs slowly
The wave sweeping out
yesterday's irritation and tears
The new hope
that birds sing about
Rays peeping through the clouds
Shine on streets
The scent of life rising
from the chimney
A familiar road
Days going on
The stars are falling,
the flowers are fading
Today, somewhere a fire goes out
Someone hopes and someone prays
Now that
I'm looking up to the sky
Newborn's small hands
Hold the light
As tight as he can
to make sure it is in there

In a small planet at
end of the galaxy
Today, somewhere
a fire is blazing up
For someone
who can't live his life,
Someone sings a song today
The sun sinks below the horizon
And the sun rises again
It repeats them
You have a good night
Have a nice dream
Your wish will come true
The stars are falling,
the flowers are fading
Today, somewhere a fire goes out
Someone hopes and someone prays
Now that
I'm looking up to the sky
Newborn's small hands
Hold the light
As tight as he can
to make sure it is in there
Somewhere, a life is born today
Somewhere, stars fall
In the corner of
end of the galaxy
We are waiting for,
believing in something
The sun rises
The day different from
yesterday starts
