(Trenchwerk)

(Ayy)
Mama told me (ayy)
Not to sell work (mama)
Seventeen five, same color t-shirt (white) 
Mama told me (ayy)
Not to sell work (mama)
Seventeen five, same color t-shirt (yeah)

Young nigga poppin' with a pocket full of cottage (ayy)
Woah, Kemosabe, chopper aimin' at your noggin (ayy)
Had to cop the Audi, then the top, I had to chop it (skrrt, skrrt) 
Niggas pocket watchin', so I gotta keep the rocket (grrah)

Neck water faucet (water)
Mockingbirds mocking (woo)
Act' pint stocking (act')
Gnats keep thottin' (gnat)
Wrist on hockey (hockey)
Wrist on rocky (rocky) 
Lot of niggas copy, huh
Name someone can stop me (no one)
Bitches call me papi (bitch)
'Sace, that's my hobby ('Sace)
Scotty on the molly, pocket rocket from O'Reilly (grrah) 
One off in the chamber, ain't no need for me to cock it (uh-uh)
Niggas get to droppin' when that Draco get to poppin' (frr) 
All I want is cottage, roll a cigar full of broccoli (cookie) 
No check, want all cash, nigga, I don't do deposits (uh-uh)
Bitches cross the border, nigga, bitches from the tropics (whew)
I'ma get that bag, nigga, ain't no doubt about it (yup)
I'ma feed my family, nigga, ain't no way around it (family)
Ain't gon' never let up, nigga, God said show my talent (show it)
Young nigga with the Anna, walkin' with the hammer (grrah)
Talkin' country grammar, nigga, straight out Nawf Atlanta (Nawfside)

Young nigga poppin' with a pocket full of cottage (ayy)
Woah, Kemosabe, chopper aimin' at your noggin (ayy)
Had to cop the Audi, then the top, I had to chop it (skrrt, skrrt)
Niggas pocket watchin', so I gotta keep the rocket 

(Ayy)
Mama told me (ayy)
Not to sell work (mama)
Seventeen five, same color t-shirt (white)
Mama told me (ayy)
Not to sell work (mama)
Seventeen five, same color t-shirt (yeah)

Mama told you
Mama told me (mama)
Not to sell work

Seventeen five, same color t-shirt (white)

1995 (90s)
2005 (2000s)
Seen it with my eyes (seen it)
Dope still alive (dope)
Real mob ties (mob)
Real frog eyes (frog)
Real whole pies (woah)
All-time high (high)
Do it for the culture (culture)
They gon' bite like vultures (vultures)
Way back when I was trappin' out Toyotas (woo, skrrt, skrrt)
I'ma hit the gas (gas)
12 can't pull me over (12)
Space coupe, Quavo Yoda, pourin' drank in sodas

I get high on my own, sir
Heard you gon' clone, sir
Stop all that flexin', young nigga don't wanna go there
Never been a gopher but I always been a soldier (no)
Young niggas in the cut, posted like a vulture (woo, bah)
Divin' off the stage in the crowd, it's a mosh pit (dive)
Yeah, shawty bad, but she broke and she don't own shit
Mama asked me, "Son, when the trappin' gon' quit?" (Mama, mama)
I been ridin' 'round through the city in my new bitch (woo, skrrt)

Young nigga poppin' with a pocket full of cottage (ayy)
Woah, Kemosabe, chopper aimin' at your noggin (ayy)
Had to cop the Audi, then the top, I had to chop it (skrrt, skrrt) 
Niggas pocket watchin', so I gotta keep the rocket

(Ayy)
Mama told me (ayy)
Not to sell work (mama)
Seventeen five, same color t-shirt (white) 
Mama told me (ayy)
Not to sell work (mama)
Seventeen five, same color t-shirt (yeah)

Mama told you
Mama told you
