		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebodys gonna hurt your feelings
Some lovers gonna break your heart 
Tear into a million pieces 
Sometimes somethings fall apart 
Not every day is gonna easy 
You might collect somes scars
But that's all part of being human

We will fall we will break 
Yeah We all will make mistakes 
Do be scared It's ok
Cause tomorows another day 
Let the rain the wash away 
All the problems of yesterday 
We will fall and we will break 
We're only human anyway 

We're only human anyway
We're only human anyway

Go easy on yourself keep trying 
Keep going the best you can 
Cause lord knows you're bound to fly yeah 
Bright futures in your hand 
Nothing's gonna stop you now 
Keep you're head out of the clouds
And just remember that you're only human 

We will fall we will break 
Yeah We all will make mistakes 
Do be scared It's ok
Cause tomorrow's another day 
Let the rain the wash away 
All the problems of yesterday 
We will fall and we will break 
We're only human anyway 

We're only human anyway
We're only human anyway
We're only human anyway
We're only human anyway

Nothing's gonna stop you now
Keep your head out of the clouds
And just remember that you're only human
