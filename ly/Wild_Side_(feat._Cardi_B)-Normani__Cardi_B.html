		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm ready to pull up on you
I'm ready to do what I do
Baby, what you wanna do?
Shoot your shot 'cause I'm bulletproof
Load it up and doot-doot-doot (doot-doot)
Baby, what you wanna do? (Doot-doot-doot-doot)
I'm ready to pull up on you (you, you, you)
I'm ready to do what I do (doot-doot-doot, ooh)

This type shit have you wildin' (ooh)
Last minute trips to the islands (ooh)
Drip, drip, drip when you slide in (ooh)
Fit, fit, fit, baby, right in (ooh)
Don't hesitate when you (ooh)
In it 'cause you know I like it (ooh)
Bakin' up a cake for you (ooh)
Sweet baby, like it when you bite it

We can't just keep talkin' about it
We think too often about it
We can't just be cautious about it
I wanna get wild
Take me for a ride, boy
Show me your wild side, boy
Know it's been a while, boy
I wanna get wild

I wanna drive you crazy (crazy)
Pull up inside me, baby (boy)
Fuckin' it up like oopsie-daisy
Ain't no ifs, and, buts, or maybes
Don't be laid up in that shit like you lazy
I need you to roll up in that shit like you skatin' (yeah)
Baby, ain't no hold up, I'm that shit, I hate waitin'
Doot-doot-doot
Shoot your shot, I'm impatient
(Doot-doot-doot, ooh)

This type shit have you wildin' (ooh)
Last minute trips to the islands (ooh)
Drip, drip, drip when you slide in (ooh)
Fit, fit, fit, baby, right in (ooh)
Don't hesitate when you (ooh)
In it 'cause you know I like it (ooh)
Bakin' up a cake for you (ooh)
Sweet baby, like it when you bite it

We can't just keep talkin' about it
We think too often about it
We can't just be cautious about it
I wanna get wild
Take me for a ride, boy
Show me your wild side, boy
Know it's been a while, boy
I wanna get wild

Look, dimelo, turn me 'round
Treat me like a watch, bust me down (mmh)
On the kitchen floor, right on that towel
It's my dick and I want it now, ow
Tell me how you want it (want it)
Put me on my back, on my stomach (stomach)
Baby, let me blow it like a trumpet (trumpet)
I can do it all
I could probably suck a watermelon through a straw, believe me
Every other day new wig, new hair (hair)
Come take me out this Mugler ('Gler)
I'll be waitin' on you in some lingerie
Drop this pussy down low like bombs away, boom
Nothing but a robe in your house
I wanna put these pretty pink toes in your mouth
Send nudes to your phone while you workin'
Boy, you gotta see this shit in person, believe me

We can't just keep talkin' about it
I want you comin' inside it
We can't just be cautious about it
I wanna get wild
Take me for a ride, boy
Show me your wild side, boy
Know it's been a while, boy
I wanna get wild

Pull up in a err, mmh, Benz
Make me say, "Ah", let me do that shit again
Ooh, yeah (vroom)
Pull up in a mmh-mmh, drop
Ha-ha-ha, yeah, I'm makin' shit hot
Ooh, yeah
Pull up in a err, mmh, Benz
Make me say, "Ah", let me do that shit again
Ooh (vroom)
Pull up in a mnh-mmh, drop
Ha-ha-ha, yeah, I'm makin' shit hot
Ooh, yeah
