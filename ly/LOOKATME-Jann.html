		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my, just look at those eyes
Pretty like a girl, oh boy
This boy is so nice
Never seen a boy like him
So cute and polite
Better keep him humble
Cuz he might wanna learn to bite
I knew already
My life was gon be heavy
But nothing could prepare me for this
For this
I lived for validation
I met your expectations
Pushed down on my temptation
That's not what I want
I want it
I want it all
I've changed my mind I wanna rock
That Vivienne Westwood
Gucci, Prada and Dior
Mind's on my money
And money's on my mind
Late to the party
Nice to meet ya
Pleasure's mine
Don't be obscene
Just don't make a scene
I'm sorry I really don't know what you mean
I'm here to serve some real cuisine
Come come everybody
Gather in a canteen
Food for your eyes
Food for your soul
Food for the girls
Some food for the boys
The plate is full just make a choice
Indulge in what you've picked up
Oh my just look at you now
Such a promising
Young man
You both must be proud
If I were you I would make sure
That he keeps both his feet on the ground
Nobody asked
Please shut your mouth
I want it
I want it all
I've changed my mind I wanna rock
That Vivienne Westwood
Gucci, Prada and Dior
Mind's on my money
And money's on my mind
Late to the party
Nice to meet ya
Pleasure's mine
Don't be obscene
Just don't make a scene
I'm sorry I really don't know what you mean
I'm here to serve some real cuisine
Come come everybody
Gather in a canteen
Food for your eyes
Food for your soul
Food for the girls
Some food for the boys
The plate is full just make a choice
Indulge in what you've picked up
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Tell me that you don't like what you see
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Tell me that you don't like
I want it all
I've changed my mind I wanna rock
That Vivienne Westwood
Gucci, Prada and Dior
Mind's on my money
And money's on my mind
Late to the party
Nice to meet ya
Pleasure's mine
