		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just turned eighteen
And I don't really know what that means
I still got the same anxiety
I feel so controlled by society
And my friends
They all seem to know what they wanna be
Got their lives planned five years ahead of me
And I don't even know 'bout next week

Sometimes when I think ahead
It pulls a string around my chest
Too young to know how to live
Too old to be a kid

I just turned eighteen
And I don't want the world to change me
It doesn't take a lot to break me
'Cause I don't recognize me lately
I just turned eighteen
Oh, one more year of this world turning
It's just another candle burning
But my reality is hurting
Just turned eighteen

I'm off track
God, I wish that I could go back
And live another day in my past
Calling to my youth

Sometimes when I think ahead
It pulls a string around my chest
Too young to know how to live
Too old to be a kid

I just turned eighteen
And I don't want the world to change me
It doesn't take a lot to break me
'Cause I don't recognize me lately
I just turned eighteen
Oh, one more year of this world turning
It's just another candle burning
But my reality is hurting
Just turned eighteen
Just turned eighteen

Just turned eighteen
And I don't really know what that means
I still got the same anxiety
I feel so controlled by society, yeah, yeah

I just turned eighteen
And I don't want the world to change me
It doesn't take a lot to break me
'Cause I don't recognize me lately (I don't recognize me lately)
I just turned eighteen
Oh, one more year of this world turning
It's just another candle burning
But my reality is hurting
Just turned eighteen (happy birthday to me)
Just turned eighteen (happy birthday to me)
Just turned eighteen
