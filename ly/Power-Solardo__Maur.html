		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't seem to find a reason
For wanting to come back into my life
Maybe you think you're special
'Cause no one treats you like I do
This time I have to tell you
This thing has almost reached the end
I know what you're thinking
You want to come again

Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
Mother packs the power
Holding on to you
Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
All the power
All the power

Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
Mother packs the power
Holding on to you
Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
All the power
All the power

The power
All the power

Mother packs the power
Calling out for you

The power
All of the power

You can't seem to find a reason
For wanting to come back into my life
Maybe you think you're special
'Cause no one treats you like I do
This time I have to tell you
This thing has almost reached the end
I know what you're thinking
You want to come again

Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
Mother packs the power
Holding on to you
Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
All the power
All the power

Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
Mother packs the power
Holding on to you
Mother packs the power
Calling out for you
All the power
All of the power

The power
All the power

Mother packs the power
Calling out for you

The power
All of the power
