		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold up, no you didn't bow, bow
I ain't the chick to walk behind you 'round town
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it laying down, baby

Oh, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it (uh-huh)
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it laying down, baby

You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

Who got the power? 
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
Hold up
My turn

I make this look easy, tick-tick, boom, like gasoline-y
Yeah, they call me Lamborghini, 'cause I know just what I'm worth
Zero to a hundred, b-b-body make' em stutter
Start my engine, push the button, 'cause I'm gon' be coming first

Yeah, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down South
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

Who got the power? 
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the) 
Who got the power? 
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the) yo
Check it (hold up)

When them boys talk loose and tell you power's for a king (huh?)
You just play it cool and tell 'em, "Power's not a thing" (what?)
You look him in the eye and say, "I know I'm not a guy
But see there's power in my losses and there's power in my wins"
Independent woman, look to shower in your Bimms
They call me Cocoa Butter Mike, you can't be powderin' my skin
And you don't need to spend another hour in the gym
You know I'm blinded by his grace but when you found me I was dim
We'll be countin' down the years, yeah I'm about this
All them dirty secrets that we share, I'll clear the browsers
We the type to build on our careers and share the houses
You can be a woman and a boss and wear the trousers at the same time
(You should know)
That I ain't never lettin' go (lettin' go)
But as long as I'm alive, then I'll be sponsorin' your pride
You know there's power in a couple (long as you don't forget)
Let me compliment your vibe, girl

You're the man (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I got the, I got the, I got the power (woo, ohh)
You make rain (you make rain, you make rain)
But I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control (I'm in control now)
I'll let you come take the wheel
Long as you don't forget (you don't forget)

(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
'Cause I got the, I got the, I got the power
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power) (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh-whoa)
Baby, don't forget I got the power, yeah
The power, yeah, yeah, yeah

Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Bike, bike, bike, bike
Bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, whoop
