		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When he comes around, I can't contain myself
The feelings like a magnet
I tried a million times, but can't explain myself
All I knows I've gots to have it
A drug I never even asked for
But now I can't quit, too addicted
Or is it all inside my head
And my eyes are tricking
Making me see what was never there
I don't care, you're

Damn near perfect
Beautiful you are, yeah
Or is it just a mirage?
You've got me in the desert dry
But seeing waterfalls
Someone save me
I'm on the verge of falling

In love
Or am I falling to the ground?
And everyone can see it
Won't believe it
I don't see no one around, yeah
Damn

You can see in my eyes (my eyes)
That I'm too hypnotized ('notized)
Temperature's too high
I smile but then I cry
So stupid fucking high
That I forget about the lows
And the lows get pretty low
To the point that I might die
But I wanna stay alive
Stop hallucinating over lame ass niggas (lame ass niggas)
I'll snap out of it in time
Damn, damn

Damn near perfect
Beautiful you are, yeah
Or is it just a mirage?
You've got me in the desert dry
But seeing waterfalls
Someone save me
I'm on the verge of falling

Back
Back to my senses
Back to the real life
And now I realize you were never good for me
Back
Back to my senses
Back to the real life, yeah
Now I realize you were never good for me
Mm-mm-mm
Mm
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, shame, shame
