		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not your Barbie girl, I'm livin' in my own world
I ain't plastic, call me classic
You can't touch me there, you can't touch my body
Unless I say so, ain't your Barbie, no

Pull up to that dream house, guard, gate, hills now
How much do you like this?
Welcome to my bedroom, hallway go down
Say he's got permission

I can take myself on a dinner date
Buy myself diamonds and the champagne
Order five courses, then chocolate cake, uh-huh
Actin' like I care when I want a man (when I want a man)
Actin' like I care but I don't, and? (But I don't care)
I do my own thing, yeah, watch me dance, uh-huh

Not your Barbie girl, I'm livin' in my own world
I ain't plastic, call me classic
You can't touch me there, you can't touch my body
Unless I say so, ain't your Barbie, no

I'm my own boss, I'm remindin' you of it
Somethin' that you just can't get
Words don't tempt me, tryin' to break me
In these heels, I ain't tryna trip, no

I can take myself on a dinner date (on a dinner date)
Buy myself diamonds and the champagne (the champagne)
Order five courses, then chocolate cake, uh-huh
Actin' like I care when I want a man (when I want a man)
Actin' like I care but I don't, and? (But I don't care)
I do my own thing, yeah, watch me dance, uh-huh

Not your Barbie girl, I'm livin' in my own world
I ain't plastic, call me classic
You can't touch me there, you can't touch my body
Unless I say so, ain't your Barbie, no

Did you forget I'm real?
Oh, I'm breathing, touch me, feel
Oh, say I'm your toy to play with, wanna put me in a box
You ain't gon' talk to me like that, you better stop

Not your Barbie girl, I'm livin' in my own world
I ain't plastic (oh, no), call me classic
You can't touch me there (uh-uh), you can't touch my body
Unless I say so (oh, no, no), ain't your Barbie, no

Ain't your Barbie, no
Ain't your Barbie, no
