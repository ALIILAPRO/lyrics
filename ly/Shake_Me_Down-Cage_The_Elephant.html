		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around
Who knows now
Softly laying on the ground, ooh
Not a lot of people left around, ooh

In my life, I've seen
People walk into the sea
Just to find memories
Plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down
Cut my hair on a silver cloud
Broken sound
Softly laying on the ground, ooh
Not a lot of people left around, ooh

In my past, bittersweet
There's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams
Lonely times indeed
With eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Turn back now it's time for me to let go
Way down had to find a place to lay low
Lampshade turned around into a light post

Walk around the corner
Never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move
It almost stopped me from belief
I don't wanna know the future
But I'm like Rolling Thunder

Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around, ooh
