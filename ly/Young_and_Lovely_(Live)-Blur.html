		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friday's child is planning to out for the first time
Says "Don't worry Mum, I won't be out that late"
Can't be playing those passive games right now, they're out of date
You're awfully sweet, haven't got the time
Growing up so fast, got better things to do
You can get what you want, you're so young and lovely

Oh, oh, la, la, la

Kicking around the center of the town lookin' through shop windows
Those mannequins look far too real at night
Friday's child doesn't know if it's awake or if it's dreaming
Says "Don't worry Dad, I'll do my bit, I'll raise the flag
I'll be just like you"

"Don't worry Mum, I'm not that dumb, I'll be just like you"
