Mm-mm, mm
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel A-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything, thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead, uh, uh, uh
I'll do it over again, I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind, I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

Crying, I'm nauseous, I hear that so often
I sometimes get lost in my head
I'm so in love with that girl (yeah)
I got the juice in this world (whoa)
She don't believe in loyalty but want diamonds and pearls
Fuck that, I had to man up
Tried to boost my confidence and froze my hand up
I'm still hot, turn that fan on
This shit had me depressed, I almost died off Xan' punch (yeah)
She said that she love me, but she sucked that boy up (oh)
You got somethin' to say, go 'head now, boy just speak up (whoa)
Try to break me down because they can't defeat us (no)
I'm a baker now, like that girl Anita
Should've listened to my boy, he said, "Don't keep her"
Nowadays, I love you so much, I can't leave ya

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were
Instead of my head
You found another, better one
I won't let you forget me
