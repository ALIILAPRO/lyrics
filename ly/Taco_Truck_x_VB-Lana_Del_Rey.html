		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Met my boyfriend down at the taco truck
Pass me my vape, I'm feeling sick, I need to take a puff
Imagine if we actually gave a fuck
Wouldn't that be something to talk about for us?
Caribbean blue in sweater weather
I'm fallin' into you
Although it seems I've gotten better
I can be violent too

That's why they call me Lanita
When I get down like bonita
Don't come find me in Reseda
I'll go crazy
Read my gold chain, says, "Lanita"
When I'm violent, it's Carlito's Way
Blood on my feet on the street
I'm dancin' crazy

Spin it 'til you whip it into a cream, baby
Print it into black and white pages, don't faze me
Before you talk, let me stop what you're saying
I know, I know, I know that you hate me

Honey, I got up so early
And then, I got into the shower
I was just able to go back to sleep for a hour and a half
So that rocked, um, anyway
I had this dream where, um, I don't know
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
Back, back to the garden
We're gettin' high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

Oh God, I miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss (yeah, yeah)

Back in the garden
We're gettin' high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything, whatever
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything's whatever

Oh God, I miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss (yeah, yeah)

If you weren't mine, I'd be (get high)
Jealous of your love (drop acid)
If you weren't mine, I'd be (never die)
Jealous of your love (not tonight, bang, bang, bang)
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be (oh, God, I miss you on my lips)
Jealous of your love (it's me, your little Venice bitch)
If you weren't mine, I'd be (on the stoop with the neighborhood kids)
Jealous of your love (callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss)
(Mm-mm)
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Mm-mm)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Mm-mm)
(Yeah)
