		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friday night you and your boys went out to eat, uhhh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three, yes you did
If six of y'all went out, ah
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah, uh
I'll pack your bags, so you can leave town for a week
Yes I am
The phone rings
And then you look at me
(Why'd you turn and look at me?)
You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213,
Show up on your Caller I.D.? Oh
I've been through all of this before
So how could you think (Don't think about it, don't think about it)
That I would stand around and take some more (Get gone, get gone)
Things are gonna change (Things are going to change, baby)
Cause I've been through all this before
That's why you have to leave (Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So don't turn around to see my face (Don't you turn around)
There's no more tears left here for you to see
Was it really worth you going out like that?
Tell me, oh
See I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out
You were making a fool of me, ohhh
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway (Make it anyway)
Pack your bags up and leave (Get up and leave)
Don't you dare come running back to me (Back to me boy)
It's not right (It's not right)
But it's okay (It's okay)
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right (It's not right)
But it's okay (It's okay, baby)
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me (Oh, oh, oh whoa)
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway (Get up and leave)
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright
Doh, dooh, dooh, dooh
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright
Dooh, dooh, dooh, dooh
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah
It's not right but it's okay
