		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I don't know if you're coming back
I wouldn't be there, said I wouldn't wait it by now
But the fear of the recompense
Fire in your belly yeah
How did it come back to this 

You know you always need this much 
You know you always need this
You know you always need this much 
You know you always need this

Take on this chance all the parts are in place
For the sun, in your heart
Brings disease, and disgrace when the 
Missed roll it in, you were sin, I can't control this heart
It's in tone, it's a start
But I wouldn't really know
Until I know

And I don't know where to stop again
How could we ever win
Carrying the sheild of heaven
You got the fear of the synthesis
Firing your synapses 
How did it come back to this

You know you always need this much 
You know you always need this
You know you always need this much 
You know you always need this

Take on this chance all the parts are in place
For the sun, in your heart
Brings disease, and disgrace when the 
Missed roll it in, you were sin, I can't control this heart
It's in tone, it's a start
But I wouldn't really know
Until I know
And I won't stop
Until you go
And I won't stop
Until you go

And you always know need this much 
You know you always need this
You know you always need this much 
You know you always need this
