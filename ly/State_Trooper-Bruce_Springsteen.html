		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  New Jersey Turnpike riding on a wet night
'Neath the refinery's glow out where the great black rivers flow
License, registration, I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience 'bout the things that I done

Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me

Maybe you got a kid, maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I got's been bothering me my whole life
Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't you stop me, please don't you stop me

In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy
Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby
The radio's jammed up with talk show stations
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk, 'til you lose your patience
Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
Whoa
Whoo-whoo

Hey, somebody out there, listen to my last prayer
Hi ho silver-o, deliver me from nowhere
Whoa
Woo
