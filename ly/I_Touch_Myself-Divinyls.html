		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love myself
I want you to love me
When I feel down
I want you above me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I forget myself
I want you to remind me

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
Ooh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

You're the one who makes me come runnin'
You're the sun who makes me shine
When you're around, I'm always laughin'
I want to make you mine

I close my eyes
And see you before me
Think I would die
If you were to ignore me
A fool could see
Just how much I adore you
I'd get down on my knees, I'd do anything for you

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
Ooh, I don't want anybody else 
Oh no, oh no, oh no, yeah

I love myself
I want you to love me
When I feel down
I want you above me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I forget myself
I want you to remind me

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
Ooh, I don't want anybody else 
Oh no, oh no, oh no

I want you
I don't want anybody else
And when I think about you, I touch myself
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh 
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
Ooh, I don't want anybody else 
When I think about you, I touch myself

I touch myself (I don't want)
I touch myself (anybody else)
I touch myself (when I think about you)
I touch myself
I touch myself (I don't want)
I touch myself (anybody else)
I touch myself (when I think about you)
I honestly do
I touch myself (I don't want)
I touch myself (anybody else)
I touch myself (when I think about you)
I honestly do
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
