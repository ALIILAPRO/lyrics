		  Easy now, no need fi go down
Rock that, run that, this where we from
Easy now, no need fi go down
Rock that, run that, this where we from

Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Car I know you're the talk of the town, yeah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Car I know you're the talk of the town, yeah

Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Car I know you're the talk of the town, yeah

Easy now no need fi go down
Just wuk it gently and no break nah bone
Cool end-it-ly, you have a style of your own
Me never kno you saw ya master the saxsaphone

'Cause you sound like the talk of the town yea
Imma lock you when you run come around yea
Make me wobble, make me whole body bubble
An me no say ya trouble, when ya ready for the double
And n you hit that

Play with it a lickle, why you so na tickle
I'm tellin' you to, hit that
No ti-na the mickle
Stay with it a lickle, why you so na tickle

Easy now no need fi go down
Walk it gently and no break nah bone

Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Car I know you're the talk of the town, yeah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around

Best shown overall, shiny and tall
One touch make a gal climb whoever you are
Brass hat, hatter than fireball
Whoop Whoop
You not small you not lickle at all
Dat touch, just dip on me mind yea
The good feelin dip on rewind yea
Make me wobble, make me whole body bubble
An me no say ya trouble, when ya ready for the double
And you hit that
No ti-na the mickle
Play with it a lickle, why you so na tickle
I'm tellin' you to, hit that
No ti-na the mickle
Stay with it a lickle, why you so na tickle
I'm feelin' them

Walk it gently and no break nah bone

Rock that run that, this where we from
