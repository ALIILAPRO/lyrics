		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How the hell did I get here?
What's the day, what's the year?
I barely recognize this bed that I just woke up in
Dress yourself up as a dream
Sweet talked 'til I fell asleep
Convinced myself it was more peaceful just letting you in
Hid your red flags well and damn, I bought it
'Cause I spent four years in knowing what I wanted

I might as well have been dead
The way you fucked with my head
Couldn't tell up from down
No voice to make a sound
I must've not been awake
Too numb to see your mistakes
You probably liked it that way, hey
I blame myself, I should've known
I must've been stuck in a coma
I should've known

How the hell did I get here?
The hold you had on me, it disappeared
It's like the curtains opened up and let the sunlight in
Now I see you for the person you are
You only wanted me when I was in the dark
You had the advantage that you were concious
I walkin' round nearly unresponsive

I might as well have been dead
The way you fucked with my head
Couldn't tell up from down
No voice to make a sound
I must've not been awake
Too numb to see your mistakes
You probably liked it that way, hey
I blame myself, I should've known
I must've been stuck in a coma
I should've known
Should've known
I should've known

Hid the red flags well and damn, I bought it
Can't get those four years back but damn I wanna

I might as well have been dead
The way you fucked with my head
Couldn't tell up from down
No voice to make a sound
I must've not been awake
Too numb to see your mistakes
You probably liked it that way, hey
I blame myself, I should've known
I must've been stuck in a coma
I should've known
Should've known
I should've known
