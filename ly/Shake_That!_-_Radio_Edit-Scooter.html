		  Alright crew
I am a junglist man
Don't try to change my plan, yeah
Right

Flip that coin, see what you get
It's MC Dave, who's on the set
Left, right, left, right
Push up the mic

Four, three stand at ease
Turning forty five degrees
I'm doing it for the massive
I'm doing it for the crew

Going to make you hop and skip around
Like a kangaroo
Get 'em, get 'em
When I'm on the mic

When I'm on the mic I rinse out rhythm
Get 'em, get 'em
When I'm on the mic 
Yeah, bring the beat back

(Shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
(Shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
Shake that!

(Shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
(Shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your)

We love you lots, ten outta ten
Selector gimme that, a mix and blend

Left, right, left, right
I got the vibe
Four, three come on please
Turning there like killer bees

I'm doing it for the massive
I'm doing it fast or slow
When I'm in charge of the microphone
Watch out I'm about to blow

Get 'em, get 'em
When I'm on the mic 
When I'm on the mic
Our hits are rithym
Get 'em, get 'em
When I'm on the mic, yeah

Come to return
(Shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
(Shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
Shake that!

(Shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
(Oh shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your) right!

Ah yeah (Check this out)
I never say no to return to the floor,
You're raw
Wanna test my crew
You better be sure

Here we come straight between the eyes
Life without knowledge is death in disguise
Shake that !

(Shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
(Oh shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
Shake your booty now!

(Oh shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your booty up)
(Oh shake shake shake, shake shake shake) 
(Shake your booty up, shake your)

Oh!
