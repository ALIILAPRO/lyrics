		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say the time say the day
We can do this over again
Know your minds on replay
We can fall back into place
Just let me know
Take you on that late drive up to the hill baby we can be
Backseat of your car girl
Light up the flame
Fucking on the low
Numbing all the pain
But you've been telling all your friends
But your mama
She don't need to know my name
(She don't need to know)
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say that you love me
Need me
Cause you know we
Feel more alive on the edge
You lost me
When you told me
When you said, you said
You love me
Need me
Girl you know we
Feel more alive on the edge
Say the time say the place
You can say what you wanna say
And I know that you bleed
I can't blame you if you wanna leave
Just let me know
Take you on that late drive up to the hill baby we can be
Backseat of your car girl
Light up the flame
Fucking on the low
Numbing all the pain
But you've been telling all your friends
But your mama
She don't need to know my name
(She don't need to know)
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say that you love me
Need me
Cause you know we
Feel more alive on the edge
You lost me
When you told me
When you said, you said
You love me
Need me
Girl you know we
Feel more alive on the edge
And we both knew this wasn't gonna last that long but
You didn't have to go so cold
Girl I ain't been feelin' myself
Cause it's you that's stuck in my head
But when I called up her phone
She brung me to my knees
And she told me
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say that you love me
Need me
Cause you know we
Feel more alive on the edge
You lost me
When you told me
When you said
You said
You love me
Need me
Girl you know we
Feel more alive on the edge
