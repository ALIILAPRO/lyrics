		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never had a bitch like me in your life
You ain't never had a bitch like me in your life, uh
Never had a bitch like me in your life
You ain't never had a bitch like me in your life (yeah)

He speed in the Wraith while his hand on my coochie (yeah)
He touchin' Emilio Pucci (uh)
Doin' good, bitch, I'm Gucci (I'm good)
Fly to Asia, he feedin' me sushi (ooh)
When we fuckin', it feel like a movie
Raw bitch, ain't never been a groupie
Stiff on a ho, I like my nigga bougie (yeah)
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me

Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never

Keep me a Haitian, I love me a Zoe
I've been thinkin' 'bout you on the road
We havin' rich sex on a boat
He hit it back to back like it's dope (like it's dope)
How you gon' prove you could treat me right?
You stole my heart like a thief in the night
Yeah, he my man, he was never your type
If you try me, ho, it's on sight
He totin' the Uzi, but he actin' real bougie (bougie, yeah)
I like to fight over dick, ho, don't get hit with a two-piece (two-piece)
You know you can call if you need me
Tell me you ain't never ever leavin' (no)
When I suck it, I look in your eyes (yeah)
You better fuck me like you mean it (fuck me like you mean it)

Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never wanna lose me
Tell me you don't never

He's speedin' the Wraith while his hand on my coochie
Doin' good, bitch, I'm Gucci
When we fuckin', it feel like a movie
Be stiff on a ho, I like my nigga bougie
Tell me you don't ever wanna lose me
