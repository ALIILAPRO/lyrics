		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me to leave you alone

You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone, but I need you now

Pullin', pullin', pullin', pullin'
Pullin', pullin', pullin', pullin'

You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone, but I need you now

Pullin', pullin', pullin', pullin'
Pullin', pullin', pullin', pullin'
Pullin', pullin', pullin', pullin'
Pullin', pullin', pullin', pullin'

You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
You tell me to leave you alone
