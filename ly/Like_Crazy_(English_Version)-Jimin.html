		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I think we could last forever)
(I'm afraid that everything will disappear)
(Just trust me)

She's saying, baby, come and follow me
There's not a bad thing here tonight
Save your reasons all for later
Stay with me a little while

Watch me go
Now I sink down, all alone, away
Where am I?
A dark haze clouding up my eyes

I can hear the voices listening
Don't know who they are
Trying to take the pressure off
Been reaching for the stars
Tell me, will I find myself again
When I go too far?
Yeah, I know, you know
I know (woo)

I'd rather be lost in the lights
Lost in the lights
I'm out of my mind
Can you help me numb the pain?
Each night, you spin me up high
Emotions on ice
Let me have a taste

Give me a good ride
(Oh, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Oh, it's gon' be a good night
(Oh, I'm fallin')
Forever you and I

(Yeah, yeah) hey
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Forever you and I)

All my reflections, I
Can't even recognize
I'm feeling so alive, wasting time

I'd rather be lost in the lights
Lost in the lights
I'm out of my mind
Can you help me numb the pain?
Each night, you spin me up high
Emotions on ice
Let me have a taste

Give me a good ride
(Oh, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Oh, it's gon' be a good night
(Oh, I'm fallin')
Forever you and I

This will break me
This is gonna break me (break me)
No, don't you wake me (wake me)
I wanna stay in this dream
Don't save me 
Don't you try to save me (save me)
I need a way we (way we)
I need a way we can dream on 

(Alone again)
(What's the point?)
