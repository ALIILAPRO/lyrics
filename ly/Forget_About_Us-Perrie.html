		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want you ever to forget about us
(Forget about us)

I heard you fell in love with somebody new
I know you heard that I've found someone too
Saw you blew up and I'm proud of you
But I don't want to hear those songs no more, yeah

Do you remember the way we fell and
Like everything froze with just one glance, then
From heaven to nothing it feels like hell, well
Here's the truth of it

I don't want you ever to forget about us
In the front seat listenin' to songs that made you think about me
Bonfire smoke on your hoodie that I stole from your flat
No, I never gave it back but

I don't want you ever to forget about us
(Forget about us)

I've felt more love since you for sure
And I don't want to go back to where we were before
But when I hear your name it's still so raw
Do you ever feel the same way too? Yeah

Do you remember the way we fell, and
Like everything froze with just one glance, then
From heaven to nothing it feels like hell, well
Here's the truth of it

I don't want you ever to forget about us
In the front seat listenin' to songs that made you think about me
Bonfire smoke on your hoodie that I stole from your flat
No, I never gave it back but

I don't want you ever to forget about us
I know we were never perfect
But I think about the life we never had (had)
Yeah, we both found different love and we're moving on
Let's leave it buried where it was, but

I don't want you ever to forget about us (to forget)
Forget about us
I don't want you ever to forget about us (forget about us)
Yeah

Do you remember the way we fell and
Like everything froze with just one glance, then
From heaven to nothing it feels like hell, well
Here's the truth of it

I don't want you ever to forget about us
In the front seat listenin' to songs that made you think about me
Bonfire smoke on your hoodie that I stole from your flat
No, I never gave it back but

I don't want you ever to forget about us
I know we were never perfect
But I think about the life we never had 
Yeah, we both found different love and we're moving on
Let's leave it buried where it was, but

I don't want you ever to forget about us 
(Forget about us)
I don't want you ever to forget about us
(Forget about us)
