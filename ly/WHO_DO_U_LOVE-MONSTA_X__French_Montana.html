		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the heat of the moment, when you're all alone and out of breath
What's keepin' you goin'? What do you see up in your head?
When your eyes are closing, where do you wish you were instead?
You got me hanging by a thread, yeah
Oh, tell me now

Who's the one that takes you higher than
Than you've ever been

Baby, I just got to know the answer

Who's the one you think of night and day?
Ain't no time to waste

I'm just tryna say

Who do you love? Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love? Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door

(Aye aye, skrrt skrrt)
Aye I'ma need me a new thing, he ain't believe his boo thing
Show me the 'Titty Boi', 2 Chainz
Now the beef cookin' like Gordon Ramsay
We should be somewhere that's hot and sandy
Used to post up in New York like Marcus Camby
My two things fighting like Monica and Brandy
Now, now in that two door, ooh wait
They asking "Who you love?" like Cool J
80's baby down the middle like KD
And1, that's my other lane
Them boys is next, Montana, Monsta X

Who do you love? Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love? Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door

Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (oh baby, say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who?

Who's the one that takes you higher than
Than you've ever been
Who's the one you think of night and day?
Ain't no time to waste, I'm just tryna say

Who do you love? Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love? Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door

Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (oh baby, say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who?
