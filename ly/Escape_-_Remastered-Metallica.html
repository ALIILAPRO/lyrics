		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fell no pain, but my life ain't easy 
I know I'm my best friend 
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger 
I'll fight until the end 
To escape from the true false world 
Undamaged destiny 
Can't get caught in the endless circle 
Ring of stupidity 

Out for my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see 
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings 
Don't tell me what to do 
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side 
And I can see through you 
Feed my brain with your so called standards 
Who says that I ain't right 
Break away from your common fashion 
See through your blurry sight 

Out for my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see 
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 

See they try to bring the hammer down 
No damn chains can hold me to the ground 

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
