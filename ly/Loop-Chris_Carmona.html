		  Yoo
I've been living in a loop
Nothing different, nothing new
I've been living in a loop
All this work, where's the fruit?
I've been living in a loop
All my habits are my rules
I've been living in a loop
If I don't get outta this shit real soon, man I might just have to shoot
Monotony's a bitch, known her a long time
But babe, we're breaking up I hope this is a bad time
Thanks to you I woke up every day a shitty mood
And I acquired a new attitude considered rude
But thanks to God, every fuck up got a lesson, right?
And what I learn? Gotta take control my life
So fuck you and all your expectations
I got way too many self obligations
I want everything
I want everything
Don't wanna die and just have kids and wedding ring
I want everything
I want everything
I've been getting to my
I've been getting to my way
(Oh na na na)
Get the fuck outta my way
(Oh na na na)
I might spray AK on all of y'all
I've been going real ape
(Oh na na na)
Ain't no part of me's afraid
(No more, no more)
I cut all of the the brakes out of my car
Gotta break the everyday routine routine
Somedays you gotta go skrrt
Gotta break outta the loop
Gotta break outta the loop
Gotta break outta the loop
I've been livin' in a loop
I've been livin' in a loop
Gotta break outta the loop
Gotta break outta the loop
Gotta break outta the loop
Gotta break outta the -
In the- I've been- gotta break outta the
Loop
Livin' in a loop
Gotta break outta the loop
I've been livin' in a loop
I've been livin' in a loop
Loop
I've been livin'
Livin' in a
Loop
Loop
Gotta break outta the loop
