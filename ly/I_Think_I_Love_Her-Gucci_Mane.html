		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (yeah), hey
Gucci always talkin' 'bout he love somebody (hey, hey)
He don't love nobody (uh-uh, hey)
Matter fact, nigga, you owe me some money don't you? (Hey, hey)
Let me show you how I do this shit (get money)

Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick (huh)
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch (brr)
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit (huh)
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit (brr)
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she super thick (huh)
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy stick (brr)
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick (huh)
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (brr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe (get in)
I stashed her in my Fendi wallet, stashed her in my tire (racks)
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar (huh)
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Calender Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singin' like Mariah
Singin' like the choir, better yet singin' like Mya (bitch)

Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlers
I be wit all the ballers, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cookin' with yo' pots

I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I know I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I know I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I think I love her

Told my boy, man, Polow Da Don
I think I love this girl, man, huh, why? (Polow and drum, man)
She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece in jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon app√©tit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat

Nigga always talk, but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have nots
My hoes pose with pots like Young Goldilocks
We got white bulgin' rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steamin' hot
I'm Susie Sarah plot, a click-clack, p-pop-pop

I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I know I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me) yeah
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey, hey
I know I love her (uh-uh, hey)
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey, hey
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey, hey
I think I love her (hey, hey, hey, hey)
