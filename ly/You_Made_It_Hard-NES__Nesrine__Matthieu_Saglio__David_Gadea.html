		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can’t wake up in the morning so early baby
this is too crazy
My nights are full of colours and dreams
so you know I still feel dizzy

But I don’t want to complain
You made it hard for me

I can’t take responsibility for the whole
humanity
yes I know it sounds easy
Each one has his own belief system ingrained
impregnable fortress I'm in chains

But I don’t want to complain
You made it hard for me

Please come and help me
slowly, surely and carefully
Please come and help me
to not divide the world between you and me

Yes I fight for integrity
failing to achieve immortality
But I loose on my way a lot of energy
building my path very much consciously

But I don’t want to complain
You made it hard for me

If suddenly I have to open a new door
am I ready to forget all my rancor
Life is a cycle, a drama maybe an opera
but somehow its time for me to start a new era

But I don’t want to complain
You made it hard for me
