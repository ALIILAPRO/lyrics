		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Wait) you left my bedroom colder
Last night felt like October
Fell asleep next to my only
With a blunt still burning slowly
You left my bedroom colder
Last night felt like October
Fell asleep next to my only
With a blunt still burning slowly

These are times I fucking live for
So high, my mind can't get bored
I just need the time to sit more
I just need the time to sit more
Somewhere by all that shit
That makes us feel like this
So when tomorrow comes
I'll wake up so damn sick

Light a fire in my heart
Light a fire in my car
Act like you don't even know me
Watch me as I'm burning slowly
Light a fire in my heart
Light a fire in my car
Act like you don't even know me
Watch me as I'm burning slowly

I'm sitting outside your house
Thinking of burning shit down
My mind is so fucking out
I don't think I'm coming down
I'll build my house in the clouds
Babe you can't get to me now
(Babe you can't get to me now)
Babe you can't get to me now

Light a fire in my heart
Light a fire in my car
Act like you don't even know me
Watch me as I'm burning slowly
Light a fire in my heart
Light a fire in my car
Act like you don't even know me
Watch me as I'm burning slowly

With you, all I need is time
