		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a certain point the body can't come back from
In one year, we've learned the turn of the mouth
The depth that the chest cavity takes
Chuckie was there for three out of three
I was there for the third 'cause I couldn't be
There for the one who was closest to me
But I can't say I'd run when things get hard
It's just that I don't trust myself with my heart
But I've had to let it break a little more
'Cause they say that's what it's for

That's how the light shines in
That's how the light shines in
That's how the light gets in, mm-mm

So everyone was there, they were standin' and laughin'
And I'm on the side with my tears streamin' down
There's somethin' about the clutch of the wrist
He thought mine was his to carve into his mouth
We've only got hours
And I just can't stop cryin' 'cause all of the ways
When you see someone dyin', you see all your days
Flash in front of you
And you think about who would be with you
And then there's Donoghue
Mm

Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
I'm probably running away from the feelings I get
When I think of all the things about them
Daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Cafe
I'm probably running away from the thoughts in the day
That have things to do with them, but they say

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

Think by the third of March, I was cracked open
Finally the ground was cold, they wouldn't open
Brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into rain
There's a name for it in Japanese, it's kintsugi
They sang folk songs from the '40s
Even the fourteen-year old knew, "Froggie Came A-Courtin'"
How do my blood relatives know all of these songs?
I don't know anyone left to know songs that I sing

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

But daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Cafe
Probably running away from the feelings today
In the snow-capped mountains of the desert
Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
Probably running away, I've been meaning to say
That there's nothing to do except know that this is

How the light gets in
Like cracking, the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
Then you're golden
Ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Just another folk song, but anyway
I try so hard, but that's okay
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
