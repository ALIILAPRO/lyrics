		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I should stop 
Lookin' out for you like I always do
When will you start lookin' out for me too
Instead of leavin' me starin' at my shoes?
It's just the way you're glancin' at me
Somethin' about you just makes me feel guilty
For liking you
When you're with him, when you're with him

This is a love song for a girl 
Who will never know it's about her
I know it's pretty stupid 
But I'm much too shy to tell her
She's beamin' that smile
All the while
I'm all choked up on my own throat
I guess there is no hope

And we're walkin' out in the snow
I say, "I guess I should go"
And we're talkin' 'bout someone else
When we should be talkin' about ourselves
It's the same old situation, you've always got me waitin'
Come on, dear, I think time's a-wastin'
Before we have to go back inside
And return to our normal lives

This is a love song for a girl 
Who will never know it's about her
I know it's pretty stupid 
But I'm much too shy to tell her
She's beamin' that smile
All the while
I'm all choked up on my own throat
I guess there is no hope, oh
