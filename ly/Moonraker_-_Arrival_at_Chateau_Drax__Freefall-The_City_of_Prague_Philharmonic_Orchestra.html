		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are you? Why do you hide?
Where is that moonlight trail that leads to your side?
Just like the Moonraker goes in search of his dream of gold
I search for love, for someone to have and hold

I've seen your smile in a thousand dreams
Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me
You love me

Where are you? When will we meet?
Take my unfinished life and make it complete
Just like the Moonraker knows his dream will come true someday
I know that you are only a kiss away

I've seen your smile in a thousand dreams
Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me
You love me
