		  Out, out for the night

Why am I on my own on a Friday night?
My friends are on my phone, they keep blowin' up my line (hello)
Send me your location, the Uber's outside (yeah)
Runnin' out of time

If we're going out, out for the night
I'ma meet you down on the floor
Oh, tell me
So, tell me when you're out, out for the night
We can get it started, let's go, oh
Just watch me dance

Just watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me

Why am I on my own on a Saturday night? (Why?)
Send me your location, the Uber's outside (where you at?)
Friends all in the bathroom, so I cut through the line
Runnin' out of time

If we're going out, out for the night
I'ma meet you down on the floor
Oh, tell me
So, tell me when you're out, out for the night
We can get it started, let's go, oh
Just watch me dance

Just watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me
Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out
Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out

Run it back, I'm so saditty, super picky
Who gon' please this pretty kitty?
Got baddies with me, tanned and tipsy
Pass the concealer, gotta hide the hicky
Ooh, DJ, run it back (run it back)
Tryna go up, where balloon girl at? (Where she at?)
Double cup love, in the club, pitch black
Bubblegum butt, come and chew this ass

Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out
Ay, ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay, ay-ay, tonight we're goin' out, out

Hi, I'm Charli, baby (baby, baby)
Tonight, we're goin' out, out

Just watch me
