		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm workin', I hustle from June to June 
I keep that 4-0, get swept like a broom
Yeah, I'm 'bout my cake, no Suzy Q's
Yeah, I'm gettin' bricks, sippin' Jesus juice 
I'm walkin' on water, like Jesus do 
I walk on the beat and I eat it too
Goin' dumb, like Ed, Edd and Eddy do
Yeah, high off life, need a parachute
Oh, I'm gettin' this cash, I'm gettin' this lettuce
My foot on the gas, these niggas ain't ready
Cutthroat be the gang, I keep a machete
And shoutout my main bitch, she be the realest
Money on my mind, one call to my business
Young niggas with me, pop out like confetti (uh)
Real street nigga and I got good credit (yeah)
Foot on the gas, these niggas ain't ready

Woo
I got my .9 in my hand and I'm ready to roll
I got my-
Woo
I got my .9 in my hand and I'm ready to roll

I'm workin', I hustle from June to June 
I keep that 4-0, get swept like a broom
Yeah, I'm 'bout my cake, no Suzy Q's
Yeah, I'm gettin' bricks, sippin' Jesus juice 
I'm walkin' on water, like Jesus do 
I walk on the beat and I eat it too
Goin' dumb, like Ed, Edd and Eddy do
Yeah, high off life, need a parachute
Oh, I'm gettin' this cash, I'm gettin' this lettuce
My foot on the gas, these niggas ain't ready
Cutthroat be the gang, I keep a machete
And shoutout my main bitch, she be the realest
Money on my mind, one call to my business
Young niggas with me, pop out like confetti (uh)
Real street nigga and I got good credit (yeah)
Foot on the gas, these niggas ain't ready

Woo
.9 in my hand and I'm ready to roll
Go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go
.9 in my hand, .9 in my hand, .9
I got my .9 in my hand and I'm ready to roll
I got my .9 in my hand, .9 in my hand, .9
I got my .9 in my hand and I'm ready to roll
I got my .9 in my hand, 9 in my hand, .9
I got my .9 in my hand and I'm ready to roll
I got my .9 in my .9, in my .9 in my .9
I got my .9 in my hand and I'm ready to roll
