		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in limbo, load up the wagon
Next stop is somewhere where something will happen
Oh, packing, unpacking, sleep in a bubble

If things are changing, the difference is subtle

Packing, unpacking all types of weather
Start on the path to the end of the tether
Oh, packing, unpacking, memories linger
Retracing your steps, it's all so familiar

Living in limbo
Living in limbo
La-la-la-la
Watching through the window

Packing, unpacking what's in your suitcase
Go ahead, and reach in, and pull out a new face
Oh. packing, unpacking, talking on skyphones
Meaningful contact is strained over time zones

Living in limbo
Living in limbo
La-la-la-la
Watching through the window

Oh, packing, unpacking on slow elevators
Asking for taxis and waiting for waiters

Living in limbo
Living in limbo (la-la-la-la)
Living in limbo (living in limbo)
La-la-la-la
Watching through the window

But this face is recorded in purple
It's called something else I don't know
The name I've heard it before
I recognize this trainstation
I mi-, I must've walked up these hall stairs before

My luggage has set me 20 kilos lighter and I'm floating
I feel clapped from to my train
I hear the sound of the conductor announcing
Our departure
