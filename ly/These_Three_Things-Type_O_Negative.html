		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The child is torn from the womb unbaptised
There&#65533;s no question it&#65533;s infanticide
I&#65533;m guilty so therefore condemned
Destroying angels must come to an end
Now in Limbo deprived of paradise not so nice

At the end I&#65533;ll escort you to hell
The dark one&#65533;s forces lock your flaming cell
To murder the one's unborn
The worst sin you&#65533;ve ever performed
There are two other things I must tell know them well

With due respect hear these words of caution
If considering and abortion
If you did boiling sulphur
To which I will not concur
Leading to a path of misfortune no one won

Of a land, land that shuns the son
So alien call it area 5-1
Should there be failure to convert Zion?
What came as a lamb returning as a lion

Not a nation but a self proclaimed state
Since the year of our Lord 1-9-4-8
The road to redemption leads to through deserts
Rocky though the trip through is well worth it

I am the duel of the fisherman Simon
He brought alpha, omega, yes I&#65533;m the one
The twins fell beginning Armageddon
So the whore too who dwelleth in Babylon

All his people gathered round - through forgiveness salvation found
