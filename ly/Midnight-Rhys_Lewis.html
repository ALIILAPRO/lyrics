		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't we run into the night
Like the sun won't ever come up?
Call it the end of the world
Start fallin' in love
Like it's the first and the last time
We get to set our hearts on fire

Are you cold in the mornings?
Do you wake up dreamin' of the past?
Are you numb from the silence?
Are you missing things you've never had?
'Cause I'm tired of screamin'
Screamin' at the same four walls
And I don't think I've been
Closer to the edge before

So why don't we run into the night
Like the sun won't ever come up?
Call it the end of the world
Start fallin' in love
Like it's the first and the last time
We get to set our hearts on fire
And why don't we dance up in the stars
Like the darkness doesn't exist?
Over the curve of the earth 
Oh, I wanna live like it's the first and the last time
We get to set our hearts on fire

Meet me in the midnight

Don't believe in the future
The moment's all we ever have
We can sleep when we're dead 'cause we know
Endless summers never last
And I don't wanna stop
Chasing the night
The higher we can jump
The deeper we can dive

So why don't we run into the night
Like the sun won't ever come up?
Call it the end of the world
Start fallin' in love
Like it's the first and the last time
We get to set our hearts on fire
And why don't we dance up in the stars
Like the darkness doesn't exist
Over the curve of the earth
Oh, I wanna live like it's the first and the last time
We get to set our hearts on fire

Meet me in the midnight
Meet me in the midnight

And take this great horizon
Paint it ultraviolet
Like gravity won't find us
Oh, no

Why don't we run into the night
Like the sun won't ever come up?
Call it the end of the world
Start fallin' in love
Like it's the first and the last time
We get to set our hearts on fire
And why don't we dance up in the stars
Like the darkness doesn't exist
Over the curve of the earth
Oh, I wanna live like it's the first and the last time
We get to set our hearts on fire

Meet me in the midnight
Meet me in the midnight
Meet me in the midnight
