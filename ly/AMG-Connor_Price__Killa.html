		  (One hunnid)

Let's go (ooh), ah
Mm, welcome to the main event
Yeah, applying pressure but I promise they ain't make a dent
In their heads living free, I ain't paying rent
Wake up in the AM, making Gs like Mercedes-Benz
Woah, yeah
Please don't take offense
It isn't you, I'm just not interested in making friends
My biggest fear is finding out that this came and went
So go ahead but I'm staying in (okay)

Drop a song, it pop up on your phone like I was U2
Connected to the fans without a hand, I did it Bluetooth
The only time I come in short is when they watching YouTube
Spin in with the drill, no wonder why my screw's loose (yeah, ayy)
Taking off and I can't stop, I beat 'em all by a landslide
Houdini, I popped out of that box even with hands tied
Big dog like Sandlot but this real life, no fantasize
Count money a damn lot my hands clean, no sanitize
Woah, had to switch up on the flow
Gotta keep 'em on their toes
I move quick, I make the most
Why they copy what I wrote
Follow everything I post
Never trip about a clone
'Cause they know what's a sheep to a G.O.A.T

Yeah (woo), ah
Mm, welcome to the main event
Yeah, applying pressure but I promise they ain't make a dent
In their heads living free, I ain't paying rent
Wake up in the AM, making Gs like Mercedes-Benz
Woah, ayy
Please don't take offense
It isn't you, I'm just not interested in making friends
My biggest fear is finding out that this came and went
So go ahead but I'm staying in (ah)

Killa
If you don't like me better close your eyes, I'm 'bout to shine ('bout to shine)
But take a picture when you see me, 'cause I doubt you'll find (doubt you'll find)
Another like me, yeah, I'm one of one no other son
The way I'm blazing NASA like the Earth just got another sun
(Ah, ah, ah, ah) Ati naliba anti-social
Are you so sure? 'Cause I only be hanging with G.O.A.Ts, oh, they never told you?
I'm a soldier and you ain't got nothing on me
I've be killing and grilling 'em rappers, I'm writing a cook book for the homies, don't hold me
I'm dangerous, you don't wanna take this risk
I don't play with kids, no I am not on Epstein's list
I'm on my grown man ting, you know, steady stacking the racks up
I've got a hard drive so if I fall I'm going back up

(Woo) ah (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Mm, welcome to the main event
Yeah, applying pressure but I promise they ain't make a dent
In their heads living free, I ain't paying rent
Wake up in the AM, making Gs like Mercedes-Benz
Woah, okay
Please don't take offense
It isn't you, I'm just not interested in making friends
My biggest fear is finding out that this came and went
So go ahead but I'm staying in (ah, okay)
