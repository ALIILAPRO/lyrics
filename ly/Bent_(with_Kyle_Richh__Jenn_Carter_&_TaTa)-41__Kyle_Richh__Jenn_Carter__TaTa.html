		  (MC, make another hit)
Bitch, when is we fuckin' again?
Grah
(Project-Project X-X-X)
Grah
Grah
Bitch, when is we fuckin' again?
Grah

Damn, I gotta relax
New opp, he got put in my gas
Like it's a body if I kick it to Krash
Fuck, I think the D's on my-
Switch-switch it to sport if the D's on my ass
Body shot like Kim Kardash
These niggas fast, they run like Flash
Pass it to Steve, he gon' 'oot it like Nash
On his body, don't let him get low
Yo, Touch, this shit a float
Too many deads, I don't know what to roll
Keep it G 'cause I don't wanna go
Pin him down, thumb tack
Tried to get low, told bro come back (come back)
They don't shoot but they all run track
Run up on me, bet he wont run back

Hennessy got me bent, bitch, when is we fuckin' again?
Like if the pussy is good I'ma spend
But fuck it, could kick it to Jenn
She a thootie, could tell by the walk (tell by the walk)
Sip Wock', can't even talk (can't even talk)
I can't help it I stay in the stores (what?)
Bitch-bitch, I be totin' in Christian Dior (it's Carter, dickhead)

Like what, Jah pass the stick (what?)
Fuck, D's on my hip (D's on my hip)
Call up SV, tell him speed up the whip (speed up the whip)
It's okay, they can't see through the tints (see through the tints)
Yo, Star, why the fuck is he eyein'? (Like damn)
P-PTSD from the sound of the sirens (grah, grah)
Hmm, think he on timin'? 
Bullets is spreadin' like it was a virus (it was a virus)

Hennessy got me bent, bitch, when is we fuckin' again?
Like if the pussy is good I'ma spend
But fuck it, could kick it to Jenn
She a thootie, could tell by the walk (tell by the walk)
Sip Wock', can't even talk (can't even talk)
I can't help it I stay in the stores (what?)
Bitch, I be totin' in Christian Dior (it's Carter, dickhead)

Like I just met her she told me she love me
Like she just want money and dick (on bro)
We in the spot, told her give me a kiss
I could taste all the Casamigos on her lips (get back, bitch)
And if she a ten, I let her hold my knocker
Ni-nine shots in this gun, Ibaka (Ibaka)
Shh, shh, don't know who shot 'em (shot 'em)
Tryna shoot on this court I bet Mdotty block 'em (bitch)
Like I'm in the spot with the Crippys
Like I'm in the spot and I'm grippy
Like please don't eye me in the party
Always feel safe when I know Star be with me
Like off the Wocky, I'm drippy
Like off the D'USSE I'm litty (litty, bitch)
I'm tryna party with all the dooties
I got my face like all up in her titties, damn

Hennessy got me bent, bitch, when is we fuckin' again?
Like if the pussy is good I'ma spend
But fuck it, could kick it to Jenn
She a thootie, could tell by the walk (tell by the walk)
Sip Wock', can't even talk (can't even talk)
I can't help it I stay in the stores (what?)
Bitch, I be totin' in Christian Dior (it's Carter, dickhead)
