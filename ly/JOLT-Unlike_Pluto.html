		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And some will take the high road
I will go low
There's nothing left behind me
Set fire to it all
The fury will fade and the images too
A world without you
That's what I need to do
So pardon me while you fade
Whoever you used to be
And now I won't remember

You, you you don't get to say goodbye
Erasing the pain inside you, you
Eternal side of my mind
A jolt and then you'll die

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ooh, oh

Oh, will I want to go back? Will I ever try?
Maybe this is the end, my bitter paradise
So pardon me while you fade
Whoever you used to be
And now I won't remember

You, you you don't get to say goodbye
Erasing the pain inside you, you
Eternal side of my mind
A jolt and then you'll die

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ooh, oh

I wanted to run
Wanted to live my life by the gun
She left me stunned, but I'm still alive
I wanted to fly
Wanted to feel the sun and the sky
I flew too close, but ooh

You, you you don't get to say goodbye
Erasing the pain inside you
You, oh eternal side of my mind
A jolt and then you'll die

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ooh, oh
