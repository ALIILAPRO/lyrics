		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mrs. Magic to and fro
Please give me one last show
Loosen my mind from within
Before it starts to wear and thin

I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here

Mrs. Magic radio
Give me one last chance to show
Tell you what lurks deep inside
Deep inside my battered mind

I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here

Leaving me outside
No, I can't get back in
No, I can't get back in
Leaving me outside
No, I can't get back in
No, I can't get back in, ooh

Mrs. Magic to and fro
Just let me be myself
