		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I've saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

But all the miles that separate
They disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me, yeah

The miles just keep rollin'
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go, oh-oh yeah yeah

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl, it's only you and me

Everything I know (yeah), and anywhere I go (yeah)
It gets hard but it won't take away my love (yeah)
And when the last one falls (oh-oh) when it's all said and done
It gets hard but it won't take away my love, whoa, oh-oh

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl, it's only you and me, yeah, oh yeah
Oh-oh, oh oh oh
