		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think about you all the time
When I freeze the frame
I need to get you off my mind
But I can't say your name
To steal you from a paradise
And rain on your parade
There's words that I can't say
'Cause it'll never be the same
Thoughts that I can't change
'Cause they're never gonna make you stay

Open the bottle and and I'll surely overflow
Once it is open it'll never fully close
Know that a secret's only safe if no one knows
So you're never gonna be alone
'Cause you're never gonna hear this song
You're never gonna be alone
'Cause you're never gonna hear this song
Never gonna hear this...

Burn me with a look of ice
Freeze me with a flame
Cut me with a blunt reply
And fix with me a blade
Let me be your satellite
'Till you're dying day
These words I can't explain
'Cause it'll never be the same
This feeling never fades
But you're never gonna feel the same

You're never gonna hear this song
You're never gonna be alone
'Cause you're never gonna hear this song
You're never gonna hear this...
