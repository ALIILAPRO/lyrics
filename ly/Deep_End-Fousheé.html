		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason

Had to go and flip the script
Had a big bone to pick
Got the short end of sticks, so we made a fire with it
Let it burn to a crisp, now that's a sure fire flip
She's a boss, she's a bitch
I'll take that as a compliment
I see 'em moving real low, but leave 'em on a high note
Always lead with love, yo
Mama raised me thorough
They better wake up, niggas on the way up
You ain't finna play her

Shawty gon' get that paper
Shawty tongue rip like razor
Shawty got wit, got flavor
Pardon my tits and make-up, uh, uh, pay her
Dribble then hit that lay up
Shawty ain't with them games, yuh
Shawty gon' get that paper, pay her

I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give, give me
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason (I don't think I wanna give it)
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give, give me

Please proceed to light this bitch up
Life ain't fair, you fight for your cut
Think I spy your eye on my bucks
Great, look, now the lion woke up
You eying my shit, inquiring shit
Live for the minor event, I finally slip
Built on the bodies of men, nobody winning
Contain what I'm bottling in just benefits them

Shawty gon' get that paper
Shawty tongue rip like razor
Shawty got wit, got flavor
Pardon my tits and make-up, uh, uh, pay her
Dribble then hit that lay up
Shawty ain't with them games, yuh
Shawty gon' get that paper, pay her

I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give, give me
