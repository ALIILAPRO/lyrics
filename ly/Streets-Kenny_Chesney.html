		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's two lost souls finding love in Times Square
There's a rumble of a train running down a track
Light's are turning on the great wide wave
Cold beer here, pinstripes aren't bad
Piano man's holding court at the garden
All the street corner preachers are back

Faith believes what it can't see
And who we are and who we're gonna be
Angels ring a cathedral bell
And on the streets of New York
All is well

The eastern sun is rising over Sunset
Tourists taking selfies at the Hollywood sign
Waxing up the boards down in Venice
At Nicky's house they're all gathering in line, give it time

'Cause faith believes what it can't see
And who we are and who we're gonna be
City of Angels rising through the ashes of hell
And on the streets of L.A.
All is well

Oh oh, whoa

Well, there's a pickup rolling through the Heartland
And the shotgun seat rides her daddy's old six-string
Tonight she'll be singing in a bar on Broadway
She'll play some Willy, and everybody sings

Faith believes what it can't see
And who we are and who we're gonna be
Music cities got some tales to tell
And on the streets of Nashville
All is well

Oh oh, whoa

Faith believes what it can't see
And who we are and who we're gonna be
Our Lady in the harbor shining like a citadel
And on the streets of America
All is well
On the streets of America
All is well

Oh oh, whoa
