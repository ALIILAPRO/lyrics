		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The shadows, cast across the land.
The pyramids, haunting monoliths.
The pharaohs, did it for the gods, yet they lay and decay all the same.
The ancients of death speak through time!
From dusk till dawn they roam the land, in search of forbidding monuments
Between the stars and the sand, they slowly bleed into the seeds of doom
Within the tomb a power grows in the dark, waiting, watching closely
Feeding on the tainted soil, soaked in the blood of the loyal.
Dirt and the decaying whores, together spawns the demented gods!
The ancients of death speak through time!
Another generations spoils, seeps through the roots of our ancestors ruins!
They summon
They choke on serpants tongue
Through the catabombs the spirits brand the sacrifice!
Bearing the heart of the lamb!
Take My Soul!
They choke on serpants tongue
The ancients of death speak through time!
