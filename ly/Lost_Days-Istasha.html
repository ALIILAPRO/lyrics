		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you be not aware?
How can you warp what I said? Lost days
Don't want a part in this
How can you warp what I said?

Don't want a part in this
Now that it started to wither away
Only to break want to break

How can you be not aware?
How can you warp what I said? Lost days

Tear out my lungs when they punish my sight
Never forced slinging into my head 'til
They're done with the skin
Lock and the key, lost in the cage
I know we promised this anger would open us
Every possible exit is closed on my way
Locked it away, locked it away
Can't seem lost, I lost them
Don't see the signs, lie dormant

How can you be not aware?
How can you warp what I said?
