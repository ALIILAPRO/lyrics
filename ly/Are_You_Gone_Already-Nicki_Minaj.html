		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you doing, Papa?
Hi
No, uh-uh
Say, "Hi" (hi)

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

You never got to meet Papa (I could lie, say I like it like that)
He sweet proper, he keep mama (like it like that)
On my toes, I needed help (I could lie, say I like it like that)
You booked a flight in three days (like it like that)
You'd meet Papa (mh)
The waiting, the gazing
The painting, the raging
The raving, the pacing
The praying, the shaking
I must admit I was breaking
I must admit I was taking
I must admit my heart was racing
Telephone ring, didn't make it (he didn't make it)
I just believed you'd awaken
A memory in the makin'
Call me
Won't you call me? (Call)
No, you gone

Are you gone already? (Don't you know too much already?)
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

So deal, 'Nika, yes, real, 'Nika (I could lie, say I like it like that)
Don't stress, Onika, so blessed, Onika (like it like that)
Today it's 12/3/23 (I could lie, say I like it like that)
Your baby's three, he's the best, Onika (like it like that)
Set me, set me, set me free (set me free)
Why didn't you come back to get me? (To get me)
Let me, let me, let me be (let me be)
Why would anyone want to love me? (To love me)
Rich, yes, but are you happy? (Rich, yes, but are you happy?)
All this guilt you carry is heavy (all of this guilt is heavy)
You already made your peace with me
One day you'll have to forgive, mommy
But she knows you know too much already

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
