		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had a dollar
For every dream of you and me
I'd buy myself a rocket
And shoot into your galaxy
There wouldn't be no parts unknown
I'd search every uncharted zone
And when it's time to come back home
I'll send ya
My antenna is pointed at

My cosmic love
You're my cosmic love
From the stars above
You're my, you're my cosmic love

Incoming transmission
I'm crashing through your atmosphere
There's no interference, no
I read you darling loud and clear
Because you're my

My cosmic love
You're my cosmic love
From the stars above
You're my, you're my cosmic love

(My cosmic love from up above
You are the one I'm thinking of
My cosmic love) 
My cosmic love

(My cosmic love from up above
You are the one I'm thinking of
My cosmic love) 
My cosmic love, my cosmic love

(My cosmic love from up above
You are the one I'm thinking of
My cosmic love)
My cosmic love
