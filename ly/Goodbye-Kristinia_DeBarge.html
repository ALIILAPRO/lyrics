		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act
And you don't know where your life is going
Am I supposed to be torn apart, broken hearted, in a corner crying?
Pardon me if I don't show it
I don't care if I never see you again
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together,
But either way baby, I'm gone

I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wondering
I got that new
I'm a single girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye

Cut my hair 'cuz it reminded me of you
I know you like the long 'do,
Had to switch my attitude up
Thinkin' of changing up how I ride, No more
On the passenger side
Too bad you miss out on the way that I drive it
I don't care if I never see you again
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together,
But either way baby, I'm gone

I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wondering
I got that new
I'm a single girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Goodbye

I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wondering
I got that new
I'm a single girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye

Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
Goodbye
