		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good old rain
Is pounding on the dreamers
You've left a stain
On every single hour
All the treasures found
Will vanish with the tide
Illusion has gone
I'm all out of your web
Maybe on the moon
There is a soil for the doomed
I should save us a ride
I'll do what you want me to do
I'll lose the grip of your eyes
I'll do what you want me to do
You're the needle in my arm
I'll drain drain drain
The rivers of addiction
I dreamed I could
Feed my veins in oblivion
Nourrir mes veines dans l'oubli
But ain't no shelter
For the years of our blindness
Though we're good people
We're bullets to each other wings
Maybe on the moon
There is a soil for the doomed
I should save us a ride
I'll do what you want me to do
You're the needle in my arm
Rain rain rain
Am I the only winner?
In this silly game
Where tears are a trophy to gather?
My solitude ain't new
I'm used to it by now
But there's is something in the blue
That has faded out of my eye
And maybe on the moon
There is a soil for the doomed
I should save us a ride
I'll do what you want me to do
You're the needle in my arm
I'll do what you want me to do
You're the needle in my arm
