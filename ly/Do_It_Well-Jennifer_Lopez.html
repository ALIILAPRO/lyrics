		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

Here's the thing
I was minding my own business doin' what I do
I wasn't tryna look for anything
All of a sudden couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze
Sayin' 'what the hell'
Here's my name, number
Baby just hit my cell
Loving everything you do
'Cause you do it well
Don't know what you got me thinkin'

You ain't even tryina play me boy
'Cause you're so good, and you're so fine
Got me sayin' crazy things, listen

I ain't ever met a man like that, no
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast, no
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that, no
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast, no
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well, oh yeah

Let me tell you how its gonna go
You and me, gonna need a little privacy
I Don't wanna do the dance, no do-si-do
I need a one woman man seven days a week
Quit tryna play it cool
Boy make your move
I told you how it is
Nothin' to lose
You been starin' over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' no cash or credit, just a guarantee
There ain't nobody else but me boy

You ain't even tryna play me boy
'Cause you're so good, and you're so fine
Got me sayin' crazy things, listen

I ain't ever met a man like that, no
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast,no
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

Baby not lookin' for false pretenses
I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night

Baby not lookin' for false pretenses
I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
