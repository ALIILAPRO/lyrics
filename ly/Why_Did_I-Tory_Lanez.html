		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why did I bring you outside? (Outside)
Cash, got the money, playin' fives, southside (side)
Ooh, I'm sad (sad), shawty, you don't slide (slide)
But I wonder why did I bring you outside? (Outside)
When it's a lot a niggas spend some money outside

Yeah, ayy (bih)
You don't like me in Taboo 'cause you know all the thots there
I be Hialeah, 826, I'm poppin' out still
So much dough, can't keep it low, you know if I was not there, yeah
Told my bitch I went there just for pasta
But I drove in black on black McLaren like a mobster
Oh, pretty bad bitches on my roster
Down to get it poppin' like it's Orville Redenbacher
How (how) the fuck (the fuck) you gon' sober with that vodka?
Stuck this dick up in her like a photo in a locker
Silk the sheets (the sheets), oh, did it shock you?
Prayin' this bitch outside, she got me

Why did I bring you outside? (Outside)
Cash, got the money, playin' fives, southside (side)
Ooh, I'm sad (sad), shawty, you don't slide (slide)
But I wonder why did I bring you outside? (Outside)
When it's a lot a niggas spend some money outside
Why did I bring you outside? (Outside)
Cash, got the money, playin' fives, southside (side)
Ooh, I'm sad (sad), shawty, you don't slide (slide)
But I wonder why did I bring you outside? (Outside)

I hate it when you wanna go out but I know the opps there
Always wanna pop your shit when you know that you pop, yeah
We at the Jamaican store, no I can't even eat my oxtail
'Cause we gotta go and shit, you got on your bogus shit
Wanna ride the Rolls 'cause the stars' like a solarship
How you tryna go viral but you tryna go legit?
Next time you wanna open up your mouth, just hold this shit
Bully how I beat her pussy, leave her with the swollen lips
Told this lil' bitch pussy tight, I call her shawty polar grip
She just wanna ball with a nigga, Victor Oladip'
Talkin' too much, got me thinkin'

Why did I bring you outside? (Outside)
Cash, got the money, playin' fives, southside (side)
Ooh, I'm sad (sad), shawty, you don't slide (slide)
But I wonder why did I bring you outside? (Outside)
When it's a lot a niggas spend some money outside
