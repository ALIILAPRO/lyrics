		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So open promise fades
And the sun forgets to rise
I'm lonely and I'm thirsty
But it's better I stay dry
No more than two drinks away
From crying

Stare into the glass
And wait for the time to pass
And thank you for the offer
But you know I must decline
No more than two drinks away
From crying

There used to be a time
When I could hold my head up high
My life stretched out before me
And rivers flowed with wine
And had my love beside me
And everything was fine
But now the ride is over
It's hard to say goodbye

So open promise fades
And midnight turns to day
I'd love to drown my sorrow
But I cannot tell a lie
No more than two drinks away
From crying
