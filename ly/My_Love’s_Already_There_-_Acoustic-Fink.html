		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, don't you cry
I'll get there just as soon as I physically can
Baby, don't you lose your grip
My love's already there
My love's already there

In the palm of your hand
In the moon looking down
Through the misty clouds
The heart has no borders
Remember when we learned that
Years ago, over tears in Paris
Baby, don't you come apart
Just keep breathing, I believe in you

Baby, don't you cry too much
Save a few for when you're in my arms
Baby, don't you cry too much
Save a few for when you're in my arms

Baby, don't you cry
I'll get there just as soon as I physically can
Baby, don't you lose your grip
My love's already there
My love's already there
My love's already there
My love's already there
