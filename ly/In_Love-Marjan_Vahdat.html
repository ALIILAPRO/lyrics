		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say love is baseless
At first it is a cure, but in the end, it is suffering.
They say you will not be ashamed by love,
However, my forehead is marked for everyone to see

Your beige colored horse is proud and beautiful
How can I be a cure for the pain of your heart?
Come and be my guest tonight,
I will decorate the bridle of your horse with Turquoise.

You are like a moon raised from behind the mountain top 
You are like a flower which has blossomed again
You are like a deer, grazing in the fields of Khorasan in the night 

They say love is baseless
At first it is a cure, but in the end, it is suffering.
They say you will not be ashamed by love,
However, my forehead is marked for everyone to see
