		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Homegrown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar 
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone, someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

We're south of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea diving 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone, someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

We got two in the front (hey)
Two in the back (hey)
Sailing along
And we don't look back (back, back)

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone, a someone, a someone, a some
