		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got these blisters on both my hands 
And I keep dreamin' of that promised land 
And I'm just doin' the best I can
But I'm a troubled, I'm a troubled man 

I break my back, toil to the bone 
I keep on hustlin' â€˜til I come home 
Ambitious man, oh yes I am 
I'm a workin' (I'm a workin')
I'm a workin' man (I'm a workin' man)

I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
And I'm just doin' the best I can 
Oh, I'm a workin' (I'm a workin')
I'm a workin' man 

Roll up my sleeves, doing the grind 
Put in the sweat and put in my time
I've drawn these lines out in the sand 
I'm a workin' (I'm a workin')
I'm a workin' man (I'm a workin' man)

I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
And I'm just doin' the best I can (Do what I can)
Oh, I'm a workin' (I'm a workin')
I'm a workin' man (I'm a workin' man)
 
Nobody told me, reap what you sow 
But all that glitters, no it ain't gold 
It's been a long and troubled road 
I'm a troubled, (I'm a troubled)
I'm a troubled man (I'm a troubled man)

I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work

I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work

I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
work, work, work

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man 
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah 
work, work, work
I'm a workin' man
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah 
work, work, work
Yeah, Oh

Crossed over rivers wandered desert sands 
And I've been dreamin' of that promised land 
And I've been doin' the best I can 
I'm a workin'
I'm a workin' man 
I'm a workin'
I'm a workin' man
