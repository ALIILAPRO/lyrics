		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Call me babydoll)

Darling, I'm falling
Fucked up over you
Bite me, bruise me
Leave me like you do
Darling, I'm calling
Lay me in my tomb
(In my tomb)

Call me babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone

Call me babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home

Oh, father, forgive me
For all my sins
When I meet your eyes
The Devil, he wins
Blinded by your lies
But I play pretend
(Play pretend)

Call me babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone

Call me babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home

(Call me babydoll)
(Call me babydoll)

Wrapped around your finger
Wish your tongue would linger
I need your warmth
Just to stay high
Now, you're holding me down
I scream but make no sound
Nothing to hold
My hands are tied

Call me babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone

Call me babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home

(Call me babydoll)
(Call me babydoll)
