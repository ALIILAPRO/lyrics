		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart said, "Follow through"
But I know now that I'm way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
'Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
'Cause if summer is here, I'm still waiting there
Winter is here, and I'm still waiting there
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Like I said
It's been three years since I'm knockin' at your door
And I still can knock some more
Ooh-ooh, girl, ooh-ooh, girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
You see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn
Oh-oh, oh

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love (love)
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain
