		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before Corona I was livin like a loner
Now I got a fuckin dime piece I can call up when I wanna
I've been gettin better imma tell em if they don't know
Everybody who was doubtin all the sudden turned to goners
I've runnin up these bags
Bitches gettin mad now I hear them talkin that bitch ass trash
I've been runnin laps, left em in the past
I don't hear no talkin cuz y'all down bad
Hahaha bitch I knew I'd get the last laugh on these niggas
Sorry I ain't sorry goin bad bad on these niggas
And I knew I'd get the last laugh on these bitches
So I'm fuckin skeetin rat-ta-tat-tat on these bitches
Goddamn lately I do what I wanna
Cum right in her face like that ain't somebody daughter
Since a kid man I knew I'd be a baller
With a couple hoes that I have to keep in order
Bounce that ass like a chevy impala 1967 baby girl go shake ya blessins right
Got your ex out her preein like a stalker colt 1911
It gon send that boiii to heaven no problem
Pussy why you talkin bout me
Hold that fuckin talk boiii we gon meet in the streets uh huh
You ain't never been in no beef
Probably fuckin why that he don't carry no heat uh huh
I've runnin up these bags
bitches gettin mad now I hear them talkin that bitch ass trash
I've been runnin laps, left em in the past
I don't hear no talkin cuz y'all down bad
Hahaha bitch I knew I'd get the last laugh on these niggas
Sorry I ain't sorry goin bad bad on these niggas
And I knew I'd get the last laugh on these bitches
So I'm fuckin skeetin rat-ta-tat-tat on these bitches
Fuck all the waiting
Shit entertaining
Sucka wanna leave me but I paved my way
Finna dance on your grave
When they chanting my name
I'm sorry not sorry but you playing my game
Screen time causing downtime
You be hella lucky to be ready in the morning
Finna need a pit stop
Ready when this shit drop
Cuz you down bad when the cameras start rolling
Fuck all the waiting
Shit entertaining
Sucka wanna leave me but I paved my way
Finna dance on your grave
When they chanting my name
I'm sorry not sorry but you playing my game
Cuz you bad
And you getting mad,
Fuck you and your face
Lil snitch I'll pass
I be loading mags
Putting on a mask
Sorry not sorry but I got the last laugh
I've runnin up these bags, bitches gettin mad now
I hear them talkin that bitch ass trash
I've been runnin laps, left em in the past
I don't hear no talkin cuz y'all down bad
Hahaha bitch I knew I'd get the last laugh on these niggas
Sorry I ain't sorry goin bad bad on these niggas
And I knew I'd get the last laugh on these bitches
So I'm fuckin skeetin rat-ta-tat-tat on these bitches
