		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our paths will never cross again
And that's the way you wanted it
You never could care less about the way we ended up
We swim in different circles now
I saw your tracks in snowy ground
And didn't want to follow them as you fell off the earth
Sightings few and far between
I have no words when they tell me
A figure spotted roaming in the icy mountain wilds
There was a time I felt for you
Would collect these words like drops of dew
And savor on my tongue in season dry

And I don't know you
I used to like to pretend to
We're nothing but myths now
That neither of us believe in

You hear how I achieved good ends
Out of the mouths of mutual friends
And shrug and raise your eyebrows in the way you always have
And with that too they carry rumors of
When someone last saw my movements
A shadow treading through the willows in the forest land
Messages that reach our ears are met with an indifference
I never thought I wouldn't care about you

But here we are
Flung to earth's corners far
We're nothing but myths now
That neither of us believe in
My tongue's forgotten how
To shape your name, the way it sounds
We're nothing but myths now
That neither of us believe in

No muscle memory, no lingering taste
No persistent impulse to pick up your trace
I left you no note, you left me no sign
Of where I plan to go, of what you've gone to find
Sweet indifference, gentle apathy
Wholesome, quiet dispassion
Restful neutrality

We're nothing but myths now
That neither of us believe in
We're nothing but myths now
That neither of us believe in
