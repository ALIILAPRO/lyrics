		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something about you is soft like an angel
And something inside you is violence and danger
I knew from the moment we met
You are a dangerous thing

When you are with me, I feel like I'm living
And living beside you can be unforgiving
I knew from the very first step
You are a dangerous thing

There's no end to the fall
You keep on getting better
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
I hope you will come
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end

Something about you is warm and sedusive
And when you're with me, you're cold and abusive
I knew from the second we met
You are a dangerous flame
You are a dangerous flame

There's no end to the fall
You keep on getting better
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
I hope you will come
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end

No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end

I don't think I know myself
Without your hell
Oh, I wonder why I got
A heaven deep inside of me
I keep the light on
It keeps me warm
I hate it when I fall for your illusion of love
I know this is not love

There's no end to the fall
You keep on getting better
There's no love in the end
I hope you will come
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
There's no end to the fall
You keep on getting better
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
I hope you will come
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end

No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end
