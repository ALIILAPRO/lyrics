So one, two, three, take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine

I say you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine

Oh, four, five, six c'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need the money
When you look like that, do ya honey?

Big black boots
Long brown hair
She's so sweet
With her get back stare

Well, I could see
You home with me
But you were with another man, yeah

Before I let you get away, yeah
