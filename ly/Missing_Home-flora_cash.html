		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a lot of hunger and
Got a lot of big dreams and
Even though I'm mining gold
I'm missing home somehow
Been a lot of hard days and
Been a lot of long nights and
Even though I love the road
I'm missing home somehow

Three in the morning and I'm looking for air
Check on your breathing and I get out of bed
Flip on the TV and I look at the news
And I'm getting confused 'cause this isn't our room

Where have we gone and how did we get here?
Where would I be in life had we not met yet?
What does it take to be happy?
What does it take to be satisfied?

Got a lot of hunger and
Got a lot of big dreams and
Even though I'm mining gold
I'm missing home somehow
Been a lot of hard days and
Been a lot of long nights and
Even though I love the road
I'm missing home somehow

And I'm thinkin' of mama and the look in her eyes
When I said I'm a dreamer and I kissed her goodbye
I took to the path with nothing to lose
And I'm feeling alone but I'm paying my dues

Where have we gone and how did we get here?
Where would I be in life had we not met yet?
What does it take to be happy?
What does it take to be satisfied?

Got a lot of hunger and
Got a lot of big dreams and
Even though I'm mining gold
I'm missing home somehow
Been a lot of hard days and
Been a lot of long nights and
Even though I love the road
I'm missing home somehow

(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I'm missing home somehow
I'm, I'm missing, I'm
I'm missing home somehow

And I think that you should know
That the places come and go
But the thing is that
Home is where the heart is
When I'm feeling low
With a million miles to go
I'll remember that
Home is where the heart is

Got a lot of hunger and
Got a lot of big dreams and
Even though I'm mining gold
I'm missing home somehow
Been a lot of hard days and
Been a lot of long nights and
Even though I love the road
I'm missing home somehow

(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I'm, I'm missing, I'm
I'm missing home somehow
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I'm, I'm missing, I'm
I'm missing home somehow
