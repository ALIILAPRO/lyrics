		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter how you live your life, you're breathing every day
Depending on somebody else to lead you on your way
But even if they disappear you're breathing all the same
‘Cause all you’ll do is drag along whomever keeps you safe

The people who I cherished and the people I forgot
Relationships that came and went without another thought
Although I felt an inkling “this is not how things should be”
I guess I really didn't know a single thing

Whatever anyone may say 
I know I've always been this way
As I avert my gaze away from bonds I’ve severed to this day

Even I cry when I’m alone
Even if nobody will know
‘Cause deathly loneliness strikes on its own

For all the people’s feelings that I threw off to the side
Although I know I needed them to keep myself in line
The punishment for running from my duty all those times
Has tightened all around my chest and now begins to bite

Before I know it, something in my heart begins to change
I wish I had somebody else to share my everyday
My body feels so numb as I succumb to prickling pain
I realize now that solitude is not a strength

Whatever words I said out loud 
I know there's no returning now
And yet again I tell myself “it’s fine because it can’t be helped”

No matter just how much I cry
No one will be there by my side
The cracks within my heart run deep with time

So that it wouldn’t break…
So that I wouldn’t break…
Although my hands were shaking I still tried to keep it safe

Oh what a simple feeling and
I fail still to comprehend…!
I held too tight and it broke to pieces in the end

Hugging my knees, I cry in vain
Knowing that not a thing will change
No one will answer to my useless cries that echo in this room

Even the silence of the night
Even the veil of the moon light
Won’t erase, won’t erase
What I try to escape, and that’s the truth...

There’s no way I can say
All the words hid away
So deathly loneliness has followed me to this day
