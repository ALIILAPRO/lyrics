		<p>
		  (Southside on the track, yeah)

Yeah
Cut the bullshit, I'm not with it
Call your main bitch, she let me hit it
Haha, ha
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Diamonds got dripped in a lake (a lake)
I don't be goin' on dates (no dates)
She got an ass, but it's fake (it's fake)
He savin' hoes, need a cape (cape)
Lil' mama's head supreme (straight up)
But I'm still rockin' this Bape (on God)
All I know is two guns, nigga
If you a plate, you get ate (brrat)
Had to put a bitch on pause (pause)
Me and my dawgs break laws (laws)
21 Gang 'til I fall (fall)
You could get hit in the jaw (your jaw)
The chopper can hit all of y'all (straight up)
Your brother, your goldfish and dog (all)
Most of my niggas just rob (wow)
They cut off and hand you your balls (on God)
Hit your BFF, I'm petty (21)
Can't leave the streets, I ain't ready (21)
Me and my hood got married (21)
And my wedding ring was a machete (straight up)
Need me a Keisha like Belly (straight up)
Dissin' me, got a nigga's homeboys buried (on God)
They don't come outside, they scary (scary)
When we start spinnin' niggas' blocks, they telling (pussy)
Got your baby mama in a yolk (yolk)
I don't smoke weed, I sell dope (21)
Ain't no back and forth, it's smoke (smoke)
Pull up on you and your folks (your folks)
Try to give me head, she choke (ugh)
We call you a rat 'cause you spoke (bitch)
All these tennis chains like I'm in a tennis game
Y'all niggas wearin' gold ropes (you're broke)

Killers out the 6 (Zone 6)
Got 'em all hired (straight up)
Ex-girlfriends (old hoes)
Got 'em all fired (bye-bye)
Don't you cross the gang, dawg
We're like barbed wire (straight up)
Stackin' up these M's
I'm a habitual car buyer (skrrt)

Actin' Hollywood, I kicked her out on Wilshire (bye)
Got a model and she tighter than a grill plier (fine)
Sneak and steal my flow, lot of these rappers slick biters (21)
I'm 4L gang for L, dawg, and we got big rifles (on God)
Let me pop my shit (yeah)
Keep a big Glock on my hip (yeah)
One up top, my shit (on God)
I don't like to cock my shit (straight up)
Y'all niggas gossip and shit (on God)
No more beef, we drop that shit (straight up)
Y'all niggas talk that shit (straight up)
Never had a payment, I bought that shit (straight up, straight up)
VS1 on my wrist (wrist)
Can't put my tongue on no bitch (no bitch)
'Cause I still kiss my kids (I do)
Ho, you need to fix your wig (you do)
All my brothers did a bid (straight up)
When they came home, we was rich (straight up)
Fuck forty acres and a mule
They got fifty racks and a brand new Sig (on God)
Lil' boy, get up out the way (yeah)
Lil' boy, we didn't come to play (yeah)
And I got a partner named Dre (Dre)
You can get beats by Dre (on God)
You can get hit by K (K)
K hit you, that's your last day (day)
Glock 27, that's bae (21)
Stick the 30 in it, had a baby (yeah)
My strippers got S-Class 'Cedes (straight up)
Ride me slow like you drivin' Miss Daisy
I ain't go to school 'cause I was too lazy
Had to cut her off 'cause she was too crazy
Moncler jacket, a letterman (letterman)
I gotta keep a Beretta, man (Beretta, man)
She screamin' and scratchin' and yellin', man (and yellin', man)
I got her in a falsetto, man (falsetto, man)

Had to put a bitch on pause (pause)
Me and my dawgs break laws (laws)
21 Gang 'til I fall (fall)
Me and my dawgs break laws (laws)
21 Gang 'til I fall (fall)
Me and my dawgs break laws (laws)

You could get hit in the jaw (your jaw)
The chopper can hit all of y'all (straight up)
Your brother, your goldfish and dog (all)
Most of my niggas just rob (wow)
They cut off and hand you your balls (on God)
