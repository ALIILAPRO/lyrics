		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe

You know
I see love in every space
I see sex in every city, every town
I wonder what us two could make
'Cause I feel so good around you
Can you imagine what we'd get up to, yeah
There's something different 'bout tonight
I could speak, or just let my body explain
I'm getting close to satisfied
And I've learned so much about you
Don't know your name, that's something we'll get to, yeah

Overdrive
Yeah, my body's working in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind

Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe
Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe

I don't pray a lot, God knows
But I'm calling in favors like I believe
Don't go bringing me that close
'Cause I feel so good around you
I'm going in tonight like I love you, yeah

Overdrive
My body's working in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind

Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe
