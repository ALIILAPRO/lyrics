		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had my reason and I had my doubts
Oh, I let my feelings, runnin' 'round this town
Yeah, I'll admit, I was foolish
But I found a way out
It's you that gives me love to believe in now

I put my hands up to the sky, and I say
That I won't be letting you down, I won't be letting you down
Put my hands up to the sky, and I say
That I won't be letting you down

I won't let you down (no, I won't)
Won't let you down again (I won't let you down)
I won't let you down (oh-oh)
Won't let you down again (no, I won't, no)
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
Won't let you down again (I won't let you down again)
I won't let you down (mmm)
Won't let you down again (mm)

I won't be leavin', I'll be stickin' 'round
'Cause I got these feelings
To pick you up when you're down
You give me something I needed
And now I won't let you go
And it took me a minute to know that I

Put my hands up to the sky, and I say
That I won't be letting you down, I won't be letting you down
Put my hands up to the sky, and I say
That I won't be letting you down, I won't be letting you down

Let me make it up to you, every day
No, I won't be letting you down, I won't be letting you down
Put my hands up to the sky, and I say
That I won't be letting you down

I won't let you down
Won't let you down again (I won't be letting you down)
I won't let you down 
Won't let you down again (I won't be letting you down)

No, I won't be letting you down
No, I won't be letting you down
No, I won't be letting you down
No, I won't be letting you down
