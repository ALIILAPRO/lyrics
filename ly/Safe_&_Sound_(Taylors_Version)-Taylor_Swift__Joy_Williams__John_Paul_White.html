		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember tears streamin' down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said
"Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darlin', everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps ragin' on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh (ooh)
Ooh (ooh)
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa)
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa)
Ooh (ooh)
Ooh (ooh)
Oh-whoa 
Oh-oh-whoa

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
