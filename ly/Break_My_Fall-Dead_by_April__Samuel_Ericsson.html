		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Break my fall)

How far would you go? (I need to know, how far would you go?)
Is there a limit? (I need to know the answer is no)
I trust who you are (would you hold on, would you let go?)

I've walked through the fire
I've danced with the flames
Time moves fast and the pendulum swings
(And I need to know)

That if I jump, will you break my fall?
Try to catch me at all?
I'm about to let go
And if I fell, fell straight into hell
Would you follow me there?
(Follow me there)

When-when I'm at my lowest I have ever been
When-when I wanna destroy everything
When-when I wanna suffer and burn and
I want to feel my veins be injected with (injected with) poison

That if I jump, will you break my fall?
Try to catch me at all?
I'm about to let go
And if I fell, fell straight into hell
Would you follow me there?
Would you follow me there?
Me there, me there

(Crush my defense)
(Create chaos in me)

Crush my defense
Create chaos in me
All I need to know
Are you my enemy?

All I need to know
Are you my enemy?

(Break my fall)
(Try to catch me at all)
(Break my fall)

That if I jump, will you break my fall?
Try to catch me at all
Would you catch me at all?
And if I fell, fell straight into hell
Would you follow me there?
Would you follow me there?
Me there, me there
