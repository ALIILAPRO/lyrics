		  (Nick, you're stupid)

Nowadays see the cash, gotta get it all
I'm better off, yes, I'm better off
She fell in love, should've never fell in love
Don't get involved, told her not to get involved
Lost the trust with me
Another love affair
I'm running out of answers
It's catching up to me

Fuck love, I feel like "Fuck love"
I'm getting fucked up, pouring my emotions
She be starstruck, going through the motion
And my neck water, wetter than the ocean
And I see them flexing for the internet, ooh
Know they waiting on me, waiting for my next move
She a bad bitch and she get the checks too
And I bet she need me now, start to watch me through the roof

Like, whoa
Leave me 'lone
I'm cold
Love's dead, upset
Ain't no space for you here, no home

Nowadays see the cash, gotta get it all
I'm better off, yes, I'm better off
She fell in love, should've never fell in love
Don't get involved, told her not to get involved
Lost the trust with me
Another love affair
I'm running out of answers
It's catching up to me
