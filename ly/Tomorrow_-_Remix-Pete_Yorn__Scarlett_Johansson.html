		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can take you anywhere
I just want to get to know you
I can take you anywhere
I just want to get to know you

Hand on your heart
Wind the clock
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day (ay, yeah yeah yeah)

There's so much of this world I never see
In front of me
Far too much of this world we've never been
Forgive me

I can take you anywhere
I just wanna get to know you
I can take you anywhere
I just wanna get to love you

Hand on your heart
Tomorrow is another day
Hand on your hope
Tomorrow we will, tomorrow we will get away (ay, yeah yeah yeah)

I just wanna get to know you
I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna get to love you
I just wanna get away

Hand on your heart
Tomorrow is another day
Hand on your hope
Tomorrow we will, tomorrow we will

Hand on your heart
Tomorrow is another day
Hand on your hope
Tomorrow we will, tomorrow we will get away (ay, yeah yeah yeah)

Tomorrow is another day
