		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna
I just feel like, ooh
Every time I see ya
I just, ooh, hey (get it, boy)

I feel like startin' something
You got my engine runnin'
You got the keys to turn me on and on
You got me accelerated
I wanna celebrate it
Can't nothing take me out my zone
It's on

When it feels right
Nothing else matters
Is this real life?
Too good to be true
Take me all night
I can feel the passion
In your eyes
I'm still in love with you

You know I can't get enough (I love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (you love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (give me all that shit)
Can't get enough
You know I can't get enough (I love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (you love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (give me all that shit)
Can't get enough of you

I'm still in love
With you, boy

I just wanna
I just feel like
Every time I see ya, it's like
Oh, hey (get it, boy)

Give me that touchin', teasin'
So good, I can't believe it
Don't wanna share with no one else
You're always the one I needed (needed)
Don't gotta keep a secret (secret)
But I let you keep me to yourself (self)

'Cause, bae, it feels like
Nothing else matters
Is this real life?
Too good to be true
Take me all night
I can feel the passion
In your eyes
I'm still in love with you

You know I can't get enough (I love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (you love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (give me all that shit)
Can't get enough
You know I can't get enough (I love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (you love that shit)
You know I can't get enough (give me all that shit)
Can't get enough of you

I'm still in love
With you, boy
I'm still in love
With you, boy

I can't get enough of you
It's the way you love me, the way you touch me
It's the way you look at me
Can't get enough (can't get enough)
Of you, boy
