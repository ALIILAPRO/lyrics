		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don't understand
But I'll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

How could we know
We'd rearrange all the cosmos? Mm
We crashed, and we burned
Now I just can't go where you don't go
And usually, I'm

Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I'm not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Let's go tonight
'Cause there's just a few seconds left 'til tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let's leave our baggage and wine at the table (mm), mm

How could we know
That this was a happy disaster? (Happy disaster) mm (mm)
I'm glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
I'll never forget when you told me
You said, usually, I'm

(Fucked) fucked up (up), anxious (anxious), too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
But I'm not like that since I met you

Mm, how could we know
We'd make the bad stuff delightful? Mm
I'm glad we crashed and burned
I know we'll be there for each other
When we're feeling

(Fucked) fucked up (up), anxious (anxious), too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
But I'm not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

(Fucked) fucked up (up), anxious (anxious), too much
Like you need me to (li-like you need me to)
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
Not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
