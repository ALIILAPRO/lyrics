		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On this road I walk alone till the end of days I'm solo
Caught inside these ups and downs tryna live my life in slow-mo
Misanthropic since the womb that's why I'm ridin' dolo
Lost my faith along the path I think my heart has gone cold
Overcome with apathy I'm stuck projecting it
Bleaker days on the horizon just accepting it
Grapple daily with these vices not defending it
Another day, another breath I'm fucking dreading it

Got an obligation to you all that's why I keep on pushin'
Tryna serve as an inspiration to you know that that's my purpose
Just know that I got my demons with me never said I'm perfect
Could flip a switch one day outta nowhere cause a mass disturbance
Solipsistic state, know that I'm the only one
Narcissistic form, hope none of you can relate
Solipsistic state, know that I'm the only one
Narcissistic form, hope none of you can relate

On this road I walk alone till the end of days I'm solo
Caught inside these ups and downs tryna live my life in slow-mo
Misanthropic since the womb that's why I'm ridin' dolo
Lost my faith along the path I think my heart has gone cold
Overcome with apathy I'm stuck projecting it
Bleaker days on the horizon just accepting it
Grapple daily with these vices not defending it
Another day, another breath I'm fucking dreading it

Apathy conquers sympathy I cannot feel for no one
Caught between the parallels of life and death awoken
Slit my wrist so I could feel, I'm tryna live wide open
Losin' my mind like Edgar Allan you feel my words in poems
Apathy conquers sympathy I cannot feel for no one
Caught between the parallels of life and death awoken
Slit my wrist so I could feel, I'm tryna live wide open
Losin' my mind like Edgar Allan you feel my words in poems

Solipsistic state, know that I'm the only one
Narcissistic form, hope none of you can relate
