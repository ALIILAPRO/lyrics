		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Gas what I blow
C'mon, like yeah, it's the opps what I smoke
The chop' make the opps all go

Yeah, it be gas what I smoke
Pistol what I tote, pistol what I blow (yeah)
Ain't kissin' no ho on the lips
Get up and put my dick in her throat (dick in her throat)
And we don't do no interviews
Walk up in the section, I just get to go (yeah, I just get to go)
Yeah, we rockin' penthouse views
That's the only way I get up in my zone (yeah, it's the only way I get up)

Yeah, I been fuckin' on these hoes (fuckin' on these hoes)
And it's overseas where I go (overseas where I go)
I get paid anywhere I go
Got money, like yesterday was broke (let's go)
Now they tryna ride up on the wave
One that I made, how they finna float? (Why they wanna float?)
You not rockin' no cool clothes
Your music is a joke, get up off the boat (go get up off the boat)
And I just be cookin' autotune
On my dick (Yeah), they be watching what I do (yeah, yeah)
Shitty pack, they be smokin' on the boof (smokin' on the boof)
High as fuck, bitch, I'm way up out the roof
Copycat, they be watching all my moves (watchin' my moves)
Kitty cat in the pussy, I'ma groom
Lamborghini Urus engine go "Vroom"
In this bitch (yeah), I hit my Tokyo groove (Tokyo, yeah)
Got 'em fuckin' with the swag
It's Balenciaga on these tracks
Got new Vetements on my sweatsuit
And I bought my ho a bag (yeah)
And you bet that I'ma flex my racks 'cause that's somethin' I never had
I live everyday like this shit VR
In the life we live, you can't lag (yeah, it's only the fast life or nothin')
Got heartagrams on my crosses (Heartagrams on my crosses)
Yeah, I be coolin' with the bosses, dawg
I put my soul up for auction (put my soul up for auction)
Rockin' black hearts on my rock shit
And I'm rockin' Chrome Hearts on my pop shit (Chrome Hearts on my pop shit)
Rock this Number (N)ine on my dark shit
Take my shirt off in the mosh pit (yeah, yeah)
Rockin' out at my shows (shows)
Pull out the Daytona and I go (go)
We ridin' down the road slow
Yeah, listenin' to Deftones
Man, these dudes must be tone deaf 'cause they ain't hear they own songs (nah, they own songs)
Watch your tone, bro, 'cause I'm on
Play with me, you could get gone

Yeah, it be gas what I smoke
Pistol what I tote, pistol what I blow (pistol what I blow)
Ain't kissin' no ho on the lips
Get up and put my dick in her throat (dick in her throat)
And we don't do no interviews
Walk up in the section, I just get to go (yeah, I just get to go)
Yeah, we rockin' penthouse views
That's the only way I get up in my zone
