		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend's gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage doing shots
Tip the man he'll ring the bell, get her drunk, she'll scream like hell
Dirty girl, gettin' down, dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, actin' tough,
Mess with her, she'll fuck you up
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned,
But she's comin' back to my place tonight!

She likes to shake her ass
She grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair, when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down
She's naughty 'til the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad bad girlfriend!

Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home
No one really knows if shes drunk or is she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
I say
No one really knows just how far she's going to go
But I'm gonna find out later tonight

She likes to shake her ass
She grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair, when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down
She's naughty 'til the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad bad girlfriend!

Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life
The time of her life
(My girlfriend's a dick magnet)
(My girlfriend's gotta have it)

She's a gold digger
Now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger
Future's finished, there it went, savings gone,
The money spent

I look around and all I see is no good, bad and ugly,
Man she's hot, fixed to be the future ex-Miss Connolly!

She likes to shake her ass
She grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair, when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down
She's naughty 'til the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad bad girlfriend, she's a bad bad girlfriend, she's a bad bad girlfriend
