		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day another post-traumatic order
Brainwashed and feeling fine
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer
So I stabbed a fork in my eye
Think I'm losing my fucking mind
Don't know where to turn, now I'm blind
Destroy yourself it feels so good to fade away
Why, d'you want to hurt yourself?
Die, for something else?
Don't let your conscience get in the way

Obey
We hope you have a lovely day
Obey
You don't want us to come out and play
Away, now now
There's nothing to see here
It's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey
Whatever you do, just don't wake up and smell the corruption

(Do you feel that? Yeah)

Another day, another systematic nightmare
Commemorate a wonderful life
Bite me first, I'll bite you back
Melodramatic laughter
I stabbed a knife in my eye
Think I'm out my fucking mind
Brainwashed and I'm feeling fine
Destroy yourself it feels too good to fade away
Why, do I want to hurt myself?
Should I die for something else?
I let my conscience get in the way

Obey
We hope you have a lovely day
Obey
You don't want us to come out and play
Away, now now
There's nothing to see here
It's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey
Whatever you do, just don't wake up and smell the corruption

When your freedom it's lethal
Tell me how you're going to hurt yourself
You call yourselves peaceful
You monsters are people

You fucking monsters are people

Obey
We're gonna show you how to behave
Obey
It's nicer when you can't see the chains

Obey
We hope you have a lovely day
Obey
You don't want us to come out and play
Away, now now
There's nothing to see here
It's under control (it's under control)
We're only gambling with your soul (with your soul)
Obey
Whatever you do, just don't wake up and smell the corruption

Smell the corruption
Smell the corruption
