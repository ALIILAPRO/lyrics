		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes blue and hollow
As it rains against their will
Feathers falling out of a pillow
As if time's standing still

I can't remember much more
But I know it happened quiet
So quiet

Words falling out through the window
All that remains is a silent call
Is the earth colored red?
As I land like a flower on the meadow
Love is wild

You fell apart
Like a stone can be broken into sand
One thousand pieces
Spread across a crying land

And you can't remember that day
But you know it happened quiet
So quiet

Words falling out through the window
All that remains is a silent call
Is the earth colored red?
As I land like a flower on the meadow
Love is wild

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Are your dreams as dead as they seem?
Are your dreams as dead as they seem?

Don't you speak over my voice
I will return from the shadows
And I'll bleed in your bed
Turn it red
Like the ground outside your window
Love is wild

Love is wild
Love is wild
Love is wild
Love is wild
