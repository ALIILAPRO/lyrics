		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold me
Whoever you are
You're the one I want beside me
When the one I love is far away
cnd hope
Is a relative term
â€˜Cause at the moment 
You're the only hope I've got

Hold me 
This terror will pass
Take a moment to reflect
On our reflection in the glass
cnd who'd have thought
For whatever it's worth
That today would be
Our last day on this earth

Deep breath 
cnd open your eyes
Take a moment to adjust
c little further from the light 
cnd when it's done
Things are never the same
I find a beauty in the shadows
cnd it seems to ease the pain

I would have thought
You were the only one
Who could have known
Who would have pulled me off that ledge
But I was wrong

I'll catch a train 
To a far away place 
Where my troubles can't chase
Where at last I'll feel relief
Pain 
Pain has no face
Chains now replaced
With wings that set me free

Hold me 
Forever more
Take the demons I have fought
cnd settle the score
cnd once it's done
You'll not see me again 
But know wherever I have landed
That my time is at an end

I would have thought
You were the only one
My angel atoned
Carried me safe
Through the unknown.
