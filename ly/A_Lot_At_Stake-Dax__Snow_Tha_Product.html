		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (LexNour)

I kneel, I pray, I stay away
I won't change and I ain't no fake
If you ever cross me better look both ways
I got too much sauce and a lot at stake
I'm ahead my space way out your range
I mute you lames and I talk big game
If you ever cross me better look both ways
I got too much sauce and a lot at stake, yeah

Yeah, New York with my state of mind (state of mind)
Every statue is at liberty to get declined (facts)
I break rules every branch that I will defy
Is governed by the thoughts that you heard through a grapevine
Me and Siri switching lanes to my baselines
Hanging up on bitches throwing pussy for a FaceTime
They say dawgs go to heaven so these niggas out here barking up a tree
I see them sniffing like the K9
Niggas claiming that I don't spit hot shit
I murder beats off top, that's off rip
Six feet is the distance
Your coffin is buried in the place I got crowds doing mosh pits, ah
And I ain't never getting boxed in my three step drop quarterbacks every option, ah
And this is not a TikTok trend, putting in work's the only time that I clock in
Like Billie I'm the bad guy, I lash out on the trash they let pass by
Then I go outside and start rapping
I bet everybody watching think a nigga throwing gang signs

I kneel, I pray, I stay away
I won't change and I ain't no fake
If you ever cross me better look both ways
I got too much sauce and a lot at stake
I'm ahead my space way out your range
I mute you lames and I talk big game
If you ever cross me better look both ways
I got too much sauce and a lot at stake

Yeah, look
Well it's the big bill counting, little bill stripper tipping
Bad bitch with a big plan, got a bigger vision
No time for you, all my time's spent making decisions
I'm the product and the dealer, on a mission for commission
If you ever cross me don't be calling me
People tryna make themselves look better with their apology
Ain't got nothing to do with me, diamonds still on two degrees
Got rid of the leaches, all of a sudden I got jewelry
'Cause all of a sudden I got my bread up, 'cause I got fed up
They used to block me, now it's Versace like I'm Donatella
And now my life is bomb as ever, sweet as Amaretto
I'm hopping out and now the driver holding my umbrella
'Cause it's a snowstorm now and I'ma make it rain
Mexicans gon' always find a way even if it ain't a way
How you gonna try and cross me, you got a bum knee
Cross 'em over, back it up, I hit 'em with the fadeaway

I kneel, I pray, I stay away
I won't change and I ain't no fake
If you ever cross me better look both ways
I got too much sauce and a lot at stake
I'm ahead my space way out your range
I mute you lames and I talk big game
If you ever cross me better look both ways
I got too much sauce and a lot at stake, yeah

(I kneel, I pray, I stay away)
(I won't change and I ain't no fake)
(If you ever cross me better look both ways)
(I got too much sauce and a lot at stake)
