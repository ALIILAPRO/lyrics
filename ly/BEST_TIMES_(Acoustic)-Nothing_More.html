		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the days pass just like that
(When the tide breaks, the waves push back)
And I'm waiting for the feeling, one last dance

(I'm so tired of tearing down)
The people I care about
(My head's got my heart boxed out)
(And the world won't let it beat)

I felt a rush over me
(It's right here but out of reach)
It's bittersweet
How the best times, the best times

They come and go like a dream
(We never know how much they mean)
It's bittersweet
How the best times weren't the best times
(Until they leave)

And the years pass just like that
(And the rain falls when I look back)

Are we better off remembering
(Or forgetting how it used to be?)
Are we ever gonna get this back?
Are we ever gonna get it back?

(I felt a rush over me)
It's right here but out of reach
(It's bittersweet)
How the best times, the best times

(They come and go like a dream)
(We never know how much they mean)
It's bittersweet
How the best times aren't the best times

I'm so tired of tearing down
The people I care about
My head's got my heart boxed out
We ever gonna get it back?
Are we ever gonna get it back?

I felt a rush over me
It's right here but out of reach
It's bittersweet
How the best times, the best times

They come and go like a dream
We never know how much they mean
It's bittersweet, yeah
Yeah, it's bittersweet
When all my life passes by
What's left in my heart
Are the best times (the best times)
