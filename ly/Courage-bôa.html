		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who makes the sun shine so bright
Who makes everything feel all right
You do
Who can change the dark to light
Fight for what you know is all right
You do
You do

Courage
Is the name of the game that I play for
Is the hope that has died that I pray for
Is the one that I know I'll die for
Hopeful
All the things that you said that you took away
And the light that you gave that is turning gray
And the things that I know I'm here for

I am the light
I am the soul
I am the one that is willing to fight for what I know
I am the light
I am the soul
I am the one that is willing to fight for…

Conscience throws the gauntlet down
Makes them see you as a clown
You know you wear the crown
Fortune favours those who try
Holds your heart and gives you time
You will see a way through

Courage
Is the name of the game that I play for
Is the hope that has died that I pray for
Is the one that I know I'll die for
Hopeful
All the things that you said that you took away
And the light that you gave that is turning gray
And the things that I know I'm here for

I am the one
I know the soul
I am the one that is willing to go the way
I am the one
I am the soul
I am the one that is willing to go the way

I am the one
I know the soul
I am the one that is willing to go the way

Courage (I am the light)
Is the name of the game that I play for (I am the soul)
Is the hope that has died that I pray for (I am the one that is willing to fight for what I know)
Is the one that I know I'll die for
Courage (I am the light)
Is the name of the game that I play for (I am the soul)
Is the hope that has died that I pray for (I am the one that is willing to fight for…)
Is the one that I know I'll die for

Courage (I am the light)
Is the name of the game that I play for (I am the soul)
Is the hope that has died that I pray for (I am the one that is willing to go the way)
Is the one that I know I'll die for
