		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we just sit down, have a little conversation?
Yeah, I wanna talk it out 'cause I'm all up in my feelings
I never felt this before and I just wanna feel some more
We used to keep casual
Now I wanna just be yours
Can we sit down, try to have little conversation?

See, you got me all in my head
Every day with you is like the weekend

I try to quit, but truth is I don't want to, yeah
'Cause twenty-four seven I'm thinking about you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you-ooh
You, you, you, you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you-ooh
You, you, you, you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about you

Staring at the clock, how'd I get so damn impatient?
I know you just left but I'm missing you like crazy
I usually don't get this far, always cut 'em off before
My heart gets in too deep
I'ma let you in too deep
Now tell me how's that for a little motivation

See, you got me all in my head
Every day with you is like the weekend

I try to quit, but truth is I don't want to, yeah
'Cause twenty-four seven I'm thinking about you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you-ooh
You, you, you, you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you-ooh (thinking about you, ooh)
You, you, you, you (no)
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about you

Ah, I've been thinking about
I'll still be thinking 'bout you
Thinking about you
About you

See, you got me all in my head
And every day with you is like the weekend

I try to quit, but truth is I don't want to, yeah (I try, I try)
'Cause twenty-four seven I'm thinking about you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you-ooh
You, you, you, you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about
You, you, you, you, you, you, you-ooh
You, you, you, you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about you

You, you, you, you, you, you, you-ooh
You, you, you, you
Twenty-four seven I'm thinking about you
