		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm packing up my suitcase
I'm checking out the set list in my hand
Wonder where the year had gone
And forward, to be back with all the band

Seems so long, forever and a day
Things sure have changed
Can't see how it ever be the same
Whatever comes we'll take it
We go round we'll make it
We go round one more time again 

You get back on the road
You gotta take it slow at first
Remember as you're falling down
You know, you know, you know it's gonna hurt

All be fine, at least for now
Won't change a thing
It ain't a lie, what can I say
I'm living for the moment
I'm living for the moment
Before this precious time just fades away

I can tell you, I gotta say 
There's not a thing I'd change anyway
The greatest picture
Humble pride
Everything behind me now
I've come to realise
It's the smallest things that means the most
Every precious little thing, you hold close
Count the fingers of your hand 
Reach out and you will find them
You will understand

Take a moment, take the time
There'll be an answer in your mind
If you can't find it, there'll be a clue
You'll find that it is staring  
Straight in front of you
