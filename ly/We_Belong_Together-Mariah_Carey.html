		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (we belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me (together)
It's still so hard to believe (come back, come back)
Come back, baby, please (come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life
Baby (my life, my life)

When you left I lost a part of me (together)
It's still so hard to believe (come back, come back)
Come back, baby, please (come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

Baby
When you left I lost a part of me (together)
It's still so hard to believe (come back, come back)
Come back, baby, please (come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together

Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

(Who will?)
(Who will?)
(Who will?)
We belong together
