		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moving west
I lost my breath
I lost my home
Still I got my name
But it isn't the same
In this concrete and chrome
I looked for myself
In somebody else
But I couldn't be found
Now if it's crash
All that I ask is that you lay me down

In the city of angels
Hope that I got a friend
And they're coming to save us
Again

Moving west
You know the rest
You've heard the songs
Promised land
Castles and sand
Reading the palms
Walked desert drifts to try to prod
Manna from some kind of god
I'm hoping some new heaven wanted this new star
But no answer I guess
Or if it was yes
Never knew how to hear

In the city of angels
Hope that I got a friend
And they're coming to save us
Just a matter of when
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the city of angels
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And if it's a crash
All that I ask is that you take me home

To the city of angels
Hope that I got a friend
And they're coming to save us
Just a matter of when
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the city of angels
