		<p>
		  Do do do
La la la

My friend Sally says she knows ya
Got a funny point of view
Says you got away with murder
Maybe one time, maybe two

Something happens in the morning
When I can't see those failing eyes
I can't find a good word for ya
Does it come as a surprise?

I don't think we'd rhyme
I will wear you down in time
I will hurt you, I'll desert you
I am Jackie down the line

Said did Sally 'bout a future
Before you bored of her as well
If all you want is entertainment
If you can't have it you make hell

Don't make no odds for you
To be told, yeah
Don't make no odds for you
To be told, yeah

I don't think we'd rhyme
I will wear you down in time
I will hurt you, I'll desert you
I am Jackie down the line
I don't think we'd rhyme
I will make your secrets mine
I will hate you, I'll debase you
I am Jackie down the line

Do do do
La la la

So come on down to Sally's boneyard
See her spirit in decline
See the handsome mourners crying
They hawked a beating heart for a sturdy spine, yeah

What good is happiness to me
If I've to wield it carefully?
For care I'll always come up short
It's only right

I don't think we'd rhyme
I will wear you down in time
I will hurt you, I'll desert you
I'm one Jackeen of a line
I don't think we'd rhyme
I will take up all your time
I will chew you, I'll go through you
I am Jackie down the line

I don't think we'd rhyme
I will make your secrets mine
I will hate you, I'll debase you
I am Jackie down the line
And I will stone you, I'll alone you
I am Jackie down the line
If I can make you, I can break you
I am Jackie down the line
I am Jackie down the line

Do do do
La la la
