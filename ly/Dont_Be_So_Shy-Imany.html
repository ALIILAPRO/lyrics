		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't be shy

Take a breath

Rest your head
Close your eyes
You're alright
Just lay down
To my side
Do you feel my heat
On your skin?

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right
Take off my clothes
Oh, bless me, Father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right

Hold my stare
I'm in command
Do you feel my hips
In your hands?
And I'm laying down
By your side
I taste the sweet
Of your skin

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right
Take off my clothes
Oh, bless me, Father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right

And my heart just
Race so much faster
I drown myself in your holy water
And both my eyes
Just got so much brighter
And I saw God
Oh, yeah, so much closer
In the dark
I see your smile
Do you feel my heat
On your skin?

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're alright
You're alright
Take off my clothes
Oh, bless me, Father
Don't ask me why
You're alright
You're alright

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're alright
You're alright

Take off my clothes
And bless me father
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
