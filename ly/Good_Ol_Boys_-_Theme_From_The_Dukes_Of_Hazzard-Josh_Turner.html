		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just the good old boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born

Straightenin' the curves, yeah
Flattenin' the hills
Someday the mountain might get 'em
But the law never will

Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow

Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow

Just the good old boys
Wouldn't change if they could
Fightin' the system
Like two modern day Robin Hoods

I'm a good old boy
You know my mama loves me
But she don't understand
They keep a-showin' my hands
And not my face on TV

Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow
You know they're just a little bit more
Than the law will allow
