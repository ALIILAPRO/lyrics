		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna lose myself in this
Spinning out of control
Somewhere on the road to happiness

I got lost
And I paid the cost, yeah

I need another love song, baby, I'm sick
Of waking up with sad songs stuck in my head
I wish I was a young dumb kid again
Gimme a hit of ignorance
And another love song, gimme something
I don't wanna wake up feelin' nothin'
I wish I was a young dumb kid again
Gimme a hit of ignorance
And a double shot of bliss

I really only wrote this song
Hopin' one day you'd be listenin' (yeah)
I've been on my own so long
I could really use a helping hand (yeah)

I got lost
And I paid the cost

I need another love song, baby, I'm sick
Of waking up with sad songs stuck in my head
I wish I was a young dumb kid again
Gimme a hit of ignorance
And another love song, gimme something
I don't wanna wake up feelin' nothin'
I wish I was a young dumb kid again
Gimme a hit of ignorance
And a double shot of bliss

A double shot of bliss

I need another love song, baby, I'm sick
Of waking up with sad songs stuck in my head
I wish I was a young dumb kid again
Gimme a hit of ignorance
And another love song, gimme something
I don't wanna wake up feelin' nothin'
I wish I was a young dumb kid again
Gimme a hit of ignorance
And a double shot of bliss

(All I need is some bliss right now)
A double shot of bliss
(All I need is some bliss right now)
And a double shot of
