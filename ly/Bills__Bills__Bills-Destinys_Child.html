		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for
Things your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity to even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me until
You get your check next week

You trifling
Good for nothing type of brother
Silly me
Why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my cards (cards)
Giving me bad credit buying me gifts with my
Own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But you're steady heading to the mall
Going on shopping sprees perpetrating to your friends that you be balling
And then you use my cell phone (phone)
Calling whoever that you think at home
And then when the bill comes all of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your mama's number's here more than once

You trifling
Good for nothing type of brother
Silly me
Why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills? (Bills)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Bills)
Can you pay my automo-bills? (Bills)
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

You trifling, good for nothing type of brother (good for nothing)
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another? (Found another)
You trifling, good for nothing type of brother (hey)
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another? (Ooh)
You trifling, good for nothing type of brother (oh no no)
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another? (Oh no, no, no, no)
You trifling, good for nothing type of brother (good for nothing)
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another?

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills? (Pay my bills)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Pay my bills)
Can you pay my automo-bills? (Telephone bills)
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (I don't think you do)
So, you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Bills)
Can you pay my automo-bills? (Bill)
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo-bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
