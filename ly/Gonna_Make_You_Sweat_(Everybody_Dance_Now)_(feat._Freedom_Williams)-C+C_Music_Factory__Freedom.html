		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

Give me the music
Give me the music
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Everybody dance now
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Everybody

Here is the dome, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
On the mic with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm, jump, jump to the rhythm, jump
And I'm here to combine
Beats and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys, grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl
It's your world and I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on, say "yeah"
Everybody over here, everybody over there
The crowd is live and I pursue this groove
Party people in the house

Move (let your mind)
Groove (put me on line)

Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

Everybody dance now

Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

Pause, take a breath and go for yours
On my command now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat 'til you bleed
Is that dope enough? Indeed
I paid the price, to control the dice
I'm more precise, to the point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and a whole
Dance till you can't, dance till you can't dance no more
Get on the floor and get raw
Then come back and upside down
Easy now, let me see ya

Move (let your mind)
Groove (put me on line)
The music is my life

Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody

Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
