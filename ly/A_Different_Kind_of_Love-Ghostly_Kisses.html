		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen different kinds of light
In many different people
Through many different signs
 
And on the surface
I've walked away a thousand times
Every time I thought I would do something right
 
I've known a different kind of love
The one you're frightened of
And wish you'd never known
 
But I don't want
To run away without a fight
I thought I would do something right
 
You've built the walls around you
Cause you're so afraid to fail
They seem to almost reach the sun
And far too high to scale
You've built the walls around you
Is it all about them now?
Still you make believe that it's alright
 
I've seen different kinds of light
In many lovers' eyes
As if they fear to shine
 
Below the surface
I've walked the shadows of my mind
Every time I wish I could do something right
 
I've known a different kind of love
The kind that makes you whole
A place where roots have grown
 
And I don't want
To run away into the night
I wish I could do something right
 
You've built the walls around you
Cause you're so afraid to fail
They seem to almost reach the sun
And far too high to scale
You've built the walls around you
Is it all about them now?
Still you make believe that it's alright
 
It's alright
It's alright
