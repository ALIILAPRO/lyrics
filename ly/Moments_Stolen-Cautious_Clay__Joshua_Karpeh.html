		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna listen too closely
To a single word you told me
Every time that you approach me, I feel lost
I don't really know the cost to be
I just really wanna watch movies
I don't wanna tell you that I love you

'Cause I think that loneliness would serve us well
It's all real enough to know that you won't understand me

I'm so afraid of intimacy
There's nothing you could ever show me
Never cared enough to see through all my flaws
I don't ever wanna hear you say
Working together gon' be okay
Hard enough to see these goals don't come true

And I think that loneliness will serve us well
All good enough to know that you won't understand me

'Cause I'm dead set, don't trust in me
Honesty is better when it's practiced
'Cause no love is perfect for me
Don't stress your confidence in subtleties
'Cause no better half can satisfy
A wasted alibi

And I think that loneliness would serve us well
