		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I disappear do you fear for the sister I took?
When I disappear it is clear I am up to no good
I am drearily bloodletting this bed wetting cosmonaut
Son, the last thing you'll realize you need is what you've already got
 
So touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been
 
Please drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait
For I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake
Shimmering under a moon made in anger and haste
Shimmering like a penny out of reach in the subway grate
(You never listen to anything)
 
So touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been
 
Or we could leave it alone
I'm sure there's someone who knows
Where you've been
 
You'll never work well with our group, not with the faults we've found
So we've fixed you with cement galoshes, and no one can save you now
Unless you have friends among fish, there'll still be no air to breathe
You can drink up the entire ocean
We'll still find someone to be everything we know that you'll never be
 
So touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been
 
Or we could leave it alone
I'm sure there's someone who knows
Where you've been
