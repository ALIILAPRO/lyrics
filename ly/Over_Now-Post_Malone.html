		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahahah, yeah

When you leave me, made me jump out of my room
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't ever met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my women for some diamonds and a coupe

When she comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hundred thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfucking bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
Kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Begging on my knees on to the floor
Now I don't even want you anymore, anymore

It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me now, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you and all the hoes

When she comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hundred thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfucking bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
Kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Begging on my knees on to the floor
Now I don't even want you anymore, anymore

It's over now
It's over now
(It's over now)
