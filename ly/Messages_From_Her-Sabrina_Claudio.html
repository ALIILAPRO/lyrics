		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look how you found me
No one else sees this but you, but you
'Cause once you told me
If something's missing in me
To go and find it in you

A piece of me ain't there
'Cause nothing can compare
To life when I was young
That girl inside me stays
If I'm not here for me
She will be there

Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada

Look how you found me
A broken part enough for two
For me and you
Just reminiscence of the best parts of my youth
I wish I was her for good

A piece of me ain't there
'Cause nothing can compare
To life when I was young
That girl inside me stays
If I'm not here for me
She will be there

Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada

Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada
Dadadadadada

Messages from her
Messages to her
Messages from her
Messages to her

Messages from her
Messages to her
If I'm not here for me
She will be

A piece of me ain't there
'Cause nothing can compare
To life when I was young
That girl inside me stays
If I'm not here for me
She will be there

Look how you found me
Searching for messages from you
