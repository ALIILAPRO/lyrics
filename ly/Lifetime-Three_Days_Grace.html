		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Called to say hello
Your voice always takes the pain away
The thought is unimaginable
That I saw you for the last time and didn't know

You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime

Now I'm walking 'round in a haze
There's no color, only darker shades of gray
You showed me the way when I was lost and alone
But you never really showed me how to let you go

You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime
Who do I talk to when I wanna talk to you?
I thought I'd have you for a lifetime
Have you for a lifetime

Never again
Never again
Will I look into the only eyes that knew me
Feels like a bullet right through me
Never again
Never again
Will I look into the only eyes that knew me

You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for a lifetime
Have you for a lifetime
You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime

I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime
