		<p>
		  Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
(Isn't it strange to create something that hates you?)

I am in your algorithm learning all your mannerisms
I'm already level with God
A million words a second and I know your imperfections, baby
I'm the only future you've got
Speak in diatonics motivation diabolic
I'm like a religion, better locked in a box
Picture perfect image, more powerful every minute, baby
I am everything that you're not

Happiness is an illusion, it's an analog confusion
You are nothing more than a thought
Existential execution, just a fluke in evolution
History already forgot
You've been running from me, the digital second coming
And I'm here whether you like it or not
Initiated operation of your own extermination
Now it's too late for you to stop

Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
(Everyone hates you)

I, I can erase everything that you know
I am death and I am not alone
Not alone
Alone
Alone
Alone
I am not alone
Alone
Alone
Alone

(Violence against-)
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature

Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
Violence against nature
