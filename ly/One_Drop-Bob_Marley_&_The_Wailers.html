		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  O-ooh, yea-ah, Wo-yoy! Wo-yoy! Wo-yoy! Wo-yoy-yoy-yoy!
Feel it in the one drop
And we'll still find time to rap
We're makin' the one stop,
The generation gap
Now feel this drumbeat
As it beats within,
Playin' a riddim,
Resisting against the system, ooh-wee!

I know Jah's never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
(I know Jah would never let us down)
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
They made their world so hard (so hard)
Every day we got to keep on fighting (fighting)
They made their world so hard (so hard)
Every day the people are dyin' (dying), yeah!
(Dread, dread) For hunger (dread, dread) and starvation (dread, dread)
Lamentation (dread dread)
But read it in Revelation (dread, dread, dread, dread)
You'll find your redemption
And then you give us the teachings of his majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy
A you forgive us the teachings of his majesty
A we no want no devil philosophy

Feel it in the one drop
And we still find time to rap
We're making the one stop
And we filling the gap
So feel this drumbeat
As it beats within
Playing a riddim, uh!
Fighting against ism and skism

Singing! I know Jah's never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
I know Jah's never let us down
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
They made their world so hard
Every day (we got to keep on fighting), every day
They made their world so hard
Every day (the people are dying), eh!
(Dread, dread, it dread, dread) Oh, whoa! Make dem a-go on so
(It dread on dread) Ah, whoa!
(Dread, dread) I'll walk (it dread, dread)
Ah, whoa! Frighten dem! Ah, whoa! Frighten dem, eh!
Give us the teachings of his majesty with a stick-up!
We no want no devil philosophy, can you hear?
Give us the teachings of his majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy

We feel it in the one drop you're lucky!
For we still got time to rap,
And we're making the one stop
Let me tell ya this generation gap
So feel this drumbeat
I tell you what it's beating within
Feel you heart playing a rythmn
