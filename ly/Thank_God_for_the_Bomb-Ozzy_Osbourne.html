		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like moths to a flame
Is man never gonna change
Time's seen untold aggression
And infliction of pain
If that's the only thing that's
Stopping war

Then thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb

Nuke ya nuke ya

War is just another game
Tailor made for the insane
But make a threat of their
Annihilation
And nobody wants to play
If that's the only thing that
Keeps the peace

Then thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb

Nuke ya nuke ya

Today was tomorrow
Yesterday
It's funny how the time can slip
Away
The face of the doomsday
Clock
Has launched a thousand wars
As we near the final hour
Time is the only foe we have

When war is obsolete
I'll thank god for the war's
To end
But any talk about hell
Freezing over
Is all said with tongue in cheek
Until the day the war drums
Beat no more

Then thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb
Thank god for the bomb

Nuke ya nuke ya
