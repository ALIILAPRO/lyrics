		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world is on fire
Nobody can save me, but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No I-I-I-I-I don't wanna fall in love
(this world is only going to break your heart)
No I-I-I-I-I don't wanna fall in love
(this world is only going to break your heart) with you

What a wicked game to play
to make me feel this way.
What a wicked thing to do
to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
you never felt this way.
What a wicked thing to do
to make me dream of you

No I-I-I-I-I don't wanna fall in love
(this world is only going to break your heart)
No I-I-I-I-I don't wanna fall in love
(this world is only going to break your heart) with you

The world is on fire no one can save me, but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No I-I-I-I-I don't wanna fall in love
(this world is only going to break your heart)
No I-I-I-I-I don't wanna fall in love
(this world is only going to break your heart) with you
