		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I'm sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I'm not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest
I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Ooh, ah (ooh, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're saying on the TV, it's crazy
It's getting hard for them to shock me
But every now and then
It's shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest
I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Ooh, ah (ooh, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yeah
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yeah

And I can't fake another smile (and I can't fake)
And I can't fake like I'm alright (no smile)
Ooh, ah (ooh, ah, ooh)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine (I'm feeling fine)
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile (yeah)
