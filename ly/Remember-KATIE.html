		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Yeah, yeah

We were so automatic
But now I'm reminiscing, falling through the cracks
It was bound to happen
It's funny how it lingers
But I'm not surprised
We were magic

Boy, you had me hypnotized
Under your spell
We were lost in a fantasy
Chasing those memories
It's like I can taste you

I swear to God I still taste you
Remember, I remember
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We make love, love, memorable, memorable
We make love, love, not typical (typical), typical (typical)
Remember, I remember
How many times that we
The time and the place that we
Remember, I remember
I, I remember

You left me no decision
To point the finger at you
You kept on coming back with all your reasons (reasons)
And when it wasn't working
You always gave me something I was needing
Boy, you had me hypnotized
Under your spell
We were lost in a fantasy
Chasing those memories
It's like I can taste you

I swear to God I still taste you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Remember, I remember
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We make love, love, memorable, memorable
We make love, love, not typical (typical), typical (typical)
Remember, I remember
How many times that we
The time and the place that we
Remember, I remember
I, I remember
