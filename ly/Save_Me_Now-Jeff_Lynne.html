		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day the earth woke up, said
Boy I feel half dead
Somebody's turning up the poison
And it's getting in my head
Sometimes I wish my guests 
would move away somewhere
Yes I'm burning up all over
I can't even breathe the air

Save me now, Save me now, Save me now come on and
Save me now, Save me now, Save me now

One day the earth woke up, said
Boy it's getting hot
And remember all those trees I had
Well now there ain't a lot
And my eyes kept slowly trickling
Down to where the party's at
And if everybody's going there well
That's the end of that

Save me now, Save me now, Save me now come on and
Save me now, Save me now, Save me now
