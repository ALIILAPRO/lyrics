		  V1 -
I'm off my rocker
I might be a just little mad
My thoughts they wander
Into a place where there’s no end

Where monsters and shadows decide to reside
There’s creatures who look like they’re dressed in disguise
It’s all in my head but I swear it’s alive
I wonder if I will survive

Pre -
Evils round the corner 
doctors orders that you stay
This dopamine won’t leave you 
it’s your friend to take the pain 

I swear just one more time and 
You’ll be fine to step away
But then they pull you closer 
look right at ya and they say

Hook -
You got some problems
You might be just a little mad
But we can solve ‘em
We know exactly where you stand
Just let us show you where to go 
we don’t take care where you’ve been 
We all got problems
But we can solve ‘em
We all got

V2 -
Issues that I can’t address
Pain keeps pumping through my chest
Heart of black
Made a mess
Here we fucking go again
Reaper is my keeper keeps on telling me to go
I wonder how I’d feel if I just let him take my soul

Pre -
Evils round the corner 
doctors orders that you stay
This dopamine won’t leave you 
it’s your friend to take the pain
 
I swear just one more time and 
You’ll be fine to step away 
But then they pull you closer 
look right at ya and they say

Hook -
You got some problems
You might be just a little mad
But we can solve ‘em
We know exactly where you stand
Just let us show you where to go 
we don’t take care where you’ve been 
We all got problems
But we can solve ‘em
You got some problems
you got some problems

Bridge -
You got some problems
You might be just a little mad
But we can solve ‘em
We know exactly where you stand
Just let us show you where to go 
we don’t take care where you’ve been 
We all got problems
But we can solve ‘em

Hook -
You got some problems
You might be just a little mad
But we can solve ‘em
We know exactly where you stand
Just let us show you where to go 
we don’t take care where you’ve been 
We all got problems
But we can solve ‘em
We all got (problems) 
you got some problems
We all got problems
