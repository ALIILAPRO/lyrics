		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walk in-between
What do I see
Blank-eyed angel
Staring through me

The room filled with stars
On astrology cards
Porcelain figures
Of what used to be

The ghosts that haunt
Were in there with me
I walked to the edge
And all the fear left me

I went to the grass
Searching to hide
The song's clear and
Dazed from my mind

The ghosts that haunt
Were in there with me
I walked to the edge
And all the fear left me

The ghosts that haunt
Were in there with me
I walked to the edge
And all the fear left me

Oh, I saw it
Standing in a sigh
Went through the grass
And there on the edge
All the fear left me

Whoa, I saw it
Standing in a sigh alone
I ran through the grass
And there on the edge
All the fear left me

I ran through the grass
And there on the edge
All the fear left me

I ran through the grass
Jumped off the ledge
All the fear left me
