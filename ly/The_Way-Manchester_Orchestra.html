		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm losin' my mind
Fear became the fentanyl
Hungry like the animal
I've been sleepin' in
I see you're losin' your light
Cut you into decimals
Drownin' out the decibels
Screamin' in your head

Do you wanna find the antidote?
Drivin' with the Holy Ghost
Holy death, the holy smoke
And does it start again?
I've been drinkin' from a periscope
Tryin' to watch my obstacles
See how fully I've been broke

Let me start again
Ooh, ooh
Let me start again
Ooh, ooh

I think I'm losing the line
The altar is inaudible
Dense and pathological
Capillary thread
When you run out of time
The soul becomes synodical
The weight is now phenomenal
And deafening again

Are you feeling like an anecdote?
Hoverin' to the hospital
Huffin' fire and holy smoke
Does it start again?
I've been lost beyond the telescope
Goddamn diabolical
God forgive the prodigal

And let me start again
Ooh, ooh
Let me start again
Ooh, ooh

Now I fall
My way, my way
Now I fall
My way, the way

I think I finally found the antidote
I've been lyin' to Holy Ghost
Holy beds that fully broke
Now let me start again
I've been sinkin' in the horoscope
Love is never optional
Holy death and holy smoke

Let me start again
Ooh
