		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my love, we've had our share of tears
Oh, my friends, we've had our hopes and fears
Oh, my friends, it's been a long hard year

But now it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas

The moon and stars seem awful cold and bright
Let's hope the snow will make this Christmas right
My friends, the world will share this special night

Because it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one night

Thank God it's Christmas, yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Can it be Christmas?
Let it be Christmas
Every day

Oh, my love, we live in troubled days
Oh, my friend, we have the strangest ways
All my friends on this one day of days
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day

Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Ooh, yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, yes, yes, yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day
A very merry Christmas to you all
