		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes wide, tongue tied
I've got the feeling that I'm seeing
Something that I like
Getting lost inside two little limes
I think it's you that makes me smile
I must confess
It brings me happiness

What can I do
When my feelings are in full bloom?

It's seems you invade my thoughts
I had this dream
And you was dancing in your silver shoes
Well, I'm pretty sure it's you
And I've never felt the way I do
There's a million other girls
But they're not you

Well it's absurd
That pretty creatures just like you occur

Was she made to melt you heart?
Was she heaven sent?
Placed on this earth?
To blow my mind apart?
I'm trying to keep sane
But the only thought that goes round my head
Is when will I meet you again?

What can I do
When my feelings are in full bloom?
