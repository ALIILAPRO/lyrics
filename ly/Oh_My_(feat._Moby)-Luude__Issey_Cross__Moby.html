		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get so caught up on this stuff
Overthink everything too much
But when you're on me
Feels like I knew you in my past life (past life)
So anything you want, just put it on me
'Cause I could do this, overdo this all night

I, I don't care where we're going
As long as you are there
I love every emotion
You take me to it, take me right there
You take you to it, take me right there

Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my

Oh, when I feel I'm not enough 
(Not enough, not enough, yeah, ayy)
You show a different kind of love 
(A love, a love, a love, a love)
And when you're on me (on me)
It feels like I knew you in my past life
So anything you want, just put it on me
'Cause I could do this, overdo this all night

I, I don't care where we're going
As long as you are there
I love every emotion
You take me to it, take me right there
You take me to it, take me right there

Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my
Oh oh, oh oh, my

(Take me to it, take me right)
(Take me to it, take me to it)
(Take me to it, take me right)
(Take me to it, take me to it)
