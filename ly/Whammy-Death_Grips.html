		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get off and rid of 'em
I nail the coffin lid on 'em

Whatchu want some don't want none your
Number one is my two dollar whore
So whatchu bought that for?
Why you wanna rock that for?
Come here drop much more
Slow down turbo look down vertigo
Turn around, where'd she go?
Wah tried ta slip alpha bone game
Whammy

Knew you had it comin' grabbed your plum and your gomez
Even though I said don't go there, that's ho flair
Don't be a bitch and you know that's not even on the low, can't see check the Kodak
Who me yeah you feel me climbin out your stomach
Gettin queasy, easy does it, can't help yourself suck it
Whammy

I get off and rid of 'em
I nail the coffin lid on 'em

Collar popper holler but all I hear's nada
All this talk about dollars need ta stop real quick
Real shit ain't Prada you lost it, you slipped
Musta forgot who dis
Whammy
You're reaction I-man the cause
I'm buyin' land and gun while you're at the mall
Big man is small man wit' a tall can of flaws
You're head in my hand my hand in my
Whammy
