		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been runnin' my mouth around the corner
Chasin' it down the street
I cash in my words like I'm a billionaire
But I don't have food to eat
And I keep talkin' like I'm taller than the trees
But my eyes never see much higher than five feet
And I keep on tellin' everyone the truth
But maybe that's not the move
And everyone wants to hear a strong opinion
If it's the same as you
And they say honesty is the best policy
If that were true, don't think all of my friends would hate me

Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch
Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch

There was a time, this guy, he tried to tell me
"Men can cheat, women can't"
Then he proceeded to ask me out on a date
And I fuckin' laughed
If you're a woman, you were made to pleasure me
But out in public, hide them shoulders underneath

Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch
Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch

(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I'm that motherfuckin' bitch
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
You should be suckin' on my clit
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I said, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a bitch
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I dare you, stop me

Society is suckin' on your dick (on your dick)
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch)
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch
Society is suckin' on your dick (on your dick)
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch)
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch

(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
Watch me
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I said, I'll be that bitch
So stop me

Well, that song's done
Song's done, you're done
Fuck! Fuck!
Oh my god! A banger!
