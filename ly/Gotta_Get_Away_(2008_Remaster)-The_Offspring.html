		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Getting edgy all the time
There's someone around, me just a step behind
It's kinda scary, the shape I'm in
The walls are shakin' and they're closing in

Too fast or a bit too slow
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
And lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

Tell you something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends, they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped

If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
Being followed, look around
It's only my shadow creepin' on the ground

Sitting on the bed
And lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me
I gotta get away from me
I gotta get away from me

Sitting on the bed
And lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me
I gotta get away from me
I gotta get away from me
I gotta get away from me
