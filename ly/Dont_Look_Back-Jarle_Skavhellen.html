		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's take a walk
Drifting on the soundwaves
Let's get lost
Let's get drunk
Sitting on the sidewalk
Singing in the dark

Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no

Let's grow old
Reading books together
Cross-legged on the porch
Leave it all behind
And get swept up by currents of young love

Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no

Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
Don't look back now
Honey, no
