		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance)
(I don't wanna talk no more)

Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

We kissed in the morning on a summer day
You taste like cigarettes and hurricanes
There's a warning written in the corners of your face
Whiplash and you left me in a vapor trail

Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

(You say) you fell in love but you don't know how
We were good once but I'm fucked up now
(You say) I was done tryna work things out
I built the house and you burned it down

Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop 'til I forget what we had

Just a minute now, there's something different now
All your moaning sounds, how's it all so loud?
Put the flowers down 'cause they look like clowns
Leave me to it then and let your hair grow out

Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop 'til I forget what we had

(You say) you fell in love but you don't know how
We were good once but I'm fucked up now
(You say) I was done tryna work things out
I built the house and you burned it down

Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop 'til I forget what we had

Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop 'til I forget what we had

You fell in love but you don't know how
We were good once but I'm fucked up now
