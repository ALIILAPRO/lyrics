		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't try to tell me that my intentions are untrue
My eyes like butterflies you caught 'em and they're open wide
Clouded and hazy future clear whenever I'm with you
Just think of all the things we could do to pass the time
It's a walk in the park, it goes

Na na na, na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na na na na

Cuz everybody's got a little pieces of someone they hide
It's okay, it's the way we distract until the day that we die
And though our future's gone uncertain, it's gonna be alright
'Cause though I'm leaving longing leaves me ever by your side

And all our time together is tearing me apart
I can't hold you tomorrow but I hold you in my heart
And all our time together is tearing me apart
I can't hold out forever, but I hold you in my heart

Don't try to tell me that my intentions are untrue
Don't even bother tryin' to tell me 'cause you live a lie
'Cause a moment or a minute I can see it through
And have a precious little second of you by my side, it goes

Na na na, na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na na na na

And our future's lookin bright
In all the little pieces of the people that we keep inside
'Cause you can do-make-say-think-laugh-sink-drink all night
All the little visions all the little moments that we keep inside

And all our time together is tearing me apart
I can't hold you tomorrow but I hold you in my heart
And all our time together is tearing me apart
I can't hold out forever, but I hold you in my heart
