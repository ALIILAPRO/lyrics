		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She is falling into the dark
She's sinking
in a pit of despair
Aurora Borealis wrapped
around her
Gradually the colors fade
But the story had only begun
She's about to pull the trigger
Sleeping pills eliminate cells
and slowly paralyze the body
Memories burned on the eyes ooze
from the brain stem
What she saw in the deep forest
was the burning sunset
Your face dimmed
Her sight and vision fade away
"I was tired of living"
So said a letter written
with her blood
Too late to come back anymore
Regret begins and then
The curtain falls
Solace song by Mary
A soul that was thrown out
to the dead end of a universe
Never cut off destiny
There is no curtain call
in life and death
It's the end
when you make your final bow

Is it painful to be alive?
Is your life full of nothing
but sadness?
Why do the bruises ache so much?
Why were we born, why do we die?
So many tribulations and trials,
why is this our universe?
Tell me if you can
Lord
Solace song by Mary
A soul that was thrown out
to the dead end of a universe
Never cut off destiny
There is no curtain call
in life and death
It's the end
when you make your final bow
For the young
Death will never save you,
it's no lie
No matter what happens,
don't turn and run away
Even if the road you travel is
sometimes steep and full of pain
Crime and punishment
So live
