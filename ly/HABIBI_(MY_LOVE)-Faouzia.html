		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya habibi
All the diamonds in the world couldn't faze me
They don't shine as bright as you
All I want, all I want is you, ah
Ya habibi
All the riches and the pearls don't amaze me
Couldn't buy me a love like you
All I want, all I want is you, ah

Oh, my love, what you worried for?
You got all my trust, all my love
All my, all my
Oh, my heart, your forevermore
You got all my days, all my nights
All my, all my

If you got doubts in your mind
About you and I
Know I'm not going nowhere

Ya habibi
All the diamonds in the world couldn't faze me
They don't shine as bright as you
All I want, all I want is you, ah
Ya habibi
All the riches and the pearls don't amaze me
Couldn't buy me a love like you
All I want, all I want is you, ah

Oh, oh
My la-la-la-la, la-la-la love

You're mine
I would never waste your time
If you ever said goodbye
My mascara tears, they would fall for years, oh

If you got doubts in your mind
About you and I
Know I'm not going nowhere

Ya habibi
All the diamonds in the world couldn't faze me
They don't shine as bright as you
All I want, all I want is you, ah
Ya habibi
All the riches and the pearls don't amaze me
Couldn't buy me a love like you
All I want, all I want is you, ah

Oh, oh
My la-la-la-la, la-la-la love
Oh, oh
My la-la-la-la, la-la-la love
