		  Whatcha gonna do with all that junk
All that junk inside your trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
'Cause of my hump (hump), my hump, my hump, my hump (what?)
My hump, my hump (uh), my hump, my lovely little lumps
Check it out

I drive these brothers crazy
I do it on the daily
They treat me really nicely
They buy me all these iceys
Dolce & Gabbana
Fendi and that Donna
Karan they be sharin'
All their money got me wearing fly
Gear but I ain't askin'
They say they love my ass in
Seven Jeans, True religion
I say no but they keep givin'
So I keep on takin'
And no I ain't taken
We can keep on datin'
Now keep on demonstratin'

My love (love), my love, my love, my love (love)
You love my lady lumps (love)
My hump, my hump, my hump (love)
My humps they got you

She's got me spending
Spending all your money on me
And spending time on me
She's got me spending
Oh, spending all your money on me
On-on me, on me

Whatcha gonna do with all that junk
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
Whatcha gonna do with all that ass
All that ass inside them jeans?
I'ma make, make, make, make you scream
Make you scream, make you scream
'Cause of my hump (hump), my hump, my hump, my hump (what?)
My lovely lady lumps (hump), in the back and in the front (what?)

Girl let's keep a trip to the disco
Yeah, let's go
We could get freak deaky on the dancefloor
I'll dip you low
You could take a sip of my coco
Sip it slow
Sip it real slow
Sip it real slow

They say I'm really sexy
The boys they wanna sex me
They always standin' next to me
Always dancin' next to me
Tryin' a feel my hump, hump
Lookin' at my lump, lump
You can look but you can't touch it
If you touch it
I'ma start some drama
You don't want no drama
No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama
So don't pull on my hand, boy
You ain't my man, boy
I'm just tryin' a dance, boy
And move my hump

My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My lovely lady lumps (lump)
My lovely lady lumps (lump)
My lovely lady lumps (lump)
In the back and in the front (lump)
My loving got you

She's got me spending
Spending all your money on me
And spending time on me
She's got me spending
Spending all your money on me
On-on me, on me

Whatcha gonna do with all that junk
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
Whatcha gonna do with all that ass
All that ass inside them jeans?
I'ma make, make, make, make you scream
Make you scream, make you scream
