		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

And it's making me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
And when will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home
Just go home

I can see your face, yes
But I know that it ain't real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it's making me so angry
I know now that the flame will always burn
It will always burn
I can't get, gonna get over?
And when will I ever learn, ever learn?

Old love, old love
leave me alone
Old love, old love
Just go on home

Old love
Just go on home, go on home

Old love
Old love
Old love
Old love
Old love
Old love
Old love
