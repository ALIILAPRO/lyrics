		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're not alone, I'm awake
And I've been missing you
I remember it well
Shout out the lesson, 
If I can lay here and just think about you
Don't wanna dream again tonight

Oh oh oh, I'll just lay here and wait
For the first light of the day
Oh oh oh, you're the sun that I crave
You're the first light of the day

You're not alone, I'm awake
And I've been thinking of you
I wanna hold on to you right
I wanna see whatever you see
When you open your eyes
I wanna be right by your side

Oh oh oh, I'll just lay here and wait
For the first light of the day
Oh oh oh, you're the sun that I crave
You're the first light of the day

You're not alone 
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

You're not alone 
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
I'll go wherever you need me to go
You're not alone
You're not alone
No I won't leave you now
I always be around
No I won't leave you now
I always be around
You're not alone
You're not alone
