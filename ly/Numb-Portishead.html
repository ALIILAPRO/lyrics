		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit

'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I am still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy

'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel
But this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no

I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breathe this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear

'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness
Just won't leave me alone

A lady of woe
A lady of woe
