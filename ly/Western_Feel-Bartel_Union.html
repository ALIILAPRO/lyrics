		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't dance with the devil
Don't dance with the devil

Daddy went out west, somewhere in California
Never came back, mama said "I warned you"
Out that way that way, they do it real sly
Think about it Son, they never, age never die

Well, I'm happy as can be, got everything I need
Was never gonna leave, old middle Tennessee
Then one day a sweetheart in a bright red car
Pulled into town like a shooting blonde rock star

She had the western feel
Knocks me back on my heels
Playin' my heart like a pedal steel
Her kiss is red hot like Bakersfield
Hypnotized by that western feel

She'll catfish all night by a big bonfire
Sleeps all day, an L.A. Vampire
Then she'll dance in a club like a demon on drugs
She don't take nothing, it's something in her blood

She bumps her tunes on a tricked out system
I tried to walk away then couldn't help but listen
You listen too long you fall in love then you lose it
Mama started yellin' "Turn off that devil music"

It has that western feel
Knocks me back on my heels
Playin' my heart like a pedal steel
Her kiss is red hot like Bakersfield
Hypnotized by that western feel

Don't dance with the devil
Don't dance with the devil

Showed up one night with a big wedding ring
Said, "We're going out to Vegas, you're gonna marry me"
So I did what she said now I wear a black Stetson
My days at the sports book putting all my bets in

Waitin' on my girl to wake up
So we can go out on the town
In a wicked dark club

She haa that western feel
And her body's surreal, stole my heart
Locked it up in steel
I can't go home, made a devils deal
Hypnotized by that western feel

She's got that western feel
Knocks me back on my heels
Playin' my heart like a pedal steel
Her kiss is red hot like Bakersfield (don't dance with the devil)
Hypnotized by that western feel (don't dance with the devil)

Don't dance with the devil, oh no
Don't dance with the devil, mm don't
