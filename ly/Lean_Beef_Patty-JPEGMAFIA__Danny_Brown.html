		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (In the morning) maybe we could start a family 
(I wanna see your pretty face, yeah)
Someone that truly understands how to treat a man (oh yeah, oh yeah)
This is what I need

First off, fuck Elon Musk
Eight dollars too much, bitch, that's expensive (true)
For the hoes in the back and the crackers in they slacks
If I tweet then delete then I meant it (uh)
I don't really need a check 'cause I got enough respect
And these niggas bitin' on me like a dentist (uh-huh)
Said he all about free speech
'til he hear some shit and then get offended (uh, let's go)
This ain't what you want (let's go), no, this ain't what you want
Uh, fuck y'all niggas, I feel like Papa John (insane)
Laughin' straight to the bank, I'm Tony Khan (Khan)
And they hate what I say 'cause I ain't wrong
What kind of rappin' is this? 
The kind that make rap niggas pissed, you know it
I put a thumb in my bitch, that pussy gettin' beat up like Gibbs, she know it
These niggas be textin' with kids
It doesn't get stranger than this, that's ho shit
Fuck a bar, I don't fuck with you niggas like I'm Hulk Hogan (wait)
I am me
Rittenhouse with the shot and repeat
While you stretchin' the truth in your tweets
I been stretchin' your girl, Iron Sheik
What's the deets?
In the crib, drinkin' Soylent for weeks (for weeks)
Watch your energy, watch what you tweet
You can go from Elon to Ye in a week, buddy (buddy, buddy, buddy)

Numb myself with that antidote
Blackout, can't think no more
So ain't no way we 'bout to take this slow
In that never seen before
Behind the scenes, on that cuttin' room floor
Smokin' on that, don't need no more
So let me tell you where we gon' go
To a place you won't ever wan' leave
You ain't gotta lie, hit this anarchy
In your head, girl, I'm rent-free
She can't stop thinkin' 'bout me
So drop it low, like you're pickin' up change
Gon' 'head, girl, do your thing
So what's up with that "what's up"?
Spittin' fast like Busta
Do I need to trust ya
To feel like I love ya?
