		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't even speak no more
We don't even speak no more
I just wanna know how you're doin'
I just wanna know how you are

Jamie
Do you still love me?
Jamie
Why'd you come and leave?

When I say, "I love ya," please know I do
When I say, "I love ya," just know it's true
When I say, "I love ya," please know I do
When I say, "I love ya," just know it's true

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ahh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

Jamie
The best thing that's happened to me
At least that's what I think
Gon' let it go, gon' let it go

It's just like that same thing, like
You know, you can love someone so much that
It's to the point of like destroying your own self
Like, you're so selfless and you're so
Like, you care for them so much that you realize 
You're being a detriment to your own self
And it's like, is this healthy?
Is it healthy to like, love this much?
