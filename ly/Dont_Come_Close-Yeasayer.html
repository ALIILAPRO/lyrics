		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't come close
I don't want you to see my face, my face
You go away I work so hard
I don't have time, to start all over
I like to be
Living with out feeling bad
Leaving you the knowledge that most
Most people would release you most, most
People don't change they only get old
So, if I let you back in close
Will you hurt me

In all your life
You'll never live down what you can't forget
So forget it
Flicking away them gnats and flies
Bringing disease to the surface
Our child must be sharper than your average man
Tell me, honey, what's the plan?

Most, most people would release you
Most, most people don't change
They only get old
So, if I let you back in close
Will you hurt me?

Don't come close, she said
I'd never stoop so low

I'm gonna need some telling me you want me
I can't hear you so take some time to think about it

Most (I'm gonna need some telling me you want me)
Most, people would release you
Most (I can't hear you so take some time to think about it)
Most people don't change
They only get old
(I'm gonna need some telling me you want me)
So, if i let you back in close
(I can't hear you so take some time to think about it)
Will you hurt me?
