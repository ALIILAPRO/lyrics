		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sum presentialiter
Absens in remota
Moonlight sonata, beyond the graves
Sailing through the valley of my death
Tears drenched in the misery of life
And I wish I could've followed thy steps
My kiss sweeps the ashes of your eyes
As the blade is taking my last breath
When demons are stealing my remains
Will I burn along with my repentance?
Remember your homeland when light is gone
While I'll wait for the day we'll love again
Will you mourn my soul before the gods
Will you pay the rower for one last tide?
But I see your lips closed in ruefulness
As we take the oath of darken crown
Forever lost, ablaze in hatred
For I've sinned in the eyes of the goddess
Now a price shall be paid for another day
I curse the hand that took you away
Shards of love of the wandering path
Last of my kind, am I first to be gone?
And I see your arms closed in despair
As we swear the oath of darken crown
Forever lost, ablaze in hatred
For I've sinned in the eyes of the goddess
What price shall be paid for another day
To curse the hand that took you away
