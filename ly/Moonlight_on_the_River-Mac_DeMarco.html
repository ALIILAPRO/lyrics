		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd say, "See you later"
If I thought I'd see you later
And I'd tell ya, that I loved ya
If I did
It's so strange deciding
How to feel about it
It's such strange emotion
Standing there beside it

I'm home
With moonlight on the river
Saying my goodbyes
Home
There's moonlight on the river
Everybody dies

I'd say, "See you next time"
If I thought there were a next time
Easy conversation
Ain't exactly where we're at
It's so strange deciding
How I feel about you
It ain't like I ain't used
To going on without you

I'm home
With moonlight on the river
Saying my goodbyes
Home
There's moonlight on the river
Everybody dies
Home
With moonlight on the river
Saying my goodbyes
I'm home
There's moonlight on the river
Everybody dies
