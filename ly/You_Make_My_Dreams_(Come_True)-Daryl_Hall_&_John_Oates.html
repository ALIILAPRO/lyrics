		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah yeah

What I've got's full stock 
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Then you pull them all together
And how, I can't explain
Oh yeah, well well you
You make my dreams come true
Well well well you, oh yeah
You make my dreams come true

Well, yeah

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with a dreamer
I can laugh it in the face

Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same, oh yeah

Well 'cause you
You make my dreams come true, oh yeah
Well well well you, ooh ooh
You make my dreams come true, whoa yeah

Well listen to this, oh

I'm down on my daydream
Oh that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know
Well you, yeah yeah you make my dreams come true, oh yeah
I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl, oh yeah
You make my dreams come true
Make, you make, you make
I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl
For life
You make my dreams come true, oh whoa whoa
I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
(You make my dreams)

I've been waiting for you girl
(You make my dreams)
