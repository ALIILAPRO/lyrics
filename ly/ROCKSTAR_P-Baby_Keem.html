		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talkin' to a model, can you get one? Don't ask that
Fuckin' on a bitch with a six pack
No cap, bro, be regular, don't act ho
I got my mans on the side though
I'ma get the pussy, put it in, I'ma slide through
Then I'ma hide you 'cause I really like you
If my homies see, they gon' wanna go inside you

I don't give advice
I just tell her when to come through and stay the night (okay)
I'm never fearful
I'm baby keem, what the fuck I'ma fear, ho?
Put the plan in motion, switchin' gears
I got another bitch on park, have a good year
I just bought her some gas, she think santa here
Little nigga, talk nice to me, you in a cavalier (uh)

Talkin' to a model, can you get one? Don't ask that
Fuckin' on a bitch with a six pack
No cap, bro, be regular, don't act ho
I got my mans on the side though
I'ma get the pussy, put it in, I'ma slide through
Then I'ma hide you 'cause I really like you
If my homies see, they gon' wanna go inside you

I need some jimmys
Swerve, goin' left on a ten speed
Why you always actin' flimsy?
My old hoes don't feed me (no)
Spendin' all that time on the phone
Goin' back and forth with you, bitch, that ain't goals
X-men and opp, he a big nerd
Tax him extra if he come to my show (let's go)
She got rock star pussy, she don't get cold
She got rock star pussy, she don't get old
Bitch tall, put tissues in my insoles
Got a big rock band, that's official
I'm on a hill, ain't no comin' residential
I double back every time I'm sentimental
I'm top five in your phone when I miss you
I'm not a hater, I got too many
I ain't a type that other niggas envy
If your bitch friend zone me, I get friendly
Supposed to be a one night stand, I'm fuckin' on her plenty

Talkin' to a model, can you get one? Don't ask that
Fuckin' on a bitch with a six pack
No cap, bro, be regular, don't act ho
I got my mans on the side though
I'ma get the pussy, put it in, I'ma slide through
Then I'ma hide you 'cause I really like you
If my homies see, they gon' wanna go inside you
