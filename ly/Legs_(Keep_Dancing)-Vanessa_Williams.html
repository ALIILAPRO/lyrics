		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh

I'm still here, still standing, still kicking
In fact, I'm the best I've ever been (uh)
Who sets a limit when we all fall apart?
I'm 'bout to give 'em hell again

So say what you say
Expect me to fade
I don't think about it
I don't think about it
I got work left to do
And I'm not close to through
Not while I still got these legs

They say the legs are the last to go
I'ma keep dancing
I'm still putting on the show
I'ma keep dancing
'Til I can't do it no more
I go where they take me
'Cause the legs are the last thing, so
I'ma keep dancing

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

My time is managed doing much better things
Than tryna prove myself to you
So time was standing
If I gotta sing, you're gonna find me dancing too

So I made up my mind
When the world is unkind
I don't think about it
I just don't think about it
So here's what I do
I step in these shoes
And then I use these legs of mine

They say the legs are the last to go
I'ma keep dancing
I'm still putting on the show
I'ma keep dancing
'Til I can't do it no more
I go where they take me
'Cause the legs are the last thing, so
I'ma keep dancing

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh (uh-uh-uh-uh)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh (oh, ooh)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh (yeah, yeah)
I go where they take me
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

They might take me to Paris, it's alright
If it's Atlanta, San Francisco same night
If it's New York down to LA
I found there's only one thing left to say
Watch these legs

They say the legs are the last to go
I'ma keep dancing
I'm still putting on the show
I'ma keep dancing
'Til I can't do it no more
I go where they take me
'Cause the legs are the last thing, so
I'ma keep dancing

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh (hey, uh, come on)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

'Til I can't do it no more
I go where they take me (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
'Cause the legs are the last thing, so
I'ma keep dancing (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
