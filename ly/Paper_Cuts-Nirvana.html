		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At my feeding time
She'd push food through the door
I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down

The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twist and masturbate

Why? I said so
I said so
I said so
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana

Black windows of paint
I scratch with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point at my way
They come with their flashing lights
And take my family away

And very later I have learned to
Accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you

To take you me with
Your life
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana
