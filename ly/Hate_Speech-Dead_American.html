		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't count the times I felt this way about you, and I don't think that it will change
I know we're not at all like one another and tell me, how does it feel to know you offer nothing?
You should use your head, think a little bit
I guess God didn't give you common sense
I think maybe, if you did have some, you would learn to live
Fuck your bullshit, go find some common sense
Do you even hear the words as they're leaving your mouth, digging you into a hole you won't get out of?
You can't seem to get out of your own way
Tell me how does it feel to know you offer nothing
Just call it hate speech
Don't just call it hate
Don't just call it hate speech
You just call it hate

Just call it hate speech 
We don't like what you say
We don't think we agree with you
