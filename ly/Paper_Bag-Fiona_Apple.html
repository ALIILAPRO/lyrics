		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was staring at the sky
Just looking for a star
To pray on or wish on or something like that
I was having a sweet fix
Of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment 
That my chances were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near
So did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bag

Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up
I've got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love

And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb
Looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine
A fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said "honey, I don't feel so good
Don't feel justified
Come on put a little love here in my void"
He said "it's all in your head"
And I said "so's everything" but he didn't get it
I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy

Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up
I've got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love

Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't want to clean up
I've got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love

Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh it kills
Because I know that I'm a mess he don't want to clean up
I've got to fold 'cause these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts but starving, it works when it costs too much to love
Mm-mm
