		  How you doing?
Oh, shit
I ain't seen you in a long time, girl
Uh huh, party, party
Now wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

Now wait a minute
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city, of L.A.
In the city, of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton 
They're Poplocking, woo

Poplocking in Rolls-Royce, Cadillacs, Lincoln and Mercedes-Benz
Poplocking in Howard Johnson, Sheraton 
Poplocking at the Holiday Inn
Poplocking in Hollywood, it's understood
While listening to the Mac
Poplocking at Broadway, everyday
To the preacher's rag

So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city, of L.A.
In the city, of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton 
They're Poplocking

Dance, dance, disco style
It's all on the West Coast
Living good and playing hard
Cruising the Boulevard
Leaning and feeling
And you won't be dreaming
That's what it's all about

So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
Woo
Lock it up, baby
Woo, ya

Lock them shoulders
Lock them arms
Now lock that neck
You just raise those fingers in the air
I swear it's getting mighty funky out there
There's a party over here
There's a party over there
Can't I get a right on, cuz?
Playboys
That's cool, clean and mean
Can't I get a right on, cuz?
Right on
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here

California knows how to party
California knows how to party

In the city, of L.A.
In the city, of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton 
Woo
They're Poplocking
Poplocking in Rolls-Royce, Cadillacs, Lincoln and Mercedes-Benz
Poplocking in Howard Johnson, Sheraton 
Poplocking at the Holiday Inn
Poplocking in Hollywood, it's understood
While listening to the Mac
Poplocking at Broadway, everyday
To the preacher's rag

So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city, of L.A.
In the city, of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
Woo
They're Poplocking

Dance, dance, disco style
It's all on the West Coast
Living good and playing hard
And cruising the Boulevard
Leaning and feeling
And you won't be dreaming
That's what it's all about
Woo
So rough, so tough, out here, baby 
So rough, so tough, out here, baby 
So rough, so tough, out here, baby 

Shake your booty and bust your soul
Get up, get up
Shake your booty and bust your soul
Get up, get up
Shake your booty and bust your soul (make you wanna scream, make you wanna scream)
Get up, get up
Shake your booty and bust your soul (make you wanna scream, make you wanna scream)
Get up, get up
Shake your booty and bust your soul (make you wanna scream, make you wanna scream)
Get up, get up
