		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will never understand the way you are
Your mind's an evil tod striving for more
Can't you see I can penetrate your lies

I created you but yet you still defy
It doesn't matter how hard I try
A lesson in respect is what you need

You thrive off the weak minded ones
These pour helpless souls that you deceive
Still come back to the security
Under my sleeve

Don't beat around the bush
I know it's a task
I only have one question
Which I must ask

When I was sad and down
You suddenly came around
Like a guiding light
No need for me to fight
I told you everything
Brought me up again

Oh how that all changed
Only you to blame
Manipulative days are through
So bye bye to you

You've opposed me since the birth
Wanting your own little world
Brainwashing them to believe

You're the ruler evil supreme
Mother earth is not your toy
Your evil world I will destroy
You were deprived of your youth
You were deprived of joy
Lonely depressed little boy
