		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in cheap delirium
Searching the neon lights
I move carefully
Sink in the city aquarium
Sing in the key of night
As they're watching me

Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
'Cause lately I've been losing my own

Wrapped in silent elegance
Beautifully broken down
As illusions burst
Too late to learn from experience
Too late to wonder how
To finish first

Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
'Cause lately I've been losing my own

Take me somewhere we can be alone
Make me somewhere I can call a home
Won't you take me home
Won't you take me home
'Cause lately I've been losing my own
Won't you take me home
