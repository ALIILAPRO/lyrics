		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I don't think we can be friends
I don't think that I can even pretend
We used to be such a hit
Now it just feels like a swing and a miss (damn)
You used to think I'm the shit
Sometimes I wish you could meet me again
I know you always believed in the kid
And my music and that I'd succeed and go big
And subsequently I'll be bringing you with
We would get married, and we would be rich
Everything changed, I wasn't the same
Now you think that you believed in a myth
I cannot tell you the reason for this
Summer is coming, I'm facing temptation
Maybe I'm selfish and I think with my dick
Remember we spent all of those nights in my basement

I know that I'm really all that you want
Wish you could say, "This is all that I need"
I know you see right through all of my fronts
I don't know who I've been trying to be
I do not think that's a problem with us
I just think that is a problem with me, me, me
Yeah
I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no
No no, no no
No no (yeah, yeah)
No no, no no

I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be (yeah)
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you
And I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
'Cause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me (gotta be me, gotta be me)
I guess I was never prepared for the truth
Telling myself the decision was right
And to have no regrets 'cause I'm scared that I do

Oh-oh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
Oh-oh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like

Yeah, and now we're just stuck in the grayest of areas
Thinking back to when I'd say I would marry you
Thinking back to all of them days I would stare at you
Thinking back when you'd be drunk at a party
And I was right there, I'd be taking good care of you
I still remember the first time I saw you
And I do not think there was a way of preparing us
For the inevitable, that's how it seems
When you go to college and I chase a dream
Eventually you'll find a man of integrity
Someone that's better you think I could never be, uh
Prolly a guy with some muscles
The type that be smoking and drinking that liquor
Prolly a guy with a beard
Prolly a fella who's penis is bigger

I gotta get myself focused again
Sometimes it feels like you're all that I know
I know you think we should only be friends
'Cause it might just help us to soften the blow
But I don't think that I can even pretend
I do not think that I'll have that control
(Yeah) I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no
No no, no no
No no
No no, no no

I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be (yeah)
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you
And I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
'Cause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me (gotta be me, gotta be me)
I guess I was never prepared for the truth
Telling myself the decision was right
And to have no regrets 'cause I'm scared that I do

Oh-oh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
Oh-oh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
