		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in a room with my guitar
I'm tryna prove that I'm a star
But I hate when we keep distance 
'Cause it's a difference with response
Keep it natural the first date, we gon' watch Tubi in the car
Ask me what's my motivation, I say, "The trenches", she say, "Why?"

I was takin' off prescriptions of them drugs
I wanna ask for your permission, don't judge
Before you ever get a job, get a gun
Gotta hit a thousand girls before you fall in love
Gotta say you're older just to get inside the club
Inside the house starvin', went to school to get lunch
Had to dress for funerals before I ever dressed for prom
Had to dress for funerals before I ever dressed for prom

Accept me please, accept me for me
Don't judge me on my past life, no
I want you to believe

All type of girls be on my line, but I ain't chasin' them though
We always around our friends, let's take vacations alone
Your last boyfriend wasn't fun, he had you stayin' at home
And I know that you was mad 'cause you was stayin' alone
For example, his friends came over, he made you stay in the room
For example, just think you with me when you stare at the moon
See your life is a scary movie,I can hold you in my arms
Can't cover your face with the makeup, I know who you are
Don't get your titties and ass done, I like who you are
It make you so insecure about whoever you are

I was takin' off prescriptions of them drugs
I wanna ask for your permission, don't judge
Before you ever get a job, get a gun
Gotta hit a thousand girls before you fall in love

Accept me please, accept me for me
Don't judge me on my past life, no
I want you to believe

I'm just tryna tell you who we are (are)
I'm just tryna tell you who we are (are)
I'm just tryna tell you who we are (are)
I'm just tryna tell you who we are

Mmh, who we are
Telling all your girlfriends that I'm your star
Caught you in a dream, I hit you with that sauce
If we aim at the moon, no, baby, we won't fall
She said she miss that feeling
A real nigga that is so appealin'
Keep it low, baby, I'm not leavin'
Soakin' up your glow, we take it slow
If there's problems, I'll solve 'em, no lie
You never had a nigga catchin' all the signs
It's time, babe, lost in the lights
Everywhere I'm at with you I'm fine (you)
It's easy, baby (baby), give me the honey, honey (huh, huh)
She fuckin' with the alien, she know it, know it (yeah, yeah)
Now watch me handle it, she threw it back, I'm diggin' in that
I give you what you want and more some more
Now, girl, that's a bet

Ohh
Said she never wanna come down (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
She want that magic (yeah-yeah), kinda like a drug (come on)
She want that magic (yeah-yeah), gotta get that love, love
