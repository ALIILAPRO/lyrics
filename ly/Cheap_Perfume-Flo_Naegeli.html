		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  getting out here
you by my side
getting lost 
we take a ride

found where we belong to
found to where we belong to


you caught me crying
on the roof that night
I find it hard
to say goodbye 

Found where we belong to 
Found where we belong to


Chorus:
woho yeah yeah
smelling cheap perfume at night
gotta think about you 
and all i do is start to cry

woho yeah yeah
seeing your face in the line
gotta think about you 
and all i do is start to cry

Vers2:

getting over 
still way too young

should have called but
I bit my tongue

found where I belong to
finally found where I belong to 


never thought I 
needed anyone

you rolled me over
you never wanted to sing my songs

found where we belong to
finally found where we belong to
