		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Johnny, my baby, tell me all the details for tomorrow
Johnny, my baby's hands, they grip my fingers when they're cold
He could be the one to make me never freeze again, because
No one is as romantic as him, I want you to know

Everyone tells me life was hard, but it's a piece of cake
Even if Johnny hasn't answered in a couple days (let's go)
You won't check your phone, so you can't tell me you're okay, because
Johnny, my baby, did it always have to end this way?

'Cause one day
One day, my baby just went away
My angel
You're what haunts me now that you're away

Everyone tells me life was hard, but it's a piece of cake
Even if Johnny hasn't answered in a couple days
You won't check your phone so you can't tell me you're okay, because
Johnny, my baby, did it always have to end this way?

'Cause one day
One day, my baby just went away
My angel
You're what haunts me now that you're away

(My angel)
(You're what haunts me now that you're away)
