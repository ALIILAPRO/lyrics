		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Held down, you've held me down too long
Push me back on the ground, now it's my time to right your wrong
Shut up, this is my turn now
You're just the hypocrite that's always tried to put me down

Take, take, take from me, that's all you ever do
You've taken everything, now I'm taking part of you
Run, run, run from me, it's too bad you can't see
I've got you in my sights and I'm ready to unleash

I'll take time to breath

Now, now that I see
I've lost so many battles from wars that you waged on me,
But this is the moment, it's time you know it
I'm gonna make you my enemy

Laid out, placed right in front of you
But you're a parasite and I'm the host you latched on to
The fire you set, left ashes surrounding
The world that I knew, you left burning around me

Wait, wait, wait you'll see, you've been so damn naive
You think you run the show, but I have to disagree
Break, break break you down Go ahead take off your crown
It's time to lose control, like a fucking animal

Now, now that I see
I've lost so many battles from wars that you waged on me,
But this is the moment, it's time you know it
I'm gonna make you my enemy

Listen your worthless, let me make this clear
I'm done with betrayal, I'm done with the fear
You had the cards, but now it's time to fold
Now hear out these words, and do what you're told
Do what you're told Do what you're fucking told

Now, now that I see
I've lost so many battles from all that you did to me,
But this is the moment, it's time you know it
I'm gonna make you my enemy

Listen your worthless, let me make this clear
I'm done with betrayal, I'm done with the fear
You had the cards, but now it's time to fold
Now hear out these words, and do what you're told

Now, now that I see
I've lost so many battles from wars that you waged on me,
But this is the moment, it's time you know it
I'm gonna make you my enemy
I'm gonna make you my enemy
