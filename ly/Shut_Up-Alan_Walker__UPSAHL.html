		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're miserable inside your mind (oh my, oh my)
Been dancing circles 'round your eyes (oh my, oh my)
You're stepping on the dreams of everyone you meet
Does stooping this low get you high?

Why don't you just shut up
I'm telling you we've had enough of
You and all your bullshit
We've heard it all before
Why don't you just shut up
I know you got to come but so what?
Won't catch you on the fall 'cause
You can't hurt us anymore

Why don't you just
Why don't you just shut up?
Why don't you just shut up?

I wonder what happened to you (oh my, oh my)
To make you wanna spin the truth (all night, all night)
You sink your teeth
Insult to injury, and we watch
Your high horse running on the loose

Why don't you just shut up
I'm telling you we've had enough of
You and all your bullshit
We've heard it all before
Why don't you just shut up
I know you got to come but so what?
Won't catch you on the fall 'cause
You can't hurt us anymore

Why don't you just
Why don't you just shut up?
Why don't you just shut up?
Why don't you please
Why don't you just shut up?
