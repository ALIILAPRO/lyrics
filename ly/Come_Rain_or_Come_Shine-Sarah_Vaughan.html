		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you 
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river 
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me 
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me 
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me 
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together 
And won't it be fine?
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you 
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river 
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me 
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me 
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me 
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together 
And won't it be fine?
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money

But I'll love you always
I'm with you rain or shine
Rain or shine
