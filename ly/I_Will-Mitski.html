		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will take good care of you 
I will take good care of you 
Everything you feel is good 
If you would only let you 
I will wash your hair at night 
And dry it off with care 
I will see your body bare 
And still I will live here 

So stay with me 
Hold my hand 
There's no need 
To be brave 

And all the quiet nights you bear 
Seal them up with care 
No one needs to know they're there 
For I will hold them for you 

'Cause all I ever wanted is here 
All I ever wanted 
All I want is 
Always you 
It's always you 

And we're not out of the tunnel 
I bet you though there's an end 

Stay with me 
Hold my hand 
There's no need 
To be brave 

And while you sleep 
I'll be scared 
So by the time you wake 
I'll be brave
