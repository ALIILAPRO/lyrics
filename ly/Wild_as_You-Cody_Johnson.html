		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're like waking in the morning by a mountain stream
You're like watching that eagle floating on the breeze
As I listen to you dreaming by my side
I wish I could call you mine

But you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

I could stay with you like this
Till the day love don't exist
Wild flowers bloom in an open field
And wither in a vase on a window seal

But you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

There's a part of me that prays
That you'll hang up your wings someday
But the part that truly does love you
Always hopes you never do

'Cause you belong where your heart can be
Out in the open, wild, and free
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
I ain't never seen anything wild as you

You belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

You belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you
