		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smooth like butter
Like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble
Breakin' into your heart like that
Cool shade stunner
Yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer
Yeah, I'm makin' you sweat like that
Break it down

Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got the superstar glow so (ooh)
Do the boogie like

Side step, right, left to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right, left to my beat
Get it, let it roll

Smooth like butter
Pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher
To remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other
That can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I got ya
Making you fall like that
Break it down

Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got the superstar glow so (ooh)
Do the boogie like

Side step, right, left to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right, left to my beat
Get it, let it roll

Get it, let it roll

Get it, let it roll

Ice on my wrist
I'm the nice guy
Got the right body and the right mind
Rollin' up to party, got the right vibe
Smooth like (butter)
Hate us (love us)
Fresh boy pull up and we lay low
All the playas get movin' when the bass low
Got ARMY right behind us, when we say so
Let's go

Side step, right, left to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right, left to my beat
Get it, let it roll

Smooth like (butter)
Cool shade (stunner)
And you know we don't stop
Hot like (summer)
Ain't no (bummer)
You be like, "Oh my god"
We gon' make you rock and you say (yeah)
We gon' make you bounce and you say (yeah)

Hotter
Sweeter
Cooler
Butter
Get it, let it roll
