		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty Christmas on a cardboard cup
I wait outside for you to pick me up
There's something different in the way you touch
Different in the way you love
Different in the way you love

Feels like stardust
Floating all around us
Shooting right across a big black sky
Feels like stardust
Falling all around us
Funny how it found us
Maybe I
Maybe I

I found perfume in a magazine, whoa
Far-off places in a moonlit scene, ayy
And I love to be there with you
And I love to be there with you too
'Cause you make anywhere at all

Feel like stardust
Floating all around us
Shooting right across a big black sky
Feels like stardust
Falling all around us
Funny how it found us
Maybe I
Maybe I

Feels like stardust
Floating all around us
Shooting right across a big black sky
Feels like stardust
Falling all around us
Funny how it found us
Maybe I
Maybe I
Maybe I
