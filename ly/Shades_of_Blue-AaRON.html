		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, you're sinking and I can't hold you
Maybe it's because I'm sinking too
I'm watching all the waves roll by
All I do is sinking inside
Babe if I can't hold you, It's just because I'm sinking too
If a grown up is just a child gone bad
Welcome to the sad boys club

(Lonely)
I'm only
Understanding who we are
Poems and sidewalks
Just street soldiers, lost into the sea of heartbeats stories
The clouds are shaping a nest where the dead lovers wish to hide

And, you're sinking and I can't hold you
Baby it's because I'm sinking too
I'm watching all the waves around

All I do is sinking inside
Babe if I can't hold you, It's just because I'm sinking too
If a grown up is just a child gone bad
Welcome to the sad boys club

(Lonely)
I'm lonely
Understanding who we are
Poems and sidewalks
My cheeks are salty, just like the fleshy lips that stole my soul
A bunch of grey birds, like dust dwells on the sun we used to own

You're sinking and I can't hold you
Baby it's because I'm sinking too
I'm watching all the waves around
All I do is sinking inside
Babe if I can't hold you, It's just because I'm sinking too
If a grown up is just a child gone bad
Welcome to the sad boys club
