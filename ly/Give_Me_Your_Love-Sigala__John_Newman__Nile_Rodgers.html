		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love

I may be selfish but I'll take your pain
When you get weak I'll make you strong again
When all is lost, I will comfort you, mmh, mmh

So give me your love, I need it
Give me your heart, I'm bleeding
Give me your love, I need it, oh yeah, oh yeah
Give me your love, I need it
Give me your heart, I'm bleeding
Give me your love, I need it, uh, uh yeah

Why don't you give me your love?
Your love, love, your love, your love
Give me your love
Your love, love, your love, your love
Give me your love
Your love, love, your love, your love
Uh, uh, yeah
Your love, love, your love

Why don't you give me your love?
Your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Give me your love
Your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love

I will be there every lonely night
When you wake up, I'll be by your side
I will always be there for you, mmm, mmm, oh yeah

So give me your love, I need it
Give me your all, I'm bleeding
Give me your love, I need it, oh yeah, oh yeah

Why don't you give me your love?
Your love, love, your love, your love
Give me your love
Your love, love, your love, your love
Give me your love
Your love, love, your love, your love
Uh, uh, yeah
Your love, love, your love

Why don't you give me your love?
Your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Give me your love
Your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love

You know all the other men baby
They won't treat you like I could
Stop your searching around
I can't do this any more

So give me your love, I need it
Give me your all, I'm bleeding
Give me your love, I need it, oh yeah, oh yeah

Why don't you give me your love?
Your love, your love, love
Oh, you got to give me, give me more
Your love, your love, love
Your love, your love, love
Why don't you give me your love
Oh, you got to give me, give me more
Why don't you give me your love?
