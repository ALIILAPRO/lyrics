		  (Alright, final take)

Uh oh, what have you done?
Lock me up, I've fallen in love
Get me out of here
I said, get me out of here
And I have homework and shit I need to do
Late assignments and papers overdue
I'm all out of tears
Blurry nights won't disappear

I was in my bed (I tried to sleep)
I held my breath (I was too weak)
I fell into (your open arms)
You'll break my heart (take it too far)
But I don't care (this isn't fair)
I love the way you (do your hair)
I love the way you (write your name)
I love the way

You're driving me crazy
You're driving me mad
I keep dreaming of prairies
And memories that we'll have
My mom calls me lazy
My friends call me sad
Haven't been eating lately
And I haven't been in class

Uh oh, how original
Girl meets boy, it's so predictable
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
You've got shit you say you've got to do
Left me there just to think it through
Facing all my fears
I've waited years and years
I get a feeling every time I go to bed
Are you thinking about me or is it all just in my head?
'Cause I'm falling at the speed of light
Can't keep up with the butterflies
Floating 'round, no sign of slowing down

I was in my bed (I tried to sleep)
I held my breath (I was too weak)
I fell into (your open arms)
You'll break my heart (take it too far)
But I don't care (this isn't fair)
I love the way you (do your hair)
I love the way you (write your name)
I love the way

You're driving me crazy
You're driving me mad
I keep dreaming of prairies
And memories that we'll have
My mom calls me lazy
My friends call me sad
Haven't been eating lately
And I haven't been in class

I was in my bed (I tried to sleep)
I held my breath (I was too weak)
I fell into (your open arms)
You'll break my heart (take it too far)
But I don't care (this isn't fair)
I love the way you (do your hair)
I love the way you (write your name)
I love the way

You're driving me crazy
You're driving me mad
I keep dreaming of prairies
And memories that we'll have
My mom calls me lazy
My friends call me sad
Haven't been eating lately
And I haven't been in class
