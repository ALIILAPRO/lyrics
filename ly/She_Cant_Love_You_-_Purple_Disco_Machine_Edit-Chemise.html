		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, yeah
I saw you last night.
Hmhm, I was in the club, yeah
I saw who you were with here too

When I saw u last night
I could easily see
She was holding u so tight
Cause she knows u want me

Oh no but she can t love ya
She can t love u like I yo
She cant love ya
She can t love you like I do

I said to myself
That must be on your mind
You were there with someone else
You know you re waistin' your time

Oh no 'cause she can't love ya
She can t love u like I do
She cant love ya
She can t love you like I do
She can't love ya ahh ahh no no
She can't love you like I do

You ain't foolin' me no ah ah no no
Who' s foolin' who
Ooh you ain't foolin' me no
Tell me who's foolin' who yo?

You re missing my beat
And I needing your move
Let's give it one more try
Let's get back in the groove

She cant love ya (she can't love ya)
She can t love you like I do (she)
She can't love ya ahh ahh
She can't love you like I do (i do)
She can't love ya (ho no she can't)
She cant' love you like I do (ahh ahh)
She cant' love you (no no)
She can't love you like I do
Ooh she

You know that she can't do it (ha ha no no)
She can't love ya who's follin who's foolin'?
You ain't foolin' me boy
She can't love ya (ahh ahh no no)

Ooh like I said
U know u miss me
And u know I miss you too baby
Well, you know I know I was wrong
What can I say
What am I suppose to do
I stepped out on you first
But I'm ready to make it up to you
And u know that

She can't love ya
