		  Ayy, we still having this shit
(DJ Durel)
And I ain't glorifying it either

Let's go
She want the info (she do)
I wanna talk about crypto
I'm tryna leave that boy bloody (ooh)
Like 'Bron when he threw the elbow ('Bron)
Strings sticky, cup muddy (mud)
Closet lookin' like Rodeo (come look)
Twenty chickens in the kitchen (they all bad)
It was just me and Roekado (let's get it)

He miss and sent them on a mission (mission)
My fingers itchin' 'cause of Benja's (itchin')
Ain't poured dirty in a minute (drank)
Don't worry 'bout it, mind your business (the fuck is you?)
Servin' OG like it's Wendy's (OG)
I'm in they mouth, no dentist (Doctor Lee)
Give a fuck about a image (a what?)
When we see them boys we scrimmage (run)
Big bank bussin' (damn)
Big bang bussin' that's cold (that's froze)
Eenie meenie miney, which ho? (which one?)
Which flow did the pretty bitch go? (where?)
I got some, but I really want more
Any weather I'ma shine, any weather I'ma glow
(It don't matter, I'ma shine)
We run the globe, step on that boy without usin' my toes
How you do that?

I wanna talk about cryto, get milli's
Shout my shotter, like big up the skelly
A check on me now, but I'm chasin' the billy
Bank account bussin', I'm rich like really (really)
Stand back, my diamonds they bite (all night)
New baguettes in the ring, they fight (they fight)
Yeah, bitch I drop five hundred thou' on a Audemar wrist
But I still can't buy the bitch a first class flight
I'ma pop a blue pill, I'm fuck her all night (all night)
On X, I'm bussin', it's aight (aight)
Put a thumb in her booty, 'cause that's what she like (what?)
Bad ass kid like Dennis the Menace
Open her mouth, on her face I'ma finish
Stay in the lab, I'm a muhfuckin' chemist
She flip on the dick, she a muhfuckin' gymnast
Eenie miney moe, which hoe? (which hoe?)
Man, I knock baddest down three in a row (in a row)
I X 'em out like tic-tac-toe (tic-tac-toe)
You seem bad, then her friend can go
I told the bitch, "You can learn from me" (learn from me)
Let me hit it from the back, gon' turn for me (turn for me)
She want the info (info)
I treat the bitch like a rental (rental)
Why does it fill up with crypto?

Let's go
She want the info (she do)
I wanna talk about crypto
I'm tryna leave that boy bloody (ooh)
Like 'Bron when he threw the elbow ('Bron)
Strings sticky, cup muddy (mud)
Closet lookin' like Rodeo (come look)
Twenty chickens in the kitchen (they all bad)
It was just me and Roekado (let's get it)

I-I wanna talk about crypto (crypto, crypto, crypto)
I'm tryna leave that boy bloody (bloody, bloody, bloody)
Strings sticky, cup muddy (muddy, muddy, muddy)
It was just me and Roekado ('kado, 'kado, 'kado)
He miss and sent them on a mission (mission, mission, mission)
My fingers itchin' 'cause of Benja's (Benja's, Benja's, Benja's)
