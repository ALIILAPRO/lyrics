		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, live through the strugglin', life's a every day hustle
I hustle every day in life thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block them older niggas said I couldn't hustle
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped back pack
Bitch, I'm flipping work, hand in hand, I think they call it trappin'
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there tryin' to knock the hustle
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch

I went from roaches on my bump to red broaches on the cuff
On my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, ands or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spend on Goyard
Used it once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, real as a gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housing
Wildin' 'til they throw me in 'em cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartier's (uhh)
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say, "Uhh"
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, just stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, be sure to frame that shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it

You say you got 'em guns, but I've never seen you bang (bang)
You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling (alright)
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play (what?)
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah (yeah)
You say you got 'em guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling (uhh)
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play (ooh ooh)
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah (skrrt)

Rap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same, hustle
Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Flexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to hustle
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, taking meetings on bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck Jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favorite rapper's corpses couldn't match up my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit

You say you got 'em guns, but I've never seen you bang (bang)
You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling (alright)
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play (what?)
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah (yeah)
You say you got 'em guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling (uhh)
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play (ooh ooh)
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah (skrrt)

Seen you bang
Seen you sling 
See you play
Nobody
