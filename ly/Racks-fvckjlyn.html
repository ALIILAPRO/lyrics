		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Racks, racks, racks, racks
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Bands, bands, bands, bands
Filling up my pockets, yeah
Racks, racks, racks, racks
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Bands, bands, bands, bands
Filling up my pockets, yeah
I just checked my bank account and it's adding up
I'm getting lit cus both my pockets fattened up
I'm seeing commas and I'm tryna see them stacking up
I want more nigga, all these racks are not enough
I ain't living lavish, I'm just living savage
I'm just tryna see how big my fucking bag gets
No more time for laxing, gotta put more work in
I'm no longer hurting, I just keep on earning
Gotta get up and get it, chyeah
Put in more work, not finished, chyeah
I wont ever stop, I'm still on a mission, chyeah
Ain't been up in a minute, aye
I feel great, let's get it, aye
Went from rags to the riches, aye
Now my vision's vivid, aye
Counting every penny, only thing I'm thinking bout is fetty
Yeah, I'm on the go staying steady
All this old skin that I'm shedding
Gas on F, now I'm really feeling ready
Niggas out here really getting jelly
Hating on a nigga that's petty
I'm just tryna eat, fill my belly
Getting phone calls on my celly
Racks in the bank, commas, too many
Racks, racks, racks, racks
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Bands, bands, bands, bands
Filling up my pockets, yeah
Racks, racks, racks, racks
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Bands, bands, bands, bands
Filling up my pockets, yeah
