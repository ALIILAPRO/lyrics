		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Without the light
Oh, the darkness comes
Hold through the night
Mmm, the shadows will run

Mmm, fend off the enemy
Sing out the jubilee
With all the fire we can breathe

We're singin' all day, and you can't tame it
High tide, low tide, you know
Nighttime, mornin' time, and we're goin' strong
Headed up, down the river
Oh, Lord, I feel the reveling
I feel a change on the rise

We're singin' all day, and you can't tame it
High tide, low tide, you know
Nighttime, mornin' time, and we're goin' strong
Headed up, down the river
Oh, Lord, I feel the reveling
I feel a change on the rise

What good's a man
Who's lost his soul?
Can't take a stand
Mmm, when his flame's gone cold

Mmm, fend off the enemy
Sing out the jubilee
With all the fire we can breathe

We're singin' all day, and you can't tame it
High tide, low tide, you know
Nighttime, mornin' time, and we're goin' strong
Headed up, down the river
Oh, Lord, I feel the reveling
I feel a change on the rise

We're singin' all day, and you can't tame it
High tide, low tide, you know
Nighttime, mornin' time, and we're goin' strong
Headed up, down the river
Oh, Lord, I feel the reveling
I feel a change on the rise

We're singin' all day, and you can't tame it
High tide, low tide, you know
Nighttime, mornin' time, and we're goin' strong
Headed up, down the river
Oh, Lord, I feel the reveling
I feel a change on the rise
