		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We go too far back
You wouldn't leave me now
To find someone like that
It wouldn't be easy now

'Cause I've been thinking 'bout getting drunk again
At the same house where it all started
And I love you so much that I didn't care
When you stained the carpet
Finding your clothes 'cause you know I stole them
You know I own them now

It's how it's gonna be
Face it, loving me takes patience

Well, the thing about us is I'm leaving
The thing about us is I'm coming home
You hate it, but loving me takes patience
We lose touch when I'm faded
And it can get dark but still I know
You're waiting
And loving me takes patience, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

We've had every fight
There is no score to keep
Chase down every sidewalk
You're walking home with me
Talkin' 'bout honesty

I've been thinkin 'bout getting drunk again
At the same house where it all started
And I love you so much
Goin' up the stairs at your new apartment

It's how it's gonna be
Face it, loving me takes patience

Well, the thing about us is I'm leaving
The thing about us is I'm coming home
You hate it, but loving me takes patience
We lose touch when I'm faded
And it can get dark but still I know
You're waiting
And loving me takes patience

No one else could care
It's a waste of time
To pretend I'd find someone out there
I wouldn't scare
'Cause loving me takes patience

Well, the thing about us is I'm leaving
The thing about us is I'm coming home
You hate it, but loving me takes patience
We lose touch when I'm faded
And it can get dark but still I know
You're waiting
And loving me takes patience

You wouldn't leave me now
