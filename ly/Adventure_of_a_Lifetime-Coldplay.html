		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends, every day
That's what she told him

Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo-ooh, woo-ooh)

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through, oh
And if we've only got this life
And this adventure, oh then I
Wanna share it with you
With you, with you
Sing it, oh, say yeah

Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
