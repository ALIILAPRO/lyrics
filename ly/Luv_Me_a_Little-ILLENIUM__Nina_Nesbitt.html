		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm caught in the way that you talk like you don't wanna know
I gave you the world but you let it go
And are you away with the night and my days here for so long
Darling, I'll wait for you coming home, mm

Tripping up over words, calling
And I can't take it anymore
You know that I've heard it all before

So please just say something different
Say we're not finished yet
Tell me I'm weighing on your mind
Baby, won't ya say something different? (Say)
Don't tear me down again (no)
'Cause I've been praying that you might
Still love me a little

(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Still love me a little
(I'm just enough, I'm just enough for me)
(I'm just enough for me)
Still love me a little
(I'm just enough, I'm just enough for me)
(I'm just enough for me)
Still love me a little

I hate the words that you say when you're wishing me well
Like I need some time to be on my own
But it makes me sick to think of you with somebody else
And darling, I'll wait for you coming home

Tripping up over words, calling
And I can't take it anymore
You know that I've heard it all before

So please just say something different
Say we're not finished yet
Tell me I'm weighing on your mind
Baby, won't ya say something different? (Say)
Don't tear me down again (no)
'Cause I've been praying that you might
Still love me a little

Still love me a little
(I'm just enough, I'm just enough for me)
(I'm just enough for me)
Still love me a little
(I'm just enough, I'm just enough for me)
(I'm just enough for me)
Still love me a little

(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Love me a little (woo-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) 
Still love me a little
