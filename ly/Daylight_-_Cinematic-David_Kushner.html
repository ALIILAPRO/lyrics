		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt

(Ooh)
There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
But I know I can't resist it

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's night time
Please, don't leave me in the end

(Ooh)
There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness (ooh)
But I know I might resist it, oh

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
