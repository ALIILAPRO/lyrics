		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Happiness and loneliness 
Happiness and loneliness 
Happiness and loneliness 
Happiness and loneliness 
And loneliness 

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world
How could you guess,
When you're only thinking of yourself?
And how you looked at other girls

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world
How could you guess,
When you're only thinking of yourself?
And how you looked at other girls

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world
How could you guess,
When you're only thinking of yourself?
And how you looked at other girls

Happiness and loneliness 
Happiness and loneliness 

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world
How could you guess,
When you're only thinking of yourself?
And how you looked at other girls

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world
How could you guess,
When you're only thinking of yourself?
And how you looked at other girls

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world

Happiness seems to be loneliness
And loneliness killed my world
