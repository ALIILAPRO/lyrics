		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fight, we get high holding onto love
We came down 'cause there was nothin' holdin' us
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears fallin' down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
So darlin'

Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

We wrote and we wrote 'til there were no more words
We laughed and we cried until we saw our worst
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears fallin' down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
Will someone

Put a little love on me, yeah
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

Last night I lay awake
Stuck on the things we say
And when I close my eyes
The first thing I hear you say is

Put a little love on me, yeah
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up, we're the only ones dancin'
I look around and you're standin' there askin'
You say, "You're the only one I need
So put your love on me"
You're the only one I need
Put your love on me
