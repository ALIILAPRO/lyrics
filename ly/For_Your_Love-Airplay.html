		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know how it is to be all alone
In the darkness of the gloomy night
Since you’ve been gone I just close my eyes
I’m going to start to fantasize

I touch your body
Kiss your lips
And I even hear your loving sighs
Shadows dreaming
And I start to realize

For your love
For your love
For your love
I’m gonna give my life away
For your love
For your love
For your love
I’m trying harder everyday

I want you
(I want you)
I want you by my side
I cannot spend my life without you
Want you back
(Want you back)
I can’t forsake your touch
I know the way I feel about you
Know the way I feel about you
For your love

Forget what I did
The words that I said
Like a fool I tumbled into lies
I promise you girl I’ll give you what I got
To make you rearrange your mind

I touch your body
Kiss your lips
Gonna love you ‘till the morning light
Blue hearts calling
Don’t you realize

For your love
For your love
For your love
I’m gonna give my life away
For your love
For your love
For your love
I’m trying harder everyday

I want you
(I want you)
I want you by my side
I cannot spend my life without you
Want you back
(Want you back)
I can’t forsake your touch
I know the way I feel about you
Know the way I feel about you
For your love

For your love
For your love
For your love
I’m gonna give my life away
For your love
For your love
For your love
I’m trying harder everyday

I want you
(I want you)
I want you by my side
I cannot spend my life without you
Want you back
(Want you back)
I can’t forsake your touch
I know the way I feel about you

I want you
(I want you)
I want you by my side
I cannot spend my life without you
Want you back
(Want you back)
I can’t forsake your touch
I know the way I feel about you
