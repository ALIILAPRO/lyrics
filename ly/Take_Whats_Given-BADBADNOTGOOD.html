		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah

Take what you're given
Love what's left
Or else, or else, or else
Don't give what you're given
Unless it's blessed
The rules get golden less and less
Oh and I wake I see
What I don't wanna be
Mmm, but it's there
Tell me love don't lie
Doing nothing right
'Til it's for yourself

'Til it's for yourself
Don't feel right, don't feel right
'Til it's for yourself
Tell me love don't lie
Doing nothing right
'Til it's for yourself

Take what you're given
Let it set
Your medicine is better when it's kept
Don't give what you're given
Unless it's blessed
The rules get golden less and less
Oh and I wake I see
What I don't wanna be
Mmm, but it's there
Tell me love don't lie
Doing nothing right
'Til it's for yourself
'Til it's for yourself
Don't feel right, don't feel right
'Til it's for yourself
Tell me love don't lie
Doing nothing right
'Til it's for yourself

So, take what you're given
Love what's left
Or else, or else, or else
Ah, don't give what you're given
Unless it's blessed
The rules get golden less and less
