		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hold my hand
cnd I share your pain 
What do we gain 
From being estranged 
Let's stop pretending 
We do not feel it 
Can't we be honest 
Say what we're meaning 

What we waiting for?
What we hiding for?
Through all ups and downs 
I want you around

I need another night 
Under the moonlight 
Is that what you want? say yeah 
Don't wanna say goodnight 
Do anything you like 
Till we see sunrise 
I need another night
Under the moonlight 
Is that what you want? say yeah 
There's starlight in your eyes
cint felt this in a while
I need another night 

Put your hand on my silk
Make a statement 
Second chance fairytale 
Don't break it 
So close to the edge
You can't fake it 
Right now 
Tell me what you're thinking 
We can break all the chains
You and me, love the way 
How you see right through me 
Ricochet bad ideas
We can do anything 
You say 

What we hiding for?
What we waiting for?
Through all ups and downs 
I want you around


I need another night 
Under the moonlight 
Is that what you want? say yeah 
Don't wanna say goodnight 
Do anything you like 
Till we see sunrise 
I need another night
Under the moonlight 
Is that what you want? say yeah 
There's starlight in your eyes
cin't felt this in a while 

I need another night
