		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up in a stranger's bed
With pins and needles in my head
And the clock ticking off the wall
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I don't even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
But I don't have a clue at all
Oh, yeah

I'm sinking
You're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

Oh
Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give (Oh)
Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give

Maybe I'm a fucking waste
Filling up the empty space
I've been here way too long
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I'm feeling like a nervous wreck
Living on my last paycheck
I'm a clich√© in a song
And everybody's singing along

I'm sinking
You're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

Oh
Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
Oh
Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give

Someone please come pull me out
From the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up
I'm falling

Oh
Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give (Oh)
Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live (Dying to live)
Something's gotta give

I'm sinking (I'm sinking)
You're wading (You're wading)
I'm thinking something's gotta give

(Oh)
Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live (Dying to live)
Something's gotta give
