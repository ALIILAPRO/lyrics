		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When your heart is weak and vulnerable
Oh I'll be there
When you're all alone, don't know where to go
Oh I'll be there
When you're in doubt, I'll bring a smile
'Cause you should know the sun will rise
Oh I'll be there

There are days when you're feeling low
Everything's impossible
There's just one thing that you should know
Every time when you lose hope
You don't know where to go
There's just one thing that you should know

I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
When you're hurt, I'm sorry
I'll be there, don't worry
Never let you down
Never let you down
I'll keep you safe and sound
I'll never let you down
I'll keep you safe and sound
I'll never let you down

From now until the end of time
Oh I'll be there
My handkerchief will dry your eyes
Oh I'll be there
If you need shade, l'll plant a tree
If you need help, reach out for me
Oh I'll be there

Every time when you lose hope
You don't know where to go
There's just one thing that you should know

I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
When you're hurt, I'm sorry
I'll be there, don't worry
Never let you down
Never let you down
I'll keep you safe and sound
I'll never let you down
I'll keep you safe and sound
I'll never let you down

And when I'm old and my days are wrapped and done
Let the blanket of our memories keep you warm
My love for you is forever when I'm gone
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

I'll never let you down, no
When you're hurt, I'm sorry
I'll be there, don't worry
Never let you down
Never let you down
I'll keep you safe and sound
I'll never let you down
I'll keep you safe and sound
I'll never let you down
