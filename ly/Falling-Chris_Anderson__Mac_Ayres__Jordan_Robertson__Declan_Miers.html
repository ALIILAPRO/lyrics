		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't say much, you just lay there
Better run the other way
(better run the other way)
Why the hell would you say that?
Think I need another break
(think I need another break)
I'm just tryna buy some time
But I started running low
(I started running low)
Think it's time that I take flight
And see what's down below
(see what's down below)

But if I keep on falling i'll be in orbit
But if I keep on falling
If all you do is talking don't you know me?
Tell me what you're wanting

I hope it wasn't me
I hope it wasn't me they saved you from
I hope it wasn't me
I hope it wasn't me that kept you down
Right? I hope it wasn't me
I hope it wasn't me i hope it wasn't me
I hope it wasn't me that kept you down
Right? I hope it wasn't me
I hope it wasn't me they saved you from
I hope it wasn't me
I hope it wasn't me that kept you down
Right?

But if I keep on falling i'll be in orbit
But if I keep on falling
If all you do is talking don't you know me?
Tell me what you're wanting
I hope it wasn't me
(But if I keep on falling)
I hope it wasn't me they saved you from
(I'll be orbit) i hope it wasn't me
(But if I keep on falling)

I hope it wasn't me
(If all you do is talking)
I hope it wasn't me that kept you down
Right? (Don't you know me?)
I hope it wasn't me
(Tell me what you're wanting)
I hope it wasn't me they saved you from
