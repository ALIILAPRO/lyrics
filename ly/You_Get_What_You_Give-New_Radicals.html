		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two
One, two, three, ow

Wake up, kids
We got the dreamers disease
Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees
So polite, we're busy still saying please
Frienemies, who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh 'til we cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light (light)
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

I'm comin' home, baby
You're tops
Give it to me now

4 AM, we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke
But hey, we do it in style
The bad rich
God's flying in for your trial

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

This whole damn world could fall apart
You'll be okay, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

Don't let go
I feel the music in you
Don't let go
Fly high, high

What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
Don't give up
Just don't be afraid to leave

Health insurance, rip off lying 
FDA, big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes
Run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your asses

Don't let go
One dance left
Don't give up
Can't forget
Don't let go
