		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's storming out, maybe you should come inside
And tell me why you don't wanna be alive
If you don't respond, I'll put my shoes on
And lay down on the pavement next to you
If we get struck at least we'll make the news
The news

What a way to go out
Something this town will forever talk about
The two kids who were laying down
And struck by lightning in front of your house

In the mud, sinking down
Thinking of everything I have to think about
You shut me up, look at the clouds
'Cause lightning struck

What a way to go out
Something this town will forever talk about (lightning struck)
The two kids who were laying down
And struck by lightning in front of your house (lightning struck)
The kids out on the playgrounds
Years from now will say, "Did you ever hear about (lightning struck)
The two kids who were laying down
And struck by lightning in front of your house?"

Mmh, maybe on a sunny day
You might have some things to say
But if you don't, that's okay

What a way to go out
Something this town will forever talk about
The two kids who were laying down
And struck by lightning in front of your house (lightning struck)
The kids out on the playgrounds
Years from now will say, "Did you ever hear about (lightning struck)
The two kids who were laying down
And struck by lightning in front of your house?"

(As lightning struck)
And struck by lightning in front of your house
