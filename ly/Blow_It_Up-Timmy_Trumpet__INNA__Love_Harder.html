		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I don't give a fuck
I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I, I, I

I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I don't give a fuck
I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I

Come get in my bed tonight
And stay until the morning
And my head's not right 
Oh, give me what I've wanted
All I need is a little bit of faith
You get it? Alright
So blow it, blow it, blow it, blow my mind

I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I don't give a fuck
I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I, I, I

(One, two, three, four)

Come get in my bed tonight
And stay until the morning
And my head's not right 
Oh, give me what I've wanted
All I need is a little bit of faith
You get it? Alright
So blow it, blow it, blow it, blow my mind (I, I, I gotta blow it up)
(I said I, I, I don't give a fuck)

I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I don't give a fuck
I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I, I, I

I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I don't give a fuck
I, I, I gotta blow it up
I said I, I, I, I, I

Come get in my bed tonight
And stay until the morning
And my head's not right 
Oh, give me what I've wanted
All I need is a little bit of faith
You get it? Alright
So blow it, blow it, blow it, blow my mind

(One two three four)

I, I, I don't give a fuck

I, I, I don't give a fuck

I, I, I don't give a fuck

So blow it, blow it, blow it, blow my mind
