		  Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Been waiting on that sunshine boy, I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So I argue, you yell
But you take me back
Who cares when it feels like crack?
Boy you know that you always do it right
Man, fuck your pride
Just take it on back, boy take it on back boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)

Been waiting on that sunshine boy, I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So I argue, you yell
Had to take me back
Who cares when it feels like crack?
Boy you know that you always do it right
Man, fuck your pride
Just take it on back, boy take it on back boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)

I've been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me what's wrong
Go on and make it right
Make it all night long
I've been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me what's wrong
Go on and make it right
Make it all night long
Man, fuck your pride
Just take it on back, just take it on back babe
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back (ooh)
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night (all night)
Hurting vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in your eye (oh)

What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)

What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)

(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
