		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Small dog in that big town
Little dog in that big pound
If you can't bite then just sit down
Better fight it just quit now
Full of bull like a pit now
Talking shit with that big mouth
Get written out, that script ouch (Bye)
Like a fish out of the water
This only gets harder
Feels like I just started
No time to get caught
I been working on me
Therapy once a week
It ain't cheap
But I'd rather pay the fee
Instead of cheat on you

And you could hate me, I don't mind
And you could hate me, I don't mind
And you could hate me, I don't mind
Yeah you could hate me, I don't mind

Sometimes it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm killin' the vibes, killin' the vibes
All of this waitin' around killin' the vibes
Sellin' you dreams, wasting time that I can't buy
Wouldn't give me peace of mind
Attitudes seemed to change when we roll up
How it taste when you taste your own medicine?
Quality of my life is in no budget
Gave me all dirty looks when I look back

You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind

Sometimes it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Pretty good ending, huh?
