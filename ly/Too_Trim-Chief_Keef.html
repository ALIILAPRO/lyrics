		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Sosa on the beat)

I be smokin' on that reefer 'til I pass the fuck out
Let your bitch ass in the club, you get dragged the fuck out
Caught that bitch up in my stash, she got smacked the fuck out
Back up in the parking spot, no time to back the fuck out
You can gamble with your life and you gon' crap the fuck out
I be smokin' all this green so I don't black the fuck out
Goin' up against the mob and you get whacked the fuck out
Had to stop poppin' X before I snapped the fuck out
Big rifle make you think a nigga camped the fuck out
Nigga need to get some sleep, man, I'm vamped the fuck out
Foenem done caught you lackin' and they ran the fuck down
I'm the only one can tell them niggas stand the fuck down
My whole fam with that street shit, it was handed the fuck down
I'm somewhere up on the clouds tryna get the fuck down, huh?
Bitch came in the crib stinkin', told her get the fuck out
Fuck you and your clique, you can call them niggas up now

A nigga wanted bands, so I came out with a plan
Had to do it on my own, I ain't holdin' out my hand
Shout out to my mans, I mean shout out to my friends
If they shot your ass once, they'll shoot your ass again
Shout out to my stans, I mean shout out to my fans
They like, "When he gonna drop? Man, that nigga cap again"
Shout out to your wife, I mean shout out to your bitch
She in a Double-R truck bent over like an ant

Make me lose my fuckin' temper, hit the nerve switch
Yeah, you ride it like a broom, you still a bird, witch
In this life, a nigga live or make you nervous
He say he shittin' on Chief So, what is it, birdshit?
When I'm shittin' on a nigga, it's big turds, bitch
I lay back, get the top, and smoke purp', bitch
What I'm rollin' up gon' have me flat like the Earth, bitch
Finish your food so you can come and eat your dessert, bitch
I got my own M's, I don't give a fuck what you worth, bitch
Fuck your ears, nigga, I don't give a fuck what you heard, bitch
How you suck at cookin'? That shit make my stomach hurt, bitch
With that loose-ass pussy, go and put it on reserve, bitch
With that dry-ass pussy, go and get some fuckin' preserve, bitch
Dig a hole and put your ass in it, I'm Joe Dirt, bitch
Now you gotta go 'cause your dumb ass gettin' on my nerves, bitch
I'm a walkin' iPhone, bitch, I be alert

Nigga wanted bands, so I came out with a plan
Had to do it on my own, I ain't holdin' out my hand
Shout out to my mans, I mean shout out to my friends
If they shot your ass once, they'll shoot your ass again
Shout out to my stans, I mean shout out to my fans
They like, "When he gonna drop? Man, that nigga cap again"
Shout out to your wife, I mean shout out to your bitch
She in a double-R truck bent over like an ant

My kid ain't say her mama name, she said my name first
Boy, all your shit sound the same, you rap the same verse
The police took him in the room, he said our name first
Wish I could stay up in the bed because I hate work
You're lookin' for a rainbow, nigga, it gotta rain first
Hogwarts, I got one up in the chamber
All this land, I gotta hire me some rangers
She said she gon' give me top, she gotta drink first
Coochie wet as hell, I told that ho to drain first
Baby mama bust my windows out of anger
Mama always told me never talk to strangers
Got me gettin' my dumb ass out of dangers
Called me broke, he said that dumb shit out of anger
Tell that nigga hang that shit up on a hanger
Dick be draggin' on the floor, bitch, I'm a swanger
Fuck nigga, bob your head, this a banger

Nigga wanted bands, so I came out with a plan
Had to do it on my own, I ain't holdin' out my hand
Shout out to my mans, I mean shout out to my friends
If they shot your ass once, they'll shoot your ass again
Shout out to my stans, I mean shout out to my fans
They like, "When he gonna drop? Man, that nigga cap again"
Shout out to your wife, I mean shout out to your bitch
She in a double-R truck bent over like an ant
