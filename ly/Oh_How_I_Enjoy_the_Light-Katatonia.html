		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's us I liken to a covey
A polar bear has breached a pup
The palace walls are
Strewn with tapestries
And the window panes are
Splintered and shattered
With a crumbled dog
On every landing
And every stranger cowers
The dress is torn
The tone demanding
The canine's latent strength

And would her loins
Would yield a yelp
A beating purr to steal the
Time with
Here's where we walk
Hand in hand
O how I despise it
O how I enjoy the light
Of the first morning forever
Wisdom, wealth tag
On like afterbirth
I will love you forever

And if I don't
And if I do
The difference exists in a fiction
The day has cooled
The time will too
And we will call upon the light
