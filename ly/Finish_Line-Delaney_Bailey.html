		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this breakup was a race
You'd win by a landslide
And I'd be tying my shoes back by the start line
You'd lap me and I'd be happy just to see you pass
Well, I'll sit right here, babe
Panting in the grass
But my mom's got my inhaler in the crowd
And she's cheering me on now

If this breakup was a race
You'd win by a landslide
I'd be walking laps, babe
To watch the birds fly by
You'd lap me 'cause you've been moving on way too fast
Your legs are on fire, babe
Ease up on the gas
So I'll watch the flowers grow for a while
You keep running your mile

Ooh 
Ooh 
Ooh 
Ooh, ooh
