		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She call me an asshole, yeah
Top floor chilling look through glass walls, yeah
5K coming through her Cashapp, damn
And she won't tell me where she work at

My girl shops at Trader Joe's all day
Pop pills and she pop that (whoa) for me
I don't understand how you get paid
And you won't say
'Cause you been taking pictures with them glass walls on top floors
Hit Coachella with an 8-ball, she ain't pay for it
Has a Tesla, she got no job and she speed in it
All she do is complain, complain, complain (oh my God)
Yeah, yeah

She call me an asshole, yeah
Top floor chilling look through glass walls, yeah
5K coming through her Cashapp, damn
And she won't tell me where she work at (work at)
She call me an asshole, yeah
Top floor chilling look through glass walls, yeah
5K coming through her Cashapp, damn
And she won't tell me where she work at

She using me for my (whoa) and she want more (nasty)
She Uber Eats all her shit to the front door
And truthfully I don't mind so I slide
Slide (ah)
All she do is yoga in Lulu's, I swear
I still use her Netflix and Hulu, that's fair
My girl doesn't work, all play
And she won't say
And she won't ever tell me everything I want
We fuck all day
She'll take that chance and hope I stay
She checks my phone when I'm away
So I checked hers and she called me

She call me an asshole, yeah
Top floor chilling look through glass walls, yeah
5K coming through her Cashapp, damn
And she won't tell me where she work at (work at)
She call me an asshole, yeah
Top floor chilling look through glass walls, yeah
5K coming through her Cashapp, damn
And she won't tell me where she work at
