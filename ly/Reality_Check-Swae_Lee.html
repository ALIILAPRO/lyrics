		<p>
		  Yeah, damn
This shit is, too regular
And it's always gon' be regular

Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality (hey)
(I gotta go in the atmosphere)

Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality
I gotta check on my ex and make sure she ain't doin' better than me

(Hey, uh, yeah)
Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality (yeah)
I gotta check on my ex and make sure she ain't doin' better than me (hey)
Ride in the car, spread the wings (yeah)
I gotta go in the atmosphere
I expect less from these people
When I'm in position, don't depend on me

Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality
I gotta check on my ex and make sure she ain't doin' better than me
When I didn't have it
I actually sat and I had to imagine it (yeah)
Don't touch my seat settings
And I'll let you know when I'm ready to leave

Do everything with a strategy
My women come from academies
My bitches come out of fantasies
They forbidden fruit like it's Adam and Eve
Spending money at the Galleria
Stripper dancing like a ballerina (yeah)
Niggas hating, low key wanna be us
Melatonin, how I put her to sleep
Good drank and it put me to sleep
At the top, it's a long drop
Gotta jump out and leap
I gotta go and get me get me the pesos
Each and everyday of the week
And I'm gonna ball
Never catch me in the bleachers (hey)

Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality (yeah)
I gotta check on my ex and make sure she ain't doin' better than me (hey)
Ride in the car, spread the wings (yeah)
I gotta go in the atmosphere
I expect less from these people
When I'm in position, don't depend on me

Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality
I gotta check on my ex and make sure she ain't doin better than me
When I didn't have it
I actually sat and I had to imagine it (yeah)
Don't touch my seat settings
And I'll let you know when I'm ready to leave (leave)

(Yeah)
Ooh (ooh, ooh)
I'll see you whenever I see you
Fucking see you, wouldn't want to be you (yo)
Took some time, turned 'em to some believers
All the cash in the bag, I need it
Spanish bitch call her Catalina
Pussy wet as Hurricane Katrina

Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality (yeah)
I gotta check on my ex and make sure she ain't doin' better than me (hey)
Ride in the car, spread the wings (yeah)
I gotta go in the atmosphere
I expect less from these people
When I'm in position, don't depend on me

Who needs a reality check?
I got a check in reality
I gotta check on my ex and make sure she ain't doin' better than me
When I didn't have it

Don't touch my seat settings
And I'll let you know when I'm ready to leave (leave)
