		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes life seems impossible
When our dreams just fade away
We get caught up in the little things
Lose ourselves along the away

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go

Time can be the perfect remedy
Let love the lead the way
So feel your heart, let it show
Give it just a little more
Come on baby, bring back the light

When life is hard, let it fly
Put your hands up to the sky
Come on baby, bring back the light

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go

Switch it up, come on make you worth it
Gonna live life our own way
Yeah that struggle is trouble
But so much beauty along the way

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go

Time can be the perfect remedy
Let love the lead the way
So feel your heart, let it show
Give it just a little more
Come on baby, bring back the light

When life is hard, let it fly
Put your hands up to the sky
Come on baby, bring back the light

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go

Come on baby, bring back the light

Switch it up, come on make you worth it
Come on make you worth it

So feel your heart, let it show
Give it just a little more
Come on baby, bring back the light

When life is hard, let it fly
Put your hands up to the sky
Come on baby, bring back the light

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go

Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
Let it go, go, go, go
Let it all go
