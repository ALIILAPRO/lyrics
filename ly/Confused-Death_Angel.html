		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes in the back of my mind
I feel like something struck me blind
Blind to the path
Leading out of the forest
Losing my grip
I slip into the darkness
Searching for a trace of serenity
I find myself dwelling
In my own self pity
Either going up or coming down
Can I be the king
Or must I be the clown

[Chorus]
Let me tell you something about myself
I got problems only I can tell
Please listen to me I don't want to be
Confused anymore

I'll start today just feeling fine
In reality my sanity is on the line
Why can't life flow nice and easy
It's hard when happiness
Is there tease me

Try to find fun for a brief escape
Someone save me before it's too late
Tell me not to listen
To the voices in my head
Balancing factors I could use instead

[Chorus]

Who controls the matter
Of circumstance
Make my move and leave the
Rest up tho chance
Take my hand I'll lead you to a faraway
Place my friend and there
Forever we can say
