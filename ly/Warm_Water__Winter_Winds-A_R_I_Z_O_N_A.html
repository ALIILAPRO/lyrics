		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the moment, didn't notice, yeah
We were growin' older
In the warm water and the winter winds
We sat ourselves by the fire
We were drinkin' whisky, tellin' old stories
That was in a time before all this

We didn't know we were lost
We would have to find all of the answers
And we didn't know somewhere
Somewhere up ahead, there was danger

In the moment, didn't notice, yeah
We were growin' older
In the warm water and the winter winds
We sat ourselves by the fire
We were young and lonely, but we had each other
That was in a time before all this, mmh

whoa, we didn't know we were lost
We would have to find all of the answers
oh, we didn't know that somewhere
Somewhere up ahead, there was danger

Even in the middle of, in the middle of this
Even in the middle of, in the middle of all this, oh
We will remember that the night is not our enemy, oh
In the middle of, in the middle of all this

In the moment, didn't notice, yeah
We were growin' older
In the warm water and the winter winds
