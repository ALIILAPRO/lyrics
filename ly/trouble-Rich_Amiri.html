		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went and ran it the fuck up
(What the fuck?)
Most of these niggas, don't trust 'em, no
I put my trust in my hundreds
Ride with the toolie, I'm tuckin', woah
These niggas not about nothin' (Never)
And that ho think that I love her, no
"How many racks?" A couple
Caught that boy lack, his ass in trouble
(yeah) he in my pack, got hit with a nuzzle
Pop me a flat, I'm doin' a couple
My money fat, I'm makin' it double
He wanna chat, get put in a bubble
(yeah, yeah)
I wanna crack, that bitch wanna cuddle
(What, what?)
That bitch, she bad, I give her my number
(yeah) blast, we turn that boy into rubble

Blast, we turn that boy into (What? Let's go)
We turn that boy into nothin'

I went and ran it the fuck up

Most of these niggas, don't trust 'em, no
I put my trust in my hundreds
Ride with the toolie, I'm tuckin', woah
These niggas not about nothin' (Never)
And that ho think that I love her, no
"How many racks?" A couple
Caught that boy lack, his ass in trouble
(yeah) he in my pack, got hit with a nuzzle
Pop me a flat, I'm doin' a couple
My money fat, I'm makin' it double
He wanna chat, get put in a bubble
(yeah, yeah)
I wanna crack, that bitch wanna cuddle
(What, what?)
That bitch, she bad, I give her my number
(yeah) blast, we turn that boy into rubble
(yeah, yeah)
