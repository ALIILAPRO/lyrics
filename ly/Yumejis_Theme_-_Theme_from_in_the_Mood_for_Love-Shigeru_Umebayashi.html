		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the late 1990's into the twentieth century
The idols, the press darlings are the faceless djs
That's not to say that i'm not, a techno disco lover
I keep it under cover

Chorus:
(i just want some personality) give me action and drama
(who to look up to, who i'm supposed to be) give me '80's madonna
(i just want some personality) give me action and drama
(who to look up to, who i'm meant to be) give me club tropicana

I'm no pro-retro know-all, i want faces for the future
I'd like my idols human not programmed in computers
Pop music's not gonna die, it just has no direction
We need a plan of action

Chorus x2
I'll be getting fresh at the weekend
Throwing myself in at the deep end
Trying to keep up with the dj
He has no voice and no say

(i just want some personality) give me action and drama
(who to look up to, who i'm supposed to be) give me '80's madonna
(i just want some personality) give me action and drama
(who to look up to, who i'm meant to be) give me bananarama
