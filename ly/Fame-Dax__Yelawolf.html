		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  LexNour

Yeah, just bought a black Bentley truck
But I got no black tuxedo
I ain't even put a post up, givin' no fucks
No ego huh, know that's a lie, homie
We all got a little bit of high rise, homie
A PBR, yeah, but I got bub on a shelf
I'm in love with myself, won't die lonely
You asking why not, why me, homie
Get tough don't cry on me
Bitch, I suffered to get rich
I became a president
But they can't put a tie on me
Gave my mama a new whip
A CVO clean as a new Q-tip
A Harley Davidson trike
The hard way to spend right
I gave part of my life just to do this
And gave part of my heart
When Shawty Fatt died
Know my brother wasn't on the block
Crack guy
Blood on my face from the shot, trap side
I didn't realize I was baptized at the time
But the time was a rhyme
I confined and compartmentalized
I built like a builder
Milled and I drilled up
Dirt to a tiller, marginalized
And part of it's pride
The other part of it is my eyes
What I've seen, what I've
Done, what I've lost, what I've won
I was made to become that guy
So when the stage lights hit the boy
In the leather jacket
That's me at the steeple
Rock and roll, here's the church
Rock and roll, here's the people

And we're all evil
Always wanting something new
To be famous people
We've been watching over you
We are (We are) evil (Evil)
Always wantin' something new
(Always wanting something)
To be famous (Famous) people (People)
We've been watching over you

Yeah they been watchin' and lookin'
Right through a peephole claim fame is nice
So I'ma need some insurance on it
So I can get half of what it equals (yeah)
The other half in case I turn evil
Is reparations for the misled people
I never meant to do that
But in between the alcohol and shows
And couple of bad hoes
I may of feel a bit off track
See, I was never meant fall in line
Every track was a stand
I don't walk left-right 'less we
Talking 'bout a marchin' band
The headspace that I'm in
Got these people looking at me
Like I'm Martian Man
They butter me up, margarine
Said my soul was the cost to trend
And my consciousness, and as a result
I ain't never fuckin' pickin'
Up the call again
I don't give a fuck what you
Say, I ain't never gon' change, bitch
I came and I did it my way
I got the crowd packed, screamin' words back
Saying "Dax" every time I
Hit the goddamn stage
Pussy, you ain't gonna touch what I made
Don't you ever try to say that you
Know or you feel my pain
We not the same, I'm off the chain
I'm in the storm, but meant to reign
And I ain't fuckin' with bad vibes
Dax is an American past time
Blowin' up on defeat like a landmine
So don't ever ask why I'm the bad guy
'Cause that's what happens when you
Something they can't find
As I look into my eyes and
Pass by the mirror lies
I see someone broken inside
That hides as the fame deprives
But helps build the life that they all
Define as one of a kind

We are evil always wanting something new
To be famous people
We've been watching over you
We are (We are) evil (Evil)
Always wantin' something new
(Always wanting something)
To be famous (Famous) people (People)
We've been watching over you

(We are evil, Always wanting something new)
(We are evil, Always wanting something)
