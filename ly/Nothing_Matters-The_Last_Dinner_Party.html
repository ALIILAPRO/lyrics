		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have my sentence now
At last, I know just how you felt
I dig my fingers in, expecting more than just the skin
'Cause we're a lot alike
In favor, like a motorbike
A sailor and a nightingale
Slow dancing in convertibles

And you can hold me like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters
And you can hold me like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters

We've got the highway tight
The moon is bursting with headlights
One more and we're away
Love tender in your Chevrolet

And we're a lot alike
In favor, like a motorbike
A sailor and a nightingale
Dancing in convertibles

And you can hold me like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters
And you can hold me like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters

Even when the cold comes crashing through
I'm putting all my bets on you
I hope they never understand us

I put my heart inside your palms
My home in your arms
Now we know nothing matters
Nothing matters

And you can hold me like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters
And you can hold me like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters
And you can hold me, like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters
And you can hold me like he held her
And I will fuck you like nothing matters, ooh
