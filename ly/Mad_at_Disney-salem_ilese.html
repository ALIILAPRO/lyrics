		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm mad at Disney, Disney
They tricked me, tricked me
Had me wishin' on a shootin' star
But now I'm twenty-somethin'
I still know nothin'
'Bout who I am or what I'm not

So call me a pessimist
But I don't believe in it
Findin' a true love's kiss is bullshit

'Cause I felt sad love
I felt bad love
Sometimes happy love (happy love)
Turns into givin' up (givin' up)
I felt hurt love
By the word love
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?

(Carry me away to a castle)
(Where we will live happily ever after)

My fairy grandma warned me
Cinderella's story
Only ended in a bad divorce
The prince ain't sleepin' when he
Takes his sleeping beauty
To the motel on his snow-white horse

So call me a pessimist
But I don't believe in it
Finding a true love's kiss is bullshit

'Cause I felt sad love (sad love)
I felt bad love (bad love)
Sometimes happy love (happy love)
Turns into givin' up (I'm givin' up)
I felt hurt love (hurt love)
By the word love (word love)
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?

I'm mad at Disney, Disney
They tricked me, tricked me
No more wishin' on a shootin' star
