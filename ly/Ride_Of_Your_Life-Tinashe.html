		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Might change your life
I be doing shit that might change your life
Oh, yeah, no lie, no hype
I been doing shit these hoes don't like
Oh yeah, we driving fast in the slow lane
I do them stunts like a movie
We be on jets a Jacuzzi
We busting off like an Uzi
I be on the block with shawty
Going extra hard, we not just ordinary
Need a re-up we connect with a homie
Every time I'm call it, pull up on me

Yeah, and I whip the whip 'til it's blue and black
And everybody asking "where the roof at?"
They wanna know how I do that, oh

Just drop the top, hot box the block
Gon' have the time of your life
Just ride with me
We gon' hit the streets
Take you on the ride of your life
I'll take you on the ride of your life
Need you here on the passenger side
Baby we could slide have the ride of your life
You're on the ride of your life

Might change your life
Still doing that shit that might change your life
Oh, yeah, no gas, no hype
I been doing shit these hoes don't like
Come through and we doing damage
My name on your bitch, yeah she tatted
Bitches got that, we been had it
Know they gon' hate, they can't stand it
I wonder why they all on me
A punk can never ball on me
And I can get the money like four ways
Back seat, we can start at the foreplay

Yeah, and I whip the whip 'til it's blue and black
And everybody asking "where the roof at?"
They wanna know how I do that, oh

Just drop the top, hot box the block
Gon' have the time of your life
Just ride with me we
We gon' hit the streets
Take you on the ride of your life
I'll take you on the ride of your life
Need you here on the passenger side
Baby we could slide, have the ride of your life
We're on the ride of your life

Whip it, gas it, clutch it, park it
Grab it, steer it, donuts, oh
Love it how I do it, don't ya?
Everybody wanna roll
Ain't no stopping on the highway
Ask me where I'm going I say my way
They ain't on my level watch me square it up
Hit that lane with the turbo

Just drop the top, hot box the block
Gon' have the time of your life
Just ride with me we
We gon' hit the streets
Take you on the ride of your life
I'll take you on the ride of your life
Need you here on the passenger side
Baby we could slide, have the ride of your life
We're on the ride of your life

Might change your life, yeah
