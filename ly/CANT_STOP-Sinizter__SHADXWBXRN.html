		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle so hold on
Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle till I'm on top

Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle so hold on
Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle till I'm on top

Need a hit, seratonin give it to me!
BBL she a Barbie, wanna do me!
When I'm lightin' up the stage, it's a movie
They could try it but they'll never out do me

New day, new bag bitch I paid dues
Bout to blow up like a bomb, I'm a lit fuse
Still shoot my shot but I may lose
Whole Scene full of fakes bet you one too

Start a revolution really what they want
Ima give it all I got until I'm never tappin' out
Start a revolution really what you want
Better give it all you got to make out the box

Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle so hold on
Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle till I'm on top

Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle so hold on
Can't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Going full throttle till I'm on top
