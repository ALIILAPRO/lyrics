		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't know and you won't say it now
'Cause you don't say and I will never ask

Skin in the game
Skin in the game
Poison the heart
Won't go so far, yeah
Skin in the game
Skin in the game
Blood in the highs
And count the stars

And I won't know and you won't say it now
'Cause you don't say and I won't ever ask

Skin in the game
Skin in the game
Poison the heart
Won't go so far, yeah
Skin in the game
Skin in the game
Poison the heart
Won't go so far, yeah

Poison the heart
Won't go so far
Poison the heart
Won't go so far
