		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open

M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
if I could melt your heart
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
we'd never be apart
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
give yourself to me
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
you hold

The key, frozen. The key, open.
The key, frozen. The key, open.
The key, frozen. The key, open.
The key, frozen. The key, open.

M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
if I could melt your heart
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
we'd never be apart
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
give yourself to me
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
you hold



M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
if I could melt your heart
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
we'd never be apart
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
give yourself to me
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
you hold
