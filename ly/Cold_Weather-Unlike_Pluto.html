		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staying in from all the cold weather
I've been Getting sick thinking of you
Feels just like the flu
Drowning in the soup

I can't find my coat
Everywhere I go is so cold
Wish that I could go
But you're too deep in the snow

Frozen Sky lights
Distort outside
And it makes me frozen inside

Every night I
Want to drive by
But my coat is lost in the snow

Staying in from all the cold weather
I've been Getting sick thinking of you
Feels just like the flu
Drowning in the soup

I been thinking
I been thinking
I been thinking of you

Broadcast from my room
Someone let me loose
Sunshine in a noose
Frosted in the gloom

I can't drive to you
My windshield frozen into
The gas won't make the fumes
I'll never make it back to you

I sit at night
Circle my mind
With the fireplace in my eyes
In the twilight
Different moonlight
Nothing comes out late at night

Staying in from all the cold weather
I've been Getting sick thinking of you
Feels just like the flu
Drowning in the soup

Cold nights
Drive through different tunes
Rolled down
Window when the heat is on
