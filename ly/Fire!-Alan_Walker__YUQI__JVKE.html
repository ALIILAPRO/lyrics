		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Set my heart on fire
Pour gasoline all over my desire
When I go up in flames, I'm burning bright
I'll tell you it's too late to apologize

You burnt that bridge
A million times, a million tries
You play with fire

Every time we touch, my fingers burn
I just want that love, don't leave me hurt
I can feel the rush when we ignite
'Cause every time we touch
Every time we touch, I feel that fire

You know sparks gon' fly
Every time you look into my eyes
All it takes is one small match to light
'Cause once we feel the flame, we'll never die

You burnt that bridge
A million times, a million tries
You play with fire

(Every time we touch) every time we touch, my fingers burn
I just want that love, don't leave me hurt
I can feel the rush when we ignite
'Cause every time we touch
Every time we touch, I feel that fire

Oh-oh, that love, don't leave me hurt

Every time we touch, my fingers burn
I just want that love, don't leave me hurt
I can feel the rush when we ignite
'Cause every time we touch
Every time we touch, I feel that fire
