		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts the maggots, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singing
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin' shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover be good to me)

Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered the sin (lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (lover, be good to me)
That's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
Oh, lover, be good to me

When the man who gives the order
Is born next time 'round on the boats sent back
When the bodies starvin' at the border
Are on TV given people the sack
Love, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there's nothing left for you and I to do
Oh, when there is nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love, for you

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover, be good to me)

Be love in its disrepute (lover, be good to me)
Scorches the hillside and salts every root (lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowin' and starvin' of troops
And, lover, be good to me (lover be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (lover, be good to me)
That grow bold in a barren and desolate land
And lover be good to me

Love, won't you be?
Love, won't you be?
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be?
Love, won't you be?
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be?
Love, won't you be?
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be?
Love, won't you be?
Be as you've always been?
