		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right now niggas is ducking off from the feds

We plot out the heist and we hitting it and
We could get time but we risking it
We currently going through sentences
So, I gotta watch what I
Say in these sentences
My 38 working so dirty I know it got
Some kinda filth but I sit in it
I know that's your sister or whatever
But she so thick
Damn, a nigga just slid in it
Talk shit and I'm stuffing this clip in it
Snug fit with a beam, I ain't missing shit
One shot in the barrel, I'm spinning it
Shoot the whole thing
So I get my percentages
Then I dump off that tooly no evidence
The body gon' sit in the sediment
I hop in the whip and I'm revving it
See me come back from the
Dead like a revenant (Skrt)
If I'm in the function, this TEC in it
If we feel a issue we pressing it
At first, they was all on my head with it
Now they just all on my
Dick like the president
Boy, watch out for shit that you stepping in
If I'm in this bitch then my weapon in
Or run to the whip and I'm getting it
That's just in case these little
Niggas want get it in
Free Heist, my little brother, he in the pen
We in, and we out like we minutemen
They think this little chop ain't
Got kick in it
Bullets they cooling inside like
They kicking it
Don't move or your body start stiffening
Suppress it, I bet he be listening
If it ain't bout bands, I ain't interested
Whip out that wop and
Start dropping the witnesses

I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
Woo, woo, I'm innocent, yuh
Woo, woo, I'm innocent, yuh
Woo, woo, no witnesses, yuh
Woo, woo, no witnesses, yuh
I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
I promise, your honor, I'm innocent
Woo, woo, I'm innocent, yuh
Woo, woo, I'm innocent, yuh
Woo, woo, no witnesses, yuh
Woo, woo, no witnesses, yuh

Kill you where you stand, murder on my hands
Uzi fuck a gram, Uzi touch your mans
Kill you where you stand, murder on my hands
Uzi fuck a gram, Uzi touch your mans
I'm gone of them xans
I'm runnin' up bands
I'm fuckin' her fam
I'm throwin' them hands
He talkin' that jam
I got the blood on my hands
I'm gone of them xans
I'm runnin' up bands
I'm fuckin' her fam
I'm throwin' them hands
He talkin' that jam
I got the blood on my hands
