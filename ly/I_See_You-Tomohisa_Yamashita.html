		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When my sky had turned to sudden dark
I never understood the reason why
But now I know
It was to shed more light to a certain truth, mhm

It doesn't have to be unfortunate
Heavy waves that swept down all my world
But now I realize
It only makes me desperate on this path

Oh, I see you and I hear you
The flowing of my blood will carry you
With you by my side I find my way home
You're shining through it all

Missed you so much felt like dying
No matter where I stay, you're all I see
'Cause I know that you were just meant for me
It'll never fade away

Holding you to feel your loneliness
Even when you smile the sorrow tells a lie
But now I realized
I look into your eyes and learn the truth
Ooh

Oh, I see you and I hear you
The flowing of my blood will carry you
You're by my side I could find my way home
You're shining through it all

Missed you so much felt like dying
No matter where I stay, you're all I see
'Cause I know that you were just meant for me
It'll never fade away

Stumbling on the raging storm, I seek
I'm here for you, I'd die for you, my love
If you only knew how I tried so long
Don't ever let me down

Oh, I see you and I hear you
The flowing of my blood will carry you
You're by my side, I could find my way home (no, no)
You're shining through it all

Missed you so much felt like dying
No matter where I stay, you're all I see (you're all I see)
'Cause I know that you were just meant for me
It'll never fade away
