		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The time has come to pack away all the joys
You don't wanna hear my apology
Get it off my chest
I would do my best
I know what you fear
Similarities we possess

Never will I pass the test
The scene is fading
Can my soul be put to rest?

Death is gonna come for me
Be the change I couldn't be
Can you find a life that's like fairytales?
Far from this tragedy
Sad you had to wait for me
Feels like an eternity
Please forgive me for my sins
Angels wings lifting and setting me free

Death is gonna come for me
Be the change I couldn't be
Can you find a life that's like fairytales?
Far from this tragedy
Sad you had to wait for me
Feels like an eternity
Please forgive me for my sins
Angels wings lifting and setting me free

The question of my love
Slipping right through the cracks and crumbling to dust
The question of my love
Slipping right through the cracks and crumbling to dust
