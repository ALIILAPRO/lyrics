		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate to love it
Hate to love the way you keep me burning
Burning for your touch but you don't give it
Give it to me only when you need it
I know you need it

But when you come my way
When you come my way
Put it all on me
But you never see
Ain't going home tonight
(Ain't going home tonight)
Unless you come with me
Ooh na na, ooh na na
Ooh na na, ooh na na
Ooh na na, ooh na na

Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye

Love me wanting
Something 'bout me craving gets you going
A taste in every space that we're alone in
Then tease me on the dancefloor till the morning
Yeah, 'till the morning

But when you come my way
When you come my way
Put it all on me
But you never see
Ain't going home tonight
(Ain't going home tonight)
Unless you come with me
Ooh na na, ooh na na

Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye

The way you play me, I can't control
Just wanna be the one who can take you home
You tell me that you want it, you wanna tell
But keep me waiting

Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Stay one more night, night, night
You make it right
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Night, night, night, night, night (one more night)
Right
Don't say goodbye
