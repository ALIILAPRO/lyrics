		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  737 comin' out of the sky
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band

Take me to the hotel, baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on, won't you get me to my room
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band

Listen to the radio talkin' 'bout the last show
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia
Wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Oh wow

Here we come again on a saturday night
With your fussin' and your fightin', won't you get me to the ride?
I wanna move
Playin' in a travelin' band
Yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Oh wow

Oh, I'm playin' in a travelin' band
Playin' in a travelin' band
Won't you come and take my hand?
Well, I'm playin' in a travelin' band
I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
Oh wow
Hey
