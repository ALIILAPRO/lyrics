		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take, you're runnin' off the road so get out the way
Push the pedal to the floor, blow 'em all away
Yeah, you see, I'm gettin' close, I accelerate
Goin' faster than fast, hit the gas

Lose control, I won't crash, rollin' high
Put your money on the dash, throw the dice
Lose control, I won't crash, run it all, I won't crash
When you slow, I won't crash, running, take, take, take, take

Take, you're runnin' off the road so get out the way
Push the pedal to the floor, blow 'em all away
Yeah, you see, I'm gettin' close, I accelerate
Goin' faster than fast, hit the gas

Lose control, I won't crash, rollin' high
Put your money on the dash, throw the dice
Lose control, I won't crash, run it all, I won't crash
When you slow, I won't crash, running, take, take, take, take

Take, you're runnin' off the road so get out the way
Push the pedal to the floor, blow 'em all away
Yeah, you see, I'm gettin' close, I accelerate
Goin' faster than fast, hit the gas

Lose control, I won't crash, rollin' high
Put your money on the dash, throw the dice
Lose control, I won't crash, run it all, I won't crash
When you slow, I won't crash, running, take, take, take, take

Take, you're runnin' off the road so get out the way
Push the pedal to the floor, blow 'em all away
Yeah, you see, I'm gettin' close, I accelerate
Goin' faster than fast, hit the gas

Lose control, I won't crash, rollin' high
Put your money on the dash, throw the dice
Lose control, I won't crash, run it all, I won't crash
When you slow, I won't crash, running, take, take, take, take
