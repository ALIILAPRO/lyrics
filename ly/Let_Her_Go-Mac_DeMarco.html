		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her know

Growing by the hour
Love just like a flower
But when the flower dies, you've got to say goodbye
And let her go

Let her go
Let her go

Tell her that you'll be there
If you'll really be there
Separation's supposed to make the heart grow fond
But it don't

So tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her go

Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Yeah

Or you can keep her, it's okay
It's up to you
Make your own choice, whatever you gotta do
God bless
