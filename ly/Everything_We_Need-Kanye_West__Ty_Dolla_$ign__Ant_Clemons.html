		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (ah), it's just the morning light (woo, woo)
Woo, woo, oh yeah

Woo ooh, ooh ooh
Switch your, switch your attitude
Go 'head, level up yourself
This that different latitude
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Life too short, go spoil yourself
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself 'cause

We have everything we need 
We have everything we need 
We have everything we need 
We have everything we need 
We have everything we need

We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (ah), it's just the morning light (oh, yeah)

Switch my, switch my attitude
I'm so, I'm so radical
All these people mad at dude
This for who it matter to
What if Eve made apple juice?
You gon' do what Adam do?
Or say, "Baby, let's put this back on the tree" 'cause

We have everything we need 
We have everything we need 
We have everything we need 
We have everything we need 
We have everything we need

We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (ah), it's just the morning light
