		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel the rhythm of the music come alive inside me I can feel the music in my veins.
Take me to a place where I can see the melody before me, come along with me and I'll explain.
Hear the music feel the beat, melody within your feet, listen to the rhythm of the song.
Lets not stop until we drop,feel the music make you rock, well keep dancing all night long.
Can you hear the music playing, listen to what the dj's saying can you hear the music melody,
get on the floor and dance some more, move until your bodies raw, come on let the music set you free.
