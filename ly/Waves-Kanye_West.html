		<p>
		  Turn it up

Step up in this bitch like (turn it up)
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah, I'm the one your bitch like (turn it up)
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight (turn it up)
And she grabbin' on my, like 
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave (yeah)

Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment, yeah
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby, I don't, I don't need to own

Sun don't shine in the shade (turn it up)
Bird can't fly in a cage (turn it up)
Even when somebody go away (turn it up)
The feelings don't really go away
That's just the wave 

(Yeah) waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby, I don't, I don't need to own you

No lie
No lie
No lie
You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie

No lie
Ooh baby, ooh baby, oh yeah
You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie
