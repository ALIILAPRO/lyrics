		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
Therefore I reside in Tennessee

Some folks think I'm hidin'
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee
