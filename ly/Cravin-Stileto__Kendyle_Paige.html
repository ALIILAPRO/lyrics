		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm rare
Like these diamonds that I wear
Gold lace
Please you like no other

Heartbeat racin'
I'ma put you through these paces
Be the best you ever tasted
Gon' stay on your mind
Come back every time
Baby I'ma keep you cravin'

Baby I'ma keep you cravin' (cravin')
Baby I'ma keep you cravin' (cravin')
(Cravin', cravin', cravin')
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah I'm the remedy subject to your abuse
I'm that desire in your blood you can't refuse
Ya picked your poison boy ain't nothing left to choose, now
You can't get enough

Intoxicated can't recover
So don't devise I'll keep you close
Put your hand on my hips
I'll do your wrists
Pressed to these lips
Kiss I won't tell

I'm (I'm) rare (rare)
Like these diamonds that I wear
Gold (gold) lace (lace)
Please you like no other

Heartbeat racin'
I'ma put you through these paces
Be the best you ever tasted
Gon' stay on your mind
Come back every time
I'ma keep you cravin'

Baby I'ma keep you cravin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah-oh)
Baby I'ma keep you cravin' (cravin')
(Cravin', cravin', cravin')
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
