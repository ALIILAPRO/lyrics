		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unreasonableness is
Lying all over the world
Staring at it won't change it at all

Why did we start this tragedy?
I had forgotten all about it
Why did we keep doing this?
I wanted an ordinary life

If it would mean less sacrifice
I don't need a peaceful time
If I lose my life sooner or later
Please forgive me, as I'm sure
It was my true desire

I don't care if it's vanity
I'm a winner until I lose
Where does the blood that's spilled go?
You live without seeing a drop

I have nothing more to lose
Why did I start?
Why did I continue?
The answer is always inside of me
From now on, I'll never be confused

I don't forget why anymore 
"I wanted an ordinary life"

I don't care if it's vanity
I'm a winner until I lose
Where does the blood that's spilled go?
Pain and sorrow are beyond the sky
I'd do anything for you
Until the end
