		  Maybach
Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh
CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY
Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh

This a lesson (ooh), cuff no ho, there's no arrestin' (uh-huh)
No more restin' (ooh), fuck a pilgrim, no more settlin' (uh-huh)
Get the message (yeah), no, you ain't 'cause we ain't textin' (uh-huh)
If we ain't sexin' (yeah), you might have to get to steppin' (uh-huh)
Just like Martin (ooh), forty K bookin', that's where I'm startin' (uh-huh)
Where the Valet at? (Ooh) hit the brake, pull up, that's where I'm parkin' (uh-huh)
Where I stay at? (Yeah) in the hills, that's where I play at (uh-huh)
All-black Bimmer (yeah), next year, it's a all-black Maybach (uh-huh)

When the last time you seen a nigga this fine
With a mind so smart and a future this bright?
Bitch, give me that pussy like Webbie, I'm tied
For the next three hours, right now I feel fine
Bitch niggas all on my line 'cause I'm on my grind
Bitch niggas' sleepin' on me, fold like a futon
Rich nigga with a good deal like a Groupon
'Cause all the labels know that homie don't play that

This a lesson (ooh), cuff no ho, there's no arrestin' (uh-huh)
No more restin' (ooh), fuck a pilgrim, no more settlin' (uh-huh)
Get the message (yeah), no, you ain't 'cause we ain't textin' (uh-huh)
If we ain't sexin' (yeah), you might have to get to steppin' (uh-huh)
Just like Martin (ooh), forty K bookin', that's where I'm startin' (uh-huh)
Where the Valet at? (Ooh) hit the brake, pull up, that's where I'm parkin' (uh-huh)
Where I stay at? (Yeah) in the hills, that's where I play at (uh-huh)
All-black Bimmer (yeah), next year, it's a all-black Maybach (uh-huh)

Teishas (ooh), Keishas (ooh), Mona (ooh) Lisas (ooh)
Bag your aunties (ooh), bag your nieces (ooh)
You tryna check for my sneakers (ooh)
I got a check for my sneakers (ooh)
I took that bitch off the bleachers (ooh)
If she act up, I delete her
(I) send her back to her man when I leave her
(You) don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you neither
(We) move intact, they don't sip from my tea
('Cause) all they know 'bout me is bitch, I am ether
(I) got a bitch thick as shit like Aretha
(That) piss 'em off, fuckin' up their urethra
(See) I'm a boss, I can hire her
Then fly her out from Brazil on a temporary visa

This a lesson (ooh), cuff no ho, there's no arrestin' (uh-huh)
No more restin' (ooh), fuck a pilgrim, no more settlin' (uh-huh)
Get the message (yeah), no, you ain't 'cause we ain't textin' (uh-huh)
If we ain't sexin' (yeah), you might have to get to steppin' (uh-huh)
Just like Martin (ooh), forty K bookin', that's where I'm startin' (uh-huh)
Where the Valet at? (Ooh) hit the brake, pull up, that's where I'm parkin' (uh-huh)
Where I stay at? (Yeah) in the hills, that's where I play at (uh-huh)
All-black Bimmer (yeah), next year, it's a all-black
