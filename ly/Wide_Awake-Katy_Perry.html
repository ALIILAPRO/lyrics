		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

(I'm wide awake) yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong?
(I'm wide awake) and now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

(I'm wide awake) not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no
(I'm wide awake) yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (and it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Falling from cloud nine (it was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine

(I'm wide awake) thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on
(I'm wide awake) God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (it was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
