		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, Ah
Ah, Ah

You got my blood running
Turn the heat to six hundred
Wish I could knock your skull in
But I'm rising above it
Know you're crashing and burning
God knows you didn't earn it
My friend karma's a bitch
She's got some lessons you'll learn 'em

Now we're enemies
You're a snake, you're a snake
I can see it in your face

Ah, do you feel no shame?
Ah, can't you see my rage?

I'm a snake, you're a snake, just like a spitting image
Fate, how's it taste? It's your own medicine
Make no mistakes, got 2020 vision
If I see your face, don't think I'm forgiving

It's time we had a discussion
'Bout your sorry production
Mask your shade and corruption
Grinning teeth lack seduction
Know the crime you committed
I forget not forgive it
Don't you dare get it twisted
I'm nice but I can get wicked

Now we're enemies

Ah, do you feel no shame?
Ah, can't you see my rage?

I'm a snake, you're a snake, just like a spitting image
Fate, how's it taste? It's your own medicine
Make no mistakes, got 2020 vision
If I see your face, don't think I'm forgiving

Snake, you're a snake
I can see it in your face
(You're a snake, you're a snake)
(I can see it in your face)
You're a snake, you're a snake
I can see it in your face
You're a snake, you're a snake
I can see it in your face (ah)
You're a snake, you're a snake
I can see it in your face (Ah, Ah)
Ah, Ah
Ah
