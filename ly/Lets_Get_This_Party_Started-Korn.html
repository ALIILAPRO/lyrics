		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man is crying, takes me to a certain place
Which I don't often find
I see a family walking, always thinking
Of being somewhere else in time

So I fall face down in a rut
I can't seem to get out of
Please wake me, please give me some of it back
The feelings I had

Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you
It doesn't matter
Each time I wake, I'm somehow feeling the truth
I can't handle

Let's get this party started
I'm sick of begging you
You make me feel insane
Which I give to you

Let's get this party started
You make me feel insane
I want to be the one
To make myself sane

Time is ticking, it makes me feel content
With what I have inside
Constant paranoia surrounds me
Everyone I see is out to get me

So I fall face down in a rut
I can't seem to get out of
Please wake me, please give me some of it back
The feelings I had

Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you
It doesn't matter
Each time I wake, I'm somehow feeling the truth
I can't handle

Let's get this party started
I'm sick of begging you
You make me feel insane
Which I give to you

Let's get this party started
You make me feel insane
I want to be the one
To make myself sane

You make me feel insane
You make me feel insane (let's get)
You make me feel insane (this party)
You make me feel insane (started)
You make me feel insane (started)
You make me feel insane

Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you
It doesn't matter
Each time I wake, I'm somehow feeling the truth
I can't handle

Let's get this party started
I'm sick of begging you
You make me feel insane
Which I give to you

Let's get this party started
You make me feel insane
I want to be the one
To make myself sane
