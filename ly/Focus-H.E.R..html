		<p>
		  Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me? Babe

Hands in the soap
Have the faucet's running and I keep looking at you
Stuck on your phone, now you're stuck in your zone
And you don't have a clue

But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on

Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

Lazy and broke?
Know he get this money, so I guess I can't complain (hmm)
But I feel alone even when we're alone
And that don't cost a thing

But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up (oh)
Lately I've been a little fed up (a little fed up, yeah)
Wish you would just focus on

Me
Can you focus on me? (Oh, yeah)
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me? (Yeah)
Baby, can you focus (oh), on me?
Me

Baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes, ooh
