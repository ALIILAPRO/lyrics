		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little do you know how I'm breaking while you fall asleep
Little do you know I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know I, need a little more time
Yeah, yeah, y'all can never know what it mean to me
All the things that I do, everything I try to be
Since I'm a little boy, I have all these big dreams
I just wanna reach, there's nothing else for me, yeah
I just wanna get on the big things
Never understand why everybody got me pissed and
I cannot be with them, I'm always bigger dreamin'
Swear I be searchin' for a meanin'
If I don't make the music, I think I'm leavin'
Little do you know
How I'm breakin' while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know
I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Little do you know
How I'm breakin' while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know
I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Yeah
I can not make it by myself
Still I got no one that tries to help
Jealousy overwhelms, with the things I try to
I can not bring them, tried to
They thought I be around, lol
They say I'm done since I'm out though
Yeah
I can not make it better
I was being cute, bought you a sweater
They push me on mute, I'm pushin' the feather
I thought I was rude, I wrote you a letter
Nothing I do, does really matter
They think its cute, I tryna get up
Big dreamin' overseas, just tryna catch up
Little do you know, how much you mean to me
Little do you know, that I wanna get you everything you need
Little do you know, right
Little do you know, right
I just don't want you to know, yeah
How close I am to go
Yeah, how close I am to go, yeah
Little do you know how I'm breaking while you fall asleep
Little do you know I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know I, need a little more time
