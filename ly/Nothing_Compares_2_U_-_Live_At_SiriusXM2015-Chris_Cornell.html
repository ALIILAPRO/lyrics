		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whoever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
Nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me
Where did I go wrong?

I can put my arms around any girl I choose 
But it just reminds me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
He said, boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama
In your backyard
All died when you went away
And I know living with me baby is sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
To you
