		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rain
Coming home again
Stepping off the train
How you been?
I can't complain
It's been a while
I'm glad you came
Coffee in a flask
Driving much too fast
Have you had a drink?
Wouldn't want to ask
Don't wanna think
About the past

This could be the time we work things out
Say some things that we should say out loud
If there's anything that I've learnt by now
It'll be just another thing that we don't talk about
It'll be just another thing that we don't talk about

Eyes upon the road
The chili's on the stove
Shall we have a beer?
Should I tell a joke?
And keep this sinking ship afloat
And stumble up to bed
But now I'm seeing red
It's not what you did
It's not what you said
It's the silence we choose instead

This could be the time we work things out
We could say some things that we should say out loud
And if there's anything that I've learnt by now
Is it'll be just another thing that we don't talk about
Ah, it'll be just another thing that we don't talk about
Ah, it'll be just another thing that we don't talk about
It'll be just another thing that we don't talk about
