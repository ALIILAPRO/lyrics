		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come get me, but don't hit me
I smoke weed, so I'm trippy
Get litty, get gritty
Rick Sanchez, get schwifty

Who gonna come to come to get me?
Who gonna break me out, set me free?
Who gonna come to come to get me now?
Who gonna come to come to get me? (Woo)
I'm sexy, I'm gifted
I'm too high to get lifted
You're racist, you're evil
You're a danger to my people

My vision is faded, my brain has calculated
How many licks to lick your lemon drop?
How many licks to lick your drop, drop?
Wait, wait for me to set you free
Wait, wait for me to set you free

You know I'm tryna make it but I only got time
Never graduated so I never had a prom
Alcoholic so I never really had a mom
Don't feel bad 'cause I turned out fine
If you really 'bout it come and step up to the line
I'm a bad mama jama, now watch me shine
Only 27, I'm ahead of my prime
If it's illegal to kill the pussy, book me with a crime
My spaceship is empty
Dolla, dolla bill, y'all, finally got plenty
Here's a glass, so shut the fuck up, it's venti
Why's everybody so uptight this century?
If you a cry baby, bitch, I'ma fuck yo' mom
Good thing for me that the cougar is a dime
Don't believe in Jesus, but I think this is the time
I'ma have to come back and kill it one time

My vision is faded, my brain has calculated
How many licks to lick your lemon drop?
How many licks to lick your drop, drop?
Wait, wait for me to set you free
Wait, wait for me to set you free
