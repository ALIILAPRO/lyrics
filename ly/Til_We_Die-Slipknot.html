		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our friends are all hurting from moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
Still we keep hoping, to fix all the defects and strengthen these seminal times
We go on together for better or worse, our history is to real to hate
Now and forever we stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fate

'Til we die
'Til we die

The start of a journey is every bit worth it, I cant let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid and the consciences opens the door
I never stopped trying, I never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent compliments each and everyone

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

'Til we die
'Til we die

My last true confession will open your eyes
I've never known trust like the nine
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

(We'll never be broken, we won't be denied)
(Our war is the present we need to deny)
(We'll never be broken, we won't be denied)
(Our war is the present we need to deny)

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we wont be denied, our war is the present we need to deny

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten we'll never give in ('Til we die)
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win ('Til we die)

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied ('Til we die)
Our war is the present we need to deny ('Til we die)
