		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I'm hated
I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, "Drink to your accomplishments," so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
I don't know who told you that (my mama)
Well, she fucking lied
Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up
Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all these beats
I body beats, I'm not discreet (per-per-perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head
You won't ever get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (per-per-perfect)
My flow increased, my dough increased
You know I leave 'em all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East
I keep the peace, don't need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it capiche?
That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I'm smokin' trees
I bought my shit, I don't need no lease
So fuck you up like Master P (perfect)
This shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police
Shooting my shot like the police
All on the block like the policemen, who gon' (stop, stop)
The police from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin streets man? (Fire, per-per-perfect)
