		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looked in the mirror
So many people standing there
I walked towards them
Into the floodlights
I heard no echo (no echo)
There was distortion everywhere (everywhere)
I found my ego (my ego)
I felt rebuttal standing there
Found my transcendence (transcendence)
It played in mono painted blue (painted blue)
You were the pirot (the pirot)
I was the dark room (the dark room)

I'ma shine a light in your eyes (in your eyes)
You'll probably shine it back on me
But I won't fall this time
With Godspeed, I'll heed the signs

I saw the solstice (the solstice)
The service station on the road (on the road)
I took the acid (the acid)
Under the white horses (the road)
My heart, it quickened (it quickened)
I could not tear myself away (myself away)
Became addiction (addiction)
If you see darkness, look away (look away)

I'ma shine a light in your eyes (look away, look away)
You'll probably shine it back on me (look away)
But I won't fall this time
With Godspeed, I'll heed the signs

Oh, glorious world (glorious)
Oh, potent waves, valleys gone wild (potent waves)
Connect us to love (us to love)
And keep us peaceful for a while (for a while)

I'ma shine a light in your eyes (for a while)
You'll probably shine it back on me (for a while)
But I won't fall this time
With Godspeed, I'll heed the signs

I'ma shine a light in your eyes (in your eyes, in your eyes)
You'll probably shine it back on me (in your eyes)
But I won't fall this time
With Godspeed, I'll heed the signs
I won't fall this time
With Godspeed, I'll heed the signs
