		  Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
R.I.P. love

Oh no, think I did it again (think I did it again)
And it kills me to see you like this, like this
Should've known from the moment we met (the moment we met)
I'd rip your heart right outta your chest, ayy

Swore I learned from the last time 
Dressed in black I guess I lied 
Warned you, God knows that I tried 
I told you
I told you

Man down, man down 
Oh, another one down for me 
Said you'd die for love 
But I never loved you, sorry
So long, you're gone 
It hurts to see 
Said you'd die for us 
So now R.I.P. love 

Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
R.I.P. love
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
R.I.P. love

When I lay in my bed at night (lay in my bed at night)
I remember the way that you cried 
But I can't go back
No, I know it's too late 
And it haunts me everyday (oh)

Swore I learned from the last time (oh)
Dressed in black I guess I lied (lied to you)
Warned you, God knows that I tried 
I told you (lo)
I told you (lo)

Man down, man down 
Oh, another one down for me (for me, for me)
Said you'd die for love 
But I never loved you, sorry (never loved, never loved, I never loved)
So long, you're gone 
It hurts to see 
Said you'd die for us 
So now R.I.P. love 

Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
R.I.P. love
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re 
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
Lo-re-lo-re-lo-re-lo-re
R.I.P. love
