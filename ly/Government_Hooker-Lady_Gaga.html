		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can be good (If you just wanna be bad)
I can be cool (If you just wanna be mad)

I can be anything , I'll be your everything
Just touch me baby (I don't wanna be sad)

As long as I'm your hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Put your hands on the ground)
As long as I'm you're hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Get down)

Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)
Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)

I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
'Cause I know you love me baby
I know you love me baby

I could be girl (Unless you want to be man)
I could be sex (Unless you want to hold hands)

I could be anything, I could be everything
I could be mom (Unless you want to be dad, oh papito)

As long as I'm your hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Put your hands on the ground)
As long as I'm you're hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Get down)

Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)
Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)

Put your hands on me
John F. Kennedy
I'll make you squeal baby
As long as you pay me (oh)

I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
'Cause I know you love me baby
I know you love me baby

Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)
Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)

I could be girl (Unless you want to be man)
I could be sex (Unless you want to hold hands)

I could be anything, I could be everything
I could be mom (Unless you want to be dad)

I wanna fuck the government hooker (Back up and turn around)
Stop fucking me government hooker (Put your hands on the ground)
I wanna fuck the government hooker (Back up and turn around)
Stop fucking me government hooker (Get down) Yes
