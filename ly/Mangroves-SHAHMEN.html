		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody can save you, fears will embrace you
Crawl from out the bed in
The house and chase you
You can try to hide but
They'll find and face you
You can try to fight but
They'll finally maim you
By the end of the night they
Will try and hang you
Tied to the heights where you lie and dangle
Do you believe in the angels
I believe I'm trying to light all my candles
While the paranoia grows like
Branches and mangroves
I'm squeezing water from stones
And eating bare bones
And all the saying in the
Books well I bury those
But I'm still trying to carry
All my buried foes
Back home and make em' friends
So the arrow goes
On and on, on and on like a broken song
And start to feeling like the
Bullshit you're smoking on

See the signs been told as I walk this road
Made a rose out of gold
But the bones was coal
When I dug them out of dirt
Trying to build my home
Haunted by these crows but
I must move forward
And see the signs been told
As I walk this road made a rose out of gold
But the bones was coal
When I dug them out of dirt
Trying to build my home
Haunted by these crows but
I must move forward but I must move forward
But I must move forward
But I must move forward

See the signs been told as I walk this road
Made a rose out of gold
But the bones was coal
When I dug them out of dirt
Trying to build my home
Haunted by these crows but
I must move forward but I must move forward
But I must move forward
But I must move forward
