		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was it true? Nights we spent alone?
In the quiet, in the dark, both were bound to trip and fall
All the secrets, secrets we'd never share
In the shadows, in the dark, did you really care at all?
In the echoes of our past
I'm searching for a sign
Did your words hold meaning?
Or was it all just a lie?

Was it true? The way you looked into my eyes
Promises of forever, under starlit skies
Was it true? The way we laughed and cried
In this maze of memories, I'm lost, I can't decide

Was it true? The way your touch set me on fire
Burning passion, unquenchable desire
But now I'm left with questions doubts inside my mind
Was it all a cleverly designed bind?
Was the love we felt real or a fleeting dream?
Yeah

Tell me, darling, was it true? Was it all a scheme?
I
Do not know how
I'm supposed to keep on moving on
Ooh
I
Was I in the wrong?
