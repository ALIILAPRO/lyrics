		  Breakdown
I'm overworking till the sundown
Don't see the light inside my head now
I need to see you in my window
In a whisper

All I really want is you
What would you do?
Lying in the rain with you
Middle of June
All I really want is you
What would you do?
Sleeping outside the moon
Trippin' with you

Head down
I don't know when to come up for air now
You take my hand like there's a way out (right now)
And we're escaping through the window
And I whisper

All I really want is you
What would you do?
Lying in the rain with you
Middle of June
All I really want is you
What would you do?
Sleeping outside the moon
Trippin' with you

All I really want is you

All I really want is you
What would you do?
Lying in the rain with you
Middle of June
All I really want is you
What would you do?
Sleeping outside the moon
Trippin' with you

All I really want is you
What would you do? (I'm over working till the sun down)
Lying in the rain with you
Middle of June (don't see the light inside my head now)
All I really want is you
What would you do? (I throw a line outside the window)
Sleeping outside the moon
Trippin' with you
All I really want is you
