		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a stampede
And it's comin' after you
You can take it
If you only let your feelings through 

So DJ spin the sounds
There ain't no way that you're gonna let us down
Gonna dance, gonna burn this disco out

Groove all night (woo)
Keep the boogie alright
Get that sound
Everybody just get on down

Got a hot foot
Better freak across the floor
Join the party
And we'll keep you movin', that's for sure

So DJ spin the sounds
There ain't no way that you're gonna sit us down
Gonna dance 'til we burn this disco out

Groove all night (groove on)
Keep the boogie alright
Get that sound
Everybody just get on down

Once you get the beat inside your feet
There ain't no way to stop, you movin' good
Now the weekend's come, it's time for fun
You got to groove just like you know you should
People now

Are you ready?
Won't you rock across the room
Got a feelin'
That we're gonna raise the roof off soon 

Uh, so DJ spin the sounds
There ain't no way that you're gonna sit us down
Gonna dance 'til we burn this disco out

Groove all night
Keep the boogie alright (groove on)
Get that sound
Everybody just get on down

(Woo) groove all night
Hee
Groove on

So DJ spin the sounds
There ain't no way that you're gonna sit us down
Gonna dance 'til we burn this disco out

Groove all night (groove on)
Keep the boogie alright
Gonna dance, gonna shout (groove on) 
Gonna burn this this disco out
Get that sound
Everybody get down tonight
Gonna dance, gonna shout (get on down, get on down) 
Gonna burn this this disco out (woo)
Groove all night (woo)
Keep the boogie alright
Gonna dance, gonna shout 
Gonna burn this this disco out (get on down
Get that sound (woo)
Everybody get down tonight
Gonna dance, gonna shout (gonna dance now, gonna shout it now)
Gonna burn this disco out (ooh)
Groove all night (woo)
Keep the boogie alright
Gonna dance, gonna shout 
Gonna burn this this disco out
Get that sound
Everybody get down tonight (yeah)
Gonna dance, gonna shout (get on down) 
Gonna burn this this disco out
