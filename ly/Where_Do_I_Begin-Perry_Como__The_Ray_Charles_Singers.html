		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do I begin ?
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet, love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start?

With her first hello
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There?d never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels? songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely

With her along, who could be lonely ?
I reach for her hand, it?s always there

How long does it last ?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day ?
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I know I?ll need her till the stars all burn away
And she?ll be there, she?ll be there
