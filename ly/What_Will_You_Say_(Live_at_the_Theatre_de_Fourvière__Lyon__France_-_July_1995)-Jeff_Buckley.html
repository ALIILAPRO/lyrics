		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been such a long time
And I was just a child then
What will you say
When you see my face?
Time feels like it's flown away
The days just pass and fade away
What will you say
When they take my place?

It's funny now
I just don't feel like I'm a man
What will you say
When you see my face?
My face

Mother dear, the world's gone cold
No one cares about love anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?

Father do you hear me?
Do you know me?
Do you even care?
What will you say
When they take my place?

My heart can't take this anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?
When you see my,
See my face

I can feel your time crawling
To a slow end
I can feel my time crawling
To a slow end

Mother dear, the world's gone cold
No one cares about love anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?

Father do you hear me?
Do you know me?
Did you even care?
What will you say
When you take my place?

Well it's so funny now
I just don't feel like I'm a man
What will you say?
