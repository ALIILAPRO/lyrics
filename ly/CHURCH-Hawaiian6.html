		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't even try to stand.
So I can feel nothing.
My intentions were
always so good.
Now and then you said to me.
"You always look ahead."
I believed in me
and so in our love.
Turn the page - My diary.
Nothing from my memories.
I cannot open my eyes.
Like drawning in the sea.
It's not sad.
It's not funny.
Not angry and not lonely.
I can do nothing.
I'm at a loss what to do.
If God is in the church.
Why won't he make me strong.
I - I know nothing
is not speaking.
I lift up my face.
And open my eyes.
And I will try to stand.
I won't even try to stand.
So I can feel nothing.
My intentions were
always so good.
Now and then you said to me.
"You always look ahead."
I believed in me
and so in our love.
Turn the page - My diary.
Nothing from my memories.
I cannot open my eyes.
Like drawning in the sea.
It's not sad.
It's not funny.
Not angry and not lonely.
I can do nothing.
I'm at a loss what to do.
If God is in the church.
Why won't he make me strong.
I - I know nothing
is not speaking.
I lift up my face.
And open my eyes.
And I will try to stand.
