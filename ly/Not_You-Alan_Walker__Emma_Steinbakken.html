		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live my life in my mind
Where I make up stories all the time
And I pretend that I am not someone
Left to face the world alone

Lately I'm not the same
I've found a stranger calling out my name
Have a feeling you would be so proud
And he's gon' need me now

But he's not you, ooh
He's not you, ooh
He will never be you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Photobook of my mistakes
Promises that we never got to make
All the things I wanna talk about
Hard to say it to myself

Winter time, once again
In the snow, I can see just where I've been
For a minute in the world so cold
Where I have everything

But he's not you, ooh
He's not you, ooh
He will never be you, ooh, ooh, ooh

But he's not you, ooh
He's not you, ooh
He will never be you, ooh, ooh, ooh
