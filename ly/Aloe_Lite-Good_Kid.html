		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These days all I see is everything you're not
Between those melodies, it's all I've been thinking of 
Since then the lines you left behind you
They cover every bit of this home  
These days it's all I've ever wanted
It's all I've ever wanted to know  

What it is that keeps me from letting you go 
I don't even know 
What it is that keeps me from letting you go 
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go
It's not what I thought
I guess we get what we want 

These days all I hear are words that I forgot 
And of those memories, I'd rather lose the lot 
Since then the days are getting longer but I keep getting lost in the snow
These days it's all I've ever wanted
It's all I've ever wanted to know  

What it is that keeps me from letting you go 
I don't even know 
What it is that keeps me from letting you go 
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go
It's not what I thought
I guess we get what we want

I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
