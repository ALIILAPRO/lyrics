		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't go any further than this
I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

I spent my time just thinking thinking thinking bout you
Every single day yes, I'm really missin' missin' you
And all those things we use to use to use to do
Hey girl, whats up, it use, it use to be just me and you
I spent my time just thinking thinking thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes I'm really missing missing you
And all those things we use to use to use to do
Hey girl whats up, whats up, whats up, whats up

Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline
Is where I'm gonna wait, for you
I'll be looking out, night n' day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish

Girl, I travel round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe I go to other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna to meet
I navigate myself myself to take me where you be
Cause girl I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown town I travel downtown
I wanna to have you around round like every single day
I love you alway' ways

Can you meet me half way (I'll meet you halfway)
Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait, for you
I'll be looking out, night n' day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish

Let's walk the bridge, to the other side
Just you and I (just you and I)
I will fly, I'll fly the skies, for you and I (for you and I)
I will try, until I die, for you and I, for you and I, for for you and I,
For for you and I, for for you and I, for you and I

Can you meet me half way
Can you meet me half way
Can you meet me half way
Can you meet me half way

Meet me half way, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait, for you
I'll be looking out, night n' day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
