		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, can I call you, can I call you mine?
Can I be the sun kissing your skin?
I can be your, I can be your ocean
Be the wave that makes you smile

Now send me your love, hot like a fire
If you can remember how we used to feel
Send me your love, from now 'til forever
I don't wanna feel cold in September
Now send me your love, hot like a fire
If you can remember how we used to feel
Send me your love, from now 'til forever
I don't wanna feel cold in September

Babe, can you hear my, can you hear my heartbeat?
Synchronized deeply with yours
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody like you
Fire meets gasoline

Now send me your love, hot like a fire
If you can remember how we used to feel
Send me your love, from now 'til forever
I don't wanna feel cold in September
Now send me your love, hot like a fire
If you can remember how we used to feel
Send me your love, from now 'til forever
I don't wanna feel cold in September

Holding you closer 'cause I don't wanna forget
Lifting you higher 'cause I don't feel no regret
Feet in the sand like we ain't got no time to spend alone
I just wanna feel you closer

Now send me your love, hot like a fire
(Can remember how we used to feel)
Send me your love, from now 'til forever
I don't wanna feel cold in September
Now send me your love, hot like a fire
If you can remember how we used to feel
Send me your love, from now 'til forever
I don't wanna feel cold in September

Send me your love, hot like a fire
Send me your love, from now 'til forever
I don't wanna feel cold in September
