		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep it real 
I know that something is wrong with you
I am too impatient 
To wait for something new
Why can't I say what I need you to hear
Find it hard to dream
I know that you are near
You are near

You'll be there to 
Laugh your head off when I fall
I will go 
With them to look for something more
Subject to change will you identify
Look at me close you'll see that I can't smile,
I can't smile

I can't smile
I can't smile
I can't smile
I can't smile
I can't smile
I can't smile
I can't smile
I can't smile

Now smile
Beg your pardon?/ 'scuse me?
Smile
Why?
Just do it
I'm afraid I can't smile without a reason
I'm sorry I can't smile without a reason
Smile
What's there to smile about?
Just do it
Why?

Think your so good with your toking
Fuck your smoking 
That's not what its all about
