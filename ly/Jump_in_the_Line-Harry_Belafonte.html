		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake it all the time
Work, work, work, señora
Work your body line
Work, work, work, señora
Work it all the time

My girl's name is señora
I tell you friends, I adore her
And when she dances, oh brother
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather

Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Ok, I believe you
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Ok, I believe you
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Ok, I believe you
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Whoa

Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake your body line, whoa
Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake it all the time
Work, work, work, señora
Work your body line
Work, work, work, señora
Work it all the time

You can talk about cha-cha
Tango, waltz, or the rumba
Señora's dance has no title
You jump in the saddle
Hold on to di bridle

Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Ok, I believe you
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Rock your body, child
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Somebody, help me
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Whoa

Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake it all the time, whoa
Work, work, work, señora
Work your body line, yeah
Work, work, work, señora
Work it all the time

Señora she's a sensation
The reason for aviation
And fellas, you got to watch it
When she wind up she bottom
She go like a rocket

Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Ok, I believe you
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Hoist those skirts a little higher
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Up the chimney
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Whoa

Yessah

Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake your body line
Work, work, work, señora
Work it all the time
Dance, dance, dance, señora
Dance it all the time
Work, work, work, señora
Work it all the time

Señora dances calypso
Left to right is the tempo
And when she gets the sensation
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion

Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Ok, I believe you
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Somebody, help me
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Ok, I believe you
Jump in the line, rock your body in time
Whoa

Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, señora
Shake it all the time
Work, work, work, señora (shake, shake, shake, señora)
