		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lyin' on your side
Sinkin' like a stone
Lyin' to me right
Wondering what it's like

If I die tonight, I'm just curious
Haven't been myself, is it obvious?
Tie the knot, pull the plug, is it obvious?
(Wondering what it's like)

(Wondering what it's like)
(Wondering what it's like)

Eat another apricot
I'm so hungry but I've had enough
Drop a couple crumbs in conversation
It's all just a bit of fun
Can't promise you a fight, it's already done
Crying's not polite
Let the boa bite, swallowing the gum
(Wondering what it's like)

If I die tonight, I'm just curious
Haven't been myself, is it obvious?
Tie the knot, pull the plug, is it obvious?

Wondering what, wondering what it's like
Wondering what it's like
Wondering what, wondering what it's like
Wondering what it's like

If I die tonight, I'm just curious
Haven't been myself, is it obvious?
Tie the knot, pull the plug, is it obvious?

Wondering what it's like
