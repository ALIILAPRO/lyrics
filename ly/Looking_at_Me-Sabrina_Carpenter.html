		  Oh
Oh, yeah

Did I catch your attention? You look like you lost your breath, huh
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude when my lips and my soles are red
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
No, no

'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes, come on

Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I can make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me

They looking at me
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me

May be young for a teacher, I'll teach you what you don't know
I could teach you the things that you wanna know
But I can't give it up all at once, you would overdose
Don't you bring any bull in the room tonight, it's a whole new rodeo
It could be you and me, but you know that I'll steal the show
Oh, yeah

'Cause I've been here once or twice (I've been here once or twice, babe)
Never worry 'bout the eyes (never worry 'bout the eyes) come on

Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I can make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me

They looking at me
No, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
But they looking at me, babe
'Cause they looking at me, baby

(They're looking at me, me, me)
(They're looking at me, me, me) hey
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks

(Don't you)
Don't just stand there staring, honey (honey)
Try to move your feet (try to move your feet now)
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I can make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me
(They just looking at me, they just looking at me)
They looking at me
(Yeah, they're looking at me, my baby, baby, baby)
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
But the truth is they looking at me
They looking at me
