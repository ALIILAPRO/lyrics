		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm back from the dead

Out of the black
Breaking free of the wasteland
Out of the mud
Crawling up through the quicksand
Leaving the dark, coming into the light
Don't lay me down, save your last rites

'Cause I'm still standing above ground

Back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me
Back from the other side
Up from the dirt I rise
Save your prayers, don't bless my bones
Erase my name from my headstone
Back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me down

On the edge of the world getting lost in oblivion
To the devils who tried to keep me living like a prisoner
Couldn't chain me down, couldn't cage me in
So keep your savior, give me back my sins

'Cause I'm still standing on the ground

Back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me
Back from the other side
Up from the dirt I rise
Save your prayers, don't bless my bones
Erase my name from my headstone
Back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me down
Down

Back from the dead alive
Back from the other side
I'm back

I'm back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me
Back from the other side
Up from the dirt I rise
Save your prayers, don't bless my bones
Erase my name from my headstone
Back from the dead alive
Hell couldn't hold me down

Hell couldn't hold me down
Hell couldn't hold me down
