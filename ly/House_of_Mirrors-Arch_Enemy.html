		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See the choice, it lies before you
A simple flick of the wrist
Blank doors keep the world at bay
Or do they keep the outside in?
What geometry lies beyond?
A familiar fa√ßade, keys in locks

Unhinge the future
Shut out the past
Winners and losers
Fiction and fact

Renegade, our reflections made across a sharpened blade
In a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home

To open is to invite the unknown
In to flood your once square home
The walls silently watch you
Are you watching them back?
Windows to the souls surround you
What escapes when those panes crack?

Unhinge the future
Shut out the past
Winners and losers
Fiction and fact

Renegade, our reflections made across a sharpened blade
In a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home
Suspicious simulacra distort your flesh and bone
'Cause in a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home

You'll run
You'll hide
Or try to
But we all
Reside
Inside you

Renegade, our reflections made across a sharpened blade
In a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home
Suspicious simulacra distort your flesh and bone
'Cause in a house of mirrors, you're never alone
Welcome home
