		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold on, hold on with me 

I've lost a lot a in this game 
Another everyday face with no name
I'm not selling misery
So would you stay around with me

Whoa, I know that you are afraid
The traces of war linger on my face
But I'm not selling misery
Maybe one day I'll feel home again

Hold on, hold on with me
What if we could change this world today
Hold on, hold on with me
What if we could change this world today

Don't let me forget what it is to belong
I hope the dream like the words of this song
Whatever your harmony
Oh, please just sing with me

Whoa, you don't have to turn a blind eye
If you really look I'm a regular guy
I'm not selling misery
Maybe one day I'll feel home again

Hold on, hold on with me
What if we could change this world today
Hold on, hold on with me
What if we could change this world today

Hold on, hold on with me
What if we could change this world today
Hold on, hold on with me
What if we could change this world today
