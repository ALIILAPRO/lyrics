		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I think it's cute when you tell me lies (ooh)
Always let you win when I know I'm right (ooh)
Backseat in the coupe with the suicide (ooh)
Then we get a little high, get a little high

Seven nights in the car (car)
And the lights are getting dark (dark)
We could take it too far (far)
I'll be with you, forever

All I wanna do, all I wanna do is ride with you
(All I want, all I want)
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is die for you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is ride with you
(All I want, all I want)
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is die for you (all I want)

'Cause your love is so infectious
'Cause you tell me I'm the bestest
'Cause your love is so infectious
Tell me, tell me I'm the bestest

I'm not picking up when I know I should
'Cause lying next to you feels so fucking good
I would drive off a cliff if I knew I could be with you forever

Seven nights in the car (car)
And the lights are getting dark (dark)
We could take it too far (far)
Dead in love, forever

All I wanna do, all I wanna do is ride with you
(All I want, all I want)
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is die for you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is ride with you
(All I want, all I want)
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is die for you (all I want)

'Cause your love is so infectious
'Cause you tell me I'm the bestest
'Cause your love is so infectious
Tell me, tell me I'm the bestest

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come feel my heart beating
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't tell me that you're leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, don't tell me that you're leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Unless I'm leaving, too

All I wanna do, all I wanna do is ride with you
(All I want, all I want)
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is die for you (all I want)

'Cause your love is so infectious
'Cause you tell me I'm the bestest
'Cause your love is so infectious
Tell me, tell me I'm the bestest
