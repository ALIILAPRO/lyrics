		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't let you go
Before I make up my mind 
You will see who I am
And you will hate it in time 
But I could let you love me 
Like I was made of glass
I could let you fantasize 
But that will never last

'Cause I only love you 
When you leave
And I will let it drop 
Before it gets real

You can try your dirty words 
And you can try on your knees 
And I will do my very best
But the world ain't ideal
And you can go ahead
You can make up your mind 
But it's all in my hands now 
It's my head wasting time

Maybe if we act like 
More of a kind
Then we could roll along 
And it will be a decent life 
But every other flower
Is a shot in the dark every time 
It's growing something else falls apart

So washed out now 
No love can stay 
Forever is too far
To fade away

You can try your dirty words 
And you can try on your knees
And I will do my very best
But the world ain't ideal
And you can go ahead
You can make up your mind 
But it's all in my hands now 
It's my head wasting time

Whatever I say now
Don't come at me
We both know it's wrong 
So just let me have it
