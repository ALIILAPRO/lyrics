		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch

Where she at? Where she at?
Where she at? Where she at? Where she at?
There she go, there she go
There she go, there she go, there she go
What she do? What she do?
What she do? What she do? What she do?
Too much, watchy-watchy
Watchin' me, watchin', watchin' you

Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your business-ness-ness

Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch

Too much looky-looky, get up off me
Too much watchy, whoa
Hands up in the cookie jar
They watchin' me, they watchin' ya
They got eyes up in the sky
So pose for that camera
They follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow, follow me

Uptown, downtown, everywhere I turn around
Hollywood, London, snap-snap is the sound
Paparazzi shot me, I am the economy
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow, follow me

Where she at? Where she at?
Where she at? Where she at? Where she at?
There she go, there she go
There she go, there she go, there she go
What she do? What she do?
What she do? What she do? What she do?
Too much, watchy-watchy
Watchin' me, watchin', watchin' you

Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your business-ness-ness

Mind your business, bitch (mind your business, bitch)
Mind your business, bitch (mind your business, bitch)
Mind your business, bitch (mind your business, bitch)
Mind your business, bitch

T-t-t-t-too much looky-looky
I'm so sick of all these looky-loos
Everybody lookin' at me like I was the breakin' news
Police gotta stay, watchin' every step I take
Every move I make, every breath I take (ha, ha, ha)

If they don't get up out my face, then send the dogs out (woof)
Five seconds and then the dogs come out (woof)
You know what happens when the dogs come out
None of your business-ness

Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B
Mind your B
Mind your business-ness-ness
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B (mind your B, bitch)
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B (mind your B, bitch)
Mind your B
Mind your B, mind your B, mind your B (mind your B, bitch)
Mind your B
Mind your business-ness-ness
(Bitch)
