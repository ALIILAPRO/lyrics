		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a piano in the sky
I hear it playing all the time
There's a rope I'm holding tight
I dream of falling every night

I'm tired of thinking that I don't deserve you
I'm dreading the day when you let me go

So take all this love from me
I don't want to feel anymore
Just take this heart of me
You had every part of me
I'll be fine, I promise

Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say
There's a way to live without me, baby
Too late, too late, it's all too late
So I'll stay 'til I break

There's a boy who reads my mind
A love so dark is hard to hide
I know he knows I'm scared of heights
And still he only wants to climb

I'm tired of thinking that I don't deserve him
I'm dreading the day when he lets me go

So take all this love from me
I don't want to feel anymore
Just take this heart of me
You had every part of me
I'll be fine, I promise

Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say
There's a way to live without me, baby
Too late, too late, it's all too late
'Cause my blood has turned to ice already

Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say
There's a way to live without me, baby
Too late, too late, it's all too late
So I'll stay 'til we break
