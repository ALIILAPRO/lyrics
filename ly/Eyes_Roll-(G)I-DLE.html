		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard to handle best be careful
When you work that ass
Better grip my wheel at ten
Until you 'bout to crash
Keep your eyes on me
Push the start now go full speed
Lock it, lock it down, baby
You about to fall to your knees

She a work of art
She gon' break your heart (she gon' break your heart)
She a work of art
She gon' break your heart (she gon' break your heart)
She gon' fuck you up
But you love that part (love that part)
She a work of art
And she gon' make your eyes roll

Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
She gon', she gon' make your eyes roll
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
She gon' make your eyes roll

She gon' make your eyes roll
She gon' make your eyes roll

Make ya eyes roll back to your brain
So good light you up no propane
Go ahead say my name
Glide on it, baby, that hydroplane
La-la-la, in your own melody
Use what you got put that work on me
All night, no, we ain't gon' sleep
She rock that boat and she love that speed go, go

She a work of art
She gon' break your heart (she gon' break your heart)
She a work of art
She gon' break your heart (she gon' break your heart)
She gon' fuck you up
But you love that part (love that part)
She a work of art
She gon', she gon' make your eyes roll

Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back (ayy, ayy)
She gon', she gon' make your eyes roll (make your eyes roll back)
Back, back, back, back (oh-oh, oh)
Back, back, back, back (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Back, back, back, back
She gon' make your eyes roll

She gon' make your eyes roll
She gon' make your eyes roll

Once I get you here
You will never leave
I can take you higher
Nothing you've ever seen
Once I get you close
I can then proceed
Looking up at me boy
A fantasy
Hypnotic, exotic
He's flying, I'm the pilot
And when you do it like that to me
I can't keep it quiet
No silence, apply it
That pressure, boy, I want it
So light me up that five-o
'Bout to make your eyes roll

Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
She gon', she gon' make your eyes roll (back)
Back, back, back, back (oh-oh, oh)
Back, back, back, back (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Back, back, back, back
She gon' make your eyes roll
She gon' make your eyes roll
She gon' make your eyes roll
