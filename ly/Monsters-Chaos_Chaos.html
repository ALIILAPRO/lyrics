		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The fun is over
But the floor is spinning
You're not by my side tonight
I just wanna say "Sorry"
You promised me
That you wouldn't cry
And now I have to say goodbye, 
Now I have to say goodbye

Nightlight in my bed, not safe and sound in my own head
Light won't keep my shadow away
Are you okay?
There's monsters in my head
And there's nothin', nothin' you can do

I left the party
With glitter still in my hair
Should have stayed home tonight
But you knew that I'd come
We were drinking in your friend's room
There was nothing to regret yet
There was nothing to regret
Until you tried to kiss me on the bed

You broke your promise
You broke something too

Nightlight in my bed, not safe and sound in my own head
Light won't keep my shadow away
Are you okay?
There's monsters in my head
And there's nothin', baby nothin' you can do
You're never givin' up, yeah 
You're never givin' up, yeah
You're never givin' up
You gotta keep on living
The world keeps spinning

(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

Nightlight in my bed, not safe and sound in my own head
Light won't keep my shadow away
Are you okay?
There's monsters in my head
And there's nothin', nothin' you can do
There's monsters in my head
And there's nothin', nothin' you can do
There's monsters in my head
And there's nothin', nothin' you can do
There's monsters in my head
And there's nothin' you can do
