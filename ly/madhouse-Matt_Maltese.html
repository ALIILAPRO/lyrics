		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home, home sweet home live, laugh, love
These are some things written by the phone
On the wall of this home

Located on nowhere avenue
Don’t understand how everyone
Lives inside their head

Multi-colored ornaments in people’s houses
Make me feel like
No one out there understands me
Well, that’s half the battle baby
Continental condiments in peoples houses
Make me happy
Can't you tell me why I'm empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby

Memes, beauty dreams, self help schemes
These are some things I can sit and read
Every dark, every tweet
Reckons with the different same old time
Confused in tide
While everyone powers on with life

Multi-colored ornaments in people’s houses
Make me feel like
No one out there understands me
Well, that’s half the battle baby
Continental condiments in peoples houses
Make me happy
Can't you tell me why I'm empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby

Home sweet home, live laugh love

Multi-colored ornaments in people’s houses
Make me feel like
I’m the only one who’s out here
Everybody feels like that kid
Continental condiments in people’s houses
Make me happy
Can’t you tell me why I’m empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
