		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You taught me everything
And everything you've given me
I'll always keep it inside
You're the driving force in my life, yeah

There isn't anything
Or anyone that I could be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side

You were there for me to love and care for me
When skies were gray
Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me

And no one else can be
What you have been to me, you will always be
You will always be the girl
In my life for all times

Mama, mama, you know I love you
(You know I love you)
Mama, mama, you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars, yes, it is
Mama, I just want you to know, lovin' you is like food to my soul
Yes it is, yes it is, oh, yes it is, yes it is, yes it is, oh

You're always there for me
Have always been around for me, even when I was bad
You showed me right from my wrong
Yes, you did

And you took up for me
When everyone was downin' me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on

There were so many times
Looking back when I was so afraid
And then you'd come to me and say to me
I could face anything

And no one else can do
What you have done for me
You'll always be, you will always be
The girl in my life, ooh, oh

Mama, mama, you know I love you
(You know I love you, you know I love you)
Mama, mama, you're the queen of my heart (you are)
Your love is like tears from the stars
(Your love is like tears from the stars)
Mama, I just want you to know (ooh, mama I just want you to know)
Lovin' you is like food to my soul

Never gonna go a day without you
Fills me up just thinkin' about you
I'll never go a day without my mama

Mama, mama, you know I love you
Mama, mama, you're the queen of my heart (the queen of my heart)
Your love is like tears from the stars
(Your love is like tears from the stars)
Mama, I just want you to know
Lovin' you is like food to my soul

Lovin' you is like food to my soul, oh yeah
You are the food to my soul, yes, you are
