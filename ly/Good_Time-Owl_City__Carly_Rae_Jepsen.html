		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh, oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time

Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time
Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time (good time, good time)
(It's always a good time)
(Whoa oh oh oh)

Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time
Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time
Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Doesn't matter where
It's always a good time there
Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
(It's always a good time)

Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time
Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time
Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

(Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
It's always a good time
Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
