		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pick me, pick me, yeah
Let a low, long signal
At ease at least, yeah
Everyone is hollow

Pick me, pick me yeah
Everyone is waiting
Pick me, pick me, yeah
You can even pay them

Hey, dive, dive, dive
Dive in me
Dive, dive, dive
Dive in me, dive in me
Dive in me, dive in me

Kiss this, kiss that, yeah
Let a low, long signal
At ease, at ease, yeah
You can be my hero

Pick me, pick me, yeah
Everyone is waiting
Hit me, hit me, yeah
I'm real good at hating

Hey, dive, dive, dive
Dive in me
Dive, dive, dive
Dive in me, dive in me
Dive in me, dive in me

Dive, dive, dive
Dive in me
Dive, dive, dive
Dive in me
Dive, dive, dive
Dive in me, dive in me
Dive in me, dive in me
Dive in me, dive in me
Dive in me
