		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like Paris fashion show
New York, Rio, Tokyo
I like the D, I like the G
I like my Louis and my V
I like peaches, I like cream
I like sweet delicious dreams!
I like fizzy cool champagne
I like that! I don't know your name!

I like clubs, I like strobes
I like it loud, I like it hot
I like track, I like drop
I like the cherry on the top!
I like sexy, sexy sound
I like it dirty on the ground
I like when it gets me high
I like to lift my freak flag fly
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like
I like!

I like to walk on the Crossett
I like to roll in king size beds
I like it down in Hollywood
I like that music feels so good!
I like bad boy movie stars
I like red lighted boulevards
I like the sound of crazy beats
My red stilettos hit the street!
Lipstick red like cherry pop
Flaunt my booty let it drop!
I like the sound that rocks my hips
I like the beach and skinny dips

But what really sucks me up
Are paparazzi who don't stop
And this guy's name is Chuck
He followed me into the club
So I just don't give a fuck
Tonight I'll dance, I'll drink, I'll rock
I'll rock, I'll rock, I'll rock
I'll rock, I'll rock, I'll rock
I'll rock, I'll rock, I'll rock!

I like clubs, I like strobes
I like it loud, I like it hot
I like track, I like drop
I like the cherry on the top!
Lipstick red like cherry pop
Flaunt my booty let it drop!
I like the sound that rocks my hips
I like the beach and skinny dips

But what really sucks me up
Are paparazzi who don't stop
And this guy's name is Chuck
He followed me into the club
So I just don't give a fuck
Tonight I'll dance, I'll drink, I'll rock
I'll rock, I'll rock, I'll rock
I'll rock, I'll rock, I'll rock
I'll rock, I'll rock, I'll rock!
