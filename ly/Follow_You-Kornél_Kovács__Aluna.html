		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You peel away the layers
One by one, yeah
We put them in the air
And all we do is watch them climb
And all you see that's left is mine
And all we do is watch them climb
And all you see that's left is mine

And it's true
In my soul, you can always trust me
Though it seems cold, I will follow you down
I'll stay always yours and I will follow you down

Your time will come around
You've gotta help out
I see your high
But I know the tide will take us slow away
And all they do is watch us fade
And all they do is watch us fade
And all they do is watch us fade
Don't worry

And it's true
In my soul, you can always trust me
Though it seems cold, I will follow you down
I'll stay always yours and I will follow you down
It's all good
Look in my eyes and see what you need
Though it seems distant, I'll follow you down
I'll stay always yours and I will follow you down

And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up

And it's true
In my soul, you can always trust me
Though it seems cold, I will follow you down
I'll stay always yours and I will follow you down
It's all good
Look in my eyes and see what you need
Though it seems distant, I'll follow you down
I'll stay always yours and I will follow you down

And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up

And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up

And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up
And I'll pull you up
Yeah, I'll pull you up

And I'll
