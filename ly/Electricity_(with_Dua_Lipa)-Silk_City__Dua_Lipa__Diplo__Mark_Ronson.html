		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel when I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm seethrough

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you
You know I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
I don't know what I do
Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I'd be bittersweet

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you
You know I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know, ooh
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
Electricity, I'm flowing into you
I feel electric, baby (I want it, I need it)
So electric, baby (this current between us)
Wanna let you know, let you know (this flow, this feeling)
I think I'm ready, baby (I want it, I need it)
I think I'm ready, now (this current between us)
Electricity, I'm flowing into you (this flow, this feeling)

Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you
You know I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know (I want it, I need it)
I think I'm ready, baby (this current between us)
I think I'm ready, now (this flow, this feeling)
Electricity (woohoo)
I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
Electricity
