		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even when I lose, I win
Even when I fail to place
When I fall off the map and disappear without a trace
Even when I can't breathe in
And I'm falling out of line
And everybody 'round me says that everything gon' be alright

See the light
See the light
See the light
I see the light

I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light

Even when I feel I'm falling
And there ain't no one to catch
Feeling weightless even though I did my best
Even when I know I'm crying, I'm smiling on the side
'Cause I know everything gon' be alright

I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light

I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on, on

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on, on, yeah

See the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light

I see the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light

I see the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light (everybody that don't see the light)
See the light (everybody that don't see the light)
I see the light

I see the light (hold on)
See the light (hold on)
See the light (hold on)
See the light (hold on, on)

See the light (hold on)
See the light (hold on)
See the light (hold on)
See the light (hold on, on)

See the light
