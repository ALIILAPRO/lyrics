		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we used to be inseparable
And the late nights sitting by the fire
We'd fall asleep knowing we would wake up by each other's side
We never had the fear that we were losing time
Remember the sound of the voice that would call our name
A sense of comfort fell upon our heart
Now the voice fades in the distance
A life changed in an instant
I can't look at you because it's tearing me apart
 
I know you want us to be together
I know it's hard to accept forever
Our delusion is the easy way out
But it's time for both of us to let this go
 
I didn't mean to hold you back from moving on
I understand that we can't keep going on like this
Can I just have one last moment to say goodbye
I need to feel them against me one last time
 
And I know you want us to be together
I know it's hard to accept forever
Our delusion is the easy way out
But it's time for both of us to let this go

And I know you want us to be together
I know it's hard to accept forever
Our delusion is the easy way out
But it's time for both of us to let this go
