		  Ear Drummers
Man, this crazy as fuck
You said you was talkin' about what?
I got nothin', man
I got nothin' on my mind
Nah, straight like that, though
Mike WiLL Made-It

Ain't got nothin' for no nothin', nothin' gets to me too close
Ain't got nothin' for no nothin' ho, lil' bitch be doin' the most
I was duckin' bullets, shootouts, me and my guys design your porch
Look in your eyes and I see ho, don't be surprised when you see smoke
Ain't got nothin' for no nothin', nothin' gets to me too close
Ain't got nothin' for no nothin' ho, lil' bitch be doin' the most
I was duckin' bullets, shootouts, me and my gangsters at your porch
Look in your eyes and I see ho, don't be surprised when you see smoke, bitch

Yeah, come through, yeah
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come? (Yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
Just want me to come through, come through
You just want a young nigga to come through (you must want a nigga to come)

Damn the bih' 'bout dumb as a box of rocks
Dawg I just get them socks
Find out lil' bitty be the opps
You can't be G and be the cops (yeah)
I can't play myself out like that
Fuck these hoes, keep gettin' that dope
Slippers countin' mine won't be tryin' get no pussy, somethin' I know
I was down bad on my luck, my dawg like three sum summers ago
Ain't shit been sweet, but neither's me so my bitch need 300 or more
I keep guns and ganja close, I keep funds, but I don't boast
I know what it's like to not have shit, it ain't a bitch I owe
Ain't no fuck nigga gon' try me without sayin' I went in his shit (fuck nigga)
Ain't no fuck nigga gon' disrespect the gang or try my bitch (fuck nigga)
Box you straight up out that '68 whip, what I'm with you gettin' dismissed
I give a fed a Jadakiss I rep that north for facin' shit, Skoob

Yeah, come through, yeah
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come? (Yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come, what time?
Come through (oh, yeah)
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come?
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come

I was slidin', vibin', ridin' 285 just in my thoughts
Do I need go hit this lick? Ain't got no time to be gettin' caught
I can't leave my folks down bad like that, guess I'm just gon' slow roll it
Partner say he got OG in the 3, that's where I'm rollin'
Focus, nigga, need to focus, mo, that's Motrin, ain't no purp
You ain't gon' fuck me up like that, step on my shit, bitch, you'll get murked
Few were out there in the bluff, Eastside just might see me in dirt
A two-piece snack in one piece skirts
Can't turn me down, this ain't that vert
Got all 12, was on recurr
Got off them bails, you hella hurt
Got up e'rytime, I failed to do
Got up e'rytime, I failed the dirt
You lil' bitches failed to mention when you gossip in your kitchen
How I held shit down since prison, how I held shit down in trenches huh

Yeah, come through, yeah
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come? (Yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come
Come through (oh, yeah)
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come?
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come

Yeah, yeah, yeah
What time you want a nigga to come, yeah
Come through
You must want a nigga to come
Come through
Oh, yeah
What time you want a nigga to come
Come through
Yeah, you must want a nigga to come
