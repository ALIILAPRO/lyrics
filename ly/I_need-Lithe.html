		  Shorty, yeah, she worried if I might show

Let's go, I got money on me (Yeah)
New city, new bitch, new keys, yeah
Missed calls finna rain on me

But a nigga still breathin'
Sayin' my prayers for the check
Straight shooter likе I'm walkin'
With a TEC
Move deep and I'm pounding on my chest, uh
You know, you know, you know what I want
You know what I need
Ice cold bitch whеn I'm sippin' my tea
I don't mean to I don't mean to
I don't mean to (Mm)
Feelin' myself, fillin' my needs
Feel like repercussions ain't gon'
Ever catch me

I ain't ever gon' rest
Never gonna test me, Check me

Touch down in the Matrix, yeah
Shorty, send me your location now
One-twenty on the freeway, speedin'
(Yeah! Yeah)
Big checks, blue pills, I'm fiending
(Yeah! Yeah) young boy finna do my thing
Get the FBI, put a case on me (I don't)
Feel like everything gon' cave on me
Shorty, hold on, have faith in me, yeah (Mm)
