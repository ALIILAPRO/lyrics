		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is a haunted house, full of ghosts
Don't go in the basement
My heart is a haunted house,
I have my doubts you'll get out alive

The windows creak when the wind blows in
gravestones are so cold
Just shadows in the attic and TV static,
bodies in the walls growing mold

My heart is a haunted house, full of ghosts
Don't go in the basement
My heart is a haunted house,
I have my doubts you'll get out alive

In a trick door, hidden in a hallway,
I will lock my love for you
In a secret passage, a pit of acid,
I'll be true, I'll be true

My heart is a haunted house, full of ghosts
Don't go in the basement
My heart is a haunted house,
I have my doubts you'll get out alive

But you can try
You can try
