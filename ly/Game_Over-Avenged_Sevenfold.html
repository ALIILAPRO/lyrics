		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open, blurry, nurture, loving
Crawling, walking, fleeting, glory
Welcome, brother, stranger, bloody
Ally, teacher, recess, buddy
Secret, toothless, fairy, pillow
Money, kissing, nervous, hero
Warmly ordinary

This daytime TV satisfies
Extra ordinary
These hand-me-downs worn in so nice

As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
Days are fine and come on time
But years leave with nothing to find

Changes, hormones, high school, threesome
Roll call, study, license, freedom
Novice, flirting, first time, lover
Party, fighting, wasted, summer
Questions, doubtful, wedding, family
Happy, ever, after, dead end
Daily iteration

The bestest part of waking up
Mundane ideation
This dark roast got me (so fucked up)

As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
Days, they come and days, they go
Until no more days set you free

Well on my way, my way to lose me

It strikes me that I don't belong here anymore
As I observe my own reflection, try a happy face
Staring through the warm tears, a sad frown from the cold years
Adieu, I never had the will, anyway

Toss a rope over the branch and fall into the night
And here I swing, from my family tree
Say goodnight

Can't you see?
Life is but a dream, anyway
