		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

I remember sleepin' on my brother couch
Yeah, with a couple thou'
Now look at me now, we don't even be speakin' no more
Stack that paper like a fill-out form 
Yeah, know I'll just be fine
Pray to God, he takes his time but name a nigga who be on time

You a fan, so you fantasize? 
Juwanna Man, y'all nigga be lyin'
Hood legend, my city be wildin'
I'm in the trenches, I'm on the benches
With the family, extended
Nigga Yankees, how I fit in
Like NAV, it's been a minute
Make 'em, mad? But I didn't
You know I'm up, no snooze
Ice on me like hockey dudes
Watch 12, yeah, we watch news, man
Hit-stick, combos, I got moves
Can't swim but she gon' pool
Chain too cold, I keep my cool
Money talk, it be so rude, fresh to death like Beetlejuice
Stack it up, I want my check
Will Smith, yeah, you know I'm fresh
It's a stake for cheese like Philly
Moncler on when I feel chilly
Aw, man, damn, my pockets swollen, yeah
Aw, man, my pockets full of blue old mans, yeah
She wanna order take-out but it's still go in
Fuckin' on babygirl, she give her all back
I do not live by the water but girl is an ocean
We do not play no football, what is the motion?
Nigga mad we rich as fuck, you mad at your own skin
Hey, Matilda, I moved the doough, yeah, with no hands
Yeah, I jumped off the porch, I didn't wanna hold hands
Yeah, growin' up in the hood as a kid, you become a grown man

I remember sleepin' on my brother couch
Yeah, with a couple thou'
Now look at me now, we don't even be speakin' no more
Stack that paper like a fill-out form 
Yeah, know I'll just be fine
Pray to God, he takes his time but name a nigga who be on time
I remember sleepin' on my brother couch
Yeah, with a couple thou'
Now look at me now, we don't even be speakin' no more
Stack that paper like a fill-out form 
Yeah, know I'll just be fine
Pray to God, he takes his time but name a nigga who be on time

Yeah, I'm on the block, yeah with the runts
We got opps, so I stunt, see us ball like I dunk
I go hard, we go up, niggas mad 'cause they suck
I'm in the crib, my bitch roll up, Murakami pillow when we lay up
Boy you fake, David Blaine, remember I used to take the train
Scared to get off at my stop, boy, you scared to meet the gang
I'm in the hood, I don't tuck my chain, ask Siri, what's my name
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
It was hard man, I got all these scars I could show
If you saw me, you would understand why we ho
They had no faith, I remember when we was broke
These hoes rotate, that's why I can't save none of these hoes
They had the trap beatin', wonderin' why its J's at the door
I was uncomfortable, it's so many roaches on the floor
My grandma across the street, she don't want us stayin' over no more
I had to get on my feet, I didn't wanna stay there no more

I remember sleepin' on my brother couch
Yeah, with a couple thou'
Now look at me now, we don't even be speakin' no more
Stack that paper like a fill-out form 
Yeah, know I'll just be fine
Pray to God, he takes his time but name a nigga who be on time
I remember sleepin' on my brother couch
Yeah, with a couple thou'
Now look at me now, we don't even be speakin' no more
Stack that paper like a fill-out form 
Yeah, know I'll just be fine
Pray to God, he takes his time but name a nigga who be on time

When I say, "Yo, Pi'erre", y'all say "Come out here"
Yo, Pi'erre, come out here
Yo, Pi'erre, come out here
Yo, Pi'erre, come out here
Yo, Pi'erre, come out here
Yo, Pi'erre, come out here
What? What? What? 
Yo, Pi'erre, come out here (it don't matter, they don't give a damn)
When I say, "Pierre", y'all say "Bourne"
Pi'erre, Bourne, Pi'erre, Bourne, P'ierre, Bourne
When I say, "Soss", y'all say "House"
Soss, House, Soss, House, Soss, House
Alright I'm bouta go I love y'all
I love y'all so much, thank you
If y'all wanna cop some merch-
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy hol' up, if you wanna get some merch-
Fuck with me, if you want to, you know what I'm sayin'
I love y'all I'll be back soon
