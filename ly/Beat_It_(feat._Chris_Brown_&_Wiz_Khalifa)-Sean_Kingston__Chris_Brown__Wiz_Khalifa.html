		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He ain't fly though, he don't even drive though
(That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone)
He ain't even fly though, you ain't gotta lie though
(That's why you're calling my phone)
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat

I've been out here looking for a girl like you
So already settled down and loyal to your dude
(You got your eyes on me, and girl, he got his eyes on you)
(My eyes are on this money and it's nothing he can do)

He ain't fly though, he don't even drive though
(That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone)
He ain't even fly though, you ain't gotta lie though
(That's why you're calling my phone)
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat

You've been out here looking for a guy like me
And I ain't never settled down, just loyal to my team
(You got your eyes on me, and girl, I got my eyes on green)
(Your nigga he so bummy, need to a boost your self-esteem)

He ain't fly though, he don't even drive though
(That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone)
He ain't even fly though, you ain't gotta lie though
(That's why you're calling my phone)
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat

You say you want a fly nigga
Roll something and get high nigga
I'm spending all the most and if he ain't coming close
It's time that you tell him bye, I'll take you up in the sky
We be floating, get you wet like the ocean
I'ma speed up on it and if your pussy was a book I'ma read up on it
Girl, I'm just trying to get you back to my crib
Seen all them Instagram pictures you post so I already know what it is
Talk to me now

He ain't fly though, he don't even drive though
(That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone)
He ain't even fly though, you ain't gotta lie though
(That's why you're calling my phone)
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat
