		  Know to let that MAC fly just like my nigga Dough (hit them ankles)
Throw a stack, where its at
Touch your ankles, throw a stack
Throw a stack, throw a stack
Throw them racks, hit them ankles
Know it's fat, where its at
Touch your ankles, throw a stack
Throw a stack, throw a stack

Let's move I'ma make it shake (okay)

Can't sit still 'cause something finna shake (money)
Not in a minute not tomorrow but today, aye (take)

All that hard work and it still ain't keeping up (where?)
These bitches mad 'cause they don't do enough 
That boy mad 'cause he ain't getting none
Bitch don't try it I ain't ever been the one (no way)
Broke ass bitch I won't argue with no bum
Tay money cutthroat so you better watch your tongue

She on her ass somebody come and get her (girl)
Hurricane Tay I can make it rain wherever (money)
You can ask my momma, shit, I been like this forever

Oh, now you think I'm crazy but I'm still the same bitch (yeah)
Still the same bitch (for real), still, still the same bitch (for real)
Throw them racks, hit them ankles (for real)

Touch your ankles, throw a stack (throw it)
Throw a stack, throw a stack (throw it)
Throw them racks, hit them ankles (shake, shake)
Know it's fat, where its at (duh) (shake, shake)
Touch your ankles, throw a stack (shake, shake)
Throw a stack, throw a stack (money)

Let's move I'ma make it shake (okay)
Not tomorrow but today (money)
Can't sit still 'cause something finna shake (money)
Not in a minute not tomorrow but today, aye
We gonna make it shake, baby (what?)

How you gon hate when you can't even get in, aye
That was back then money hanging off the rim (money)
How a man gon fold but a bitch never bend (I swear)
I ain't never switching up I ain't never giving in
Everything that I said bitch I did (I did)
I ain't worried 'bout going back broke 'cause I never was (where)
Every time my hands touch a bag it's gon double up (where)
Don't compare me to nobody 'cause bitch I'm one of one (one of one)
Real bitches want money freak bitches want to fuck
Shake it like a bottle (yeah)
Walk in like a model (okay)
Shut up bitch swallow see your ass tomorrow (yeah, tight)

Let's move I'ma make it shake (okay)
Not tomorrow but today
Can't sit still 'cause something finna shake (yeah)
Not in a minute not tomorrow but today, aye (you better)
We gonna make it shake, baby (aye)
Lemme see you shake, aye (shake)
Shake aye, shake aye
