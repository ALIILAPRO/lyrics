		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
You don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every step that I take is another mistake to you

I-I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do is be more like me
And be less like you

You

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
You're holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Is falling apart right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do is be more like me
And be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do is be more like me
And be less like you
