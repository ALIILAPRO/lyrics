		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were a joke on the porch passing smoke back and forth, shitty timing
Three stems of aster, a dried up disaster all left in the binding
Papa, is that you, or the hairpin bulb loose in the dining?
I don't need to be reminded I'm dying

Antidepressant, sedated the second I look at him smiling
Biblical name, go on, fill me with shame, I got a silver lining
He takes off his shoes, carries me through the blues to the island
We're almost there, but I still have dreams where I wake from your bedroom crying

Falling asleep at the wheel and I'll die before dialing
New year resolve to be nice again, momma I'm trying
Take me back Ana, the library manifesting something more exciting
What I would give to go back there and live in the pages of your handwriting
