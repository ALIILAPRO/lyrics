		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Los Angeles approach control
This is Cessna 0281-Echo-119.3, over
Cessna 81-Echo, Los Angeles approach control, roger, go ahead
Cessna 81-Echo is over the Compton Airport, 5-2 at 5000
Requesting ground controlled approach to the Los Angeles Airport, over
81-Echo, Los Angeles approach controlled, roger
Radar identification, turn right, heading 0-3-0

I got mo' class than most of 'em, ran wit' the best of 'em
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
What can I say? Cal-i-forn-I-A
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit' my shit off safety - for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'Cause from Eazy-E, to DOC, to DPG
Started from that SOB, DRE
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer, nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' the Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers Jeeps and Regals

Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes Jeeps and Geos

I bust a Mr Toughy, slash a Smoothy Doobie
Crash and flex on Tuesday's, harassin' hoes at movies
Passin' by with uzis, hey, who you aimin' at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-tat-tat-tat

I don't sympathize for whack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hittman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
Tryin' to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm LA's loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get
Hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' hard, Hittman and Dre
You playin' games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit' crews
That's sick, Aftermath cause we rule shit
I'm big Hitt, don't confuse me wit' no other by the flow, motherfucker

Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers Jeeps and Regals

Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes Jeeps and Geos

You look like AC Green
Bitch, don't call here anymore
With feet like Ben Vereen's
Bitch, don't call here anymore
No no, no no

What up? It's Hittman
I ain't at the crib right now
So you can leave your name and number after the beep
Unless it's Tammie's ugly ass, I ain't fuckin' with you
