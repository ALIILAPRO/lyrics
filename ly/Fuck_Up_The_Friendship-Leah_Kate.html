		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you gonna kiss me?
'Cause you're takin' me home
It's four in the mornin'
Are we doin' this wrong?
This weekend I saw you
Through eyes that are new
You got me fallin' for you
And I kinda want to

(Ah)
Tell me what you mean, is it all me?
(Ah)
Start to overthink everything
(Ah)
When you're close to me, I can't breathe
(Ah)
We're already six-feet deep

Let's fuck up the friendship
Come get in my head
Baby, cut the tension
I'm hung by a thread
Maybe it's somethin'
But let's not pretend
Or maybe it's nothin'
And this is the end

We could never be (oh no)
We could never be friends
We could never be (oh no)
We could never be friends

It got kind of scary
My bones always knew
Oh, I didn't mean to
Are you feelin' this too?

(Ah)
Tell me what you mean, is it all me?
(Ah)
Start to overthink everything
(Ah)
When you're close to me, I can't breathe
(Ah)
We're already six-feet deep

Let's fuck up the friendship
Come get in my head
Baby, cut the tension
I'm hung by a thread
Maybe it's somethin'
But let's not pretend
Or maybe it's nothin'
And this is the end

We could never be (oh no)
We could never be friends
We could never be (oh no)
We could never be friends

On the edge of my seat
I'll wait for the outcome
If we ever have one (if we ever have one)
Let me take the lead (oh)
You follow me closely
But come on and show me (come on and show me)

Let's fuck up the friendship
Come get in my head
Baby, cut the tension (baby, cut the tension)
I'm hung by a thread
Maybe it's somethin'
But let's not pretend
Or maybe it's nothin'
And this is the end (woo)

We could never be (oh no)
We could never be friends
We could never be (oh no)
We could never be friends
