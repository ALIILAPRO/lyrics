		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Winter snow is falling down
Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on
Like a fairy tale come true

Sittin' by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed
I would find someone
And, baby, I found you

And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away and I'm thankful everyday, for the gift

Watching as you softly sleep
What I'd give if I could keep
Just this moment
If only time stood still

But the colors fade away
And the years will make us gray
But, baby, in my eyes
You'll still be beautiful

And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away and I'm thankful everyday, for the gift

And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away I'm thankful everyday
Can't find the words to say thank you, for the gift
