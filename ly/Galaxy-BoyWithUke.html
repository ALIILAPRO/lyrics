		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder why I feel I’m on top of the moon
Oh, wait, it’s 'cause of you
I fill my cup with apple juice
Sunday morning watching cartoons
Baby, I don’t wanna go home tonight
Let me stay with you, it’s 4 am
And your dads come in

'Cause I don’t get spooked easily
Looked on tv, I swear I saw your eyes
I was watching documentaries
Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky

Have you ever wondered like I do?
And had those sleepless nights
It’s when I think of you
Have you ever wondered like I do?
Wish I could fly my kite
And wake up next to you

'Cause I don’t get spooked еasily
Looked on tv, I swear I saw your eyеs
I was watching documentaries
Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky
'Cause I don’t get spooked easily
(I'll always hurt for you)
Looked on tv, I swear I saw your eyes
(I'll never lie to you)
I was watching documentaries
(You'll always be)
Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky
(My galaxy, galaxy)

(I'll always hurt for you)
(I'll never lie to you)
(You'll always be my galaxy, galaxy)
