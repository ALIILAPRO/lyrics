		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will always love you
I will always love from here
I will never see you
I will never see you clear

I'm in a perfect space
Please come design me soon
I'm in a perfect space
I hate to judge but I do

You my robot boo
I believe in terrestrial angels
Believe in the power of one
I believe in life ever-changing
Believe that we are not done
I believe in the passion of neighbors
Believe in the danger of guns
I believe you can dig yourself out
I believe you can wait 'til I come

We're just human sand
We're just human sand
We're just

You will always cut me
You will always cut me here
You will never have me
You will never have my fear

I'm in a perfect space
Spend all the day on a Zoom
I'm in a perfect space
Look at the size of my room

You my robot boo
I believe in terrestrial angels
Believe in the power of one
I believe in life ever-changing
Believe that we are not done
I believe in the passion of neighbors
Believe in the danger of guns
I believe you can dig yourself out
I believe you can wait 'til I come

We're just human sand
We're just human sand
We're just

The sand is years of our lives
Hail to the mistakes
The sand is years of our lives
You've tried but we don't break

I believe in terrestrial angels
Believe in the power of one
I believe in life ever-changing
Believe that we are not done

We're just human sand
These are the things on my mind
We're just human sand
Will we be alright?
We're just human sand
These are the things on my mind
We're just human sand
Will we be alright?
We're just human sand
