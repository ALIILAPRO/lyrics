		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know all my secrets
You know all my pain
Can I see you again?
Can I be with you again?

I've been falling to pieces
Listen to me say
I wanna see you again
Can I be with you again?

I've been worshiping you
But it's been too dark to see
While I've been down on my knees
You ain't been worshiping me
I've been worshiping you
But it's been too dark to see
While I've been down on my knees
You ain't been worshiping me

Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord

You know all my secrets
You know all my pain
Can I see you again?
Can I be with you again?

I've been falling to pieces
Listen to me say
I wanna see you again
Can I be with you again?

I've been worshiping you
But it's been too dark to see
While I've been down on my knees
You ain't been worshiping me
I've been worshiping you
But it's been too dark to see
While I've been down on my knees
You ain't been worshiping me

Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord

Oh Lord
Oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love
While I've been down on my knees
You ain't been worshiping me
Oh Lord
Oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love
While I've been down on my knees
You ain't been worshiping me
