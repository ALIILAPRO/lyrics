		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who the pilot?
And my bitch eat me up when I'm driving
And I swear it's a show, not a riot
Uh

I was trippin', you was trippin', who the pilot?
And my bitch keep me up when I'm drivin'
And I swear it's a show, not a riot
And I had a nightmare last night that I wouldn't count it up
We had too many hoes in this bitch, I had to 'round 'em up
And I had too many hoes in my face, I had to cut 'em off
I done focus on my one-on-one
And I hope your pussy good as my bank account
What you said?

Ayy, bitch, can I break you off? Trunk wavin' at the mall
Hoes on your side of town hate when they ain't involved
Geeked on my brudda pack, beat and I'm overcharged (yeah)
Hurt, what I'm servin' in it, spread like the word of God (what you said?)
Fuck what a nigga do, reach for some inner peace
Geeked on my side of town, dope when I'm slidin' (bitch)
Ghost when I'm slidin' (bitch), Ghost when I'm slidin' (bitch)
Porsche when I'm slidin' (what you said?)

All the hoes with the shorts in ya ass
And you got the D'Usse fallin' out your glass
Old man don't want you in the club
'Cause your pussy poppin', start fights in the club
Come through in your new rental car
Bitches all in your face 'cause you a star
And you come with 'bout four, five hoes
Down to fight anything straight out the door

Roll but I make him eat up, yeah, yeah, yeah (on go)
Drunk but I make him drink up, yeah, yeah, yeah (he gone)
Real, I don't wanna sneak up, yeah, yeah (he gone)
Pop pills but I make him geek up, yeah, yeah, yeah (grrat)
Drunk on a Saturday, hoes get mad, hoes get mad (hoes get mad)
Dirt, it go that-a-way, ho be glad, ho be glad (ho be glad)
Real when you grind (yeah), real when you shine (yeah)
Drunk, drunk, drunk on a Saturday (on the way)
Lookin' bad when you spazz with yo' girls and yo' ass out
Bad like the girl from the Ave, goin' anti
Keep a bag, pop a tag, gon' let it air out
Drop it fast, let it spazz, gon' let your hair down
Shush when I say I get it done, when they speak, I sit up
Flip a pack and make a bun, when they done, I link up
Get ahead like you a geek, show no face if you discreet
Come and put this drink on me if you wanna link up (what you said?)

All the hoes with the shorts in ya ass
And you got the D'Usse fallin' out your glass
Old man don't want you in the club
'Cause your pussy poppin', start fights in the club
Come through in your new rental car
Bitches all in your face 'cause you a star
And you come with 'bout four, five hoes
Down to fight anything straight out the door
