		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now or later, I could plate ya
Suck a Skittle out the middle
She said she wanna taste my Lifesaver
I said "Pick the time and the flavor"
The sun's going down on us, baby
How about we return the favor?
Or we can hit the town from the back
You know she love it when we do it like that
You know I love when you confide in me
I hate when you keep shit to hide from me
I could smell it, you ain't gotta tell the lies
I can tell it on the terrace, tryna keep it magical, esoteric
Pick a star, I'ma pluck it out the sky, we can share it
Pinky promise like a AKA
You just wanna let your hair down
Snatch that wig off and let it air it out
Fine ass, we a perfect fit, let me wear it out

Purple Now-A-Later
Peachy star busting through your skirt
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
I can make your strawberry shine from across the Earth
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
Purple Now-A-Later
Peachy star busting through your skirt
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
I can make your strawberry shine from across the Earth
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work (hey)

Out of pocket, in my bag, do a lil' dance, pop a tag
Shawty got a booty 'cause she usually a juicy crab
I'ma take a jab, stab, take a stab at it
Strategy addict, I was passing mathematics with the flying colors
Rock the same flag as my dying brother
Wish he lived to see it, know I gotta fuck it up for ya
I'ma keep it gutta, ho, I'm out the gutter, still got the hunger
Been clutch, still getting clutch, oh, I can beat the buzzer
Every day I kill it like it try to beat my mother
I ain't rocking diamonds 'til none of my people suffer
Trying to feed the fam, I ain't plan to feed the culture but I do though
I can change your night as far as you know
Got the strippers going back to JUCO
Niggas so fake, so psuedo
Where was y'all at when we was in the street
Fighting niggas, flying through the Honda, no sumo?
Now you wanna kick it like judo
Say you got options, you don't know who though
I'm the best choice, I'ma leave it up to you though
And if you choose wrong you a punto, punta
Bitch, bye

Purple Now-A-Later
Peachy star busting through your skirt
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
I can make your strawberry shine from across the Earth
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
Purple Now-A-Later
Peachy star busting through your skirt
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
I can make your strawberry shine from across the Earth
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work

So this the Earth side, when I say, "Earth"
Say, "Earth" (Earth)
Say, "Earth" (Earth)
Here we go
Our side, we the Gang side
When I say, "Gang", say that shit back
Gang (Gang)
Gang (Gang)
Gang (Gang)
Gang

Purple Now-A-Later
Peachy star busting through your skirt
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
I can make your strawberry shine from across the Earth
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
Purple Now-A-Later
Peachy star busting through your skirt
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
I can make your strawberry shine from across the Earth
Can I put in work?
Oh, baby, I'ma put in work
