		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG, yeah
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me

I just caught a shawty off a finsta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like

I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Yeah

Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
I'm sorry

And, and, and, and
I'm outside in a
I'm, I'm, I'm
(I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm outside in a
I'm, I'm, I'm
(I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm outside in a
And, and, and, and I'm outside in a
I'm, I'm, I'm
(I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm)
I'm outside in a

Woi-oi, woi-oi, woi-oi, woi-oi, woi-oi, woi-oi
