		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heart over mind, yes I'm
My father's son
I live my life, just like
My father's done
If he'd've told me, one day
That somebody'd have my heart in chains
Would I believe it? No way
Made up my mind I'd never fall that way

But tell me why
Every time I try to tell you it's goodbye
I can't seem to let go
In my heart I know I want to stay
What I'm trying to say

Heart over mind
Yes I'm my father's son
And I'm inclined to do
As my father's done

Here I am with you
And I know that it's true
Despite all the feelings
You're putting me through
I try to walk away, something makes me stay

Heart over mind, yes I'm
My father's son
I live my life, just like
My father's done
But tell me why
Every time I try to tell you it's goodbye
I can't seem to let go
In my heart, I know I want to stay, what I'm trying to say

Heart over mind
Yes I'm my father's son
And I live my life just like
My father's done
If he had told me, one day
That somebody'd have my heart in chains 
Would I believe it? No way
Made up my mind, I'd never fall that way
Heart over mind, yes I'm 
My father's son
And I'm inclined to do
As my father's done
Heart over mind, yes I'm
My father's son
