		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, check, uh, I kind of miss my student loan
Uh, I miss sitting in the student home
Sharing stories now I simmer, sipping sorta wrong
Walking like I've been talking the talk but can't afford a phone
Trust, I'm all alone panicking to play it safe
This talk of paper chase is forcing me to stay awake
Living in sake of cake, yeah, others will say you're straight
Say they got my back and that they're praying Imma pave the way
Like it's the great escape brothers doing better than me
I'm in a hurry worry what if they forget about me?
I'm just another number nothing when the check will bounce
See now we're moving for money, but there's nothing but debt around me
So when the rest have found me buggin' in the brain
And I'm somewhere between the stricken and the strained
They ask why every fucking song the fucking same
And I tell them it's 'cause ain't nothing changed, saying ain't nothing changed

Check, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
No, 'cause ain't nothing changed
I'm saying ain't nothing changed

Uh, uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Brother, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
No, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed

'Cause this is for the men of the house who we're far too young
See your friends are growing up before you can't do nothing
You're raising funds for your mother and your can't-do sons
Up in the rubble raising trouble, what you can't do is run
And trust I feel it, I feel it, but can't conceal it, see
This inner city responsibility's killing me
I start to shiver when I think of all the shit I need
Seeing my brothers burning paper on that sticky greed
Picking the thickest leaves stuck in a mitt
Taking a shit, I should have quit but couldn't fucking resist
Now they sit with a narc, a little luck a wish
Trust they still blow their mother a kiss
They're living up in the bits
And slip, stagger through the puddles and the pain
Somewhere beneath the rubbles and the rain uh
They ask why every fucking song the fucking same
And I tell them it's 'cause ain't nothing changed, saying ain't nothing changed

Check, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
No, 'cause ain't nothing changed
I'm saying ain't nothing changed

Uh, uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Brother, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
No, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed

Uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed uh
Uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Uh, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed uh
Uh, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed uh
Uh, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
