		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you still a lover 
When you're gone? 
When you're gone
One day you will find me 
When you're alone

Do you even remember
How we met?
You fill me up with tension under my skin

Don't you forget me 
Don't you forget 
Don't you forget me 
Don't you forget

Are you still a lover
To be found?
To be found
One day will be different 
I'll wait by the clouds

I'll wait by the clouds

Do you even remember
How we met?
You fill me up with tension under my skin

Will you forget me 
Will you forget 
Will you forget me 
Will you forget
