		  What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)
What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)
Are you waiting on a lightening strike
Are you waiting for the perfect night
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for wow
Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer
Don't you wait another minute here
What are you waiting for wow
What are you waiting for wow oh

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living one so tell me?
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You only living one so tell me?
What are you, what are you waiting for?

Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose
While your waiting it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for wow? (What are you waiting for wow)
Don't you wanna spread your wings and fly?
Don't you wanna really live your life?
Don't you wanna love before you die?
What are you waiting for wow?
What are you waiting for wow?

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

Tell me what your waiting for (Tell me what your waiting for)
Show me what your aiming for (Show me what your aiming for)
What you gonna save it for? (What you gonna save it for?)
So what you really waiting for? (So what you really waiting for?)

Tell me what your waiting for (Tell me what your waiting for)
Show me what your aiming for (Show me what your aiming for)
What you gonna save it for? (What you gonna save it for?)
So what you really waiting for? (So what yo

Everybody's gonna make mistakes
But everybody's got a choice to make
Everybody needs a leap of faith
When are you taking yours?

What are you waiting for wow?

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

You gotta go and reach for the top
(What are you) What are you waiting for wow?
Believe in every dream that you got
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you gotta give it your all
What are you, what are you waiting for wow?
You only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
What are you, what are you?
What are you, what are you waiting for?
What are you, what are you
What are you, what are you waiting for?
