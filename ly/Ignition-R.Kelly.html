		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is

Girl, please
Let me stick my key in your ignition, babe
So I can get this thing started and get rollin', babe
See I'll be doin' about 80 on your freeway
Girl, I won't stop until I drive you crazy
So buckle up, 'cause this could get bumpy, babe
Now hit the lights and check out all my functions, babe
Girl, back that thing up so I can watch it, baby
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this Jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a thuggin' it out

Jump up, down once I hit them switches, babe
And I'm about to take it where you wanna go, babe
Guarantee you I'm about to get some mileage, babe
And it won't be no runnin' out of gas, babe
It's like, ooh ooh ooh, pull over babe
And let me put this lovin' off in your trunk, babe
So buckle up, 'cause this could get bumpy, babe
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this Jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a thuggin' it out

Now, hold on tight 'cause I'm about to go faster, babe
Girl, you're dealin' with a pro behind this wheel, babe
So tell me, have you ever driven a stick, babe?
You'll be screamin' every time we shift them gears, babe
So brace yourself while I'm hittin' them corners, babe
And when it's over, put that Kells on your license plates
Now buckle up 'cause this could get bumpy, babe
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this Jeep
We foggin' up the windows (yeah)
We got the radio up (uh)
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a thuggin' it out

When I hear you say (green light)
I'ma go (yellow light)
Do it slow (red light)
I'ma stop

When I hear you say (switch lanes)
Hit the signal (let' stop)
Take a break
Hit the hazards when we park

When you say (green light)
I'ma go (yellow light)
Do it slow (red light)
I'ma stop

When you say (switch lanes)
Hit my signal (let' stop)
Take a break
Because we're 'bout to go real far

'Cause we off up in this Jeep (off up in this Jeep)
We foggin' up the windows (baby you and me)
We got the radio up (got the radio)
We all up in the back (all up in the back)
We got this shit bouncin' (got this baby bouncin')
We goin' up and down (goin' up and down)
And we smokin' and we drinkin' (smokin', just a thuggin' it out)

Now let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Now let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

Now let me see you
