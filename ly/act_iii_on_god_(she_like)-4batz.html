She like, "Boy, go find someone, find someone you love"
Girl, I can't find no one, 'cause you the one I love
You don't understand, it's so hard to trust
She like, "You not the one, you didn't give me enough"
Seen us, trust me, I seen from far
You told me that you loved me
You put that shit on God

You so damn hard to read
It's so damn hard to please you
I know you're wrong for me
But I still want you come home to me
It's not my fault, or is it?
Girl, I didn't know
You thought it would make a difference
If you let me go, go, go, oh

She like, "Boy, go find someone, find someone you love"
Girl, I can't find no one, 'cause you the one I love
You don't understand, it's so hard to trust
She like, "You not the one, you didn't give me enough"
Seen us, trust me, I seen from far
You told me that you loved me
You put that shit on God

Don't you walk away, girl
Look at what we made together
Don't you walk away, girl
We can clear this up together
Don't you walk away, girl
Look at what we made together
Don't you walk away, girl
We can clear this up together
