		  (Cook that shit up Quay)
Yeah
I need my ladies fine
Yeah
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
It's your trainer TP and it's workout time
And I can tell you in the gym cause you workout fine
You like to dance at the spot
Want thighs like a ox
And if you answer yes then drop it like it's hot
Gimmie squats
Tell her squat
Gimmie ten
Gimmie ten of 'em
Gimmie squats, squats, squats
Gimmie ten
Gimmie ten of 'em
Gimmie squats, squats, squats
Gimmie ten
Gimmie ten of 'em
Gimmie squats, squats, squats
Gimmie ten
Gimmie ten of 'em
Make ya hands touch ya toes
Get ya stretch on
Stretch, stretch
Make ya hands touch ya toes
Get ya stretch on
Stretch, stretch
Make ya hands touch ya toes
Get ya stretch on
Stretch, stretch
Make ya hands touch ya toes
Get ya stretch on
Stretch, stretch
I just fucked a nigga bitch with some Crocs on
Got this bitch goin' down like a Joc song
Gimmie ten jumpin' jacks
Ten, ten jumpin' jacks
Drop and do some squats and let me see you run it back
One, two, three, drop it
One, two, three now run it back
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch it out just like the song said
She the model type look at her with them long legs
I wanna make lil baby mine I wanna own that
Bitch I'm 38 hot like Capone said, yeah
Shawty standin' bolegged
You can tell from the back that she corn fed
Five racks in the air it's on ya forehead
If it go up it must come down just like some gravity
Drive I ain't talking sex
Wanna see you sweat
Look at them thighs and them breasts
Work on your finesse
Can't even jive, lookin at your smile
Make me wanna test
Wanna strive
Wanna be the best
Baby this is it
One, two
Three, four
Make ya knees touch ya elbows
One, two
Three, four
Make ya knees touch ya elbows
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit
Stretch, stretch
Stretch that shit, stretch
