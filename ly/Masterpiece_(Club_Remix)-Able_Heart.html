		<p>
		  Oh my gosh you see that?
I've Never seen someone so Pretty before!

Ohh I'm so pretty look at me
I'm a masterpiece
Got my nails Done
When I walk Everybody Freeze
Lookin Tip Top Keep in Shape Like an Athlete
I deserve the best
Cause I love who I really Be

Self made
I don't take no days off no way You think lookin this good is Easy But It's a full time job and I'm well paid
Now everybody's like hey you I ain't even tryna impress you
But Tell me where you got that hair do New shoes pants too
Go ahead and say what you want
Blurt it
Everything I got ima flaunt
Earned it
Pulling off Quick in the Benz
Skirt it
Pics of my body on the Web
Perverted
Checkin my OF slide thru
IG DMs all nude
Sending back pics like thank you
Go to Pull my camera out but get distracted like

Ohh I'm so pretty look at me
I'm a masterpiece
Got my nails Done
When I walk Everybody Freeze
Lookin Tip Top Keep in Shape Like an Athlete
I deserve the best
Cause love who I really Be

Look how I move
My hips be Right in The Groove Now all these hunnys
Wana Boogie like it's 72
They say the puddin is proof
That's why I put it to use Yea I'm so Expialidocous
But you already knew
Look at my wrist
Looks at my clothes
Look at my back
Follow your roll
This that new wave you ridin
We sailing this home
Take it all in Bring it on back
Knocking out goals
Nothin but facts
I just glanced in the rear view
To see where we at And I'm like
