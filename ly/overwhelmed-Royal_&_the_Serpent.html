		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn off the TV
It's starting to freak me
Out it's so loud
It's like my ears are bleeding
What am I feeling?
Can't look at the ceiling
The light is so bright
It's like I'm overheating

This mind isn't mine
Who am I to judge?
Oh I should be fine
But it's all too much

I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety keeps me silent
When I try to speak
What's come over me
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed

All of these faces
Who don't know what space is
And crowds are shut down
I'm overstimulated
Nobody gets it
They say I'm too sensitive
I can't listen cause I'm eyeing the exits

This mind isn't mine
Who am I to judge?
Oh, I should be fine
But it's all too much

I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety keeps me silent
When I try to speak
What's come over me
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed

I get overwhelmed

I should be fine
But it's all too much
I should be fine
But I'm not

I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
Keeps me silent
What's come over me
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed
