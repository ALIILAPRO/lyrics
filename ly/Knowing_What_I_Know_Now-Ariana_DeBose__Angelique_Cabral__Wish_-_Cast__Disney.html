		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been deceived
Magnifico is not the man he claims to be
He's more vicious than I could have ever comprehended
When I made a wish and Star came down
This is not what I expected or intended
But now that it's happened I don't regret it
'Cause now I've seen
Him show his true colors, in shades of green
Saying that you wishes aren't safe because of me and
That's a lie, lie, lie, lie
And I-I know I can't do this on my own and

If it's not us then who and when?
If we don't fight he knows he wins
Not allowed
Knowing what I know now
The lengths he'll go there's no amount
I won't sit back watch this play out
That's my vow
Knowing what I know now

Get up, yah!
Know I'm not the only one that's (yah)
Fed up (yah)

Wait 'til they hear our feet go dun, dun, dun, dun (yeah)

I don't think he's prepared for what's coming

A revolution hit the ground runnin'

If there's one thing he can't keep down
Uh-huh
It's us and the strength we've found
It's too loud (loud)
Knowing what we know now (knowing what we know now)

And who, who knows if we'll succeed?
But we-
Won't stop and we won't retreat or turn round
Round
Knowing what we know now
Knowing what we know now

Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-ha-hoo-ha-hoo-ha
Hoo-hoo-hoo

Can he tell what we're becomin'? (Hoo)
Hear it in the way we're drummin' (hoo)
I was sweet but now I'm something else (oho)
Yah, yah, yah, yah! (Hoo-hoo)

Ain't it nice of us to drop in (hoo-ha)
To take what's ours to take it back in? (hoo-ha)
He thinks we're nothing (hoo)
But we're something else! (Ha)
Yah! (Hoo)

I've seen too many bad things that I can't keep count
He loves one thing more than himself
His crown (crown)
Knowing what I know now
Knowing what I know now (hoo-ha-hoo)

The good in him, I've watched it melt
I was fooled by the love I felt
So profound 
Knowing what I know

I know (hoo)

I know (ha)

We know now (hoo)

Knowing what we know now
