		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
I want to get to know you
I really want to fuck you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you , crazy
I want to be your lover
I want to get to know you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you , crazy

[Young Buck]
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with a frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla night

[Chorus]

I want to be your lawyer
I really want to defend you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy

I want to be your lover
I want to get to know you, baby
I'm lost in your lovin'
I'm simply gonna try you, crazy

I want to be your lover
I really need to stand you, baby
I want be your lover
I really need to stand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.
