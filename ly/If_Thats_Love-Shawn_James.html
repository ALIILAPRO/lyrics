		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He wakes to find her in his bed
Naked from the night before
She wakes and grins from ear to ear
Thinking that she's won his heart
He tells her, "Get your things and leave"
Until we meet again
She wonders if she's wrong or right
To have shared her love with him

If that's love then I don't know what is
If that's truth then I'm a fraud
If it's real then I must seem like such a fool
To have saved my love for one

If that's love then I don't know what is
If that's truth then I'm a fraud
If it's real then I must seem like such a fool
To have saved my love for one

No, you don't really know what love is
No, you don't know what love is
No, you haven't got a clue
