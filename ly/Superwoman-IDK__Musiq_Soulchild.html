		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What an afternoon it's been
And just three more corners to go now for our race leader
The checkered flag is in sight
It's the freedom of freetown
For our winner today, Lewis Hamilton 

Mary wants to be a super woman
But is that really in her head?
But I just wanna live each day to love her for what she is (mm-hmm)
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind
But-

Very well
I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything goin' through your head
Very well
And I think I can face very well
Wish that you knew me too, very well
And I think I can go with everything goin' through your head

Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to bounce the ball around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream? (Mm-hmm)
My woman wants to be a superwoman
And I just had to say goodbye
Because I can't spend all my hours, start to cry
But, but-

Very well (da-da-da-da, da, oh-oh)
I believe I know you very well (da, da)
Wish that you knew me too, very well (very well)
And I think I can deal with everything goin' through your head
Very well (da-da-da-da, da, oh-oh)
I think that I know you too, very well (da, da)
Wish you knew me like I know you, very well (very well)
And I think I can deal with everything goin' through your head
Very well
Dum-da-duh-dum, duh-duh-dun, very well (da-da-da-da, da, oh-oh, da, da)
Wish you knew me too, very well (very well)
And I think I can deal with everything goin' through your head
Very well, ba-duh-duh-dum, ba-dum, oh (very well, dum-da-da-dum, duh-duh-dum, very well)
Duh-da-dum, da-duh-dum, dum-dum-dum (know me too very well)
And I think that I can deal with everything goin' through your head 
(I can deal with everything going through your head)

When the summer came, you were not around
And now that summer's gone, love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you?
Last winter, my love
When the winter came, you went for the south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you
Like, right now?

Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
And tomorrow, we'll reflect
Love's path

When the winter came, you were not around
Through the bitter winds, love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you
Last winter, my love?

Our love is at an end (end, end)
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow, we'll reflect
Love's path

Spring will fill the air
And you will come around ('round)
Well, is it summer love (summer)
That won't let me down? (Me down)
Where were you when I needed you?
Last winter, my love?
La-da-da-da-da (la-da-da-da-da)
La-da-da-da-da (la-da-da-da-da)
La-da-da-da-da (la-da-da-da-da)
La-da-da-da-da (la-da-da-da-da)
Where are you when I need you (I need you) 
Back right now? (Right now, right now, right now)
Where were you when I needed you?
Where, where?
Where were you when I needed you? (I needed you)
Last winter (last winter)
My dear (my dear)

Where were you and I? (My dear) 
Where were you and I? (Where?) 
Where were you and I? (Where?)
Where were you and I? (Where were you?)
Where were you and I? (Oh, where were you when I needed you?)
Where were you and I? 
Where were you and I? (Last winter)
Where were you and I? (Last winter)
