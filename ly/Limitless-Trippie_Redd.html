		  14, 14, 14 baby
Woah, 14, 14, 14 baby
Huh

All my life I been limitless, nigga never had a limit, huh
Yeah, rollin' around in the Rari, you still in the Civic
Yeah, rollin' around in my city, I feel like I'm Diddy
Yeah, all these niggas they some suckers, I show 'em no pity
Young nigga gotta floss, hey
Dabbing on 'em with the sauce, huh
Feeling like a young boss, huh
Feeling like I'm Rick Ross, huh
Hundred dollars in the city man
All these fuck niggas man they hate it, huh
Now I made it out, when I come back better show appreciation

Appreciate my time difference
Appreciate my rhymes different
Appreciate my grind different
Appreciate that I did it
Appreciate that I did it, appreciate that I did it
Actavis what I'm sippin', Actavis what I'm sippin' yeah
This thirty got me limping, woah
Ball like Scottie Pippen, yeah
They hate me 'cause I'm different, woah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Appreciate my time difference
Appreciate my rhymes different
Appreciate my grind different
Appreciate that I did it
Appreciate that I did it, appreciate that I did it
Actavis with oil sippin', Actavis with oil sippin' woah

All my life I been limitless, nigga never had a limit, huh
Yeah, rollin' around in the Rari, you still in the Civic
Yeah, rollin' around in my city, I feel like I'm Diddy
Yeah, all these niggas they some suckers, I show 'em no pity
Young nigga gotta floss, hey
Dabbing on 'em with the sauce, huh
Feeling like a young boss, huh
Feeling like I'm Rick Ross, huh
Hundred dollars in the city man
All these fuck niggas man they hate it, huh
Now I made it out, when I come back better show appreciation

I been trippin' all week off the narcotics
Takeoff on Pluto, got some hoes beside me
Sipping Hi-Tech, moving like a zombie
That boy say he looking for me, come and find me
Pull up with trip and we tweaking
VVS's on me blinging
Smoking dope with the demons
Dress according to the seasons
Pop a perc, then I leave this Earth
I ain't coming back
I'm making plays in the field like a running back
Louis V tennis shoes, I'm trapping on avenues
Alexander McQueen my protege
I'm sipping on lean out of lemonade
I pop me a xan then I levitate
You can't live how I live
'Cause I wake up every day with pints in my fridge

All my life I been limitless, nigga never had a limit, huh
Yeah, rollin' around in the Rari, you still in the Civic
Yeah, rollin' around in my city, I feel like I'm Diddy
Yeah, all these niggas they some suckers, I show 'em no pity
Young nigga gotta floss, hey
Dabbing on 'em with the sauce, huh
Feeling like a young boss, huh
Feeling like I'm Rick Ross, huh
Hundred dollars in the city man
All these fuck niggas man they hate it, huh
Now I made it out, when I come back better show appreciation

All of my life I been limitless
My hoes different colors like M&Ms
I been spending them Benjamins
I been spending them Benjamins
Some G-Star and jeans, yeah
I fill them with Benjamins
I'm fucking on your lil bitch again
She sucking all on my dick again
Pull up to the club, these hoes like there he go
She so thick woah, I might just take this bitch home
Yeah, my Rafs fit like a moose
Her pussy so wet like some goop
Nigga want beef, I'm like who?
Shoot at your ass like a hoop

All my life I been limitless, nigga never had a limit, huh
Yeah, rollin' around in the Rari, you still in the Civic
Yeah, rollin' around in my city, I feel like I'm Diddy
Yeah, all these niggas they some suckers, I show 'em no pity
Young nigga gotta floss, hey
Dabbing on 'em with the sauce, huh
Feeling like a young boss, huh
Feeling like I'm Rick Ross, huh
Hundred dollars in the city man
All these fuck niggas man they hate it, huh
Now I made it out, when I come back better show appreciation, huh
