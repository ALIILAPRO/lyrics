		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (If Young Metro don't trust, I'm gon' shoot you)

Spent a thousand dollars just to sip (just to sip muddy)
Park that motherfucker in the VIP
I got that motherfucker on my hip
I'ma squeeze (baow)
I'ma squeeze (baow)
We ain't really with all that intimate shit (21)
We ain't really with that pretending and shit (21)
Come and get your bitch she actin' friendly and shit
When I get inside that pussy, I be killin' that shit (killin', killin')

I'm in savage mode (whoa) I'm in savage mode (whoa)
I'm in savage mode (whoa)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (savage)
Savage on these hoes (whoa)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes (whoa)
I'm in savage mode (21)
I'm in savage mode (savage) I'm in savage mode (savage)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes

Cup, whoa
Muddy, yo
Hit the yolk
Got the stick, whoa
Keep it on me, yeah (yeah)
Knew you got it, yeah
One in the head, yeah
Bitch, I fuckin' dare (I dare)
Nigga, I double-dare (yeah)
Why the fuck you stare?
Pew-pew, bet you ass don't stare
Red bottoms, yeah (red)
Bitch watch where you step
I'm in savage mode, cook a nigga like a chef
Ain't no loyalty, these niggas off themselves
All these fuckin' stripes, I shoulda been a ref (ya dig?)

I'm in savage mode (whoa) I'm in savage mode (whoa)
I'm in savage mode (whoa)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (savage)
Savage on these hoes (whoa)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes (whoa)
I'm in savage mode (21)
I'm in savage mode (savage) I'm in savage mode (savage)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes

All that backstabbin' turned me to a savage (savage)
All that fuckin' krabbin' turned me to a savage (it did)
Racks inside the mattress turned me to a savage (racks racks)
I turned to a savage bitch, I gotta have it (gotta have it)
Fell asleep in science, I love mathematics (countin' cash)
Bitch, I like to add, bitch, I like subtractin' (that countin' cash)
That chopper flip a nigga like he acrobatic
He don't want no smoke, he don't want no static (want no static)
I'm in savage mode, shit can get tragic, yeah
I might toe tag him, I might body bag him (whoa, whoa)
These bitches gettin' old, I already have 'em ('ready have 'em)
She wanna live lavish, she don't need my status

I'm in savage mode (whoa) I'm in savage mode (whoa)
I'm in savage mode (whoa)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (savage)
Savage on these hoes (whoa)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes (whoa)
I'm in savage mode (21)
I'm in savage mode (savage) I'm in savage mode (savage)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes

(If Young Metro don't trust, I'm gon' shoot you)

I'm a savage on these hoes, savage on these hoes
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes
I'm in savage mode, I'm in savage mode
I'm in savage mode, I'm in savage mode
I'm a savage on these hoes, savage on these hoes
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes
