		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a darkened room
Beyond the reach of God's faith
Lies the wounded, the shattered remains of love betrayed
And the innocence of a child is bought and sold
In the name of the damned
The rage of the angels left silent and cold

Forgive me please for I know not what I do
How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true

Well tell me when a kiss of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room

All the precious times have been put to rest again
And the smile of the dawn
Brings tainted lust singing my requiem
Can I face the day when I'm tortured in my trust
And watch it crystallize
While my salvation it crumbles to dust

Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm
I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore

Tell me when a kiss of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room
