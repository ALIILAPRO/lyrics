Girl, you are killing it
Body is banging and I am feeling it
The way I am feeling there's no concealing it
You're young, you're fine, so magnificent
Go on, girl, you just keep killing it
Your body like orange and I am peeling it
The way I am feeling there's no concealing it
That's why I, I, I'm revealing it so
