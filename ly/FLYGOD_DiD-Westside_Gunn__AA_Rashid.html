		  Gaga, hehe

Here we are again
Long live Michelle
Long live Virgil
The wise among you will always do the knowledge twice
You will revisit the one with the two and be wise
On every porch resides two pillars 
And every door got two sides, y-you feel me? Yeah
Um, but, um, hey, some people pray to be seen
We do so to be heard, you heard?
And what does we mean? What does we mean?
Ask FlyGod, 'oui' means yes in France and they speak French in Paris
We have prayed there and elsewhere
And now we have arrived again at another yes
You are now listening to a audible finely crafted garment
High-end, highly textured sonic resonance wrapped up in cloth talk 
And sewn with threads of a minds eye beyond common comprehension
At any rate you know, it's always beautiful speaking to you
I would like to add that it is still 
And will for always ever be God bless the dead, yeah
The ancestors are ever present and participating in our greatness, yeah
The FlyGod loves the child that got its own
Long live Michelle
Long live Virgil
