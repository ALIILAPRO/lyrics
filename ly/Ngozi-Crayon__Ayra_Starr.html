		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gimme light, bi ti solar
Can feel your love taking over
On a good day, I be loner
See what you make me discover
Girl, you don change my persona
The revelation is in order
All the pressure I've been under

Why I call you Ngozi
God don bless me, Ngozi
No deserve this kind loving
The loving wey you show me
Private lounging in Paris
With expensive room service
No one make me do like this
Girl, I gat you, no worries
No worries, ah yeah

E dey do me wah wah oh
Scatter my internal
Craving your nsala oh
You're killing me, Kitana oh
Jeka lo, biza wa o
Hypertension idi nla nla
Referee, no disallow
You're killing me, Kitana oh

E dey do me wah wah wah oh
Scatter my internal
Craving your nsala oh
You're killing me, Kitana oh
Jeka lo, biza wa wa o
Hypertension idi nla nla
Referee, no disallow
You're killing me, Kitana oh

I know you're waiting
I'll run hastily to you
In my Panamera
Hola hola oh

Whisper nakupenda
Wetin you put for this your jollof (plenty)
You've gat my heart and my soul on lock
And I wanna go crazy with you
Through the night, till the sun come up
Lets do it all, do it all for love
Cus moti fun e ni kokoro
I never wanna lose this
To you I belong
This must be love

E dey do me wah wah wah oh
Scatter my internal
Craving your nsala oh
You're killing me, Kitana oh
Jeka lo, biza wa o

Abi you want make bad belle off my light?
The future I want to hold on to
Girly no fear, I dey for you

Make I be the reason you believe in true love

Why I call you Ngozi
