		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb

Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down

And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover

Skin the sun
Fall asleep
Wish away
The soul is cheap
Lesson learned
Wish me luck
Soothe the burn
Wake me up

I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
My day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb

Maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb
