		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time is like the first time tenderly
Loving you's like breathing spring
Seasons change but your heart beats constantly
Count my blessings every day as you love me
As the sunset disappears across the northern sky
You look for forever in my eyes
All I can say, long as I have a voice
I'll thank God above that I was your first choice

If I should die before I wake
I'll go into the night whispering your name
If lying in your arms is the last thing that I do
At least I know that I'll be loved by you
In about a hundred years from now
When all of my love letters are found
And someone reads these words I've written only meant for you
They'll know how forever came true

If I should die before I wake
I'll go into the night whispering your name
If lying in your arms is the last thing that I do
At least I know that I'll be loved by you
In about a hundred years from now
When all of my love letters are found
And someone reads these words I've written only meant for you
They'll know how forever came true

Let the years roll on by
These are the best times of my life
I'll just smile when my days are through
Knowing that I've been loved by you
At least I know that I've been loved by you
