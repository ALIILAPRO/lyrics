		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel like I wanna go back
To a time before my mind turned black
I miss the way it was
When instead of just my gooey brains
All that melted was popsicles
And the rain just pelted down down on me

Make me into more than a goner
Perhaps a little bit stronger
Thicker skin, less needy
And maybe to not bruise so
Damn easily But you can't and I won't

I want you to help keep me from growing older
Just let me snot on your shoulder
When all that I'm thinkin' bout is her, her
Give me everything you got
Don't need drugs 'cause I can
Already feel my head rot and it won't stop

It won't stop it won't stop
It won't stop it won't stop
Please slow down please slow down
Make it all slow down make it all slow down

Make it all slow down
