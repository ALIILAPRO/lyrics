		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you recognise me?
If our blue and brown eyes meet in the crowd
Psycho-analyse me
Are we happy in this clean empty house?
Oh I've fallen enough for these knees to give in
And your brown paper packages I tied up with string
They surround me
I still haven't found me
And I've stalled for too long, now I'm somebody new
Keep on wearing me down until my cheeks are all blue
From the night cold
Our limbs in a tight hold
There's a new scent on your sweater
But the less I know the better
You know it terrifies me
Are we missing out on something more?
And all the nights you don't sleep
In your room on the second floor
Oh I've sat here enough to count cracks in the walls
I've been walking through spiderwebs
Missing your calls and your frown lines
I still haven't found time to breathe
Now you live for rainy weather
But the less I know the better
There's a chance I won't forget her
So the less I know the better
