		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing unusual
Nothing strange
Close to nothing at all
The same old scenario
The same old rain
And there's no explosions here

Then something unusual
Something strange
Comes from nothing at all
I saw a spaceship
Fly by your window
Did you see it disappear?

Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me

Nothing unusual
Nothing's changed
Just a little older that's all
But you know when you've found it
There's something I've learned
'Cause you feel it when they take it away

Hey, hey, hey
Something unusual
Something strange
Comes from nothing at all
But I'm not a miracle
And you're not a saint
Just another soldier
On the road to nowhere

Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
And Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
