		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me,
I'd say the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

It never entered my mind
