		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of here, outer space
Pussy all on my face
Money down for my case
I can't lie, life's great
I can't lie, life's great
Yeah, you know this shit been good
Yeah, you know I'm from the hood
But I made it out that hood
But I made it out the wood
Smokin' on dope every day as I should
Countin' up money every day as I should
Fuckin' on hoes every day as I should
I'm a big boss, yeah, I feel like Suge
Don't care 'bout the cost, I'ma make the bitch plug
I can bet, make the bitch ride on that
Her nigga walked in, had a heart attack
I'm a 800, I'm part of that
We got the same opps, get to fallin' back
We shoot at these niggas, no poppin' back
I'm hittin' that trigger, I'm off of that
They copycat see, copycat Vamp
I light the bitch up just like a lamp
I had a red flag before I was stamped
Niggas dyin' by hoes, niggas dyin' by tramp
We can shoot at the bitch, shoot at the camp
Shoot at that bitch, shoot at his camp
Shoot at that bitch, shoot at his camp
Shoot at that bitch, we shoot at his camp
My shooter gon' shoot, he gon' shoot
My shooter gon' shoot at ya
My shooter gon' shoot at
My shooter gon' shoot you, yeah
I gotta go bananas one time
I fucked a bitch in Panama
She gonna be here tomorrow

I'm not playin' no more, yeah
I'm not playin' no more, oh yeah
I'm not playin' no more
I'm not playin', yeah, I'm not playin'
I'm not playin', I'm not playin'
I'm not playin', I'm not playin'
I'm not playin', I'm not playin', yeah
I'm not playin', I'm not playin'
I'm not playin', I'm not playin', yeah
