		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you can call me lover boy
They say I throw my heart around
And you can be my lover girl
I'll pick you up drive you around
I'll show you how to fall in love
We'll be the talk of all the town
Now everybody wants to be like us
They're gettin' jealous, feel it now
Oh wow

Kill the lights
So, baby, close your eyes
The way you're lookin' at me
You've got me mesmerized
Somethin' I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good lovin'
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothin' will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
Oh yeah

It's such a shame
Somehow the love came to an end
You've started talkin' to a tool
You're tellin' lies to all your friends
But you know damn well it should be me
But I'm movin' on doin' my best
Now everybody whispers things 'bout us
You're hearin' voices in your head
Can't forget

Kill the lights
So, baby, close your eyes
The way you're lookin' at me
You've got me mesmerized
Somethin' I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good lovin'
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothin' will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Kill the lights
So, baby, close your eyes
The way you're lookin' at me
You've got me mesmerized
Somethin' I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good lovin'
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothin' will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Kill the lights
So, baby, close your eyes
The way you're lookin' at me
You've got me mesmerized
Somethin' I can't escape
Feel like I'm lost in space
You've got that good lovin'
Girl, if you leave me I might throw my heart away
You know my heart can't take the break
Nothin' will ever be the same
We'll meet again some other day
