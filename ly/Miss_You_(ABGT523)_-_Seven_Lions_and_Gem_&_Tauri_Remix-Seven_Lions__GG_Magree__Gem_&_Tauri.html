		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're making me feel so alone
Your heart is a hard thing to hold
But without out it, don't feel like home
'Cause there's nothing to hide anymore
Anymore

I'm a ghost
While you're sitting right there
On your throne
Zoning the world, like you ain't there
What if I broke?
Would you find all the pieces or go? Or go?

I'm slowly falling down here tonight
Triggers out, there's no safety in this life
And if I let you go would you
Would you change your mind?

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh

Would you change your mind?
Would you change your mind?

You're making me feel so alone
Drifting silently into our thoughts
Want to shake us both awake but you just yawn
Wishing we could go back to the start
When we're both in love

I'm slowly falling down here tonight
Triggers out, there's no safety in this life
And if I let you go would you
Would you change your mind?

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

'Cause I miss you i miss you I do
All of you even if I lose

Would you change your mind?
Would you change your mind?

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you oh

You're making me feel so alone
Your heart is a hard thing to hold
But without out it, don't feel like home
'Cause there's nothing to hide anymore
Anymore

I'm a ghost
While you're sitting right there
On your throne
Zoning the world, like you ain't there
What if I broke?
Would you find all the pieces or go? Or go?
