I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight, 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him (him)
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when (when)
I pulled out that gun

Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

Little 22, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
Whatchu expect me to do?
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool, and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him (him)
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when (when)
I pulled out that gun

Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down (well, hear me now) 
In central station

Said, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, never thought I'd do it
Oh gosh, what ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me, ever happened to me?
Why did I pull di trigger, pull di trigger, pull di trigger? Boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon
When me pull di trigger, pull di trigger, pull it pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Ayy

Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Me say one man down, ah wah me say?
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
When me went downtown

'Cause now I'm a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord ah mercy, now I am a criminal, man down
Tell di judge please gimme minimal
Run out a town, none ah dem can see me now, see me now

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
