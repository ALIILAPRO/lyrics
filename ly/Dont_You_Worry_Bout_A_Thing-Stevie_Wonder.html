		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reachin' out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces but

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

When you get it off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Bam bambam bambam bambam
Bambambambam bambambambam
Bam bambam bambam bambam
Bambambambam bambambambam

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

When you get it off your trip
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through but

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Yeah
Bam bambam bambam bambam
Bambambambam bambambambam
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, sugar
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, sugar
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
