		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gotta help me, I'm losin' my mind
Keep gettin' the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were goin' strong, I thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breakin' and I don't know what to do
Thought we were goin' strong, thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever

All of the rumors, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were goin' strong, thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne, and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know

You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever

So don't let me go, so don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby, don't you know, baby, don't you know
We can live forever
