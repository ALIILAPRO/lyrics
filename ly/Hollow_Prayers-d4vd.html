		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost again trying to find myself
Searching through both heaven and hell
I can't let go
I can't let go

I'm losing myself
Can't call out for help
Oh, I see my faults
Oh, it's all my fault

Can you take me
And replace me
With someone else? hmm
Someone else

And I don't hate myself
Just wanna be better
Just wanna be better

Oh, God
Do you have a second to talk?
'Cause I need something off my chest
And something off my shoulders

And I can't even walk no more
And my eyes are sore
From all the tears I cried
Please, don't let me die

Hmm, Hmm, hmm
Lost again trying to find myself
Searching through both heaven and hell
I can't let go
I can't let go

I'm losing myself
Can't call out for help
Oh, I see my faults
Oh, it's all my fault
