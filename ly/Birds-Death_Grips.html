		  I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming
In

Birds

Fuck you

I've got a bluebird
It might die
It got wetted
I stayed dry
I'm not trying to use my mind
I got that attitude at all times
I've got this attitude at all times
I got a black cat
It might live
It's got a black hat
It goes big
I had a bluebird
Now it's dead

one, two, three, four 
One bird, two birds, three birds, four
Five birds, six times life is war
One bird, two birds, three birds, four
Fuck you think I fuck this for

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming
In

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming
In

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming
In

Fuck you

I got you now in my way
I got right now between my legs
I put right now between your legs
I got today shoveling graves
I got tomorrow turning in your grave
I got Jesus, he got saved
I got power, it's so cheap
Fuck this bird, bitch, drink this bleach

one, two, three, four
One bird, two birds, three birds, four
Five birds, six times life is war
One bird, two birds, three birds, four
Fuck you think I fuck this for

I got higher
I got fake
I got higher
I got fake
I got higher
I got fake
I got higher
I got 

Birds 
Birds

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming

I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming
In

Birds

Fuck you
