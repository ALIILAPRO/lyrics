		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It makes me wanna die, die, I wanna die
You said I ruin your life
Love is the devil ahead and the devil doesn't sleep
Baby, take it out on me
Sorry I don't make it easy

Ooh, delicate weapon
Ooh, war in heaven

Ooh

Tell me all the ways I hurt your name
If you could see
You wanna keep me as forever
But it was just all a game
Make me
Truly choose regret
So that I can take the shorter path

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Where are you tonight? Are you tonight?
Baby, it's the worst day of my whole life
Put me outta my misery
Baby, take it out of me
Just reiterate everything
Sorry I can't make it easy

Ooh, delicate weapon
Ooh, war in heaven

Ooh
Tell me all the ways I hurt your name
If you could see
You wanna keep me as forever
But it was all a game
Make me
Truly choose regret
So that I can take the shorter path

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
