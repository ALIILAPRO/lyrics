		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I know is I don't know nothin'
All I know is I don't know nothin' at all
People talk but they don't say nothin'
All I know is I don't know nothin' at all

No license, I'm still ridin'
Crashed into a tree and kept drivin'
My label hates that I'm like this
I gotta go through shit to keep writin'
All these girls, I don't want none of them
But I know I'll end up with one of them
My life on the outside's fun to them
But the person on the inside is crumblin'

All I know is I don't know nothin'
All I know is I don't know nothin' at all
People talk but they don't say nothin'
All I know is I don't know nothin' at all

All I know is I don't know nothin'
I love you, but I don't love nothin' at all
Yeah, the world is crazy, so corrupted
I'm by myself, so I don't feel too involved
'Cause I'm alone, alone, alone
Don't know who to call, don't know, I don't know (yeah, yeah)
If you know the answer to these things, let me know (yeah)
Let me know, let me know again

All I know is I don't know nothin'
All I know is I don't know nothin' at all
People talk but they don't say nothin'
All I know is I don't know nothin' at all

Ripped jeans, I've been runnin' from the cops all night
I'm dead, I don't care about nothin'
Bloody teeth in my mouth when I smiled last night
Broke his jaw, now he can't say nothin'
Nothin' at all
