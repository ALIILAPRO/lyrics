		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, mm, yeah
Do do do do do do do do, oh yeah

Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that "We can't come to the phone"
And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah

(Enough is enough)
No more walking round with my head down (yeah)
I'm so over being blue, crying over you

And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory
And now every song reminds me of what used to be

That's the reason I'm
So sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio? Oh-oh-oh

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Hey, don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs (hey), so tired of tears (so tired of tears)
So done with wishing (oh) she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (ooh-oh)
So why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)

Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears (so tired of tears, yeah)
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (hey)
Why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)

And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears (I'm so sick of love songs)
So done with wishing you were still here (so done and I'm so sick of love songs)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (so done and I'm so sick of love songs)
Why can't I turn off the radio? (hey)
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Why can't I turn off the radio?
