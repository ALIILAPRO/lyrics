		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so we run
Look how we run
And come undone
The lesson’s done
Hit and run
Elephant shunned
With this part I'm done
Time for no one
Life on the run
With this part I’m done
Come undone
We disappear here
Nothing is real here
We come undone
We’ve become undone


Who oppose us to leave or delete fake beliefs
Now we need to escape this cage
Common believe

Use and abuse us
All the numbers confuse us
That race can’t be won
In hundred years
How many fears from today are gone
Probably none
As time it runs
Everything runs
Oh, it’s a trap, my son
And we are part of one
What is the real world if kid a can feel hurt
Who can answer this one
No on

Who oppose us to leave or delete fake beliefs
Now we need to escape this cage
Common believe
