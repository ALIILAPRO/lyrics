		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too many drugs in my system, system
I tell a joke, you don't listen
I fucked the punchline anyway
Your phone wouldn't charge
Too far to walk with no car
In that shirt, you're breaking my heart

And you'll call me up again at 12 o'clock on a Friday
And I'll answer way too quickly
And I hate that I might say that I
Love you, I do
Love you, I do
Love you, I do

We get back from the party
At Annabel's house
You tell me you want me
And spit in my mouth
I don't say your name
When your girlfriend's around
You say she can tell
She can tell
She can tell
So I'm never gonna let it out
I'm never gonna let it out

I crossed your name off my wishlist, wishlist
And I know it's none of my business
But are you with her Saturday?
Some tears I don't show
You're a dick and you know it
You're the best and you blow it

And you'll call me up again at 12 o'clock on a Friday
And I'll lie to mum and David
And I hate that I might say that I
Love you, I do
Love you, I do
Love you, I do

We get back from the party
At Annabel's house
You tell me you want me
And spit in my mouth
I don't say your name
When your girlfriend's around
You say she can tell
She can tell
She can tell
So I'm never gonna let it out

They're playing Havana
I hated that tune
I swear it don't hurt
You're looking at her
I'm looking at you
You're getting the words wrong
But you're making it cute
I swear it don't hurt
You're looking at her
I'm looking at you

I'm never gonna let it out
I'm never gonna let it out
