		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say now you talk about the things I do
But baby I, I'll try n explain the reasons why
Cause I've been thinking about
The things we said late last night
When every word I said just didn't come out right
And you were so afraid that I'd found someone new
But darlin well, there's no need
For what we're going through because

You and I've been in love too long
To worry about tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman that I'm dreaming of
You're the only woman that I really love

Baby see what a foolish heart has done for me
Darling why would you break my heart and make me cry
Well now you can't go back and change the way things are
And all this foolish talk won't take us very far
And so I hope you're listening cause I'm telling you
About the way I feel and what I'm going through because

You and I've been in love too long
To worry about tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman that I'm dreaming of
I say you're the only woman that I really love
Don't speak, shhh

When the pain of love surrounds you
And the world may be unkind
I'll put my loving arms around you
And take you far from this place and time because
You and I've been in love too long
To worry about tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman I've been dreaming of
Baby you're the only woman that I really love
You're the only woman
I know you're the only woman
Well now you're the only woman
