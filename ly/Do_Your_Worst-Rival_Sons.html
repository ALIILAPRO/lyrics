		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See that stranger coming up the hill
Though you don't recognize him, I know your preacher will
Got a voice like sugar, sugar in your teeth
And he could sing a winning song now
Sing it sweeter than me

Blind your eyes
Steal your tongue
Take it when you're older
But he likes 'em young

Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my body, take my body and do your worst
Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my body, take my body and do your worst

If you see that stranger
Coming on the track
I can hear your mama just calling you back
Hit you like a fever, fever deep
And I touch you like a thief
And leave your pockets clean

Blind your eyes
Steal your tongue
Get you when you're old now
But he likes 'em young

Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my body, take my body and do your worst
Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my body, take my body and do your worst

Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my body, take my body and do your worst
Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my body, take my body and do your worst
