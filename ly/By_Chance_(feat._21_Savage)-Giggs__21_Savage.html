We just pulled up on 'em, we just got 'em by chance
Thought he was a general, we got his five stars
I cannot be winnin' and I let my guys starve
Extended clip, twenty-five sparks
Ran up in your office and we tear up five staff (Haha, ha)
Thought it was a joke until we got the last laugh (Last laugh)
Tell me 'bout the numbers, give a fuck about charts
These niggas fake, and they just play parts (Haha, ha)

I don't trust 'em, we fell out
He would say we left him out (Haha)
I'm in every (?)
You just got the F&N out
They in some pretentions vibe
But me I'm from that mental side
Where you pull up unidentified
In a high, you're meant to slide
Touch my little bro, it's gonna cost your right arm
See all of these niggas in here, those are my dawgs
I'm just doin' me so please don't cross on my path
The bar I'm layin' low, don't stay on five palm
Move it over there, that isn't me, I might pass
Diss me once before and then again I'm like nah
Got him one that's drivin', nigga hit a parked car
They talk a good game but niggas half heart

We just pulled up on 'em, we just got 'em by chance
Thought he was a general, we got his five stars
I cannot be winnin' and I let my guys starve
Extended clip, twenty-five sparks
Ran up in your office and we tear up five staff
Thought it was a joke until we got the last laugh
Tell me 'bout the numbers, give a fuck about charts
These niggas fake, and they just play parts

Smack a rapper
Then we smack the entourage
Layin' in your bushes (21)
I got all camouflage
Runnin' from the stick (21)
I just gave 'em ass shots
Spray a nigga team (Pussy)
Then we spray the mascots
I got mad pulls from 6 to London (On God)
Fuck the metal detector, I still brought my gun in (On God)
Hit her from the back, you know I'm stickin' my thumb in (21)
I heard you got questions and your ass start hummin' (Pussy)
We don't do no arguin', we bun 'em
If you cross that line, you know your ass is gettin' somethin' (Facts)
Hate to see her leave but I be lovin' when she comin' (On God)
Fifty on the switch, I might trip out and get to drummin' (Grrt)
Pussy (Grrt)
Drive by you rookie
Wanna see me? Book me (21)
You mad 'cause your wifey choosin', wanna give me cookie (21)
When I get my Green Card, I'm goin' straight to Brixton (On God)
I don't do no hair but all my Glocks got extensions (21)

We just pulled up on 'em, we just got 'em by chance
Thought he was a general, we got his five stars
I cannot be winnin' and I let my guys starve
Extended clip, twenty-five sparks
Ran up in your office and we tear up five staff
Thought it was a joke until we got the last laugh
Tell me 'bout the numbers, give a fuck about charts
These niggas fake, and they just play parts
