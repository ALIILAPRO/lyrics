		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve seen you so many times
I’ll be waiting for a sign
And I know it’s a waste of time
But I guess you’re already gone
Every word you spell is a lie
And I told you so
And I thought you knew
That I let you go
Da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da
And I’m wild in secret
Time flies so fast
Even if i thought you were mine
Somewhere lost in thousands of lies
Consequences keep us apart
Even if I thought you were mine
Even if I thought you were mine
Cause you said it so many times
And all of the time, And all of the time
It’s a mistake
I said it so many times
Asked for help, for advice
Thought it was nothing too much
Always a waste of time
And I told you so
And I thought you knew
That I let you go
Da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da
And I’m wild in secret
Time flies so fast
Even if i thought you were mine
Somewhere lost in thousands of lies
Consequences keep us apart
Even if I
Time flies so fast
Even if i thought you were mine
Somewhere lost in thousands of lies
Consequences keep us apart
Even if i thought you were mine
