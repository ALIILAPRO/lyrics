		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay

You make it hard for me to love you
The way you break us when you lose control
I know you need me to come over
The way I feel the need to heal your soul

You know you're screw, screw, screwing me up (me up)
But I still fall hard for your love (your love)
And I know this isn't right
It's a feeling I can't fight
Oh, I know, know, know, woah

I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay
I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay
You know that we're suffering
But you don't see nothing but you, woah
I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay

I know you don't want me to let go, yeah
I'm trying to burn but then you act so cold
Oh, I can't breathe down in the water
I didn't think that I would get so low

You know you're screw, screw, screwing me up (me up)
But I still fall hard for your love (your love)
And I know this isn't right
It's a feeling I can't fight
Oh, I know, know, know, woah

I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay
I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay
You know that we're suffering
But you don't see nothing but you, woah
I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay

I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay
I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay
You know that we're suffering
But you don't see nothing but you, woah
I should run away, but I stay, stay, stay
