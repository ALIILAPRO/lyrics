		  Supercollide
Before you felt it
How could you know
When the wilderness
Was natural
The sun and the moon
And everything below
Was set to explode (supercollide)
How could you miss it
You've never been told
That you're seeing every colour monochrome
Before the reason
Before the light
Out of the darkness
Supercollide

I'm shaking salvation
I'm flying faster and faster and I
I was the darkness
And you where the light
Tear it apart
And then we supercollide (I was the dark)
We supercollide (and you were the light)
And then we supercollide (I was the dark)
We supercollide (and you were the light)

And then I saw you time was still
All my mysteries turn to miracles
This is our age of reason
Carve it in the stone
Down to the bone (supercollide)
You know I'd miss you if we tore apart
The centre of my universe is in your arms
And all the chaos crystallised
When you and I
Supercollide

I'm shaking salvation
I'm flying faster and faster and I
I was the darkness
And you were the light
Tear it apart
And then we supercollide (I was the dark)
We supercollide (and you were the light)
And then we supercollide (I was the dark)
We supercollide (and you were the light)

And if I ever fall from grace
Under the veil of the dark age
I'll never be lost again
To the ghost living in my head
'Cause you are the question and you are the truth
And you are the answer and everything's you
Now there's a reason, now there's a light
Out of the darkness then we supercollide

I'm shaking salvation
I'm flying faster and faster and I
I was the darkness
And you were the light
Tear it apart
And then we supercollide (I was the dark)
We supercollide (and you were the light)
And then we supercollide (I was the dark)
We supercollide (and you were the light)

I was the dark and you were the light
I was the dark and you were the light

I was the dark
And you were the light
