		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your words cut sharper than knives
I thought we'd be sharing some time
You wanted too much and I wonder why

Remember back then, wasn't that nice?
But something happened in between lines
You lost your faith and I wonder why

So I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know that I'm letting you go
And I'll say, it wasn't easy for me
Yeah, I'll say, it's time I learned to release
So I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know that I'm letting you go
And I'll say, it wasn't easy for me
Yeah, I'll say, it's time I learned to release

We climbed the mountain and as we looked down
You pushed me off the cliff and stole the crown
And as I fell down further, I wondered why

Remember back then, wasn't that nice?
But something happened in between lines
You lost your faith and I wonder why

So I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know that I'm letting you go
And I'll say, it wasn't easy for me
Yeah, I'll say, it's time I learned to release
So I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know that I'm letting you go
And I'll say, it wasn't easy for me
Yeah, I'll say, it's time I learned to release

(Hah-ah, hah-ah-ah-ah)
I keep making the same mistake
Waiting for you to come back some day
I keep making the same mistake
Waiting for you to come back some day
I keep making the same mistake
Waiting for you to come back

So I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know that I'm letting you go
And I'll say, it wasn't easy for me
Yeah, I'll say, it's time I learned to release
So I'm letting you know, I'm letting you go
I'm letting you know that I'm letting you go
And I'll say, it wasn't easy for me
Yeah, I'll say, it's time I learned to release
