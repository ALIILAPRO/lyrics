		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted to get the hell out of Portland
You wanted to say it was more important
To be where you were raised, understand, my love
I wanted the roll and see the world
You wanted a home, one boy, one girl
But clearly, God had different plans for us

Though we made it down the interstate
I feel my heart begin to break
Is this choice or is it fate by fate?

Maybe we were right
It was good to say goodbye
"Happy ever after" doesn't last
We both knew it was time
To leave those times behind
Let's hope that down the road
We'll cross our paths
So, we could look back and laugh

I'm sure you'll find someone you can settle down with
When I find the one, I'll tell you all about it
Wish we could've been there for one another

Though we made it down the interstate
I feel my heart begin to break
Is this choice or is it fate by fate?

Maybe we were right
It was good to say goodbye
"Happy ever after" doesn't last
We both knew it was time
To leave those times behind
Let's hope that down the road
We'll cross our paths
So, we could look back and laugh

So, we could look back and laugh
So, we could look back and laugh
