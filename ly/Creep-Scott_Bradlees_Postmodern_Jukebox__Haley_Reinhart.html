		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
And I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so very special
Yeah, I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

She's running
Well, she's running out again
I said she's running out
She runs, runs, runs, runs, oh
Well, I said, I said she runs
I said she

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
Yeah, I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
Ooh, I said it
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here? Oh
I don't belong, -ong, mm

I'm a creep, oh
I'm, I'm a weirdo, oh
What the hell am I doing here?
Oh yeah, oh no
I don't belong here, ooh
I don't belong here
