		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell meWhere you wanna go
Somewhere I can't find you
Cold world
Sitting in the back seat
Trying to forget you

Searching through the dust of our memories
I will be for you 

Wanna change, wanna cry, wanna say that
That you care but instead please
Take me to the moon,  Take me to the moon

Wish I could go back in time and catch the falling stars
Take me to the moon,  Take me to the moon
And leave me there

It's always hard to keep the heart warm in front of them all
Don't hurry up I'm still here dreaming safe laid on the floor
Cold world
Sitting in the back seat
Trying to forget you

Tell meWhere you wanna go
Somewhere I can't find you

Searching through the dust of our memories
I will be for you

Wanna change, wanna cry, wanna say that you care but instead please.......
Take me to the moon,  Take me to the moon

Wish I could go back in time and catch the falling stars
Take me to the moon,  Take me to the moon
And leave me there

Take me to the moon,  Take me to the moon
Wish I could go back in time and catch the falling stars
Take me to the moon,  Take me to the moon
And leave me there
