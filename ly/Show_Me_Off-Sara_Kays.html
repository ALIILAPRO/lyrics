		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He likes kissin' me in his car when it's late and it's dark
He likes holdin' me in his bed, shut the door, turn the lock
He'll say I'm pretty outside the bar, then
I'm just a stranger when we walk in
I want a witness, I want a garden
He wants the blinds drawn, he wants a fence

I know when the sun is up
I know when tomorrow comes
I know when my clothes are on
He'll never show me off
Not on a busy street
Not where anyone could see
Does he know it's killin' me?
He'll never show me off
Standin' at his doorway and I'm hopin'
Everything will change this time but
I know when the sun is up
I know when tomorrow comes
Even though it's all I want
He'll never show me off

I like how it sounds when he sings to himself in the shower
I like how he looks when the sun hits him at golden hour
I say I like when we're late night talkin'
Then he goes quiet, won't let me in
I want a witness, he's stayin' guarded
He wants the blinds drawn, I just want him

I know when the sun is up
I know when tomorrow comes
I know when my clothes are on
He'll never show me off
Not on a busy street
Not where anyone could see
Does he know it's killin' me?
He'll never show me off
Standin' at his doorway and I'm hopin'
Everything will change this time but
I know when the sun is up
I know when tomorrow comes
Even though it's all I want
He'll never show me off

I know when the sun is up
I know when tomorrow comes
I know when my clothes are on
He'll never show me off
Not on a busy street
Not where anyone could see
Does he know it's killin' me?
He'll never show me off
Standing at his doorway and I know that
I should walk away this time 'cause
I know when the sun is up
I know when tomorrow comes
Even though it's all I want
