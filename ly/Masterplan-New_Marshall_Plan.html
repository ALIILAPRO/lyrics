		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's the manâ€¦ with the plan
So let me tell you about my masterplan
It's a four-step multi-million dollar-plan, by your anchorman
You will be rich, all will be grand
You're going to fucking live, in wonderland
The first step is, to draw the plot
The second one, I ask you what you've got, what you've got
Third phase, a good atmosphere
I am going to sing it loud now, crystal clear
I am going to turn your inside out
I am going to put you upside down, now
I am going to get, you out of here
I am going to fucking run, and disappear
The first time, you win
On the second try, you're breaking
A sudden hit, you're finished soon
Time is running out, running out by noon
He's the man, with the plan
He's the man, with the plan
It's gonna be, a no man's land
I am going to make you understand
And when you finally realized
I am already long gone
Is this a bet, is this a bet
I am going to fill, you up with debt
Your wonderland, the end is near
I am gonna sing it loud, now crystal clear
I am gonna sing it loud, now crystal clear
I am gonna sing it loud, now crystal clear
I am gonna sing it loud, now crystal clear
He's the man, with the plan
He's the man, with the plan
I am gonna make some noise
I am gonna make you money
I am gonna be your voice
It's gonna be so funny
I am gonna make some noise
I am gonna make you money
I am gonna be your voice
It's gonna be so funny
He's the man, with the plan
He's the man, with the plan
He's the man, with the plan
He's the man, with the plan
So let me tell you about my masterplan
It's gonna be your wonderland
My million dollar plan
