		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Still waiting around for some mystical
Shift in the winds
So honey please, don't go just yet
Cigarette fingers, a shake in the knees
A bit blue, kind of tired, but not broken

'Cause back when I needed someone
You took me in like I was some orphan kid
And you drove me to the ocean
Then you picked me up and dipped me in
You picked me up and dipped me in

Anticipating a magical bend in the road
So hang on, take it slow
Your go bag is packed and your hangover gone
Another dawn at the edge of the known world

Didn't see the mountains 'til
The age of twenty-four cold, sunlit and huge
We're still just babies on the borderline
Watching it all tumble into view
Watching it all tumble into view

And I still believe that you're my ocean
Please believe that I believe that it is true
Believe me when I tell you that I do
