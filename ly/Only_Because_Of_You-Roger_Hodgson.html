		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so we sail towards the dawn, joining those who gently mourn for you
It's only because of you
Friends may come and friends may go, the only friend I need to know is you
It's only because of you
Mighty castles, lonely kings, hear the ragged children sing it's you
It's only because of you
He who smiles at lofty schemes, stems the tide of broken dreams is you
It's only because of you

And when the storms have died away, only truth will live to say it's you
It's only because of you
And when the darkness flies away, only love will shine to say it's true
It's only because of you
