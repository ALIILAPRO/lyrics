		  Damn, I got it bad (I got it bad)

He looked right into my eyes and it was over
I knew I should walk away, but I ran closer
'Cause I don't want something right down the middle
He calls on me late at night and he calls me "Baby"
If you knew how blessed he was, you would probably hate me
He gives it to me more than a little

Take off every piece of me
Until there's only skin on my body
He's what I want, I could just cry
He's what I want, give me more time
(And I just realized)

Damn, I got it bad
I didn't see it coming, I got it bad
I love it, but it's
Definitely something that could ruin my life
'Cause I, I got it bad

He looks like the boy next door from my boyband poster
But he drives like a maniac in his black Range Rover
He got me close, but now it's official

Take off every piece of me
Until there's only skin on my body
He's what I want, I could just cry
He's what I want, give me more time
(And I just realized)

Damn, I got it bad
I didn't see it coming, I got it bad
I love it, but it's
Definitely something that could ruin my life
'Cause I, I got it bad

I throw all these parties wishin' you'll come by
'Cause I'm a sucker for you every night
I really got it bad

Got it so bad, but I didn't see it coming
Got it so bad, and it's definitely something
Ruin my life

Damn (Damn) I got it bad (I got it bad)
I didn't see it coming, I got it bad (I didn't see it coming)
I love it but it's
Definitely something that could ruin my life (ruin my life)
'Cause I, I got it bad

I got it bad
