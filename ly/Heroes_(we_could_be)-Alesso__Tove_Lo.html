		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We go hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That's where we run

Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

Anybody's got the power
They don't see it
'Cause they don't understand
Spin around and run for hours
You and me, we got the world in our hands

Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light 
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
