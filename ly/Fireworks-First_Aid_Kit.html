		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night
As the lights flickered and they failed
I had it all figured out

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

I took a trip out to the frozen lake
And you felt so far away
But I could feel it washing over me
There's no escaping the harsh light of day

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Stood out on that beach in Chicago
Woke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue
Wherever I went I always knew, always knew
'Til I didn't know

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night
