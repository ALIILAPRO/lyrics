		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driver, do you mind
Turn off Patsy Cline
Walking on my own tonight
Hate being impolite
But no small talk, I'm tired
Just wake me when we arrive

Oh, pick up speed and sandwiches
A Ziploc bag, a fifth of gin
Don't ask me why
Oh, drop me by the burn-out sign
Where hell is near and heaven hides
With a pair of dice

Here at The Nowhere Inn
Where nothing and no one wins
Where our last days are spent
Wasted on song and sin
Here at The Nowhere Inn
The hallways are labyrinths
Where I last sold my myth
Now I live at The Nowhere Inn

Always knew you'd end up here
Been waiting now for years to see you
In my everlasting mirror
Everybody knows your name
And knows you are to blame
For every trickle of your mama's tears

We're all at nowhere and where are you now
We're all at nowhere and where are you now

Here at The Nowhere Inn
Where nothing and no one wins
Where our last days are spent
Wasted on song and sin
I'm here at The Nowhere Inn
The hallways are labyrinths
Here I sold my last myth
Now I live at The Nowhere Inn

We're all at nowhere and where are you now?
We're all at nowhere and where are you now?
We're all at nowhere and where are you now?
We're all at nowhere and where are you, where are you?
Where are you, where are you?
Where are you, where are you?
Where are you, where are you?
Where are you, where are you?
Where are you, where are you?
