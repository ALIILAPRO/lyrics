		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we're in the dark
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
I can share my love with you
When no one knows
Yeah, when life gets hard
You are all I know
Oh, darling
I can bare my soul to you

And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling

And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling

When we're in the dark
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
I can share my love with you
When no one knows
Yeah, when life gets hard
You are all I know
Oh, darling
I can bare my soul to you

When we're in the dark
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
I can share my love with you
When no one knows
Yeah, when life gets hard
You are all I know
Oh, darling
I can bare my soul to you

When we're in the dark
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
I can share my love with you
When no one knows
Yeah, when life gets hard
You are all I know
Oh, darling
I can bare my soul to you

And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
And we're all alone
Oh, darling

When we're in the dark
And we're all alone
Oh, darling
I can share my love with you
When no one knows
Yeah, when life gets hard
You are all I know
Oh, darling
I can bare my soul to you
