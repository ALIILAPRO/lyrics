		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving out through the windmills
And some of them were still
Sometimes it's hard to catch the wind
And bend it to your will

Even though it's hard to know
Just how the story ends
The road is long and it takes its time
On that you can depend

Lay me down in the river
And wash this place away
Break me down like sand from a stone
Maybe I'll be whole again one day

Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again
Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again

Somewhere between Heaven and Hell
A soul knows where it's been
I want to feel my spirit lifted up
And catch my breath again

Lay me down in the river
And wash this place away
Break me down like sand from a stone
Maybe I'll be whole again one day

Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again
Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again
Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again one day
