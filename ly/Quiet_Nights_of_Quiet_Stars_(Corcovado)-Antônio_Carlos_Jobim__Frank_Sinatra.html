		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quiet nights of quiet stars 
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams 
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, how lovely

This is where I want to be 
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke
I've found with you 
The meaning of existence, my love

I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke
I've found with you 
The meaning of existence, oh my love
