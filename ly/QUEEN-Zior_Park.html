		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna be pretty
I just wanna be iconic
I've got no time to care of
Haters who try to stop me

I'm addicted to dopamine
Spotlight makes me feel catharsis
Enjoying debates and hatred
Need a stronger stimulation

Dress up like a girl, you may feel awkward
You may feel uncomfortable to my look
It's different from what you've thought

But we're stuck in the phone
We are meant to meet again kids
In the midst of the pointed fingers
I will reign as the ripped and torn

Queen
My queen, your highness
They don't know what they did
Forgive 'em
My queen
Conceal your schemes and skin

My queen, your highness
Don't reveal your knowledge
Conceal it underneath your skin
Until you reign

Can't remove makeup
Even if it's already smudged
Can't take off dress
'Til I've done all the performances
Need to be a perfect girl
To catch all the cameras here
How beautiful when I lay down
On the ground as a queen
My queen

Always have to be sensitive
I'm browsing 'eyes magazine'
For the new shoes
For the new pants
For the new trends
Don't let myself get old

I sold the normal life
For the gold and diamond
Controversy is must for these young customers

A wig and heel, a lipstick
And weird smile are quite working on this table
Let me hear your blessing
Let me hear your retching
Trick or treat, guess whether I'm a gay or not
It's working on this table
In the midst of the pointed fingers
I will reign as the ripped and torn

Queen
My queen, your highness
They don't know what they did
Forgive 'em, my queen
Conceal your schemes and skin

My queen, your highness
Don't reveal your knowledge
Conceal it underneath your skin
Until you reign

Can't remove makeup
Even if it's already smudged
Can't take off dress
'Til I've done all the performances
Need to be a perfect girl to catch all the cameras here
How beautiful when I lay down on the ground as a queen
My queen

Queen from the bottom
You never get it
But you will serve it
Are you gonna be freaked out again
When kingdom comes?

Queen from the bottom (bottom, bottom, bottom)
Are you gonna be freaked out again
When kingdom comes?

Queen, my queen
Queen, my queen
Queen, my queen
Queen, my queen
Queen, my queen
