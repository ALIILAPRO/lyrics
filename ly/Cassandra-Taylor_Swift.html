		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call

When the first stone's thrown, there's screaming
In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's "Burn the witch," they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet

So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So, they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

I was in my tower weaving nightmares
Twisting all my smiles into snarls
They say, "What doesn't kill you makes you aware"
What happens if it becomes who you are?

So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So, they set my life in flames, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto something
The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
They all said nothing
Blood's thick but nothing like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a morning warning, no one heard

I patched up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all

So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So, they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

Ahh-ahh
I was onto something
Ahh-ahh
They all said nothing

Blood's thick but nothing like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a morning warning, no one heard
No one heard
Not a single word was heard

When the first stone's thrown, there's screaming
In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's "Burn the witch," they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet
It's so quiet
