		<p>
		  If it were up to me, there would be no more lightning
Cause I know how much how much you hate storms
When I had to choose between the winter time and you
you swore I'd never be cold

Here I am, freezing
Trying hard, trying so hard
Trying hard, trying so hard
To please you

When is it my turn to cut my strings
I always take care of everything
I guess I'll just wait till you're done
How much longer can this go on?

Trying hard, trying so hard
Trying hard, trying so hard
To be free

I'll just wait till we're done
Why can't I be like everyone
I'll do my best to feel like home
There's no reason for you to know
So I'll just be quiet til I lose my mind

I'll try

Trying hard, trying so hard
Trying so hard
Trying hard, trying so hard
To be me
