		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah

Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on
Tell me the answer well, you may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer

Look out, Helter Skelter helter Skelter
Helter Skelter

Will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast
But don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Look out, Helter Skelter helter Skelter
Helter Skelter look out

When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah

Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast
But don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Look out, Helter Skelter helter Skelter
Helter Skelter

Look out yes, she is
Helter Skelter, baby coming down, fast
