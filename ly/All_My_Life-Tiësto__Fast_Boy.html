		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life, all my life
I've been runnin' around, I've been tryin' to find
All my life, all my life
I've been lookin' for love, I'm still lookin' tonight

Are you the one to free my heart?
Are you the spotlight in the dark?
Are you the one to free my heart? Yeah

All my life, all my life
I've been runnin' around, I've been tryin' to find
All my life, all my life
I've been lookin' for love, I'm still lookin' tonight

Are you the one to free my heart?
Are you the spotlight in the dark?
Are you the one to free my heart? Yeah

I wanna know if someone's out there (save me)
Could you be, could you be mine? (Mine)
If we ain't got love, then we got nothing (we got nothing)
Then we got nothing

All my life, all my life
I've been runnin' around, I've been tryin' to find
All my life, all my life
I've been lookin' for love, I'm still lookin' tonight

Are you the one to free my heart?
Are you the spotlight in the dark?
Are you the one to free my heart? Yeah

All my life, all my life
I've been runnin' around, I've been tryin' to find
All my life, all my life
I've been lookin' for love, I'm still lookin' tonight

Are you the one to free my heart?
Are you the spotlight in the dark?
Are you the one to free my heart? Yeah

All my life, all my life
I've been runnin' around, I've been tryin' to find
All my life, all my life
I've been lookin' for love, I'm still lookin' tonight
