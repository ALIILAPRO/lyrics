		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby just come to me
Don't break my heart tonight
Swinging my soul to side
Baby just come to me
Be what you want to be
Using your fantasy
I look your soul to see
Baby just come to me
Now we can do it right
Holding each other tight
Now I can make it right
I promise you the light
Waiting until daylight
I got to hand a key
Open your heart to me
Now I can set you free
Be what you want to be
Don't want to be alone
I got to be so strong
Don't want to be alone
Baby I love you so
I never let you go
I'm looking for your face
Waiting for warm embrace
I'm living in the space
I'm following your trace
Tell me what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'm goin'to make it great
Girl are you air to see

I got to hand a key
Open your heart to me
Now I can set you free
Be what you want to be
Don't want to be alone
I got to be so strong
Don't want to be alone
Baby I love you so
I never let you go
I'm looking for your face
Waiting for warm embrace
I'm living in the space
I'm following your trace
Tell me what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'm goin' to make it great
Girl are you air to see
Moving it, come to me
Baby just come to me
Don't break my heart tonight
Swinging my soul to side
Baby just come to me
Be what you want to be
Using your fantasy
I look your soul to see

A little thing you won't belong
I can see your face to strong
It seem you want to think your are in right, oh mind
Don't you ever satisfy my soul
With any find my side
I'm not laughing
I'm not crying
Don't you go
Baby I love you so
I never let you go
I'm looking for your face
Waiting for warm embrace
I'm living in the space
I following your trace
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me what's goin' on
I'm gonna make you queen
Girl I will ever see
Moving it, come to me
