		<p>
		  (Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Yeah (phew, phew)
Gettin' that money the same, gettin' more money my thing
Gettin' that money the same, gettin' this money my thing (yeah, yeah)
Gettin' that (phew), gettin' that the money
(COUPE)

Brazy (brazed out) 
You didn't catch no body back then (yeah), you ain't build to make it (uh-uh)
Put you on a mission, we gon' see if you built to take it (show me some')
Nigga get to bitchin' when it time to get to blazin' (pussy boy)
My trigger finger itchin' and I'm ready to do some' crazy (eat some')
Faced the blood, hit my face, that body is contagious (he's a dub)
Man, I want some more of them bitches, drop the location (pull up)
Itchin' for a body, I'm at home, I'm just pacin' (what up?)
Sippin' on this Styrofoam, I'm all alone, no chaser

Bales, I'm havin', the pounds, I'm havin' 
The pressure of this shit (pressure)
Yeah, I'm the flexer 
I'm the one that do 'em wrong and took they lick (I did)
That dirty nigga, that big Slimeball 
Talk that shit and I pop that shit (big Slimeball)
And I got that motherfucker off off of my drip 
Get in the cut and I pull out my hip (yeah)
I got my gun right on they lip 
Now, give me that, give me that, pussy, get down (get down)
Still the same nigga with the get-down-get-down gang 
Ski mask on my face and I'm rockin' that bang
You know I like robbin', that shit is my thing 
You niggas too pussy, you can't do the same (lame)
I know that they scared 'cause Slime ain't contained (huh?) 
I'm sippin' on Wock' and I got that flame (I got that flame)
And I don't got no heart, I just love my gang
It ain't 4L, then what do you claim?
You comin' around, this shit gon' get dangerous (damn) 
You must don't know I'm not with the savin'
I'm all about lettin' 'em go, blazin' (blazin') 
Shit, how did we make it? (Make it)
Takin' shit, brazy (yeah), blood gang

Brazy (brazed out) 
You didn't catch no body back then (yeah), you ain't build to make it (uh-uh)
Put you on a mission, we gon' see if you built to take it (show me some')
Nigga get to bitchin' when it time to get to blazin' (pussy boy)
My trigger finger itchin' and I'm ready to do some' crazy (eat some')
Faced the blood, hit my face, that body is contagious (he's a dub)
Man, I want some more of them bitches, drop the location (pull up)
Itchin' for a body, I'm at home, I'm just pacin' (what up?)
Sippin' on this Styrofoam, I'm all alone, no chaser

Throwback tunes and hop in the hotbox, pull up, droptop, brr (fuck it)
Bitch ass nigga had got me two racks at the door back, got him robbed 
(Say what? He tried me like that?)
Anyway, money my main priority 
But shootin' just part of my job (my job)
Nigga, I'm runnin' the hood 
I'm standin' on business, ain't never got robbed (I swear)
Post on Bouldercrest every day 
Like that motherfucker part of my job (bitch, that part of my job)
Pull up on Rombay, "Here jay" 
Give him a hundred dollars just to wash my car (just to wash my car)
In the hood, East Atlanta, Zone 6 
Pussy ass nigga, I'm a motherfuckin' star (I'm a star, nigga)
Every time I pull up in the hood 
Two hunnid on the dash in that lil' boy car (lil' boy car, nigga)

You didn't catch no body back then (yeah), you ain't build to make it (uh-uh)
Put you on a mission, we gon' see if you built to take it (show me some')
Nigga get to bitchin' when it time to get to blazin' (pussy boy)
My trigger finger itchin' and I'm ready to do some' crazy (eat some')
Faced the blood, hit my face, that body is contagious (he's a dub)
Man, I want some more of them bitches, drop the location (pull up)
Itchin' for a body, I'm at home, I'm just pacin' (what up?)
Sippin' on this Styrofoam, I'm all alone, no chaser

Let's ride, the fuck you talkin' 'bout?
I might hop in that, you know, water, all that, damn, mm-hmm
Damn, and that too, and that too
That's true, I ain't goin', nah
