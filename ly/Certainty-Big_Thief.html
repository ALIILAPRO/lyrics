		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Name on the line, last request
Pull the car over to find some rest
Saying I love you
Need to lie here, need to leave
Living in the debt of make-believe
Saying I owe you
Crooked as a crow gnawing on dawn
Shadow from the grass and the dirt on the lawn
Why do I string you along?

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child believing
You lay beside me, sleeping on a plane in the future

Sit on the phone, watch TV
Romance, action, mystery
Wanted to show you
Sine wave is a particle ride
Bring your light out then in on the tide
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you is a river so high
Maybe I love you is a river so low
I love you, still don't know

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child believing
You lay beside me, sleeping on a plane in the future

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child believing
You lay beside me, sleeping on a plane in the future
