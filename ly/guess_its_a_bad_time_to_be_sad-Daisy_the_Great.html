		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open my eyes wanna get out outta my head
But I'm waitin on the rain 
Hummin the same song and the red sun is caught in the clouds with the rest of my days 

Guess its a bad time
To be sad
What a shame 
Oh I wanna be closer to someone to hold at the bottom of all of this what do I got
But myself and my stuff and my thoughts 
But myself and my stuff and my thoughts

Follow the lines in the grey wall 
Trying to see a face in the paint 
Talk to the shadows when the wind blows
I'm losing my mind every word is the same

Guess its a bad time
To be sad
What a shame 
Oh I wanna be closer to someone to hold at the bottom of all of this what do I got
But myself and my stuff and my thoughts 
But myself and my stuff and my thoughts

Oh I'm making a list of the things that I wanted to do when I found some time to do them
Now all I have is a list and the things that I had in my room before
And the sleep that I lost is awake in the corner with all the other monsters 
And the dust from under the rug is out on the floor
Now I have to face myself 
I guess I have to face myself

Guess its a bad time
To be sad
What a shame 
Oh I wanna be closer to someone to hold at the bottom of all of this what do I got
But myself and my stuff 

Guess its a bad time
To be sad
What a shame 
Oh I wanna be closer to someone to hold at the bottom of all of this what do I got
But myself and my stuff and my thoughts 
But myself and my stuff and my thoughts
