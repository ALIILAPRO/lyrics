		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In times of peace
Times of war
The sky remains the same
You reach for the stars too far away

The one who's born in misery
Is left without a chance
But still holding on to naked life

Amamos la vida
Amamos la vida

What a time, what a place
For someone who's lost
It's hard to survive
In the jungle of life

Amamos la vida
Amamos la vida

Is there someone to hear me
Is there no one to see
Is there someone to hear me
Doesn't anybody care

A single tear in the river of life
The dogs have turned their backs
Today a face, that you don't know
And tomorrow it's you

Amamos la vida
A single tear in the river of life
Amamos la vida
Amamos la vida
