		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shyin' away
I'll be coming for your love, okay and

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me, I'm stumblin' away
Slowly learnin' that life is okay, and
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry and

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

And, oh, things that you say
Is it life or just to play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
I'll be gone
In a day or two
In a day or two
