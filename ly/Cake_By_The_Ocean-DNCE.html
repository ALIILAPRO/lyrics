		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nah, nah, yeah
(Cake by the ocean)

Oh, no
See you walkin' 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl, why those feet cold?
We just gettin' started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe (ah)

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh)
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me (ah-ah-ah)
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy (huh)
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously

Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet-sweet cravin', whoa-oh 
Let's lose our minds and go fuckin' crazy 
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fuckin' crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)

Goddamn
See you lickin' frostin' from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm beggin', "Yes, ma'am"
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, ooh

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh)
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me (ah-ah-ah)
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy (huh)
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously (whoa-oh)

Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet-sweet cravin', whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fuckin' crazy (ah)
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fuckin' crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean

Ooh, ah-ah
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
Ooh, ah-ah
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)

Hey, you're fuckin' delicious
Talk to me, girl

Talk to me, baby (talk to me, baby)
I'm goin' blind from this sweet-sweet cravin', whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fuckin' crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (hey) (uh)
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go (and go what?), fuckin' crazy (that's right)
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' (I'm ready), we'll eat cake by the ocean (ah, yeah)

Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready, I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
