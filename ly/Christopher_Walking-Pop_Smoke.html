		<p>
		  Niggas sayin' they outside (ooh, haha)
Niggas sayin' they outside (woo, come outside)
Send the addy, we gon' slide (slide, slide, slide)
Air it out when we arrive (doo-doo-doo-doo)
Poppin' that shit but they don't want the smoke (nah, niggas don't want no smoke)
She like it rough when we fuck, so I'm grabbin' that bitch by the throat (grr)
Niggas sayin' they outside (they're outside)
Send the addy, we gon' slide (slide, slide)

Heard he was talkin'
But he never jumped off the stoop (he never jumped off the stoop)
Take down the streets, then I pull up and pop out and shoot (pop out and shoot)
And they say I got the juice (yeah, yeah)
I bought the Dior, Dior, now that's all that I rock from the shoes (ayy)
Porsche niggas, hot boy, you ain't in the field, you a top boy
We gon' tie that boy up like a cowboy
I'm the one that they envy like Calboy (yeah)
Broke bitches ain't allowed (you not allowed)
She wanna fuck with a real one, but real niggas back in style
I ain't no window shopper, your man out here window shoppin' (yeah)
I be in all the stores, and no, we ain't window shoppin' (woo)
She throw it back 'cause I'm poppin' (woo)
I'm makin' plays with the, we run it back like an option (yeah)

Woo
Niggas sayin' they outside (ooh, haha)
Niggas sayin' they outside (woo, come outside)
Send the addy, we gon' slide (slide, slide, slide)
Air it out when we arrive (doo-doo-doo-doo)
Poppin' that shit but they don't want the smoke (nah, niggas don't want no smoke)
She like it rough when we fuck, so I'm grabbin' that bitch by the throat (grr)
Niggas sayin' they outside (they're outside)
Send the addy, we gon' slide

Just 'cause I dance, don't think I'm pussy
Don't make me pull up with the stick (woo, stick, stick)
I got a Louis V bag to match with the fit (Louis V, Louis V, Louis)
VVS ones on my wrist (ice, ice, ice)
All this water on me, I got water for me and my bitch (huh, me and my bitch)
Drownin' (drownin'), flooded (flooded)
They told me the price, I said, "Fuck it" (oh)
I spend it all with no budget (budget)
If it ain't a hunnid, I ain't budgin' (huh, are you dumb?)
I made like two hunnid in London (bow)
You out here gassin' these bitches
You pumpin' shit up like you Budden (bow, bow, bow)
If I see a opp I'ma throw out the car (grr)
I'm at the crib with your bitch
She came with a dress, she left with no drawers (huh, left with no drawers)
She love how I talk (love how I talk)
She know that papi outside, she know I'm the king of New York (grr)

Woo
Niggas sayin' they outside (ooh, haha)
Niggas sayin' they outside (woo, come outside)
Send the addy, we gon' slide (slide, slide, slide)
Air it out when we arrive (doo-doo-doo-doo)
Poppin' that shit but they don't want the smoke (nah, niggas don't want no smoke)
She like it rough when we fuck, so I'm grabbin' that bitch by the throat (grr)
Niggas sayin' they outside (they're outside)
Send the addy, we gon' slide (slide, slide)
