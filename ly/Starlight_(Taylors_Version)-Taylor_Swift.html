		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up, late one night out the window
We were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playin' when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about
Things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singin' the blues
If you keep thinkin' that way"
He was tryna skip rocks on the ocean
Sayin' to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talkin' crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancin' with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
