		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby bone, never wanted to be alone, yuh
Baby bone, never wanted a fucking throne, yuh
That bread is what I gotta focus on
But if the shoe fit I'ma wear it
Spit it out your mouth, don’t be embarrassed
Time is money, can't be moving like I'm Gary, life so scary
Everybody carry guns, everybody on drugs
Everybody suicidal but got nowhere to run
Who gives a therapist therapy? Think I might need me one
I’m an insomniac with a gambling problem, throwing my life away
Fucking hoes with no condoms until my dick evaporates
Mask on but no masquerade
She love to hear my voice every time she wanna masturbate
Buffet boys up in your bitch boy

I just caught the flu, sitting inside of the coupe
With my hair off of the roof, titties out like Bettie Boop
And my pockets got a lot of loot, pocket rocket, too
If you sat up inside my shoes, oh you won't know what to do

Yeah, rolling through my city with my limo tinted windows
And nobody can see in it, used to pull up in a Civic
Wait a minute quit your bitching, bitch and I'ma slide my dick up in it
Less than a minute, I'm cool, I'm good, I'm straight, I'm finished

Bitch get in your bag, like the rabbit in the hat do
Swerving in a hooptie with them babies blowing past you
No I didn't jug you little bitch, but I planned too
Pussy talking shit behind the keyboard in the chat room
I’m just chasing goals and catching bags along the way
If you try me catch a semi automatic to your face
I might go and rent the boat and leave it anchored for the day
Just to pull up with my gang ’cause we just wanna celebrate
Split that shit up like a Kit-Kat with my partner by my Bentley
Why you ain't get no money, but you sitting out here bitching?
Lil bitch, I’m a trapper, I don't care about no pension
Man, somebody call the cops because my roof is going missing
