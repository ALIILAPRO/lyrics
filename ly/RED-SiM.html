		<p>
		  Mic check one, two, ay

Now you listen to the sound of a rebel
Of rats running through under cities and ghettoes
A treasure box always be found at the lower level
And I'm the rat that made a deal with the devil
Call a therapist, he's a bit crazy
No, I'm not pissed, feel free to hate me
But you gotta stop forcing your opinion on me
I'm here for myself not to make your day complete
Oh why, oh why

Tell me why, tell me why do you divide everything into pieces?
Tell me why, tell me why should I treat you like a princess?
Don't try to judge me, I'm not a suspect
It's too much, I refuse to accept it
Imagine why, imagine why we all bleed the same red

I'm gonna make your wisdom flow
The life is complicated more than you know
What I'm about to show you is your kingdom falls
I'll let you know how it goes

I'm not a bully, just doing my duty
Like love scenes in spy movies
Same old routine, I'm not a machine
We can be what we want to be

Don't overdo it

Tell me why, tell me why do you divide everything into pieces?
Tell me why, tell me why should I treat you like a princess?
Don't try to judge me, I'm not a suspect
It's too much, I refuse to accept it
Imagine why, imagine why we all bleed the same red

(Tell me why) why can't we be friends?
why can't we be friends?
Even if I respect other people, your journey never ends
(Tell me why) why don't you sing with me
(Tell me why) don't you dance with me?
(Tell me why) why are you always nagging
(Tell me why) why don't you do your thing

I wasn't born to win, wasn't born to lose
No worry about the others

Imagine why we all bleed the same red

Tell me why, tell me why do you divide everything into pieces?
Tell me why, tell me why should I treat you like a princess?
Don't try to judge me, I'm not a suspect
It's too much, I refuse to accept it
Imagine why, imagine why we all bleed the same red
