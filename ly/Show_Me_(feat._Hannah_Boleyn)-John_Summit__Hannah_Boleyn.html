		  Show me you love me

(Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away)
(Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me)
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
To show me you love me, to show me you love me
To show me you love me

Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow 'cause moments never stay
Before night is done, just show me you love me

Show me, show me
Show me you love me

Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
To show me you love me

Show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow, it's way too far away
Don't wait for the sun to show me you love me
Don't wait for tomorrow 'cause moments never stay
Before night is done, just show me you love me
Show me, show me
Show me, show me
Show me you love me
