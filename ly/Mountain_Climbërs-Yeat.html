		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My bitch, she rock Alyx
She a mountain climber
My bitch, she rock Alyx

My bitch, she rock Alyx
She a mountain climber
I rock a ice pick, I'm a mountain climber
All this ice on me, I'm a mountain climber
I get high as God, I'm a mountain climber
Yeah, yeah, baby, she a bad, bad lady
I been high as God lately
Switch and crashed dummies, baby
Yeah, crash dummies, boo, I'm high as fuck
I'm booted up
I crashed the Mercedes, CLA AMG, the latest
I was jumping on a bed in the hotel
I smacked lil' shawty ass
It's redder than Ro Tel
Yeah, get that boy a snippet
Cut the whole tail
Lil' boy dead so I guess it didn't go well

Yeah, she pull up and play the
Flute, she ate my semen, oh
Boy, I'm not your twin, I'm not your kid
I'm not your cuddy
This Trackhawk got seven hundred and
Seven horses in it got a garage so I can put
All of my Porsches in it
Flawless, the coupe
I went and cut the fucking top off
Flawless, these VS1 diamonds, they bust
They top dollar all of 'em is pussy cats
They can't come for the top dog
I was in the and I left the fucking top down
Now that we the hardest artists
I know they wanna talk now
Now that we got all this bread
They wanna talk down
Bitch I'm on a private jet
I can't even talk now bitch I'm so high up
All I can do is talk down
Beam on it, beam on it
I wanna, I wanna, wanna pop a bean
Pull up on me, she on top of me
This shit as easy as a, b, c, yeah, one, two
Three one of my twizzies'll hit they
Melly up for nothing, for free
Song way too hot, I burn your ears
I gave you fifth degree
I cannot die today or I can
Die when I turn fifty three
I put this shit on God, bitch
This is not no cap, this no kidding
I can see how I'd die 'cause I
Got beef with one of my kidneys

My bitch, she rock Alyx
She a mountain climber
I rock a ice pick, I'm a mountain climber
All this ice on me, I'm a mountain climber
I get high as God, I'm a mountain climber
Yeah, yeah, baby, she a bad, bad lady
I been high as God lately
Switch and crashed dummies, baby
Yeah, crash dummies, boo, I'm high as fuck
I'm booted up
I crashed the Mercedes, CLA AMG, the latest
I was jumping on a bed in the hotel
I smacked lil' shawty ass
It's redder than Ro Tel
Yeah, get that boy a snippet
Cut the whole tail
Lil' boy dead so I guess it didn't go well
