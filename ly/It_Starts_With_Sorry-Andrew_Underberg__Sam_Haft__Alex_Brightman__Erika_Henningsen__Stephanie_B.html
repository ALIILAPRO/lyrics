		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It starts with "sorry"
That's your foot in the door, one simple "sorry"
Spoken straight from your core
The path to forgiveness is a twisting trail of hearts
But "sorry" is where it starts

Who could forgive a dirtbag like me?
I don't deserve your amnesty

Can't we just kill him?
Shoot him and spill his blood?

That's an option you could choose

Works for us

But who hasn't been in his shoes?
It starts with "sorry"

Sorry

Dig down deeper and say one sincere "sorry"

I'm so sorry

And your journey's underway
It'll take time to cover (my) your vast multitude of sins
But "sorry" is where it begins
It starts with "sorry"
