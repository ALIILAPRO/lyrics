		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathing life into dead trees
The first to stand alone
The night is worn, the night is gone
She keeps on dancing, mother of all

From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again

Pouring stars into wide eyes
Another Orpheus sings
The night is worn, the night's reborn
From lost to loved it never ends

From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again

From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved
Lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved
Lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
From lost to loved and back again
