		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Left, right, step up to the spot light
Why you actin' uptight? Takin' you to school (that's right)
High, low, don't tell me you don't know how to ever let go
Takin' you to school (that's right)

Tonight we burn it all
Get high, get tall
Yeah we're lighter than air
You got the key to your release
So pop that lock until you're lighter than air

If you wanna be it
You've got to dream
If you got the key then baby, pop that lock
If you wanna free it
You have got to scream
If you got the key then baby, pop that lock
Banshee Boys and Dancey Girls get down down down

Werk b****, you don't got to stress this
Got 'em feelin' restless, show 'em how it's done (alright)
Secret, don't care if you don't keep it.
Don't care if you leak it, show 'em how it's done (alright)

Tonight we burn it all
Get high, get tall
Yeah we're lighter than air
You got the key to your release
So pop that lock until you're lighter than air

If you wanna be it
You've got to dream
If you got the key then baby, pop that lock
If you wanna free it
You have got to scream
If you got the key then baby, pop that lock
Banshee Boys and Dancey Girls get down down down
Get down
Get down

Work, work, work alright get down
Work, work, work alright get down

Yeah! Ay yeah yeah!

Banshee Boys and Dancey Girls get down down down
You better pop that lock!

If you wanna be it
You've got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it
You have got to scream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
Get down yeah!
Baby pop that lock, get down!
Get down
Pop that lock, get down!
