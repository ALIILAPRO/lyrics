		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got venom dripping from my lips
Know who you're about to kiss
Think that you can handle it
Boy, it's on
Just step into the danger zone
Shake it if you wanna roll
Never bend, just take control, stakes are on

So sick, ill-equipped, gonna stick to a stick
I don't think that I can stop this
Pick it up, let it drop, be my cup, stir it up
Oh no, I'll never stop

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
'Cause tonight got poison on my mind
That power I got
You'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind

So cool out, let her in the scene
'Cause tonight I need you clean
My sexy little dirty scream
Yeah, it's on
And then I get you in my stream
Play it hard to be extreme
You're so cool, baby, you're so mean (turn me on, turn me on)

So sick, ill-equipped, gonna stick to a stick
I don't think that I can stop this
Pick it up, let it drop, be my cup, stir it up
Oh no, I'll never stop, hey!

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
'Cause tonight got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh)
I got that poison, that poison on my mind

I got that poison, that poison, that poison
That'll make you fall in love with me
(Turn me on, turn me on)
I got that poison, that poison, that poison
That'll make you fall in love with me
(Turn me on, turn me on)

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
Got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine, feel alive
Got poison on my mind

That bad girl power I got, I'll abuse it tonight
'Cause tonight got poison on my mind
That power I got, you'll be mine when I strive, feel alive
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh, uh huh)
Got poison on my mind
I got that poison (uh huh), I got that poison (uh huh, uh huh)
Got poison on my mind
