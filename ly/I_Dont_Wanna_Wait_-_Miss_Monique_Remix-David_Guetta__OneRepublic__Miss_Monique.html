		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's make tonight the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait

Swimmin' in the deep blue
Got me thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just tryin' to dive right in
Wanna spend tonight like
The last night of our lives
Chasin' all the love we can

And now, oh, I'm in a sea of lights
And all that I can see is you
And now I'm dyin' to feel alive
So baby, let's try somethin' new

Let's make tonight the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait
Tonight's the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait

I've been chasin' so long
Every right that feels wrong
Rather be with you instead
There's somethin' 'bout it right here
Got me seein' so clear
Rainbow-coloured skies ahead

And now, oh, I'm in a sea of lights
And all that I can see is you
And now I'm dyin' to feel alive
So baby, let's try somethin' new

Let's make tonight the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait
Tonight's the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait

Let's make tonight the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait
