		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever I'm hurt, you are my nurse
You stand beside me through all seasons
You clean up my face, you fill up my space
With white linen and syringes
Out on the road you carry my load
Make it lighter when I feel weak
And when i am blind you crawl in my mind
And make me wiser than I could ever be alone

I know it ain't easy
I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose

When I make a mess you wash and you dress me
When I'm wired you talk me down
When I'm a fool you're calm and you're cool
I never want for anything when you're around
When I'm in your bed, all you ever do
Is treat me with respect, but I don't know how

I know It ain't easy
Yes, I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose

Though I've made some big mistakes
You don't complain at all
Even when you come and find me
Crying like a baby
Standing up in the bathtub

Whenever I'm hurt, you are my nurse
You stand beside me through all seasons
You're patient when I'm slow, warm when I'm cold
You're everything I'm not, you know everything I don't

I know it ain't easy
I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose
These are the roads that we choose
These are the roads that we choose
