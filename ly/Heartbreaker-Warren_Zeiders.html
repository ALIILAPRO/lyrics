		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I knew I never should've took you home
To meet my mom and dad and tuck you in my bed, no
But there's something about the high
Chasing after someone that you know could drive you to the edge, oh

I know this ain't gonna work
But somehow I just never learn

'Cause I'm a heartbreaker, yeah, that's what I do
One of us always gets broken in two
I'm a heartbreaker, yeah, I'm just the type
To fall for the girl that's got somebody else on her mind
You could say I'm a heartbreaker
'Cause the heart I keep breakin' is mine
I keep breakin' mine

Now we met, you was innocent
You were just a girl goin' out with your friends, yeah
Lookin' back, how you wore that dress
It's obvious you were out for revenge, oh

I know it's a losin' game
It always ends up the same

'Cause I'm a heartbreaker, yeah, that's what I do
One of us always gets broken in two
I'm a heartbreaker, yeah, I'm just the type
To fall for the girl that's got somebody else on her mind
You could say I'm a heartbreaker
'Cause the heart I keep breakin' is mine
I keep breakin' mine

Maybe that's what I get for the good ones I hurt
I keep chasin' the fire and I keep gettin' burned

I'm a heartbreaker, yeah, that's what I do
Crazy recognizes crazy, I guess I'm just like you
I'm a heartbreaker, yeah, I'm just the type
To fall for the girl that's got somebody else on her mind
You could say I'm a heartbreaker
'Cause the heart I keep breakin' is mine, mine
I keep breakin', I keep breakin'
I keep breakin' mine
