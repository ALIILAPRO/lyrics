		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see it in your eyes, that you wanna get out
I can see it in your eyes, that you need it right now
That you need it right now, that you wanna get out
That you need it right now, that you wanna get out

Yeah, I just wanna hear the sound, drive our Camaros out of town
Baby, we could leave right now, woah
Yeah, I just wanna feel alive, baby, take your time
Smokin' on this loud, whoa

Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin', I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me, I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie 'til the sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my nuts
