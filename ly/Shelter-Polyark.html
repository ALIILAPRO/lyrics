		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stood by your side
And now I'm all but on your mind
Please answer me and let me in
I need your help tonight
Don't send me away again
I am too weak to fight

I'm getting sick from distancing
I need to tell you all my fears
All I want is that you listen to me
Just give me warmth and dry my tears

Give me shelter
Before I die out here
Give me shelter
Until I'm free of fears

You left me outside
Now I'm alone and running blind
A lesson I don't want to learn
I wish I could be brave
Your attention is so hard to earn
Some words are all I crave

I'm getting sick from distancing
I need to tell you all my fears
All I want is that you listen to me
Just give me warmth and dry my tears

Give me shelter
Before I die out here
Give me shelter
Until I'm free of fears
