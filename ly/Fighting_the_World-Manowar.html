		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fight, fight, fight
Fighting the World every single day 
Fighting the World for the right to play
Heavy Metal in my brain
I'm fighting for Metal cause it's here to stay

Fighting, fighting, fighting the World 
I been fighting the World
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been figthing
Fight for a living-Fighting the World
Fight for a living-Fighting the World
Fight for a living-Fighting the World
Fight 

Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look'em in the eye
Tell'em no way
Strips on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay

Fighting,fighting,fighting the World
I been figthing the World
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World
I been figthing

Fight for a living-Fighting the World
Fight for a living-Fighting the World
Fight for a living-Fighting the World
Fight Yeah!
See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing in our mind
Radio playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder'til we all get fried

Fighting,fighting,fighting the World
I been figthing the World
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World
I been figthing
Fight-Fighting the World
Fight-Fighting the World
Fight-Fighting the World
Fight-Fighting the World
Fight for a living-Fighting the World
