		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, well I just woke up
And you already don't care
That I tried my best to hold you
Through the headset that you wear
And as tight as I might hold it
Over where the signal's good
There's no way to save your evening now
Through the little phone that could

And yes I was tempted
And I christened me lonely, I pretended to falter
And I burnt scented candles there
And I hung some good pictures where
The paintwork was perfect so no-one could doubt it
Oh, I was still losing

So show me the land you acquired
And slip into something beside
The holes you try to hide
And lay out your rules for the night
Oh, don't eat your toast in my bed
Oh, darling I
I never felt the crumbs until you said this place
Is not for any man
Nor particles of bread

You furnished your suffering
And you played a good organ, and the world gathered singing
Good words that you'd stolen
And every phone died then
And no-one had Wi-Fi inside your apartment
So we knelt at your altar

Okay, well I just woke up
And you already don't care
That I tried my best to hold you
Through the headset that you wear
And as tight as I might hold it
Over where the signal's good
There's no way to save your evening now
And I'm ready for this to be understood

So show me the land you acquired
And slip into something beside
The holes you try to hide
And lay out your rules for the night
Oh, don't eat your toast in my bed
Oh, darling I
I never felt the crumbs until you said this place
Is not for any man
Nor particles of bread
