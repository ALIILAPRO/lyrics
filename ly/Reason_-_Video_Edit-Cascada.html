		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something in your eyes I know I can't resist.
Something in the air I don't know why

You were hardly there when I was on my own
There's something about you that makes me cry

Can I believe that your heart still beats for me
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny

I wanna know
give me a reason for me to believe in,
can't you see it in my eyes
That I need a reason for I'm still breathing
is a time to say goodbye
Cause deep in my heart I know there's a reason,
why I'm not leaving , why I'm not alone
So give me reason for me to believe in, give me a reason

There's something in your eyes I know I can't resist.
Something in the air I don't know why

Can I believe that your heart still beats for me
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny

I wanna know
give me a reason for me to believe in
can't you see it in my eyes
That I need a reason for I'm still breathing
is a time to say goodbye
Cause deep in my heart I know there's a reason
why I'm not leaving why I'm not alone
So give me reason for me to believe in, give me a reasonâ€¦
