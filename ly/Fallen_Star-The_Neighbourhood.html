		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Further apart, the closer that we are
I'll keep you far away from me like a star
Hard not to fall for you, I gave you all my heart
Further apart, the closer, the closer, the closer that we are

Tryna find the right time to tell you what you might not like to hear
I can feel the zeitgeist stuck inside the pipeline for some years, yeah
I wanna be your lifeline but everybody can't be a millionaire
I'll be in the night sky, shinin' like a light on always there

You're in my DNA, I can't get away no matter how hard I try
You're runnin' through my veins, something I can't change, that's the same reason why

We're further apart, the closer that we are
I'll keep you far away from me like a star
Hard not to fall for you, I gave you all my heart
Further apart, the closer, the closer, the closer that we are

20/20 hindsight, lookin' from a distance, now it's clear
Went and found the limelight, wasn't in the vision to disappear, no
Now I'm in a new place, I can feel the room change when you're here
Had to run and do things, never meant to leave you in the rear

You're always in my brain, and I take the blame, no matter who's wrong or right
I'm on a one-way train headed far away, but you're still on my mind

Further apart, the closer that we are
I'll keep you far away from me like a star
Hard not to fall for you, I gave you all my heart
Further apart, the closer, the closer, the closer that we are

The closer that we are, oh

The closer that we are
