		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never wanna mess up this ummm
Okay I'll say it, it's love
Call you the blueprint
"the one"
You set the bar way up
My exes irrelevant
In a matter of seconds
Don't care bout no one outside of us, of us, yeah
All of my friends say I'm too attached
Said you know what happens when you fall in way too fast
But baby what's so wrong with that
If I know this one's gonna last
I'm stuck again in this loop
No way of knowing 'til it's absolute
But I get a feeling when I'm next to you (to you)
Maybe it's heaven that's leavin' all the clues
So far they're leading me right back to you
Usually lost but with you there's no room (no room)
Maybe it's heaven that's leavin' all the clues
Snow out the window
Down low
All of my problems could wait
Punch in the numbers, hello
99 4 triple 8
Dont matter how hard I try
I cant seem to say goodbye
My body fits so good next to you, to you boy
All of my friends say I'm too attached
Said you know what happens when you fall in way too fast
But baby what's so wrong with that
If I know this one's gonna last
I'm stuck again in this loop
No way of knowing 'til it's absolute
But I get a feeling when I'm next to you (to you)
Maybe it's heaven that's leavin' all the clues
So far they're leading me right back to you
Usually lost but with you there's no room (no room)
Maybe it's heaven that's leavin' all the clues
Never saw this coming
Girls like me don't ever get our happy ending
Can't believe I get to call you mine
I'm stuck again in this loop
No way of knowing 'til it's absolute
But I get a feeling when I'm next to you (to you)
Maybe it's heaven that's leavin' all the clues
So far they're leading me right back to you
Usually lost but with you there's no room (no room)
Maybe it's heaven that's leavin' all the clues
