		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mike Dimes (yeah)
Straight up (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Uh (yeah)

Homie act cool on the drop, I see him tryna plot
Got a little money, make a shorty act cool on a nigga
Half an hour, she'll be back with the opps (what you doin'?)
I ain't get no love from my city
All a nigga wanted was some guap
I ain't ask for a lot (I ain't ask for a lot)
Run the game through my ma, plan the game with the pops
Brother told me if a nigga act tough, he gon' pop
I hit up Joe Biden, I need me a stimmy, my nigga (stimmy, my nigga)
They ain't fuckin' with me, my nigga (on gang)
I'm tryna get out of my city, my nigga (my city, my nigga)
These boys tryna kill me, my nigga
I'ma go cop a 350 or a .380, lifestyle been driving me crazy (on gang)
And I don't got time for the pussy
She think 'cause I'm paid, we can have a lil' baby (hold up)
Watch a young nigga composure
I get to the bag when I'm off of the sofa (get to the bag)
I touched me a rack before I touched diplomas (get to the racks)
I touched on her cat before I try to bone her (get to the cash)
I did me a lot, I just did what I told 'em, uh (hold up)
Looking at me like I owe 'em, uh (hold up)
Looking at me like she know me
She think that she special, she don't know my motive (yeah, yeah)

Wiss
Watch how I move like this (like this)
Nigga get pissed, catch my drift, wiss
I get the bag so swift
I get in my bag and these niggas get pissed, wiss
Watch how I move like this (this)
Nigga get pissed, catch my drift, wiss
I get the bag so swift
I get in my bag and these niggas get pissed

Who in that whip? (Whip)
Who that young nigga in VIP? Boy, I'm too stiff
I got the strips, I got the commas
Go to the strip and fuck up some commas
I had to make me a way, I had to make me a play
Run it up, breaking the bank, big boss (run it up)
When I get in my bag, they get pissed off
Boy, I drink liquor, this shit ain't no Cristal
I got a bitch and she suckin', her lips soft
We carry rockets, the gang finna lift off
Don't fuck with leeches, we takin' them ticks off (on gang)
What can I say?
Niggas turn bitches when it come to the commas
P Diddy ain't lyin', more money, more problems
I got off my ass and I got to a bag
And these niggas been hating, but they at the bottom

Wiss
Watch how I move like this (like this)

I get the bag so swift
I get in my bag and these niggas get pissed, wiss
Watch how I move like this
Nigga get pissed, catch my drift, wiss
I get the bag so swift
I get in my bag and these niggas get pissed, gang
