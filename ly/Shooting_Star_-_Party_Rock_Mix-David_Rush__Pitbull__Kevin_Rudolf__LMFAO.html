		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love just who you are, I ain't goin' try to change ya.
You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite.
I love just who you are, I ain't goin' try to change ya.
You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite.

I caught her when she feel from heaven.
1 to 10, baby girl is an 11.
And I ain't trying to spit no game but I'm trying to figure out from where you came.
Because a star like her man it rarely occurs in a world like this.
Only will you ever meet a girl like this, get up in a spaceship and take that trip.
You gotta have a way with words.
Keep a short low convo to get at her.
Every other chick becomes a blur.
Be my misses I'll be your sir.
I love her, the way she is, the way she are, a shooting star.
And I pray that you never change, never ever change.
Stay the same, cause

I love just who you are, I ain't goin' try to change ya.
You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite.
I love just who you are, I ain't goin' try to change ya.
You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite.

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane.
Na baby girl that's a shooting star with your name.
I ain't gon lie.
I told a lot of lies and played a lot of games.
But with you it's not the same, for you I'm a ride.
I want you by my side.
I feel like them ghetto boys, you're playing with my mind.
I'm a tell you one more time.
For you I'm a hustle, for you I'm a grine.
You were there through the pain, you stood right by me, thanks to you I survive.
I guess it's true what they say, love is blind.
We together till the day that we die, till death do us part.
Baby you my heart.
They can take all the houses and the cars.
But they'll never take my shooting star

I love just who you are, I ain't goin' try to change ya.
You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite.
I love just who you are, I ain't goin' try to change ya.
You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite.
