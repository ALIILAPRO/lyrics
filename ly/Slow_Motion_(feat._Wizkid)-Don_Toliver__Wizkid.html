		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She just wanna go dancing (dancing)
Baby, tell me what you're hopin'
And leave your door wide open
See it in slow motion (motion, motion, motion)
Baby, tell me what you're hopin'
See you bust wide open
Move it in slow motion (motion, motion, motion)

Well, I was really upset
But, I got lost in love today
You was commitment-ready
So, I had to find a way
Even when upset, you lift me up on occasions

She just wanna go dancing (dancing)
Baby, tell me what you're hopin'
And leave your door wide open
See it in slow motion (motion, motion, motion)
Baby, tell me what you're hopin'
See you bust wide open
Move it in slow motion (motion, motion, motion)

Only you, wey dey make me, make me work all night
If not your love, I need am one more time
Every night and day, yeah, I dey tell true lies
Touchin' on your body, making you feel right
Hold you back and make you drop the drawers alright
Make a tie your strings weh go bust your mind
As the rythym trouble baby, bust so wide
Make a give you tings a make you go all night
Only you, way to make me, make me work all night
Fiendin' 'bout your love and I need one more time
Every night and day, yeah, I could tell true love
Touchin' on your body, making you feel (feel)
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

She just wanna go dancing (dancing)
Baby, tell me what you're hopin'
And leave your door wide open
See it in slow motion (motion, motion, motion)
Baby, tell me what you're hopin'
See you bust wide open
Move it in slow motion (motion, motion, motion)

See, I was really upset
But, I got lost in love today
You was commitment-ready
So, I had to find a way
Even when upset, you lift me up on occasion
