		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, if it won't for my old dogs and the good Lord
They'd have me strung up in the psych ward
'Cause every day livin' in this new world
Is one too many days to me

Son, we're on the brink of the next world war
And I don't think nobody's prayin' no more
And I ain't sayin I know it for sure
I'm just down on my knees

Beggin', Lord, take me home
I just wanna go home
I don't know which road to go
It's been so long
I just know I didn't used to wake up feelin' this way
Cussin' myself every damn day
People have really gone and lost their way
They all just do what the TVs say
And I wanna go home

Seven generations farmin' the ground
Grandson sells it to a man from out of town
Two weeks later the trees go down
Only got concrete growin' around

And I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I don't know which road to go
It's been so long
I just know I didn't used to wake up feelin this way
Well, cussin' myself every damn day
There's always some kind of bill to pay
People just doin' what the rich man say
And I wanna go home
