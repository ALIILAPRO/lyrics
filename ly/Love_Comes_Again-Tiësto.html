		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have become
What you have always been
Light flickering around
Peripheral vision
No words we can speak
Of paths to be chosen
All trails that we trek
Shall lead us back to here
Because our

Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again

Deep within me
Turn all the secret stones
Forests and fields
Breathing with blood and bones
Still no words we can speak
Of paths to be chosen
but all trails that we trek
Shall lead us back to here
Because our

Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
