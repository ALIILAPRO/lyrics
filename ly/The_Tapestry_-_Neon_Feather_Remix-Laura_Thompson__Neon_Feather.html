		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trying to make sense of it all, through a veil of tears
Somehow you’re holding on
Trying to seek His face, but a thousand prayers
Don’t make Him seem closer at all
Let your seed of faith
Trust His words’ still true
Right now your fears are bigger than your faith
Right now your tears fall like endless rain
Right now your shoulders carry heavy weight
And right now, He hasn’t changed
He’s still good, and He’s still God
Every trial you face
And every pain you feel
One day you will see
They weave the tapestry, of Christ’s love
They weave the tapestry, of Christ’s love
Right now your fears are bigger than your faith
Right now your tears fall like endless rain
Right now your shoulders carry heavy weight
And right now, He hasn’t changed
He’s still good, and He’s still God
