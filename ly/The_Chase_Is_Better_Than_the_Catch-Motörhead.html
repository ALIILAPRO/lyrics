		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I'm bad, the times I've had
I've got a bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation, I don't

The more I get the better it is
I like it fine, like a little whiz
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact
You know the chase is better than the catch, you know

Silver-tongued devil, demon lech
I know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent bitch
You know I ain't just screwing, I ain't

I love you baby, love you too much
I like it fine, I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
You know the chase is better than the catch, you know

A little beauty, I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I want to shake your tree, you know

Come on honey, touch me right there
Come on honey, don't you get scared
Come on honey, let me get you in the sack
You know the chase is better than the catch, you know

All right
Come on
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
I can't hear ya
I can't hear ya
I can't hear ya, can't hear
