		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 
I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 

I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 
I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 

Is it up to me? 
You won't wait to see 
Screwed us both again 
About as close as you dare 

I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 
I feel the pain of everyone 
Then I feel nothing 

Is it up to me? 
You won't wait to see 
Screwed us yet again 
About as close as you dare 
Hey, now take it back 
Get off the attack
Trailin' on your scene 
Just try and keep it clean
