		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my happy song
I like to sing it all day long
I'll teach you the words
Then you can sing along

Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

Great! Let's try it again

This is my happy song
I like to sing it all day long
I'll teach you the words
Then you can sing along

Let's try a high voice

Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

Nice job

This is my happy song
I like to sing it all day long
I'll teach you the words
Then you can sing along

Let's try a Low voice

Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

Great

Let's sing it again

This is my happy song
I like to sing it all day long
I'll teach you the words
Then you can sing along

Let's sing it underwater

Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

Here we go again

This is my happy song
I like to sing it all day long
I'll teach you the words
Then you can sing along

Let's sing it fast

Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

Faster?

Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
This is my happy song
