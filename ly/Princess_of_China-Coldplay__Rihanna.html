		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying, "Fast as they can"
I got to go
I got to go

Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands
The two halves of my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Once upon a time we're burning bright
That all we ever seemed to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on

Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game, now why'd you have to go
Have to go and throw it all in my flame

Could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring,
But no, you let me go

Stole my star
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
You stole my star
La-la-la-la-la-la

'Cause you really hurt me
Oh you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh-oh, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
You really hurt me
