		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say the devil takes the best of us
I guess I always knew you weren't like the rest of us
You held the party in your hand like it would slip away, like moments passed
How I miss the way you used to laugh
Is that the way it goes, you trade your soul to be a rose
Give everything you've got to give before you've got to go
I guess that no one knows
I guess that I just didn't see the lows

Oh, we all fall down
Oh, we all fall down

I wish you told me how you felt that night
Now I'll never get to change your mind
But with all of the memories
You'll always be part of me
I'll tell your mother how we used to laugh
But it's never gonna bring you back
Now you're only a memory
But you'll always be part of me
Part of me

I remember times when we'd stay up 'til morning light
I remember how you'd say how much you miss those nights
And I wish that I'd have noticed all those cracks in your smile
'Cause it took a while
We could have put stars together, planted roots and lived forever
We could have been kings of our own kingdom, had you let me help you
But you're conditioned to believe it only makes you weaker
'Til it chokes you and you're barely breathing

Oh, we all fall down
Oh, we all fall down

I wish you told me how you felt that night
Now I'll never get to change your mind
But with all of the memories
You'll always be part of me
I'll tell your mother how we used to laugh
But it's never gonna bring you back
Now you're only a memory
But you'll always be part of me
Part of me, oh-oh

I wish you told me how you felt that night
Now I'll never get to change your mind
But with all of the memories
You'll always be part of me
I'll tell your mother how we used to laugh
But it's never gonna bring you back (bring you back)
Now you're only a memory (only a memory)
But you'll always be part of me
Part of me
