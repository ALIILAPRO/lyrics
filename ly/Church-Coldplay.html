		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What I can tell you, when I'm with you I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
And what can I get through, and for everyone everywhere?
Yeah, answering everything

When you're riding a wave, oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're setting your sail, oh, can I be your seventh sea?
When you're riding a wave
When you're riding a wave

'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church

'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church

When you're riding a wave, oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're riding a wave

I'll worship you in church, baby, always
I'll worship you in church, all the seven days
I'll praise and praise
