		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just popped a bean and I'm on a helicopter, ay
God damn, I'm a problem, ay
Hold on let me do that, ay, ay, ay

I just popped a bean and I'm on a helicopter (ay)
I don't wanna do shit, unless I'm with my partners
I got all this money
Gave it straight to my momma (straight to my momma)
I just wanna fuck Michelle Obama, ay (Michelle Obama)
Okay what's hannenin' (what's hannenin'?)
I don't trust nobody 'less they got some melanin (black folk)
That girl lyin' when she telling me she celibate, ay (she ain't)
Free all of my niggas let the felons out (let 'em out)
I won't stop 'til every nigga makes they first day out (woo woo)

Ay, what the fuck he say? I'll punch him in his mouth (wait)
Ay, remember when Janet Jackson had her titty out (wow)
Ay, remember when Rihanna had her titty out (wow)
Free the nipple man, Jordan Peele, get it out (yup)
Made a three-course meal at his baby mama house
She want me to change but all my change is in the couch (get it?)
I burn the house down R.I.p. Left Eye (R.I.p. Left Eye!)
Now I'm in Ireland and I'm sippin' on that biggest stout

The bean kicked in (Molly)
The bean kicked in (Molly)
The bean kicked in (Molly)
But a bean kicked in (Molly)
In the hotel room with your bitch and her friends (Molly, Molly, Molly)
The bean kicked in (Molly)
The bean kicked in (Molly)
The bean kicked in (Molly)
Bean kicked in (Molly)
Bean kicked in (molly)
Man, The bean kicked in (Molly) (The bean kicked in!)
Wow, damn (Molly)
The bean kicked in (Molly) (I'm geeked out)
The sunset so pretty
The bean kicked in (Molly) (geek, geek, geek)
