		  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, its more than I dare to think about

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, its more than I dare to think about

Every night
Every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay
Won't you lay
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, its more than I dare to think about

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me left in your heart
Set me free
Feel the need in me
Set me free
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I just can't get you out of my head
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I just can't get you out of my head
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I just can't get you out of my head
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
