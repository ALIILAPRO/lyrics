		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
It's a million miles
From the mornin' light

Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues

When the shadows fall
I feel the night closin' in
There must be some reason
For this mood I'm gettin' in

Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues

Every evenin' after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away

Every evenin' after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away

It's the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
It's a million miles
To the mornin' light

Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
...
