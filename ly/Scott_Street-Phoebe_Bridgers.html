		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer, it's a payment plan
There's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?

I asked you, "How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree"
And I said, "That makes me feel old"
You said, "What does that make me?"
I asked you, "How is playin' drums?"
You said, "It's too much shit to carry"
"And what about the band?"
You said, "They're all gettin' married"

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Anyway, don't be a stranger
Ooh
Ooh
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Ooh
Ooh
Don't be a stranger
Ooh
Ooh
