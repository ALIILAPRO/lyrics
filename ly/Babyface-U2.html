		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching your bright blue eyes
In the freeze frame
I've seen them so many times
I feel like I must be your best friend
You're looking fine, so fine, oh my
Dressed up like a lovely day, oh

Babyface, babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, babyface
Cover girl with natural grace
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy

Coming home late at night
To turn you on
Checking out every frame
I've got slow motion on my side
Turning around and around
With the sound and color

Under my control, go
Round and around, going down
Dressed up like a lovely day

Babyface, babyface
Tin foil hair all tied up in lace
Babyface, babyface
Bitter sweet girl won't you give me a taste
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy

Do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do

Babyface, babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, babyface
Open the door, let me unpack my case
Babyface, babyface
You're everywhere child
You're all over the place
Babyface, babyface
You're coming to me from outer-space
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy, yeah yeah
