		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my god
Ahhhh, the tape is almost over
Ahhhh

Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say, uh

I keep a rickety ratchet
I smoke a spliffy don't lemme go batshit
Can't give a fuck about that shit
Please get the fuck out my face uh

I don't believe in your race uh
I don't want shit but to be alone
I don't want see you on screen on phone
I just want to have my own place uh

Get the fuck out of my eye sight
What the fuck you mean you might fight?

Left right white light
I'll do whatever it takes uh
Put weight on yo face 'til it breaks, ugh

I smoke a pound down you got baby lungs nigga
Wound down bitches they be dumb thicker
Gravy run slicker dripping

Shoot the trigger from my hip and
On the blunt a nigga sipping
Ripping flicking on my Bic and
I could tip a bitch but I go all the way
I fuck her 'til she shitting call the k

9-unit, keep a large weapon
Gotta fine tune it like guitar settings
Start betting on me
Get a tommy
Wet a commie
Red tsunami
Dead around me

I gotta mean what I say
Mean what you say
I gotta mean what I say
Mean what you say

Be seen to be seeming
You mean what you screaming
These niggas be plotting on each other's semen
I'm leaving
I cannot fuck with the fronting
I cannot fuck with the dick wanting

Be seen to be seeming
You mean what you screaming
These niggas be plotting on each other's cocks
Don't fuck with you you get block
Eat some more doo doo you motherfucking cop

Bobble head bobble head
Make him a bobble head
Pop him he waddle
Like bottle he prolly dead

Looking like hop scotch
Popping off all he did
I'm on that pop gosh
I'm not a molly kid

I had to rot josh
To become who I am
I geek a lot
Wash drugs off my fucking hands

I don't want no swamp, I like my house clean
I don't want no swamp, I like my house clean
I know what you want failure and beans
Complain about whatever act like a fiend
Niggas do not care we're far too mean

Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say

Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say
Mean what you say

Um, if it wasn't drained already
The swamp is now empty
This is lil darkie
