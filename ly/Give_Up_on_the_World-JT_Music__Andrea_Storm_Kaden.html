		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got no guardian angel
But she still in my heart
Had to hang up her halo
Find a new light to fill the dark
See, I never started a fire
But I smothered a guilty spark
As I kept my head above the flood
Without any time to build an ark

With the foresight of the forerunners
I for sure couldn't call this
To walk a legendary path
Eventually put me back in Mark VI
So I'll fire it up with what
Little time that I got, enjoy what is left
But I'm gonna follow my gut 'cause I
Can't always trust the voice in head
Now listen
You new to the battle? Consider this a hazing
Shouldn't be hard to grapple
Give me just a pistol, it'll look amazing
'Cause I'm the combat evolved game changer
One man army, the playmaker
Fat lady sing, I'm back in the ring
And you bet I'll be swinging the Haymaker
I'll go ballistic, I hate lasers
Battle rifles outweigh tasers
Covenant didn't know close shave
'Til I showed up with a straight razor
Bring a hammer down with my Mjolnir
Leaving banished pounded like cold beer
Been around too many explosions
So when they cry quarter, I don't hear
I'm a Spartan, part divinity
Read up on John 1: 17
A demon respawning infinitely with
A mantle of responsibility
Y'all jealous of me? Better deal with it
'Cause the real reclaimer is back
I lost Cortana, just gotta live up to my name
When I'm taking her back
As I awake from slumber
Keep my gun up and my boots down
I'm more than a number
But I'll show 'em I'm the one who counts

I am lost without you
You're the light always shining through
You're my luck and my truth
I'll give up on the world before
I'm giving up on you if I'm not keeping her
Give up on the world before
I'm giving up on you
Then I don't need the world
'Cause all of it's worth giving up
Long as I got you

If all that I carry are memories and ashes
I got nothing to lose
My enemies better be covering their asses
Master Chief's about to boot up
I mean put my foot up your brute butt
You can't pop my bubble, I don't chew gum
But my fuse lit, so I'll nuke 'em
Hear me coming when I'm
Running through grunts
See this old dog got some new guns
Any questions I have are meant to be asked
And answered after I shoot 'em
Get the whole team mobbing with the hog
And we roll deep, hop in shizzle dog
UNSC 'bout to kick it off to infinity
Maybe then beyond
Better turn a cheek when you take a spank
I beat everything, you can save a tank
I have reminded the gods that even
Halos are made to break
'Cause everything good has an ending
I would know, I finish every fight
Is the universe I'm defending
Really worth her sacrifice?
I guess we had borrowed time
But now it's all on the light
If they wanna assign a replacement, trust me
She's gonna be hard to find

I am lost without you
You're the light always shining through
You're my luck and my truth
I'll give up on the world before
I'm giving up on you if I'm not keeping her
Give up on the world before
I'm giving up on you
Then I don't need the world
'Cause all of it's worth giving up

You picked me up when I fell down
I need you more than ever, Chief
You gave me hope where none was found
Don't make a promise you can't keep
There comes a time when to love it so let go
Then I can't call it love because I won't

I am lost without you
You're the light always shining through
You're my luck and my truth
I'll give up on the world before
I'm giving up on you if I'm not keeping her
Give up on the world before
I'm giving up on you
Then I don't need the world
'Cause all of it's worth giving up
Long as I got you
