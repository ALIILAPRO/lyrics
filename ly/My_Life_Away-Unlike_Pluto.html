		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Left brain tries to fight the right brain
I'm talkin
Livin in the middle of insane 

Opinions six feet under the pain of control

Hey
I just want stay
Hey
And throw my life away
Hey
I'm fallen, I'm fallen away
Uh oh
Isn't that okay
Hey

Building my dreams lost in the field of zombies
They're pulling me down but they won't disarm me
My thoughts feel so real and they alarm me
Walls and the ceiling are turning to red, a a panorama in my head

Opinions six feet under the pain and out of control

Hey
I just want stay
Hey
And throw my life away
Hey
I'm fallen, I'm fallen away
Uh oh
Isn't that okay
Hey

It's hard, it's hard to internalize
I stand my ground with earthquakes inside
I feel, I feel like part of me
Wants to hide
Wants to hide

Opinions six feet under the pain and out of control

Hey
I just want stay
Hey
And throw my life away
Hey
I'm fallen, I'm fallen away
Uh oh
Isn't that okay
Hey
