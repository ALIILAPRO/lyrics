		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You and I dancing then)
(You and I dancing then)
(You and I dance)

Suddenly my eyes are seeing you clearly
I think I'm nearly back where we were
When the sun came up, and we're still dancing together

The water was still, and the people were sleeping
You and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When the sun came up, we were still dancing together

(You and I dancing then, you and I dancing then)
(You and I dancing then, you and I dancing then)
(You and I dancing then, you and I dancing then)
(You and I dancing then, you and I dancing then)
(You and I dancing then)
(You and I dancing then, when you and I dance)
When the sun came up

Suddenly my eyes are seeing you clearly
I think I'm nearly back where we were
When the sun came up, and we're still dancing together

The water was still, and the people were sleeping
You and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When the sun came up, we were still dancing together

(You and I dancing then, you and I dancing then)
(You and I dancing to the sound of their breathing then)
(You and I dancing then, you and I dancing then)
(And you and I dancing to the sound of their breathing)
(You and I dancing then, you and I dancing then)
(And you and I dancing to the sound of their breathing)

(You and I dancing then, You and I dancing)
When the sun came up

Suddenly my eyes are seeing you clearly
I think I'm nearly back where we were
When the sun came up, and we're still dancing together

The water was still, and the people were sleeping
You and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When the sun came up, we were still dancing together
