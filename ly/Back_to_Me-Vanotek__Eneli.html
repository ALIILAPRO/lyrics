		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me back, don't leave me
Don't be bad, don't hurt me
Listen to me when I say
I know what you did so
When you said you let go
Did you ever think of me?

But it's going through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh ah

It's going through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh ah

I'm not a dog
That all he's ever been taught
So wait patiently
Don't you come back to me
I'm not a dog
That all he's ever been taught
So wait patiently
Come back to me, to me

There is something different
In the way you're speaking
Now you're harder to believe
I can tell you're distant
And I know the reason
Did you think that I won't see?

But it's going through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh ah

But it's going through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh ah

I'm not a dog
That all he's ever been taught
So wait patiently
Don't you come back to me

I'm not a dog
That all he's ever been taught
So wait patiently
Come back to me, to me

Give me a reason why you said goodbye
Give me a reason for the lonely nights
Give me a reason why you did that
No need to fall on your knees

I'm not a dog
That all he's ever been taught
So wait patiently
Don't you come back to me
I'm not a dog
That all he's ever been taught
So wait patiently
Come back to me, to me

Come back to me, to me
Come back to me, to me
