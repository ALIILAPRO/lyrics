		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, close your eyes

So watch 'em do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition about these women and suspicions
Got me lookin' at you different, how I'm a man in my position
Can't stop slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you were young and you just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids
And we gonna show you what the love is

Stay high, go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It won't stop
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Uh, and I keep a couple most dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some Tai Chi
Homie can't you see I'm chillin, please don't fuck up my Chi
Yea my jacket Y three, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of sastisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell 'em fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restore it now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways

Stay high, go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It ain't never gonna stop 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Sometimes I wake up, up in the mornin', make up
Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed soon as she's gone and
Take up hours out my day just do find power, shit to say, but
You won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre
I mean, the sun is slowly fallin'
We all surely should die eventually, so what's your callin'?
Oh, you left your phone behind, identity
Crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and devil say you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open
On oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, chokin'
Or Soakin' up game, I'm hopin'
You picked the second one, change the emotion of jealousy that you're holdin'
You're telling me, that you're golden, but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever
But even if you Mayweather
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop 
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
Oh, fuck me
Oh, I want you to fuck me
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, don't stop, oh
