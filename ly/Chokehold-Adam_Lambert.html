		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Sheets are in a knot
My heart is like rock, eh

Pictures flashing by inside my head
I'm hanging by a thread
But I'd do it all again, eh

I keep running away, running away, running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains, breaking the chains
It's too good

'Cause I know the second you go
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
And you know I want your chokehold
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

All without your touch I suffocate
I could asphxiate, but I kind of like the pain, eh
Baby, I can smell you on my clothes
I try to stay composed
But I feel the fever grow, grow oh oh

I keep running away, running away, running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains, breaking the chains
It's too good

'Cause I know the second you go
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
And you know I want your chokehold
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey
Baby, gonna bring it back to me

'Cause I know the second you go
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it on back to me
And you know I want your chokehold
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it on back to me, yeah yeah
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
