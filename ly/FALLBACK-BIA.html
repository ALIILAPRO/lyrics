		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, okay (okay)
Uh, okay (okay, okay)
Uh, okay (okay, okay)
Yeah

If you gotta choose between me or the next bitch, you better choose her (choose her)
Bitches be fightin' over the same dick and won't argue 'bout who's first (yeah)
I'll be the racks up off of that lick 'cause I should be havin' me two birds
I cut my friend off, she was a burden, I had to tell her the truth hurts
That's just the principle, baby
I'm takin' bitches to class, I'm startin' to feel like the principal, baby (yeah, yeah)
I wouldn't give you a pass, their shit be lookin' so pitiful lately
Bitches be down to their last, tryin' to buy a new ass
I couldn't ever do that
Talk about goin' out sad, uh (damn)
I can't fuck my friends on OnlyFans, bitch, that's some ho shit (some ho shit)
Nigga cheat on me then I'm gon' pay to wipe his nose quick
Bitches tryna sound like BIA and everybody knows it
I got motion, get my pussy wet, now every time I ghost him

What do you call that?
This ain't no blog rap (huh)
I'm a real rap bitch (huh)
This not a podcast (yeah)
Say you don't like me (ooh)
Pray we don't cross path (bitch)
Say it in all caps
Bitch, you better fallback (that's right, that's right)

Uh, I'm havin' no beef, these bitches won't say my name
That's not in their destiny (that's not in their destiny)
Tried to trick me out of my spot but I won't go and let 'em get the best of me (uh)
I wouldn't feel you bitches even if I was on ecstasy (yeah)
And I can tell he trickin' or if he broke just by his tennis seats (cash, cash)
It's obvious, baby
Either you got it or not
You should see what it been costin' me lately (facts)
This shit could never be taught, I do this in front of an audience, baby
That's just another expense, with you, I'm still on the fence
I couldn't feel you at all, that's in the literal sense

Damn, bitch (damn, bitch), you so wack to me (wack to me)
I can't stop this nigga runnin' back to me (I can't) 
Damn, ho, you so wack to me (you so wack to me)
It's like they build you bitches in a factory, okay

So what do you call that?
This ain't no blog rap (huh)
I'm a real rap bitch (huh)
This not a podcast (yeah)
Say you don't like me (ooh)
Pray we don't cross path (bitch)
Say it in all caps
Bitch, you better fallback (that's right, that's right)

Uh (that's right, that's right)
Damn, damn, damn
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Uh, bitch
