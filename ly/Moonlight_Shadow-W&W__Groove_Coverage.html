		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in the riddle last Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through. 

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing the song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

Four A.M. In the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Star was glowin' in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day
