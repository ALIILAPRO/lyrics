		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Victory or die

What do you say? What I can ever do for you?
What are we gonna do to pass the time?
What do you care when you find that life's unfair
Equality is just a state of mind
Believe whatever's right, what's right for you tonight
You know where to draw the line

What have you done? What's on your mind? What do you need?
Where shall we go to let it out?
What have you seen? We don't know where you've been
Life so often blows your candle out
Believe whatever's right, what's right for you tonight
Who knows what the fuck it's all about

Look up and see the flying saucers cruising in the sky
I saw one myself, it ain't no lie
Look down and see the road you're on as if you are on a marathon
That's the spirit, victory or die

What did they say? What have we learned? What do we know?
What shall we do to even up the score?
What do you find, if you find that you've gone blind
Darkness is a thing we've seen before
Believing is your right alright, whatever lights your light
You always end up on the killing floor

Look around and see the soldiers, see them marching off to war
Take a careful look as the swing by
They're all heroes but they don't know what they're fighting for
That's the spirit, victory or die

Watch out for the monsters in the alleys of the night
They're always hungry, look 'em in the eye
They're looking at your daughters, they've seen the flying saucers
You have to tell them victory or die, or die
