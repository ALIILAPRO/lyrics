		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let the raining tear-drops rain down on me tonight
I think making up, faking up stories is alright
Tick tock stop the clock, fiction is my thing
My attitude is always I and me and mine

Oh I'm so clever, I'm so clever, I'm so clever
Until my paranoia kicks in then I'll accuse her
Of doing all the worst things I do best
It's funny how me fucking her about
Has got me in this fucking mess

Liar liar liar liar pants on fire
Lies alibis lies more alibis
From the truth, I admit I'm more than shy
Ain't it the times we are living in
Everybody's doing it so why can't I?

I tally up tonight's strangers
And stragglers that I've kissed
Training ground notches, perfectly executed notches
And near misses
It's all about going out and getting pissed with eagle eyes
And sincerity bottom on my list
What's the story morning glory?
I feel so low and worthless, yeah

So this is where the outcome unfurls and the truth is being told
A cloud has gathered over my head and now I know
Infidelity and my good friend ecstasy doesn't work, it makes you worse
I'm feeling so guilty about the things I said to my mum when I was ten year old
I'm feeling so guilty about any old shit
And how I think my missus is fucking every guy that she looks at
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it
The end was always coming and now it's here

So this is the grande finale
The crescendo of demise
This is the happy ending
Where the bad guy goes down and dies
This is the end
With me on my knees and wondering why?
Cross my heart, hope to die
It's my own cheating heart that makes me cry
