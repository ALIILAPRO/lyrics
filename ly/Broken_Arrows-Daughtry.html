		  Hey
Show me one man that's never made mistakes
Mmh
And I pay
All of my time and every dime I may
But today

The best of intentions
I lay at your feet
And I need you to see past the worst part of me
I'm tired of taking my aim
When I keep on missing
There's gotta be a better way
Gotta be a better way

And every little word I say
Keeps getting twisted
Or coming out wrong, so baby hold on
I'm tryin' to hit the mark but I'm shooting with broken
Arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken
Arrows

No
I may not be the same but I've got a heart of gold
Yeah
Oh, like a telephone
Connection ain't clear, but I hope you hear soul
You gotta know

Yeah, the best of intentions
I lay at your feet
And I need you to see past the worst part of me
And I'm tired of taking my aim
When I keep on missing
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way

Seems like every little word I say
Keeps getting twisted
Or coming out wrong, so baby hold on
I'm tryin' to hit the mark
But I'm shooting with broken
Arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken
Arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken
Arrows yeah
It's like I'm shooting with broken
Arrows
Broken arrows

I'm driving it back now
And the target is you
And I dunno what else I can do oh
I'm tired of taking my aim
When I keep on missing
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way

Seems like every little word I say
Keeps getting twisted
Or coming out wrong, so baby hold on
I'm trying to hit the mark
But I'm shooting with broken
Arrows
It's like I'm shooting with broken
Arrows yeah
It's like I'm shooting with broken
Arrows yeah
It's like I'm shooting with broken
Arrows
Broken arrows
