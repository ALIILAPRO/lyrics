		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feelin' so confused
You don't know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be knockin' at her door?

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says she's true
So you start comin' to
Just as that old knockin' comes to stay

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
