		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, Larray, ok, skrt, skrt, ooh, bang bang, let's go

This ain't a race but I still take first place
Take your man just to shove it in your face (Mwah)
My name not Lightning, but I still am a queen (Kachow)
I go to Panda just to ask for Chow mein

Call me gay but your dad texts me "hey"
You don't like me but you like stalking my page (yikes)
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco
I don't speak Spanish but I know Despacito (puta)
B-b-b-bitch I'ma kick you in the throat (hiya)
My ass so big it be looking like a boat (Titanic)
I got asthma so you know I don't smoke (bang bang)
Why am I ugly? JK bitch that was a joke
I'm cute, I'm hot, I'm everything you're not
I looked you up on Google just to find out you're a flop
I'm sexy take a pic, I'm better than your chick
Your boyfriend messaged me and asked if I was Timmy Thick
I walk around in Guccis
My favorite meal is sushi
If you wanna talk then I'll hit you with that uzi

Pr-r-r-r-a
Pa pa ka ka ka
Skidiki-papa
And a pu-pu-pu

I feel pregnant after dinner
Like my name is Kylie Jenner
I'm a baddie, I'm a sinner
You so ugly, you so bitter
In a foreign, yea we do the most, we skrt skrt
All around the coast
Tell me pick a Dolan Twin, guess what bitch I'm choosing both

This ain't a race but I still take first place (ya ya)
Take your man just to shove it in your face (mwah)
My name not lightning but I still am a queen (kachow)
Go to Panda just to ask for chow mein (yeah yeah)
