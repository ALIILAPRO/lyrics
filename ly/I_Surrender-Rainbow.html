		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I surrender to your heart babe
Do anything that you want me to do
Please be tender I'm in your hands girl
This is a feeling I never knew
You know I tried to make it on my own
That's not the way it was meant to be
Spend my time waiting by the phone
Oh darling come back to me

I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender
Oh be tender, Girl be tender
Can't you feel the love that I send her
I surrender

I remember, seems like a lifetime
Can't believe it's a matter of days
Since you left me I'm near to heartbreak
I want you so bad don't turn away
What does it take to stay by my side
You know I'll do what you want me to
Don't take away this feeling inside
I'm still in love with you

I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender
I remember, I remember
Can't you feel the love that I send her
I surrender

I surrender, I surrender
Darling now won't you be tender
Surrender, oh surrender
Feel the love that I send her
I surrender
