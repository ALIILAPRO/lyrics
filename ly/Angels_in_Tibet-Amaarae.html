		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fountain baby, wash her make it wet
Diamonds hit the sweat
Tattoo on her chest, yeah, yeah, yeah
I like when my remedies connect
That pussy and a bed
Like Angels in Tibet, yeah, yeah, yeah

Louvre and Armani, I like how you say it
Feeding me body I like how you cater
I took a trip to the stylist today
I spend the bitch like I'm spending the paper
Stop

Okay keep going
I'll Lindsay a Lohan
I'll play with my favorite
y'all bitches boring
Now I need the foreign
Now I need Dior

In the club
Take it off
In the club
Pay homage
In the club
To the God
In the club

Play your part
In the club
Say no more
In the club
Love and war
In the club
Je t'adore
In the club

I want to fuck a puddle
Give that kitty cuddle
Kilo Halo'd Angel
Fuck me slow and subtle
Don't you want to taste it?
Just to get it started
Virtuistic patience
Take it 'cause you earned it

Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling
I like chains on chains
Blood stain stained my ring
Just a little bump
Touch me where you need to
I can give you more
Bodies on the floor
Just breathe, breathe

That Dior
In the club
Take it off
In the club
Pay homage
In the club
To the God
In the club

Play your part
In the club
Say no more
In the club
Love and war
In the club
Je t'adore
In the club

Tell me who you are
Is this what you wanted?
Step into your power
Come on home to God

That Dior
In the club
Take it off
In the club
Pay homage
In the club
To the God
In the club

Play your part
In the club
Say no more
In the club
Love and war
In the club
Je t'adore
In the club
