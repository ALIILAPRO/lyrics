		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run away, run away, run away
You don't know who to run from
Nowhere to go, don't wanna go, nowhere to go
No road is left to run on

I was born, I was born with horns
Demons couldn't shake me up
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
'Cause we haven't had enough

Won't give up the fight

Make it out alive
Set this world on fire now
Whoa (whoa), whoa (whoa)
Don't give up, it's gonna be alright
'Cause I won't let you burn out
Whoa (whoa), whoa (whoa)
We gotta make it out alive

Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm screaming on the inside, I was
Trying to hide, trying to hide, trying to hide
Now I'm ready for this ride

Gotta face, gotta face the unknown
It's the only way to live
I'm ready to go, ready to go, ready to go
Somewhere I've never been

Won't give up the fight

Make it out alive
Set this world on fire now
Whoa (whoa), whoa (whoa)
Don't give up, it's gonna be alright
'Cause I won't let you burn out
Whoa (whoa), whoa (whoa)
We gotta make it out alive

Make it out alive
Set this world on fire now
Whoa (whoa), whoa (whoa)
Don't give up, it's gonna be alright
'Cause I won't let you burn out
Whoa (whoa), whoa (whoa)
We gotta make it out alive

Whoa (oh, yeah), whoa (oh, yeah)
We gotta make it out alive
Whoa (oh, yeah), whoa (oh, yeah)
We gotta make it out alive
