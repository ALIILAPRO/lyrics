		<p>
		  Oh God
Whoa

Lookin' at your last text
Damn did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it?
I been breakin' up with girls since I was 15
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin' I got more liquor
More ladies, more drugs and no cases
With jobs and no babies
I hope no phone saving and if so you gon' hate me

When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples' counselin'
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

Let me see how big your mouth is

Goin' hard 'til I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are old me
Wishin' they could X and O me
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off
On the ledge and we danglin' off
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do
Body language speaks louder than verbal

And we see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit (I do)
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples' counselin'
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is (oh)

Let me see how big your mouth is

This goes out to, uh
You know who this goes out to
Yeah!
