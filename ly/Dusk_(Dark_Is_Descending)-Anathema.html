		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lift my mind to the light because I'm frozen
Lift my eyes to the sky because I'm searching

To feel like I want it to
To be like I want it to
Because I'm trying my love

To feel like I want it to
To be like I want it to
Because I'm trying
My love

Reach for my hand
And take me away

Away from this place
Because I know I don't belong here

Away from this place, I don't know, how did I get here?

Away from this place
Because I know I don't belong here

Speak to my heart
And take me away

Because I'm trying to be brave now
But I'm frozen in this place now
And it's so cold

And the hopes I had forsaken
We're replaced with such an aching
Please take me home

Because I'm trying to be brave now
But I'm frozen in this place now
And it's so cold

And the hopes I had forsaken
We're replaced with such an aching
Please take me home

But I keep it all inside
Inside
Inside
Inside

Through the tears I watched you fly
You fly
You fly
Far away from me
Far away from me
Far away from me

As the years went by
I found in time I smiled

I set my dreams alight
But I'll never forget you
I'll always live for you
All my love

You're not far away from me
