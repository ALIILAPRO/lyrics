		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The day after you said goodbye
All I did was lay in bed and cry
But after one month, I started to move on
And after two, I felt alright
Then three months in, you were off my mind

In month four and five, I was living my life
I was better and didn't have to try
Not to think of you, until you reached out
And said, "Remember that night?"

We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night?"
Remember that night?
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night?"
Remember that night?

The day after you had reached out
I was broken for the second time around
I prayed on the third day that I would be okay
That I'd forget you were ever mine
Oh, I don't think you realize

How long I had to fight to be living my life
To get better and never have to try
Not to think of you until you reached out
And said, "Remember that night?"

We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night?"
Remember that night?
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night?"
Remember that night?

Do you remember, remember?

We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night?"
Remember that night?
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night?"
Remember that night?

Do you remember, remember?
