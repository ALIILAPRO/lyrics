		  (Been trill, been doin' it, been at it)
(Real trouble)
(Ayy YB, pipe 'em up, bro)
Yams

Money gettin', I'm a money spender, you a runner
I ain't goin' 50/50 with no nigga, I'm a hundred (bitch)
Fuck I look like?
Silly hoes hatin', please, address me as a boss, boo
Bad bitch, Miss Turn-His-Head when I walk through (yams, bad bitch)
Ho, you delirious
He ain't talkin' Hermes for this pussy, I ain't hearin' it
You got money askin' me where mines, you the weirdest
Bitch, don't check for me unless that check you got clearin'
What? I'm a mogul, nigga
Speakin' on a rich bitch, don't make me expose you, niggas (bitch ass)
He don't trick, I make him change his mind the first week, uh
I'm too pretty to be sittin' in the nosebleeds (damn)
Court side, white toes, my ass eat up the whole seat
Head to toe, I be givin' ate, bitch, I'm gon' eat
Caramel on his tongue whenever he lick me
Nigga dick small, probably why his balld so pissy
Meat puller on your kneew, how you standin' on the business?
Akademiks, you a bitch, why you speakin' on women? (Fuck nigga)
Yeah, I leave him alone
Mr. Pocket Pussy, what you beatin' on?
You see this face, I ain't one of them bitches you can hang up on
She say she want the confidence of Caresha with no makeup on
We share locations but I'm busy, I ain't comin' home
Yeah, like how you mad at me?
I don't care what that ho on, she ain't bad as me
Yeah, yeah, this P make a nigga try to marry me
Bag me and tag me, choke me out and gag me, period

Ugh, ugh
Yams
