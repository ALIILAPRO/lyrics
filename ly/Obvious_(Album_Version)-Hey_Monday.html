		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's make a mess, steal a kiss in the moment
You and me, everything that it could be
Touch, don't go, stay as long as you like

Let's get reckless, dance with our hands to the beat
Don't let this slip through our fingers
It feels insane, don't you put up a fight
Let's rough it up 'til they shut it down

It's oh-oh-obvious, right here's where the party starts
With you and me, all alone
No one has to know
It's oh-oh-obvious to me
How it's gonna be
Oh-oh-obvious when you come close to me

Let's make a scene like the movies in our dreams
Make me scream, take me down, no one's watching
Close your eyes
Play it back and rewind

So surreal, as the story unfolds on the screen
Stop stalling, the credits are rolling
Hold me now before we run out of time
Let's rough it up 'til the end of the night

It's oh-oh-obvious, right here's where the party starts
With you and me, all alone
No one has to know
It's oh-oh-obvious to me
How it's gonna be
Oh-oh-obvious when you come close to me

It's oh-oh-obvious
One kiss, it's easy to see
You and me

It's oh-oh-obvious, right here's where the party starts
With you and me, all alone
No one has to know
It's oh-oh-obvious to me
How it's gonna be
Oh-oh-obvious when you come close to me

It's oh-oh-obvious, right here's where the party starts
With you and me, all alone
No one has to know
It's oh-oh-obvious to me
How it's gonna be
Oh-oh-obvious when you come close to me
