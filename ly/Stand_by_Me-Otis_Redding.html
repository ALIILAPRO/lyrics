		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
No no no no no no
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand by me

Now darling, darling
Whenever I'm in trouble
Darling, won't you stand
I need just a little helping hand
Now now now
And darling, darling
Won't you stand by me

If the sky we look upon now, now
Should tumble and fall
All of the mountains may crumble
May crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No no no no no, I won't shed no tears
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand by me

Now darling, darling
I said I need somebody right now
I need just a little helping hand
I need someone to come pick me up
And stand by me
Come on, come on, baby, yeah
My my my my baby, whoa
Come on, come on and stand, stand by me

And darling, darling stand by me
Come on, pretty baby, and stand now
Stand, stand by me
Come on and help me, baby
I need a little lovin'
Come on and stand, stand by me
Whenever I'm in trouble
Won't you stand by
Come on and stand by me, my baby
Come on
I need a little bit of love
