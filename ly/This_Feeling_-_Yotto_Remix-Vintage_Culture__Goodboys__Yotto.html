		  I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end

I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end

Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Oh, oh

I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end

I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end
I just don't want this feeling to end
