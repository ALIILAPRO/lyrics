		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay off the weed
Hm-hm, hm-hm
Hm-hm (Roy, baby), hm-hm
(Day-Day-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

While I cough up this blunt, I sit back in the cut
All my niggas ridin' with me, more excuses to stunt
And we fill up the cup, and we fill up the Woods
Loud bang out the truck and the Range lookin' good
Get your girl off a "hey", said she ready to play
It's all a game, it's all a game, and I'm doin' my thang
More rage, more rage, black Porsche in the rain
Someone stop me, bitch, get off me, man, my life ain't the same
Natural killer, born to serve the feeling and pain
Now it's like I'm on my super and I'm feeling them gains
Been through Hell and back, made it, it's a wrap
Can't keep a nigga down, down, baby, that's a fact
And I reppin' Cleveland city, runnin' through my veins
To BK, East New York, and I never change, uh huh
Keep my niggas close, just like I'm supposed
This is for my people, truth is what I wrote, uh-huh

And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (yeah, let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want (yeah)
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (yeah)

Feel like writin' a movie, yeah, that shit would be groovy
Anything that I want, anything that would move me
Next step, I'm on my shit and I'm livin' with love
Ain't no question, all praises to the angels above
Take a trip, a couple women, couple shrooms to the groove
Set it mood to the tune, rockstar in the news
Rockstar, U2, nah my nigga you lose
Keep my head up, never let up and my fate's what I choose (Roy, baby)
On this journey, fronto burnin', catch the signs and the clues
And I'm drippin', yes, you catch him Virgil tag on the shoes
Can't forget I'm on zoom, Cudder back on the moon (the moon, the moon)
Cudder back on the moon

And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (yeah, let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want (yeah)
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (yeah)
