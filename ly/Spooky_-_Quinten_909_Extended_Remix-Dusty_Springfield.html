		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the cool of the evening 
When everything is gettin' kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie?
First I say no, I've got some plans for tonight
And then I stop
And say, "Alright"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you 
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'
I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile
And hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky

If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dyin' to be sayin'
Just like a ghost you've been a-hauntin' my dreams
But now I know
You're not what you seem
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

Spooky, ah
Spooky, mm-mm
Spooky, ah, ah, ah
Spooky, ooh, spooky
