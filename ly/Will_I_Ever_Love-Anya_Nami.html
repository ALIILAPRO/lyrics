		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every I choice made was wrong and
Souls who loved me were left broken,
Guess I’ll pay for this till the end of days

I won and lost and calculated,
Why who I liked I never dated
And broke my head deriving formula

But will I ever love?
Feel it inside my heart?
All that I do is
Fake it all again,
Fake it all again,
Boring
Reckoning again,
Reckoning again
For it
How do I make this vicious cycle end?

Convinced myself to like the beds I shared,
While crying, going numb and lying bare

I did it all for them and more 
With all my body getting sore,
How could I be so brutal to myself?

Will I ever love?
Feel it inside my heart?
All that I do is
Fake it all again,
Fake it all again,
Boring
Reckoning again,
Reckoning again,
For it
How do I make this vicious cycle end?

Will we have kids and marry, hun?
I’d like to, but you’re not the one 
I wanna keep you!
You cage and treat me wrong.
You are a dream girl!
… you made up all along.
Maybe we met to end alone,

All alone

Born to be alone,
Born to be alone,
Earned it
Born to be alone,
Born to be alone,
Worth it
How do I make this vicious cycle end?
