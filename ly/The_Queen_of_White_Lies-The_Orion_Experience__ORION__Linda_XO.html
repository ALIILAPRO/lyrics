		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I like the way you make me feel like I could be
The number one game in town
And all those pretty words you say to me, they pick me up
Whenever I'm feeling down
But I know you're just a White Witch
Putting that spell on me

You know I love the punishment
So girl keep telling me
Li-li-li-lies
Yeah tell me that you love me
Li-li-li-lies
Look deep into my eyes
Li-li-li-lies
Say there's no one else above me
I'm the king of fools, cause baby you're
The queen of white lies
(You're the queen, you're the queen, you're the queen of white lies)
(You're the queen, you're the queen, you're the queen of white lies)
(You're the queen, you're the queen, you're the queen of white lies)
Ooh you're like that Cheshire Cat
There's a devil that resides behind your smile
(There's a devil right behind your smile)
You've got them diamond eyes, they hypnotize
You're unsuspecting victims with your style
(They've hypnotized with your style)
But I know I'm not the one and only
Game you're playing

You know I love the punishment
So girl keep saying
Li-li-li-lies
Yeah tell me that you love me
Li-li-li-lies
Look deep into my eyes
Li-li-li-lies
Say there's no one else above me
I'm the king of fools, cause baby you're
The queen of white lies
Li-li-li-lies
I'm at your beck and call
Li-li-li-lies
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere at all
Li-li-li-lies
So lie to me honey, take all my money
Just do those things you do to me
Ooh, I like the way you make me feel like I could be
The number one game in town
And all those pretty words you say to me, they pick me up
Whenever I'm feeling down
But I know you're just a White Witch
Putting that spell on me

You know I love the punishment
So girl keep telling me
Li-li-li-lies
Yeah tell me that you love me
La-la-la Lies
Look deep into my eyes
Li-li-li-lies
Say there's no one else above me
I'm the king of fools, cause baby you're
The queen of white lies
(You're the queen, you're the queen, you're the queen of white lies)
(You're the queen, you're the queen, you're the queen of white lies)
(You're the queen, you're the queen, you're the queen of white lies)
(You're the queen, you're the queen, you're the queen of white lies)
