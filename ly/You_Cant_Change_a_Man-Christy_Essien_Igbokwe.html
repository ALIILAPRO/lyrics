		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say what you wanna say about your man
You know he's got what it takes to keep a woman
You can say what you wanna say about your man
You know you can never change him from his ways
You know men have gotten many ways of living their lives
They have funny ways of moving around the town
When they go party here party there baby oh Lord
You turn round to talk about this man

I'm telling you say what you wanna say about your man
You know he's got what it takes to keep a woman
You can say what you wanna say about your man
You know you can never change him from his ways
Some women are so ungrateful some women are so heartless
Some women are so rude some women are so ungrateful

You keep on saying what you wanna say about that man there
But you know somehow he made you what you are
You gotta say what you wanna say about your man over there go on
The man is just a man the man is your second God
And a woman is got to be a woman oh Lord

Say what you wanna say about your man
You know he's got what it takes to keep a woman
You can say what you wanna say about your man
You know you can never change him from his ways
A woman has got to be just what she is
She's got to turn the woman she is meant to be
She'so got to be home to know what's going on oh Lord
Cos she is just a woman to her man
I'm telling you stop doing wrong things
You stop doing it ooh
Stop doing funny things
You stop doing it
I say stop saying wrong things
You stop saying it oh Lord
Stop doing funny things you stop doing
Cos just a man your man is just a man oh Lord

Stop listening to gossips
I'm telling you stop acting foolishly oh Lord
Stop saying wrong things you stop saying ooh
Stop doing funny things you stop doing it
He's just a man he is just a man
I'm telling you stop listening to gossips
Uuh baby stop acting foolishly
I'm saying stop saying funny things
You stop doing oh Lord you stop doing funny things
You stop doing
I'm saying stop saying funny things
You stop doing
He's just a man
