		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's okay to just admit that you're jealous of me
Yeah, I heard you talk about me, that's the word on the street
You're obsessing, just confess it, put your hands up
It's obvious, I'm your number one

It's alright to just admit that I'm the fantasy
You're obsessing, just confess it 'cause it's obvious
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
I'm your number one, yeah

I'm just living that life
Von dutch, cult classic but I still pop
I get money, you get mad because the bank's shut
Yeah, I know your little secret, put your hands up
It's so obvious, I'm your number one
Life
Von dutch, cult classic in your eardrums
Why you lying? You won't fuck 'less he's famous
Do that little dance, without it you'd be nameless
It's so obvious, I'm your number one

I'm your number one
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
Yeah, it's so obvious
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
Yeah, it's so obvious

It's okay to just admit that you're jealous of me
You're obsessing, just confess it 'cause it's obvious
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
I'm your number one
Your number one, your number one
Your number one

I'm just living that life
Von dutch, cult classic but I still pop (I'm your number one, I'm your number one)
I get money, you get mad because the bank's shut
Yeah, I know your little secret, put your hands up
It's so obvious, I'm your number one
Life
Von dutch, cult classic in your eardrums
Why you lying? You won't fuck 'less he's famous (He's famous)
Do that little dance, without it you'd be nameless
It's so obvious, I'm your number one

I'm your number one
Your number one, your number one
Your number one, your number one
Your number one, your number one
Your number-, your number one, yeah

I'm just living that life
Von dutch, cult classic but I still pop (I'm your number one, I'm your number one)
I get money, you get mad because the bank's shut (I'm your number one, I'm your number one)
Yeah, I know your little secret, put your hands up (I'm your number one, I'm your number one)
It's so obvious (I'm your number one), I'm your number one

I'm your number one
Your number one
Your number one
