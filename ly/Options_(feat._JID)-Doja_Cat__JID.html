		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need lovin'
Late night, cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, then pause it
Kitchen, vibin', bedroom, closet
Takin' it elsewhere, maybe
You know we both got options 

I know you faded, boy
I feel it wearin' off
Went to get Hen' and Coke
I like the way you talk, yeah
I couldn't give a fuck
Givin' him paranoia
He just wanna smash on tour
Fuckin' for the new velours
I like it when you with me all night
I can't imagine what you might try
Yeah, you so full of surprises
Guess you one of my vices
You want a picket fence and a wife
You never change your mind when I cry
Yeah, I see you flossin', you know it
Droppin' your jaw when the drawers hit the floor

I don't need lovin'
Late night, cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, then pause it
Kitchen, vibin', bedroom, closet
Takin' it elsewhere, maybe
You know we both got options 

You can count on me 
To never count on you
I'm only down for you
We put it down, baby, well, I, I

She wanna fuck a nigga like she love me
She got a lover but I might get lucky
But you got me on a drain like drunkie
Lookin' at the junk in your trunk like a junkie
We don't speak, just fuck twice a week
And if she like freaks, we must try a threesome
Do it on the beach, in the sand, let me see somethin'
Seashells, on the shore, I'm a beach bum
Finna eat somethin', when you come 
Baby, don't you wanna let me know?
Layin' in my bed like a vegetable
Love when you say, "Never let me go"
Just like a pro, you professional
Stand on your hand 'cause you flexible
Now she tryna fuck me in the restroom 
Or the parking lot at the restaurant
Anywhere, everywhere, anytime, I

I don't need lovin'
Late night, cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, then pause it
Kitchen, vibin', bedroom, closet
Takin' it elsewhere, maybe
You know we both got options 

I don't need lovin'
Late night, cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, then pause it
Kitchen, vibin', bedroom, closet
Takin' it elsewhere, maybe
You know we both got options
