		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  North Star
Where are you
Come guide me home
This love
Wont end
If I see you soon
I cant turn night to day
I can explain it
Oh please
North star, come bring me home

It's been a long time coming
But its well worth waiting
And I raise my hands
And ask for nothing more

If we are of the same mind, finally
It was worth the calamity of you being mad at me
You know I've got feelings too they come stealing through
And batter me properly revealing my sensitivity
We don't get this time for free
Take my hand and promise me your love and honesty
And this soliloquy would not have been in vain
On our journey of life lets take the slow train

(It's been a long time coming)

Waiting for the train

(It's well worth waiting)

Take my hand

(And I raise my hands)

We don't get this time for free

(And ask for nothing more)

Hey

Its been a long time coming
But its well worth waiting
And I raise my hands
And ask for nothing more

L-O-N-G time coming

Its been a long time coming
This bright star shining (inginging...)
