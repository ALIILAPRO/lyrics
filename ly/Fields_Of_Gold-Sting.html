		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'll remember me when the west wind moves 
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky 
As we walk in fields of gold

So she took her love for to gaze awhile 
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down 
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me? Will you be my love?
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky 
As we lie in fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so 
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left 
We'll walk in fields of gold
We walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days 
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down 
Among the fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves 
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky 
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
