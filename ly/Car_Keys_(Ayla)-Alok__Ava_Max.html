		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, pull up at the Ritz in my brand new whip in gold (gold, yeah)
With a full eclipse and the moon lit, lit like, whoa
Everything blurred, mixing all that smoke with the Grey Goose
Fendi Baguette on the bar top, both my hands on you

Take a picture
Of my figure
Catch a glimmer
Allow me to remind you, baby

I'm the keys to your car, babe
If you lose me then, baby, good luck
I'm the king to your checkmate
Still yours, oh, baby, you've won
I'm the bubbles in your champagne
Grip me tight like you're holding your cup
I'm the keys to your car, babe
Whoa, know that you need me

Oh, yeah, uh-uh (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, yeah, uh-uh (know that you need me)
Oh, yeah, uh-uh (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, yeah, uh-uh (know that you need me)

Catwalk through the hallway, straight tell 'em one, two (two, yeah)
Three, four, five, six, seven, let the liquor flow through
Six in the morning, tell me now, what we gon' do? Yeah
Driver pull up in the black car, baby, let's move

Take a picture
Of my figure
Catch a glimmer
Allow me to remind you, baby

I'm the keys to your car, babe (oh, yeah)
If you lose me then, baby, good luck (uh-uh)
I'm the king to your checkmate (oh, yeah)
Still yours, oh, baby, you've won (uh-uh)
I'm the bubbles in your champagne (oh, yeah)
Grip me tight like you're holding your cup (uh-uh)
I'm the keys to your car, babe (oh, yeah)
Whoa, know that you need me

Oh, yeah, uh-uh (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, yeah, uh-uh (know that you need me)
Oh, yeah, (yeah, yeah-ay), uh-uh (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, yeah, uh-uh (know that you need me)

I'm the keys to your car, babe
If you lose me then, baby, good luck
I'm the king to your checkmate
Still yours, oh, baby, you've won
I'm the bubbles in your champagne (yeah)
Grip me tight like you're holding your cup
I'm the keys to your car, babe
Whoa, know that you need me
