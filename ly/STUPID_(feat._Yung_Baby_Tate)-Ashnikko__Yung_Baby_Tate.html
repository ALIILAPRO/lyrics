		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm shy) Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Hahahaha, ah, oh my God

Stupid boy think that I need him, humph
I go cold like changin' seasons
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him
Stupid boy think that I need him

Pleasin' season, I'm spicy
Hot to touch, too much, too pricey
Heathen, I'm in your psyche
You know don't no one else like me, whoa
Stupid boy think that I need him
Stupid boy think that I need him
I know you think about me in the shower
PornHub in your browser
Fantasize about the pussy power
Think about me with your hand on your trousers
I'm sweet then I'm sour, I'm big boss Bowser
I know you salivating over me, sir
Nipples through the t-shirt
Tell your mommy that you're bringing home a keeper
Knees are getting weaker when he hear me through the speaker
Big wood, cut him off, cedar

Stupid boy think that I need him, humph
Stupid boy think that I need him, humph
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him
Stupid boy think that I need him, humph (stupid, stupid)
Stupid boy think that I need him, humph (stupid, stupid)
Stupid boy think that I need him
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him

Stupid-stupid, you dumb, you goofy-goofy
This pussy juicy-juicy, ooh yummy, wanna do me?
Ha nah, boy you could never, 'cause you not clever enough
And I got several dummies that wanna get on me
I don't want you and I don't want your homie
'Cause both of y'all are suckers, y'all some dumb-dumbs
I could play you straight up out your bread, now you got crumb crumbs
I don't really need a man but sometimes I want one, though
So I keep Peter Pans on me I got young hundos, young money (get it)

Stupid boy think that I need him, humph (leave me alone)
Stupid boy think that I need him, humph
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him, humph
Stupid boy think that I need him, humph
Stupid boy think that I need him, humph
Stupid boy think that I need him
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him

Nothing about you is attractive to me now
Blocking you, avoiding you actively right now (blocked)
I don't need the dick, I need magic, I need money
Puppy wanna like somethin' sticky just like honey

Stupid, stupid
Stupid, stupid
What, what, what
