		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your good intentions are boring, take me away
If it keeps you sane, is that ok?
If I played it safe would it save me?
I'd like to get some rest now if I could just ignore the truth

Scratching at my window
This time I've got to make a move ego obliteration
Stand back and watch me melt away
Dissolve all recognition

But I got to burn this weight out of my mind
Running through my veins till I disappear
This feeling is over, this feeling is over me
This feeling is over, this feeling is over me

Climbing up my wall gonna creep between the cracks
Get out of my skull tighten the rope around my neck
Destroy all emotion got to rip my face to shreds
Cut my eyeballs open

But I got to burn this weight out of my mind
Run it through my veins till I disappear
This feeling is over, this feeling is over me
This feeling is over, this feeling is over me
