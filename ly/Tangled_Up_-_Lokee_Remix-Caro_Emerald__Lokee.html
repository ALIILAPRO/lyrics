		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took the perfect avenue,
Down the road to both of you
Did I go Dutch?
This is too much!
With all the money in the world
You could never buy this girl
Quite enough
It will be tough
If romancing me with neons is something you should do
Make the letters write in luminous, and blue

And get me waking up
Shake it up, tangled up
You could be breaking up, making up, tangled up
You can't be faking it, making it from my love
With all this tragedy, don't get me tangled up

I can't separate your sins,
To me you're acting like you're twins, this is a mess
Is this a test?
How many guesses do I get?
Till only one of you is left
You're quite the same,
If love's the gain
I want to see emotions coloring the sky
To the point it will make me wanna cry

And get me waking up
Shake it up, tangled up
You could be breaking up, making up, tangled up
You can't be faking it, making it from my love
With all this tragedy, don't get me tangled up

Tangled up

Treating girls like a yo-yo
Is a no no of monumental kind
If playing with your string
Happens to be your thing
It's easy to say to both, oh nevermind

And get me waking up
Shake it up, tangled up
You could be breaking up, making up, tangled up
You can't be faking it, making it from my love
With all this tragedy, don't get me tangled up
Oh oh tangled up
Oh oh tangled up
Oh oh tangled up
Oh oh tangled up
