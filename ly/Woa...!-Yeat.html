		  (Dulio, phew, woo, Lucid, kick your bitch)
Pullin' up inside a big truck, this a Bentley (woo)
I don't fuck with nobody, bitch, I'm not friendly (woo)
I don't leave the crib without my gun, without my semi' (yeah) 
Yeah, I don't leave without my Hemi (ooh)
I got lots of money inside my bag, lots of cash on me (shh)
I don't give no fucks, I don't give no fucks at all (what?)
I got bucks, I got these bucks around (yeah)
Woah, I got cash, who ask who poppin' now?
Woah, why they tryna jack my fuckin' sound?
Woah, I got too many flows, too many sounds
Woah, hah, we ain't pull up just to fuck around (phew)
Woah, fuck the law, fuck your money, I got all 'em honey bunnies (yeah)
I got every type of digit, I got all types of money (all the types, all the types)
Everytime I did, I just wont, "ehh" (ehh)
I ain't never gave a fuck, I just went, "ehh-ehh" (dulio, woo, Lucid)

All this shit is fuckin' trash, it just went, "ehh" (shh, shh, shh, shh, shh)
I just pulled up just to crash, and just went, "ehh" (ooh)
I know it's bad, I know I'm brash, I know I'm, "ehh" (ack)
I don't boast and I don't brag, that's why I'm him (huh, huh)
All my fuckin' money, just to swim in it, yeah
I got deadly weapons, I got bullets in it (boom-boom, boom-boom, boom-boom)
I got two garages, I got twelve of 'em tinted (twelve, whoops)
I got four different houses, I don't know which one I'm at (huh, huh)
I jus' been runnin' that bitch, I jus' been runnin' that shit (huh)
Yeah, I jus' been runnin' that bitch, I jus' been runnin' the street (what? What?)
Maybe go shoot up this bitch, don't like Swisher Sweets (woah, woah)
They cannot muh'fuckin' air, boy, you a muh'fuckin' lame (yeah, ha-ha)
Claimin' to really act tough, boy, you ain't in no gang (boy, say your name)
We can get you deceased, we can get you out of this place (stay in your lane)
Bitch, that Shmunk army, we all over the place (yeah)

(Dulio, phew, woo, Lucid, kick your bitch)
Pullin' up inside a big truck, this a Bentley (woo)
I don't fuck with nobody, bitch, I'm not friendly (woo)
I don't leave the crib without my gun, without my semi' (yeah) 
Yeah, I don't leave without my Hemi (ooh)
I got lots of money inside my bag, lots of cash on me (shh)
I don't give no fucks, I don't give no fucks at all (what?)
I got bucks, I got these bucks around (yeah)
Woah, I got cash, who ask who poppin' now?
Woah, why they tryna jack my fuckin' sound?
Woah, I got too many flows, too many sounds
Woah, hah, we ain't pull up just to fuck around (phew)
Woah, fuck the law, fuck your money, I got all 'em honey bunnies (yeah)
I got every type of digit, I got all types of money (all the types, all the types)
Everytime I did, I just went, "ehh" (ehh)
I ain't never gave a fuck, I just went, "ehh-ehh" (dulio, woo, Lucid)
