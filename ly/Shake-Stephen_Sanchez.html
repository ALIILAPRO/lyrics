		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, she was a-shakin' to the east
Shakin' to the west
An Elvis movin' pelvis underneath a-that a-dress

Oh, come over, little baby, and shake it over here with me
Uh-uh-uh, oh, oh
My heart's a-beatin' like a drum, just a-lookin' for my tambourine, woo-ooh

She had me movin' like a bullet
A-shootin' out a gun
Tryna get a piece of all her Betty Boop-in' love

Come over, little baby, and shake it over here with me
Uh-uh-uh, oh, oh
My heart's a-beatin' like a drum, just a-lookin' for my tambourine, oh, ow

Uh

Well, way down in Louisiana
And somewhere in Atlanta
My baby's off and runnin', and you know I gotta catch her

Come over, little baby, and shake it like a leaf on a tree
Uh-uh-uh, oh, oh
My heart's a-beatin' like a drum, just a-lookin' for my tambourine, eh

Oh, come over here, baby, and shake it for me

Well, come over, baby, and shake it over here with me, eh
A-come over, little baby, and shake it over here with me
Uh-uh-uh, oh, oh
My heart's a-beatin' like a drum, just a-lookin' for my tambourine, eh
My heart's a-beatin' like a drum, just a-lookin' for my tambourine
My heart's a-beatin' like a drum, just a-lookin' for my tambourine
Brr
