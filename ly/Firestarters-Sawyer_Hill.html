		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lust below it

I never show it

The truth comes out and we're gone again

Through the darkness and light

The pleasure and the strife

Nothing quite like the fight between the wrong and the right


Take me as you see me

I'll tell you when to leave me

Don't you fight my hold on you

Pour the gasoline

Strike your match on me

FIrestarters, we are


I'll lie to you if you lie to me

Let him go

And I'll promise that I'll

Lie with you if you lie with me

The truth it burns

But can you take the heat?

Bleeding martyrs

Firestarters


Tension rising

Our ship capsizing

Don't you moralize

This compromise of love

The backstabbing game

And no one else to blame

For this strain of pain we caught


Take me as you see me

I'll tell you when to leave me

Don't you fight my hold on you

Pour the gasoline

Strike your match on me

Firestarters, we are


I'll lie to you if you lie to me

Let him go

And I'll promise that I'll

Lie with you if you lie with me

The truth it burns

But can you take the heat?

Bleeding martyrs

Firestarters
