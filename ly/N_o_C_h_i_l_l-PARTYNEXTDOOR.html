		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah

And I been with triplets, I been with twins
I been solo, where do I begin? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And to me you are the star of the show still
Even though I found your pretty ass out in Mobile
Ever since I copped you all that ice you got no chill
No, woah

Never try to waste your time
And you never try to waste mine
Proved it a million times, woah
Linking up, we were in Turks together
I always keep you close (yeah, oh yeah)
And you dressed up for me
But you don't wanna show anybody
Super lowkey, you don't know anybody (ah-ah)
Can't wait to take you down in private
You know my deepest dark desire
Oh-woah
Baby, I seen everything, I felt you too
But you were the best part
If nobody's told you
Baby you're pressure

I been with triplets, I been with twins
I been solo, where do I begin? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And to me you are the star of the show still
Even though I found your pretty ass out in Mobile
Ever since I copped you all that ice you got no chill
No, woah

My girl got diamonds on her arm, diamonds in her ear
She even worked at Diamonds for a year
I'm tryna treat you special, like no one did
My baby skips the nightlife (nightlife) and the sideline (sideline)
Just to show me it's mine
I'm tryna treat her special, like no one ever did (no baby, I)

I been with triplets, I been with twins (oh baby, I)
I been solo, where do I begin? (For you, for you)
And to me you are the star of the show still (to me you are the star of my show, woah)
Even though I found your pretty ass out in Mobile (ooh, ooh)
Ever since I copped you all that ice you got no chill
No, woah

Where am I at? Hmm
Are you comin' to get me? Oh, no, I didn't think so
Yeah
No, we're good, we're good, we're good
We're chillin', I'm chillin', chillin', chillin'
I'm not doin' nothin', I'm chillin', I'm relaxin'
I'm with my girl, we're good, like
I don't need nothin', no, you're good
I'll be back later
Didn't you say you had somethin' to do?
Oh, okay, how long, how
What do you mean? You're trippin'
Trippin' for no reason, I don't even trip on you like that
You're welcome
