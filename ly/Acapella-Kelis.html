		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was walking, was living
My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune or a scale I could play
No sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea
The silence was too deafening

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing

Everything was the same
One color was just like the others
An assembly routine
My memories were all black and white
'Til I stopped overthinking
Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing

You got the drum in my heartbeat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away
You got the drum in my heartbeat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away
You got the drum in my heartbeat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing

Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing
Before you
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's the only song to sing
