		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me, ooh

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now, girl, I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home
Oh, don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children when we argue, fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never, never, never know me (no, you won't)
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me, ooh

We all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman, you got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye, oh

If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never, never, never know me (no, you won't)
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me (ooh)
If you don't know me by now (mmm)
You will never, never, never know me, ooh
