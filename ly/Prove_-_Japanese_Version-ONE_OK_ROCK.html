		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One step at a time
No matter how long it takes
(I can prove to you) I will make the climb
Learn from the mistakes I've made
(I can prove to you) 

When times are looking tough
I will be looking up to you
I found a better life
That'll be the one that I choose

I need answers
Nobody ever nobody seems to know
Sticks and stones will never break these bones

One step at a time
No matter how long it takes
I will make the climb
Learn from the mistakes I've made

And I'll prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove without a doubt
Give me the one chance, the one chance
So I can, so I can prove to you

心を開いて
見出す新しい世界を
連れてく 必ず
行き止まりはない もう oh oh 

ああ言えばこう言う
どうしようもない答えはない時代に
君は何を思う?
Sticks and stones will never
Break these bones

One step at a time
No matter how long it takes
I will make the climb
Learn from the mistakes I've made

And I'll prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove without a doubt
Give me the one chance, the one chance
So I can, so I can prove to you

I might bend but
I'm not gonna break no more
Might be tired but
I'm not about to give up no

I might bend but
I'm not gonna break no more
(I'm not bout to give up)
No sticks and no stones

And I'll prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove without a doubt
Give me the one chance, the one chance
So I can, so I can prove to you
So I can prove to you

No matter how long it takes
One step at a time
I will make the climb
Learn from the mistakes I've made

And I'll prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove it to you, prove it to you
Prove without a doubt
Give me the one chance, the one chance
So I can, so I can prove to you
So I can prove to you
So I can prove to you
(So I can prove to you)
