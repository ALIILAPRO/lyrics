		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We'd be laying in my bed
And you'd randomly get up and leave
You would make a lot of time
For anyone other than me
The more that I gave, the more you held back
Now I am emotionally starved
You're stuck on your ex, you're stuck in the past
Truth is that you really broke my heart

For one day, one day
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day
I missed you really, really, really, really bad
And a single tear trickled down my face
While I threw your shit in the fireplace
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day

I woke up and it was strange (I woke up and it was strange)
All that I felt was relieved
No more feeling second best (no more feeling second best)
I'm cringin' at those memories
Like the time that you left me alone at the party
When I didn't even know anybody
Truth is that you really broke my heart
Really broke my heart

For one day, one day
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day
I missed you really, really, really, really bad
And a single tear trickled down my face
While I threw your shit in the fireplace
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day

One whole day, ah
One whole day
One whole day, ah (okay)
One whole day (one whole day)

Break up, make up, I wake up, bake up
Quit your cryin', why you messin' up your makeup?
Late night, I stay up tryna get my money way up
Soon as I do some wrong, you approach me the day of
You tell me it's over and you're done and you can't take no more
You're walking out the door and I'm here like, "What you waitin' for?"
Just tryna get the truth, I ain't tryna be confrontational
Before you make a decision, I'ma just let you stay for (uh)

For one day (yup), one day
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day
I missed you really, really, really, really bad
And a single tear trickled down my face
While I threw your shit in the fireplace
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day

One whole day, ah (it's young Khalifa, man)
One whole day
One whole day, ah (I'm tryna make you play)
One whole day (one whole day)
