		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My pockets could run circles around you
I haven't spread my wings but I'm bound to
Think you're on top of me
No one is stopping me
I don't got time to pray

Confessing my sins at the ATM outside
'Cause money ain't asking me why

God can't take me
I'm the only to the save me
Skies are breaking
Raining down
It'll be gold
Gold
Cover me in gold
Cover me in gold

Hold my crown
It should be my throne by now
Watch them fall to their knees
Stop playing now

Confessing my sins at the ATM outside
'Cause money ain't asking me why

God can't take me
I'm the only to the save me
Skies are breaking
Raining down
It'll be gold
Gold
Cover me in gold
Cover me in gold

I need it all
But I don't need you
God can't take me
I'm the only one to save me
Skies are breaking
Raining down
It'll be gold
Gold
Cover me in gold
