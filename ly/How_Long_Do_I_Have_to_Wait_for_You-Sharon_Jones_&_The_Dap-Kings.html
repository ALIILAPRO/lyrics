		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on
Ooh, baby, tell me
How long do I have to wait for you honey?
Before I can say that you're gone

Every hour seems like a day
And every day is like a year
And every week is an eternity
Well, I get lonely, baby, when you're not here

Ooh, baby, tell me
How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on
Ooh, baby, tell me
How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone

Won't you let me know, yeah?
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait
How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone

I asked your mama, I asked your papa
Your friends, your preacher and your boss
No one knows where you're going to, baby
Or if you're coming back to me
Are we together or are we lost?

Ooh, baby, tell me
How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on
Ooh, baby, tell me
How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone

Won't you let me know, yeah?
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

Oh, oh baby, tell me
How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby, how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone, ah

How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby, how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone, yeah
How long, baby tell me, how long?
