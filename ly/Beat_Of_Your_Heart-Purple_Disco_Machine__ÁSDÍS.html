		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a sound like a drum echoin'
When the high from your love's kickin' in
And it hits like the holy ghost
A million-mile-an-hour wind
Pour some fuel on the floor, make a fire
Strike a match, light the flame of desire
Keep me warm 'cause this town is cold
All night long

You make the spot light up wherever we are
All night, we're magnetically charged
Lightning couldn't strike us apart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart
True love in a city of lies
Get lost when I look in your eyes
Lightning couldn't strike us apart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart

Pleadin' guilty, I'm not innocent
If the crime is your love, let me sin
Prayin' nobody saves my soul, oh no

Spin me around, take me up, take me down, high and low
Spin me around, lift me up off the ground, don't let go 
All night long

You make the spot light up wherever we are
All night, we're magnetically charged
Lightning couldn't strike us apart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart
True love in a city of lies
Get lost when I look in your eyes
Lightning couldn't strike us apart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart

You got me dancin', I'm dancin' to the beat of your heart
You got me dancin', I'm dancin' to the beat of your heart
You got me dancin', I'm dancin' to the beat of your heart
You got me dancin' to the beat of your heart

(To the beat of your heart)
(To the beat of your heart)
(To the beat of your heart)
(To the beat of your heart)
(To the beat of your heart)
(To the beat of your heart)
(To the beat of your heart)
(To the beat of your heart)
