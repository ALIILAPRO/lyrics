		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a cup full of coffee, keep us awake.
Corners have got me, hitting the brakes.
I got tank full of fast gas, you've got the sun in your eyes.
I've got some time in the forecast, you got the blue skies.

You take the wheel a minute, steer.
I've got a feeling that it's, clear.
Steal glances at you in the, mirror.
We're on a road to nowhere, dear.

Couple of ramblers, hitching a ride.
Lives are in shambles, taken in stride.
I've got the road in the forecast, you've got the sun your eyes,
I've got a tank full of fast gas, you got the blue skies.

You take the wheel a minute, steer.
I've got a feeling that it's, clear.
Steal glances at you in the, mirror.
We're on a road to nowhere, dear.

It's got nothing lacking, we can't overlook.
We'll drive forever I don't doubt it. (Aaaaaaah)
And the windshields cracking, and the AC's cooked.
The radio ain't wearing out. (Aaaaaaah)

You take the wheel a minute, steer.
I've got a feeling that it's, clear.
Steal glances at you in the, mirror.
We're on a road to nowhere, dear.
