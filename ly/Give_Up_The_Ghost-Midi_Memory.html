		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running from this nightmare
Pass out of existence
Turn around the corner
You've caught up to me
Give up the ghost
Become as one
Control over me
Digging a hole
One foot in the grave
Become as one
Control over me
Digging a hole
One foot in the grave
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost

Running from this nightmare
Pass out of existence
Turn around the corner
You've caught up to me

Give up the ghost
Noises in the void
Echoes in my bones
Surrender to the sound
Give up the ghost
Noises in the void
Echoes in my bones
Surrender to the sound

Become as one
Control over me
Digging a hole
One foot in the grave
Give up the ghost
You've caught up to me
Give up the ghost
You've caught up to me
Give up the ghost
You've caught up to me
Give up the ghost
You've caught up to me
