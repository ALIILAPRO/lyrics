		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today

Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong

Uh, day-to-day same thoughts
This is all the devil's fault
I ain't mean to name drop
Off three, I pop, all three, I'm off, all three
Should make it four like the rings on my Audi
Xans with the Everclear got me seein' foggy
Ironic how somethin' clear got me seein' foggy
Something ain't right 'bout the pills but I bought them
Something ain't right with my mind so I lost it
Drugs turn my knob, then I run, that's a faucet
But it ain't water, it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high, it's exhausting
I was told it gets better with time

Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Unless a Postmates' comin' on the way
But my cellphone isn't well-known
Go the hell on
"Pretty please, get me these
Buy me this, buy me that," bitch, hit your knees
I wasn't prepared for a guest
I'm aware of the stress, I don't care to impress
Can't you see that I am high on drugs?
And low on the sleep
I just wanna go somewhere and count my sheep
I'm tired, I'm tired
Gettin' high is exhausting
But I was told it gets better with time

Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong
