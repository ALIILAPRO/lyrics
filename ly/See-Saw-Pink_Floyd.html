		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Marigolds are very much in love, but he doesn't mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the seas or land
All the way
She smiles

She goes up while he goes down, down

Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn't know so then

She goes up while he goes down, down

Another time, ah
Another day, ah
A brother's way to leave
Another time, ah
Another day, ah

She'll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds, she hasn't got the time to care
All can see he's not there

She grows up for another man, and he's down

Another time, ah, another day, ah
A brother's way to leave
Another time, ah, another day
Another time, ah, another day, ah
A brother's way to leave
