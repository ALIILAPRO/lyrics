		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long-tongued liar
Go tell that midnight rider
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell 'em God Almighty's gonna cut 'em down
Good God Almighty will cut you down

Well stop, God Almighty, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I been down on bended knees
Talkin' to the Man from Galilee

My God spoke and He spoke so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels' feet
Put one hand upon my head
Great God Almighty, let me tell you what He said

He said to tell that long-tongued liar
Tell that midnight rider
The gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell 'em God Almighty's gonna cut 'em down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Well, you may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down
Good God Almighty will cut you down

You may throw a rock, hide your hand
Workin' in the dark 'gainst your fellow man
Be sure as God made day and night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run and hide, slip and slide
Try to take the mote from your neighbor's eyes
Be sure as God made the rich or poor
You gonna reap just what you sow

Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down
My Almighty will cut you down

You better tell that long-tongued liar
Tell that midnight rider
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell 'em God Almighty's gonna cut 'em down
I said God Almighty will cut them down

Some people go to church just to signify
Or try to make a date with the neighbor's wife
But brother, let me tell you sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone

One of these days, you mark my words
You'll think your brother is gone to work
You sneak up and knock on his door
Look out, brother, you'll knock no more

Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Good God Almighty will cut you down
My God Almighty will cut you down

Tell that long-tongued liar
Tell that midnight rider
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell 'em God Almighty's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em God Almighty will cut 'em down
Good God Almighty will cut 'em down
My God Almighty will cut 'em down
