		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Relax
It’s only magic 

I want
All the power and the pain
I’ll love you in the flames
Just tell me that you're mine

I’ll be your beautiful obsession
Center of attention
That’s just what I like

Run through your veins
Got your heart to keep
Calling my name
Get down on your knees

I’m cold as ice
Get what I like
Won’t stay till morning cause I am the night

I’ll show you where
You won’t scared
I’ll be there holding you tight 

I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 

I’ll show you where
You won’t scared
I’ll be there holding you tight 

I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 

I’m the fog inside your memory
I’m the midnight breeze 
Worship like I’m godly 

I’m the air you breathe
Feel my energy
Eyes shut 
But you see me

I run through your veins
When your soul I reap
Control your brain
With these words I speak

I’m cold as ice
Get what I like
Won’t stay till morning cause I am the night

I’ll show you where
You won’t scared
I’ll be there holding you tight 

I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 

I’ll show you where
You won’t scared
I’ll be there holding you tight 

I feel pretty in the dark 
I feel pretty in the dark 

I feel pretty in the dark
