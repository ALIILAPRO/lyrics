		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained? (One)

Every time, every night is a loose one
And every flight, you know that I put the crew on
You say that I dropped off, well, then tell me what you done
I'm still in my winning phase, yeah, I been away
Are you entertained? (Yeah) I'm gone

The God in me, that's what I'm constantly summonin'
I love the climb, I don't care where the summit is
Funny when people be sayin' I peaked (ha)
Retired my parents, they live at the beach
Models and freaks is my track record (yeah)
I made my homies my staff members
Got myself lit to give y'all the light
Usin' my mind to attract better
At first, when adversity came I said, "Why me?"
Now I be starin' it down sayin', "Try me"
Kyrie, I handle it well
They still takin' shots, tryna hand me a L
But I pass on that
Anger, I try not to act on that
I'ma just transmute it
Put it all back in the music

It's feelin' like I might just be on a roll
I'm never sellin' my soul
My records are platinum and gold
It just keeps happenin', whoa
It's feelin' like I might just be on a roll
I'm never sellin' my soul
My records are platinum and gold
It just keeps happenin', whoa

Every time, you see me shine and move up (yeah)
My seat is reclined, the jet is G5, I blew up
You tell me I fell off, but tell me what you done
I'm still in my winnin' phase, 'Rari switchin' lanes
Are you entertained? I'm gone

Well, I'm in the pub with the bros
Lightin' up something that goes, nothin' is froze
But when I put the kettle on
It's a number that nobody knows
I stay off the road, live in the sticks
Put my profit into mortar and bricks
You know I got good advice from a couple guys
To leave more than just stress for my kids
Well, isn't it blissful, baby
Sittin' here like we made it?
It's kinda mad how the game is
You're celebrated and hated
But I don't pay no attention to the words
Put out another one, let it burn
Still on the list, you know what it is
They puttin' me first, yeah
Met Russ in Carbone in New York
Now we here, and I'm killin' the verse
And every time, it's gotta be right
And he told me, "Teddy, boy, take 'em to church" (oh-oh)
When you touch down up in London, you know what?
Give me the stage and you're gonna see how it goes off

Every time, every night is a loose one
My seat is reclined, the jet is G5, I blew up
You say that I dropped off, well, then tell me what you done
I'm still in my winnin' phase, 'Rari switchin' lanes
Are you entertained? I'm gone
