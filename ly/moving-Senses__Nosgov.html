		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a Nosgov exclusive

Until your heart is moving
Mines not truly moving
I won't forget what you did
You thought I’m this stupid

My heart is sacred lost in strong dependence
I won't tell you, not likely
I don't see you brightly

Under your watch I’m prisoned
Locked me up inside my mind
Can't trust you you think I'm blind
You won't get another try
Tell me u love me but u want me gone
I don't care at all trust me I get that a lot
I'm off a substance I don't wanna talk
U the type of person that
I rather just ignore hate me I take it
Ur not right u never were
Don't bothеr just face it
Leave mе out your dirty games
Ur tryna make me look so bad
U should worry bout your self
Why u talk down on my name
Leave me out your dirty games

Until your heart is moving
Mines not truly moving
I won’t forget what you did
You thought I’m this stupid
My heart is sacred lost in strong dependence
I won't tell you, not likely
I don’t see you brightly
