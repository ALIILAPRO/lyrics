		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, crime pays
Crime pays, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Crime pays, nigga, crime pays
Choppin' up the change wit' cocaine in my microwave
Made it through my home wit' my lights out I seen brighter day
Watch this shit get me high, boy, you live and you die by this game
Homeboy just caught HIV, he lived and he died by his hoe
Have we ever hit the same bitch before? Ain't nobody know
Have we ever hit the same bitch before? Wasn't nobody business
Niggas be fucking these hoes and say, "Fuck insurances and doctor visits"

Fly like the wind, it's time to begin your life
(Say, "Fuck insurance and doctor visits")
You got control to stop again and do it right
Look to the sky and you will feel how to live a life that's real
To the perfect harmony, when the spirit is free
(Yeah, yeah)

Crime pays, nigga, crime pays
Choppin' up this change wit' cocaine in my microwave
Diamonds in my chain, yeah, I slang but I'm still a slave
Twist it in the system, just a number listed on a page
Made it through my home wit' my lights out I seen brighter day
Watch this shit get me high, boy, you live and you die by this game
Bitch don't touch my body, 'cause I put your body all off in a body slam
You ain't gon' hurt nobody, go body for body but we the body gang
The hoe that you brought out to Cali
But she only fuckin' wit' you 'cause you fuckin' wit' Kane
Thought she was boostin' her credit wit' niggas 
Like you that just ain't got enough on their name
Thought I would front you when other one niggas 
Like you that just ain't got enough on the books
Talkin' that shit in the booth but when niggas come shoot at you
You couldn't do nothin' but look
My niggas gon' bust a four nickel on your nigga
Bustin' that he on the shit bad
His homie done bubble the condom, he got her shot up
Now I know that his bitch mad
He steadily called up my phone and you huffin' and puffin'
'Cause they at your bitch, duckin'
And Rocky done went and bought Jeezy a pair of new shoes
That nigga was dick suckin'

Fly like the wind, it's time to begin your life
(That nigga was dick suckin')
You got control to stop again and do it right
Look to the sky and you will feel how to live a life that's real
To the perfect harmony, when the spirit is free

Crime pays, nigga, crime pays
Yeah, crime pays, nigga, crime pays
Crime pays, nigga, crime pays
