		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dude, she's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not-

You're sitting waiting, beside your phone
The apple of your eye
The one you love is awake
You're alone, and you can't help but realize

That you waste your time
Tell yourself a lie
That you waste your time

Dude, she's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not-

I love you
And I can't stop thinking of you
But when I love you
I can't stop thinking of you
Love you

Dude, she's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
She's just not into you
Gotta move on, move on
