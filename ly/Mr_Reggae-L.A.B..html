		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh na-na-na, na-na, na, na, na
It's okay, woah, oh 

I hear music, I hear music (hey)
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh
I hear music, I hear music
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh

Like to tell someone 
How to be as one
But they won't come out
They won't come out to sing my song
Mr. Reggae, won't you help me now
Sing a song about today

I hear music (run with it) 
I hear music (growing with it)
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh (take with me)
I hear music (run with it) 
I hear music (I can call)
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh
(We're gonna run with it one more time)

(We're gonna run with it one more time)

Just like birds of a feather
We got to sing together
And spread our love
Along this lonely land

We got to realize
We got to stop the lies
We got to love this land
And give it a helping hand
We got to love this land
And give it a helping hand

I hear music (run with it) 
I hear music (growing with it)
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh 
I hear music (run with it) 
I hear music (gone with it)
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh 

(We're gonna run with it one more time)
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh
(We're gonna run with it one more time)
Woah-oh, woah, oh-oh, oh, mmm
