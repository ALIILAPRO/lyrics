		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Mabellene in a Coup de Ville
A Cadillac arollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' about ninety-five
She's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side
Maybellene
Why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It then got cloudy and started to rain
I tooted my horn for a passin' lane
The rainwater blowin' all under my hood
I know that I was doin' my motor good
Maybellene
Why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

Oh, Maybellene
Why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

The motor cooled down the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac asittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten half a mile aheadv The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill
Maybellene
Why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do
