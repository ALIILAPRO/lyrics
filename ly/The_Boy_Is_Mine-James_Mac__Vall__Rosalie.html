		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start

It's not hard to see
He belongs to me
It's not hard to see
He belongs to me

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

It's not hard to see
He belongs to me
It's not hard to see
He belongs to me
