		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just hope that someday someone would love me

There's no hellos
On our way to the show
Your sweet face is turning cold
As the fires begin to draw a little closer

I left all the water running at home (oh, shit)
Then drove around with a car that we stole
All of a sudden they just wanted to know
How I really feel
So I just danced

Feel you
Feel you
Feel you
I just danced (feel you)
Feel you
Feel you

Hello, your beautiful roses are flat
Flamingos are turning into giant pink rats
Let me know how many knives are in my back
Don't get cold
Your world is just about to crack

I left all the water running at home
Then drove around with a car that we stole
All of a sudden they just wanted to know
How I really feel
So I just danced

Feel you
Feel you
Feel you
I just danced (feel you)
Feel you
Feel you

I never thought it would come to this
What you like them struggles? (Hoo)
It's not your end of the story
God, this shit sucks (hoo)

Hoo, oh, God

I left all the water running at home
Then drove around with a car that we stole
All of a sudden they just wanted to know
This is how I really feel

This is how I really feel
So I just danced
