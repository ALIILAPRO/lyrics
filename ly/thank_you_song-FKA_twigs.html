		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted to die, I'm just being honest
No longer afraid to say it out loud
So, I put my ear to your chest 'til I heard the answer

Love in motion seems to save me now

Love in motion, my heart's open
Thank you, thank you, I'm okay
'Cause you care I made it through today

I once had a dream that shadows took over
Tears we falling like rain
I must've died down 'cause you were awake
You're the only one who really cares what I say
You turned on the light as you pulled me closer
All I know is that no one loves me like you

Love in motion seems to save me now

Love in motion, my heart's open
Thank you, thank you, I'm okay
'Cause you care I made it through today

(Like you, like)
No one loves me like you (like)

Like you
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no (like you)
No-no-no-no-no, no

Love in motion, my heart's open
Thank you, thank you, I'm okay
'Cause you care I made it through today

No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no
