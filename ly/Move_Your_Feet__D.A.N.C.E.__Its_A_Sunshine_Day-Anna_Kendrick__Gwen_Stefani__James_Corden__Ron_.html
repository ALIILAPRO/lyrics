		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody, move your hair and feel united
Oh oh oh
Everybody, shake your hair and feel united
Oh oh oh

Yeah! Everybody's coming to the celebration
I'ma hook you up with the invitation
Let your hair swing and party with me
No bad vibes, just love, you'll see

Do the D-A-N-C-E
1, 2, 3, 4, fight
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P-Y-T
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right

It ain't hard out here, when you're doing it right
Put a smile on blast, that's the troll life

And I'm here to help you through it
"Come on Smidge I know you can do it!"

Your confidence gives me strength

Everybody, shake your hair and feel united, oh oh oh
Sunshine day
Everybody's laughing
Sunshine day
Everybody's singing

Don't stop, don't stop the beat
I can't stop, I can't stop the beat
I won't stop, won't stop the beat
Go!

Everybody, shake your hair and feel united, oh oh oh 
Sunshine day
Everybody's laughing
Sunshine day
Everybody's singing

Sunshine day
Everybody, move your hair and feel united, oh oh oh
Yeah! oh!
Yeah!
