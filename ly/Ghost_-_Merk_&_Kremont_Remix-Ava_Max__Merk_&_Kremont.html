		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ah-ah-ah)

You're in my blood and you're in my veins
And you're appearing in every face
So out of earth, I'm in outer space
Caught up in my dreams but I'm wide awake (ah-ah-ah)

Footsteps are following me all night long
Spirits are calling on me, something's wrong
Can't shake off my emotions, way too strong
Heart is underground and I feel you all around

Everywhere I go I'm haunted by your ghost
You stay on my mind, can't help but keep you close
Oh baby, everywhere I go I'm haunted by your ghost
You're the one I love and I fear the most

(Ah-ah-ah)

(Ah-ah-ah)

Keep having visions I can't control
I close my eyes just to feel your soul
It's in the air and I think you know
That if I never stop I might overdose

Footsteps are following me all night long
Spirits are calling on me, something's wrong
Can't shake off my emotions, way too strong
Heart is underground and I feel you all around

Everywhere I go (I go)
You stay on my mind (my mind)
Oh baby, everywhere I go (I go)
You're the one I love and I fear the most

(Ah-ah-ah)

(Ah-ah-ah)

I'm haunted by your ghost
It's what I fear the most
I'm haunted by your ghost
It's what I fear the most
