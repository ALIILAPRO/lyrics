		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Mr. Hollywood, won't you come back soon?"
She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you come back soon?"

She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you come back soon? (Ayy, ayy)
She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you come back soon? (Ayy, ayy)

She said, ooh
I just wanna lay right by your side
We don't gotta love each other right
We just gotta make it through the night
You don't gotta say
You're not into me no more
When we pass out on the floor
See the sunrise through the door
By the way you move, I know you want me to
Tell you all the rules, I know I'm searching too
Give me all your clues and things to guide me through
The end of the world, the end of the world
Don't blow out the fuse when darkness comes to light
So much I could do to make you come to life
Fingers coming loose, I see there's no more time
Don't tell me I'm gone, don't tell me I'm gone

She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you come back soon?" (Ayy, ayy)
She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you come back soon? (Ayy, ayy)

She said, ooh
I just wanna lay right by your side
We don't gotta love each other right
We just gotta make it through the night
You don't gotta say
You're not into me no more
When we pass out on the floor
See the sunrise through the door
By the way you move, I know you want me to
Tell you all the rules, I know I'm searching too
Give me all your clues and things to guide me through
The end of the world, the end of the world
