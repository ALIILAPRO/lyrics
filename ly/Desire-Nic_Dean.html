		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dripping down her face
Like a single tear
Wash away your sins
With some Belvedere
Yet she already knows
He won't treat her right
Going in blind
But you got perfect sight
The love that you show is mislead
Give it off like the clothes in your bed
Lay next to the one
You've confessed
Ou, oh
Libido
Is feeling like gold
Like sharing a piece of your soul
Hold on to the one I propose
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh why
Libido
Is feeling like gold
Grew found on your touch now I'm sold
Like sharing a piece of our soul
Gone again
Who would've thought
Drink runs it's course
Kept it distraught
Beg you to stay
Girl have it your way
I live in your head
I'm enjoying this place
To me you just show
You don't need me no more
Hold out to your worth
And your back they will blow
Gone and out
Fall back on who you want
(Oh)
Libido
Is feeling like gold
Like sharing a piece of your soul
Hold on to the one I propose
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh why
Libido
Is feeling like gold
Grew found on your touch now I'm sold
Like sharing a piece of our soul
