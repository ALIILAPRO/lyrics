		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I need help
I can't do this by myself
'Cause wishing away all my mistakes
Is dragging us both through hell
It tears me in two
I'll never shine bright like you
But when I see stars surrounded by dark
I think of me and you

In a city broken like me every
Nightmare started out a good dream
I just need to tell you before I go

The weight of the world
On my shoulders 'til I say I'm sorry
My heart's on my shirt
But the rest of me is empty inside
I, I want to tell you everything
But there's so much that I can't say
Every time I try I get hurt
The weight of the world
On my shoulders 'til I say I'm sorry
I'm sorry 'bout me

I think I need help
'Cause lately I'm so unwell
From diamonds to dust that could be us
If I could just change myself

In a city broken like me every
Nightmare started out a good dream
I just need to tell you before I go

The weight of the world
On my shoulders 'til I say I'm sorry
My heart's on my shirt
But the rest of me is empty inside
I, I want to tell you everything
But there's so much that I can't say
Every time I try I get hurt
The weight of the world
On my shoulders 'til I say I'm sorry
I'm sorry 'bout me

The weight of the world
On my shoulders 'til I say I'm sorry
My heart's on my shirt
But the rest of me is empty inside
I, I want to tell you everything
But there's so much that I can't say
Every time I try I get hurt
The weight of the world
On my shoulders 'til I say I'm sorry
I'm sorry 'bout me
I'm sorry 'bout me
