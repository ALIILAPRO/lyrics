		  Hmm

Words gotta match the actions
Fatal, fatal attraction, R.I.P.
For every time we went through it, know it's all on me
So no more runnin' backs, no more apologies (uh)
Slant right got me thrown
Before we ever fucked, we spent hours on the phone
I done dragged all my exes through the mud, so I ain't gotta do it no more
We know they got FOMO
We know it's all promo when they talk about us (my name still in your mouth)
If you talkin' 'bout me, I must've did somethin' right
I can make one night feel like a whole damn life
Get rid of that strife
Update your life on some iOS shit
Came three times, ain't gotta buy your ass shit (uh)
Always been the plug, no denyin' that shit
I know how to keep you wired, I inspire that shit

Fatal attraction, ah
I would ride for you, ride for you, ride for you
Die for you, die for you, die for you
Live for you, cry for you, slide with you, yeah
Make me never wanna leave ya
Fatal attraction, R.I.P.

She got that killer, killer grip, am I dead? (R.I.P.)
So much to think about, but it's crazy what you doin' with your head (R.I.P.)
I done been a lot of things, but one thing I'm not is scared
If there's one thing I got to share
It's a lot of spillin' goin' on, lot of hurtin' goin' on
Figure out what's goin' wrong
You been through too much and you don't need no more
The help I get is gold, C-3PO
It might be fatal, but I'm hooked on it
Gotta write a book on it
Love it when you shook on it
Get a second look on it
You in love, no denyin' that shit
I know how to get you wired, I inspire that shit

Fatal attraction, ah
I would ride for you, ride for you, ride for you (yeah, I'll ride)
Die for you, die for you, die for you
Live for you, cry for you, slide with you, yeah
Make me never wanna leave ya (oh)
Fatal attraction, R.I.P. (dead)

Fatal attraction
You know I ride for you, ride for you, ride for you (no questions asked)
Die for you, die for you, die for you (might think twice about that one, yeah)
Make me never wanna leave ya (leave)
R.I.P.

Girl, you know the things that I would do
You say you're bad for me
But I'ma need some proof
Mind in the gutter, put one on your roof
You look up to me, I look up to you

Dear Mother, Father God
I just wanna thank you for the opportunity to be this blessed
To experience love
To be so present
To be happy with who I am
To wear my body righteously
To be confident with the words that come from my soul
Thank You, thank You, thank You
