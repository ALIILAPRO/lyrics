		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bits and pieces of love for you, 
So sweet and simple yet
I'm frightened by the way you feel
Little by little you touch my heart, 
Where they had touched it too
And as I smile, I catch myself
Trouble me or I'll go, 
Trouble me with you
Spider, spider, crawl on the lake, 
Guilty and poison free
I wish that I could be like you
Trouble me or I'll go, 
Yeah I'm human too
Over and over the need needs food 
Will human weakness
And as I act I hate myself
Bits and pieces of love for you, 
So sweet and simple yet
I'm frightened by the way you feel
And as I act, 
I hate myself
