		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had a plan, move out of this town, baby
West to the sand, it's all we talked about lately
I'd pack the car, bring your guitar and Jane for smoking
First thing at dawn you'd cue the songs and we'd get going
But you weren't home, waited on the porch for ya
Sat there alone, all throughout the morn 'til I
Got a hunch, down in my gut and snuck around the back
Empty cans and I'll be damned, your shit was never packed

Did your boots stop workin'?
Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money?
Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will then there's a way 
And I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it

Was the whiskey flowin'?
Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you?
What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA
And that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years you'll still be here
Drunk, washed up in Austin

A hell of bluff you had me believin'
How many months did you plan on leaving?
What happened? Bad habits?
Did you go back? Go batshit?
I loved you, how tragic ohh-oh

Did your boots stop workin'?
Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money?
Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will then there's a way 
And I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it

Was the whiskey flowing?
Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you?
What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA
And that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years you'll still be here
Drunk, washed up in Austin

Did your truck break down?
Did you ex find out?
