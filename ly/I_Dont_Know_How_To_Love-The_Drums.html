		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're alone and I'm alone
I could touch your hair three months ago
But now it makes you so upset

But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life
You can say you don't know

But I remember football in the snow
Everybody's gone home
Why don't you love me anymore

But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life

But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life

But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life
