		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like you live in a different universe 
Wrapped in a silhouette, a curse 
Oh how your blindness cracks the dirt 

I talk to you and I watch all our thoughts disperse 
It's just a silhouette, a burst 
Oh how our silence cracks the earth 

Ooh, Ooh Ooh
Ooh, Ooh Ooh
It's just a silhouette, a burst 
Oh how our silence cracks the earth 

I only wanted what you wanted 
You always seem to cross the line 
We got a million scores to settle, 
but I can't put up a fight 
Can't even say what got us started, 
So who even cares who is right? 
You and I, you and I 
Only problem with me and you 
Is you and I 

I feel like you live in a different universe 
We used to talk until it hurt 
and now I wonder what it's worth (ooh) 
We're hard wired to be better but we're worse 
And now our silence is a curse 
look how our violence cracks the earth 

I only wanted what you wanted 
You always seem to cross the line 
We got a million scores to settle, 
but I can't put up a fight 
Can't even say what got us started, 
So who even cares who is right? 
You and I, you and I 
Only problem with me and you 
Is you and I 

When we're down let it out, let me in 
I don't wanna begin this again 
(but) let's just try 
let's just try

I only wanted what you wanted 
You always seem to cross the line 
We got a million scores to settle, 
but I can't put up a fight 
Can't even say what got us started, 
So who even cares who is right? 
You and I, you and I 
Only problem with me and you 
Is you and I 
Only problem with me and you 
is you and I
