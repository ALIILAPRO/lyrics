		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give her back shots 'til her back hurt (Back shots)
Thumb through the money 'til my hands hurt (Cash out)
Wanna go on a date? You gotta dance first (Yah, yah)
Take it to the paint, I gotta slam first (Yah, yah)
She be actin' stiff with the booty (On God)
Feelin' like I'm Biggie rockin' Coogi (On God)
Draco make you put up that lil' Uzi (On God)
I don't want no features, niggas groupies (Straight up)
Pass her to the gang, quarterback sneak (Quarterback sneak)
I was in my feelings, now it's, "Fuck Kiki" (Worried 'bout)
Let lil' Tip hit that bitch, on GP (Straight up)
Smokin' gas, nigga, I re-up at the BP

Five foot five (Five), she my ride or die (Die)
Never tell a lie (Lie), we like Bonnie and Clyde (Clyde)
Lookin' at her thigh (Thigh), like, "Do it come with rice?" (Rice)
She don't like FaceTime, she would rather Skype
But I'm out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Yeah, I'm out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)

Yeah, you workin' hard (Hard)
And I see you (I do)
And your bills late (Late)
And your rent due (Yeah)
And you never need a man to defend you (Straight up)
You already pissed off, on your menstrual (Straight up)
And you been through (Yeah)
'Cause he been through (Yeah)
You a star player (Yeah)
And he benched you (Yeah)
In your corner, I'd never go against you (On God)
Bought a foreign, now it's friends wanna text you (Straight up)
You got off late (Late)
And you worked out (Worked)
You ain't stunt his baby mama 'cause she burnt out (Burnt)
You got rid of him and made sure that we worked out (Facts)
So I put a hunnid racks in your purse now (Racks)

Five foot five (Five), she my ride or die (Die)
Never tell a lie (Lie), we like Bonnie and Clyde (Clyde)
Lookin' at her thigh (Thigh), like, "Do it come with rice?" (Rice)
She don't like FaceTime, she would rather Skype
But I'm out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Yeah, I'm out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)

Damn
Damn
Ooh (Huh)
Ooh

P-pardon my lateness, this beat hittin', slap
After take one, then just run this shit back
Say La Flame hot, no, I'm hotter than that (Yeah)
Told you before, know this deeper than rap
We been up-up in the cap, ain't no cap (Uh)
Just bought the block where they didn't want me at
Just threw a fest right across from the tracks
Tried take my world, but I got that bitch back
My heart in this 'til I heart attack
Runnin' this shit 'til cardiac
Not far from this shit where they find me at
Flame, Flame, La Flame
Walk in my closet, she tryin' on pieces
She wanna bling blaow for the evenin'
Up at the top it's still plottin' and schemin'
City of Angels, we watch for the demons
Out of the window, we countin' in seasons
Three nights in The Forum for the kids, gotta feed 'em
They open pits up without even speakin'
It's been some tension, but can't rock the wave
Let the coupe roller coast, get the fuck out my way (Yeah, yeah)
It will start makin' sense, I guess, when I get older
For now 'cause they cold, I got ice to get colder
I run through the H, keep an eighth when I go there
Don't break out MoÃ«t 'cause I'm lit if I'm sober
Don't mean that I'm slippin' and slidin' on this
She wanna go out for the night, I'm with it
Yeah
