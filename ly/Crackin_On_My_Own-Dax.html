		  Como te amo, me amor, trapta, Dax

I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
Now these people call my phone
I was down and needed help
Went and got it by myself
This for anybody watching
I don't need nobody else
All you niggas didn't believe me
Now you watch me on the TV
I swear to god it wasn't easy
Now we taking trips to Fiji
I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
Now these people call my phone
I was down and needed help
Went and got it by myself
This for anybody watching
I don't need nobody else
All you niggas didn't believe me
Now you watch me on the TV
I swear to god it wasn't easy
Now we taking trips to Fiji

I'm in a trap, nigga you trash
Fuck on your bitch, fuck up a bag
Nigga be lit, nigga be wack
Don't give a fuck, nigga I'm mad
Mumbling that way
Couldn't beat me in on a bad day
I was tryna get my ass paid
Couldn't even get a track play
Now they talk when I'm talking
Holy walk when I'm walking
Always hit on my IG, pay see what I'm droppin
Dax sick they coughing, Dax rich I'm poppin
I can't go home, I get no love that often

I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
Now these people call my phone
I was down and needed help
Went and got it by myself
This for anybody watching
I don't need nobody else
All you niggas didn't believe me
Now you watch me on the TV
I swear to god it wasn't easy
Now we taking trips to Fiji

I'm the topic, I swear that I called it
Now I take my family to trips
Out and I drop this
Real big ballin', can't nobody stop here
I be fuckin' doin heat and no nobody poppin'
Now I went and got it by myself
All the hatred doing bad for your health

I got it cracking on my
I got it cracking on my
I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my
I got it cracking on my
I got it cracking on my own
I don't need anybody's help
I did this all by myself waoh waoh waoh waoh

I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
I got it cracking on my own
Now these people call my phone
I was down and needed help
Went and got it by myself
This for anybody watching
I don't need nobody else
All you niggas didn't believe me
Now you watch me on the TV
I swear to god it wasn't easy
Now we taking trips to Fiji
