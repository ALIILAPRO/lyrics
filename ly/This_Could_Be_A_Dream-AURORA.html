		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look up at the light
This could be a dream or it could be real
Dive into my mind
And don't come up for air
You won't need it here

Can I move you?
Can I soothe your fear?
Could you trust love?
If I prove it's there
Oh, I need to know it, too
And now I don't feel you

So I lift myself and I close my eyes
And I sing sometimes to know I'm alive
I know I should figure this out on my own
But if you come by could you take me home?
I get back up when the wind is strong
But I wish I knew how it felt to run
I know I'm not alone
And if you come by could you take me home?

Being so alive
Can hurt so very much
When you're losing touch
But if I touched you, would I feel it there?
Could I trust love even if I'm scared?
Oh, I wish I could give like I'm longing to give
Oh, I wish I could live like I'm longing to live

And I lift myself and I close my eyes
And I sing sometimes to know I'm alive
I know I should figure this out on my own
But if you come by could you take me home?
I get back up when the wind is strong
But I wish I knew how it felt to run
I know I'm not alone
And if you come by could you take me home?

This could be a dream
This could be a dream

And I lift myself and I close my eyes
And I sing sometimes to know I'm alive
I know I should figure this out on my own
But if you come by will you take me home?
I get back up when the wind is strong
But I wish I knew how it felt to run
I know I'm not alone
And if you come could you take me home?
