		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I do?
Will I be getting through?
Now that I must try to leave it all behind
Did you see what you have done to me?
So hard to justify, slowly it's passing by

Forever and one, I will miss you
However I kiss you yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow, I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies?
Your lies

Here I am, seeing you once again
My mind's so far away
My heart's so close to stay
Too proud to fight
I'm walking back into night
Will I ever find someone to believe?

Forever and one, I will miss you
However I kiss you yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow, I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies?
Your lies

Forever and one, I will miss you
However I kiss you yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard I was trying
Tomorrow, I'll still be crying
How could you hide your lies?
Your lies, your lies
