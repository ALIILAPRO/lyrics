Huh
East Atlanta Santa
It's Guwop
Ziggy
Wanna do this for all the street niggas
Yeah, Christmas came early
So Icy Winter

They didn't hear a gunshot, they just saw him on the ground
Chopper with the silencer, that bitch don't make a sound
Some niggas tried to bully me but I don't fuck around
I'm Gucci Mane, the gravedigger, I put 'em in the ground
I'm East Atlanta Santa when the bales touch down
All these ho ho hoes know the player's in town
Wrapping up a brick like I'm wrapping up a present
Ain't thinking 'bout the past 'cause I'm focused on the present
White girl in and I call it Taylor Swift
People say I'm blessed man, they say I got a gift
Taping bricks to her chest, if you love me, take a trip
Better not hold your breath if you waiting on me to slip
But the birds on the sleigh, I can fly the whole bomb
'Cause my right hand man, he supply the whole slums
Caught a F in the cookie jar, cut off his right thumb
Speaking on a cartel, we'll cut off your damn tongue

It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
For street niggas just like me (like me)
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
The kids need new J's on they feet
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
For street niggas just like me
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
Ain't no love, it ain't no rules in the streets

It ain't all good, probably never been good
Gucci Mane hood and he'll always be hood
I remember ridin' 'round four deep Glenwood
6 kickin' 12s at my fuckin' Kenwood
Bouldercrest Road, man, you know how that go
Nigga wipe your nose, right around flesh holes
Gotta keep your head on a swivel 'round here
Gotta keep your hand on your pistol 'round here
Never thinkin' shit get sweet 'round Christmas
Niggas 'round here gettin' geeked 'round Christmas
Robbers 'round here don't sleep 'round Christmas
Niggas 'round me damn near shoot missiles
I know a nigga lost his life 'round Christmas
Playin' 'round cutthroat on the dice 'round Christmas
You gotta keep the fire, rock your ice 'round Christmas
These checkers 'round here kidnap your wife 'round Christmas

It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
For street niggas just like me (like me)
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
The kids need new J's on they feet
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
For street niggas just like me
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
Ain't no love, it ain't no rules in the streets (yeah, huh)
