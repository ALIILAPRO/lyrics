		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love Saves the Day

We are an army, we are beautiful and strange
We are chaos, we are change, we are united
We are the future, we are living for the cause
We are Children of the Stars, we are ignited

Now if you come to stop us, or slow us down
Join in or get out of our way
Cause we got the momentum, we got the sound
And we have got something to say...

Melt down the guns, we'll build ships to the Stars
We'll rise above conflict and wars
Now dry your eyes, there's still a way
We live for Love. Love Saves the Day

Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
We live for Love. Love Saves the Day

Come on now, don't you get dragged down by the weight of the World
It's easier when we come together
We could find a world where we belong, make a right of every wrong
And keep this party going strong forever and ever

We are fire, we are flame
We do what we desire, we feel no shame
We live for Love Love for Love Love, we come from above
and if you want it come and get it we've got more than enough

Melt down the guns, we'll build ships to the Stars
We'll rise above conflict and wars
Now dry your eyes, there's still a way
We believe in Love and Love Saves the Day

Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
If you believe in Love, then Love finds a wayâ€¦

Whoa, yeah yeah yeah. Whoa, yeah!
Children of the Stars unite! Donâ€™t you be afraid to share your light
Children of the Stars unite! Donâ€™t you be afraid to share your light

Melt down the guns, we'll build ships to the Stars
We'll rise above conflict and wars
Now dry your eyes, there's still a way
We believe in love and Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
We believe in Love and Love Saves the Day.
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
Whoa
Love Saves the Day
We live for Love and Love Saves the Day
