		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look into my eyes and tell me what you see 
If this meant to show one say it's mystery 
Since the day I met you baby I can feel 
Deep inside my heart I know it's real 
You have turned my dreams into reality 
Beating of my heart to your sweet melody
It's the same old feeling, baby, it's so real 
Deep inside my heart I know it's real 

Say you'll never, never, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever, ever go away

Yesterday my life was just in history 
Now I feel like mastering my destiny 
It's the same old feeling baby, it's so real 
Deep inside my heart I know it's real 

Say you'll never, never, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever, ever go away

Say never
Say never, never, ever, ever go away
Say never, ever go away
Say you'll never, ever, ever go away

Say you'll never, never, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever go away
Say you'll never, never, ever, ever go away
(Say you'll never, never, ever go away)
