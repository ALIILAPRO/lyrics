		  (Mood swings)
Oh, you ain't know I could sing? (Oh, oh, oh)
Hahaha (yeah)

Shorty a lil' baddie (she a lil' baddie)
Shorty my lil' boo thing (boo thing)
And shorty got the fatty
Shorty be catching mood swings
Every time I fuck without a rubber
I nutted on the covers
And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell (kiss and tell)

Every time I fuck, she call me daddy
My lil' mama nasty
I see the pussy through the panties (whatever you want)
She taste like candy
She a queen, like Nefertiti
Uh-oh, my lil' mama sittin' pretty
And we be shoppin' through the city (oh, oh)
I gave her keys to the Bentley (whoa, whoa)
Get off your knees, you don't gotta cry to me
I'm your best friend, baby, you don't gotta lie
I'll get you everything that you want and you need from Chanel to Celine
It's on you to decide
Valentino, yeah, I put you in the best
Start liftin' up your dress, start kissin' on your neck (oh no, no)
Start rubbin' on your butt, start massagin' your breasts
I ain't wanna give you a baby just yet, so I backed out and nutted on your breasts
I put you in an Uber (Uber) and sent you to your bed (oh)
The very next day (oh), you sent me a text (oh)
You pulled up to the crib and we did it again (oh, oh)

Shorty a lil' baddie (she a lil' baddie)
Shorty my lil' boo thing (boo thing)
And shorty got the fatty
Shorty be catching mood swings
Every time I fuck without a rubber
I nutted on the covers
And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell (ooh)

You know, I never found love until I looked into your eyes (into your eyes)
First time blushin', I ain't even gon' lie (ain't even gon' lie)
Four rounds in, leavin' bruises on your thighs
You the only bitch could make me spin off on the guys
And the only bitch that make me wanna nut when I'm inside
It's your vibe, leave with me you gettin' high
None of these bitches fuckin' with you even if they tried
Pussy on tsunami, I ain't never felt it dry
Close my eyes 'fore I sleep, hope you be there when I wake
Honestly, I feel the vibe we have is great
And if there's something in your mind, you can tell me
And if I told you what's on mine, would you help me?
You gon' see the bigger picture, it's just gon' take time
Just because you mine
I'ma keep you lookin' like a dime
Ain't no imperfections, girl, you fine
Baby, what's your sign?
hope you ain't against the slow grind
(Work, work, it's me and you) me and you
Keep it silent, there ain't nothin' we can't do
Through the storm, baby, we can make it through
Why you actin' brand new? You know you my lil' boo thing
Got up on my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin (it's hurtin')
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
She know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy
So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy
Late night sex, she can't find her panties
Couldn't hold it in, now she need a Plan B

(Shorty a lil' baddie)
(She my lil' boo thing)
And shorty got the fatty (shorty got the fatty)
Shorty be catching mood swings
(Every time I fuck without a rubber)
(I nutted on her covers)
And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell
