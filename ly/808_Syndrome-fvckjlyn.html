		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, I'm so sick
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, I'm so sick
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, I'm so sick
I have a craving only 808's can satisfy
If I dont get it then I know my symptoms amplify
Doctors told me that my ailment can't be classified
But as the days go on, it just ramifies
People look at me like I'm the one that's going crazy
I probably am, cus I see my vision's getting hazy
I hear a beat with crazy 808's and listen up
Then all a sudden, my vision starts clearing up
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, I'm so sick
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, bitch
I have 808 syndrome, I'm so sick
