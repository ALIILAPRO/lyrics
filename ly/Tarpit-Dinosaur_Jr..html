		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey what's bubbling down under there? 
Why's it screaming?, what's unfair? 
Please excuse it for getting hard 
Let the (shellfish?) swell inside 
But how should I now watch it squirm? 
It's asking me what's that I learn 
Stay inside, pull me out of space 
Trip me sprinkling grey 
Stay and take my fate 
Thought I knew you, stuck out my hand 
The bit which I could understand 
It's a twisted feeling, staring bored 
It's time to burn, I hope I score 
Wait for me there, the gas might run 
Strike this little, be outdone 
Stay inside, pull me out of space 
Trip me sprinkling grey 
Stay and take my fate 
Take my fate 
Take my fate 
Take my fate 
And take my fate
