		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uno, Dos, Tres, Quatro
She flew out from Colorado
Everybody bought her bottles
Sip until she hit the bottom
Uno, Dos, Tres, Quatro
(Aye, se la vie)
She flew out to see Chicago
(Aye, se la vie)
She don't care about tomorrow
(Aye, se la vie)
Sip until her soul is hollow
(Aye, se la vie)
Let's go

Uno, Dos, Tres, Quatro
How many sips till you kill the bottle
She never struggle with pills to swallow
She don't care how she gon' feel tomorrow
Uno, Dos, Tres, Quatro
Acting like she don't wan' waste the bottle
Keeping up is a hard pace to follow
She don't care how she gon' feel

Sniffin' that coca
Sipping that cola
Shake it like Doja
Shake it like Doja
She wanna go numb
Break it and roll up
Shake it like Doja
Shake it like Doja

She could model for vogue
She could study at Yale
She could fly to the 'wood
But she lookin' for more
She got plenty of foes
Lotta envious hoes
Tryna copy the moves
So they lookin' like clones

Say she grew up in Aurora
Watching the legend of Kora
I took that bitch to Sephora
I took that bitch to Sephora
Mix a lil Henny in Soda
Got a lil purple to pour up
I took that bitch to Sephora
I took that bitch to Sephora

Uno, Dos, Tres, Quatro
Lil mami got what it take
To shake it like Doja
Shake it like Doja
Uno, Dos, Tres, Quatro
Lil mami got what it take
To shake it like Doja
Shake it like Doja

She got the moves
I got the stamina
Break all the rules
Turn on the camera
She got the moves
She got rhythm, uh
She got the body and mind of a goddess
And I got to have it all
Let's go

New Marilyn Monroe
Sweet like cinnamon roll
Too cute for the night show
For the night show
For the night show
But I seen the way you hit that pole
I seen the way you pop that roll
Two doses of the X and O
Playing with me like Tic Tac Toe
New Marilyn Monroe
Sweet like cinnamon roll
Too cute for the night show
For the night show
For the night show
But I seen the way you hit that pole
I seen the way you pop that roll
Two doses of the X and O
Playing with me like Tic Tac Toe
