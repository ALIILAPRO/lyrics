		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That boy take me away into the night
Out of the hum of the street lights and into a forest
I'll do whatever you say to me in the dark
Scared I'll be torn apart by a wolf in mask
Of a familiar name on a birthday card

Blow out all the candles
Blow out all the candles
"You're too old to be so shy"
He says to me so I stay the night

Just a young heart confusing my mind
But we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene

Well, I have brittle bones it seems
I bite my tongue and I torch my dreams
Have a little voice to speak with
And a mind of thoughts and secrecy

Things cannot be reversed
We learn from the times that we are cursed
Things cannot be reversed
Learn from the ones we fear the worst
And learn from the ones we hate the most how to

Blow out all the candles
Blow out all the candles
"You're too old to be so shy"
He says to me so I stay the night

Just a young heart confusing my mind
But we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed

'Cause we both know
I'll never be your lover
I only bring the heat
Company under cover
Filling space in your sheets

Well, I'll never be a lover
I only bring the heat
Company under cover
Filling space in your sheets
In your sheets

So, please just blow out all the candles
Blow out all the candles
"You're too old to be so shy,"
He says to me so I stay the night

It's just a young heart confusing my mind
But we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene
