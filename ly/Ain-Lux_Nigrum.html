		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see
I've seen the unclear darkness of your face
I've seen the pure mystic of your grace
I've heard your silent voice
Dissolving my being
A Sacred Spirit Is Shattered
By the Thoughtless Alogos
A Return To Ain
Nullifying your light
A Sacred Spirit Is Shattered
By the Thoughtless Alogos
A Return To Ain
Nullifying your light
I can feel
I've felt the antinomian pulse in me
I've felt the Magnum Opus
Of your purification
Great Master without thought
Enlighten our creation
A Sacred Spirit Is Shattered
By the Thoughtless Alogos
A Return To Ain
Nullifying your light
A Sacred Spirit Is Shattered
By the Thoughtless Alogos
A Return To Ain
Nullifying your light
I can see
I've seen the true colour of thy flame
I've seen your Nigra Opus
Over yhws's regression
Great Master without thought
We offer our conception
A Sacred Spirit Is Shattered
By the Thoughtless Alogos
A Return To Ain
Nullifying your light
A Sacred Spirit Is Shattered
By the Thoughtless Alogos
A Return To Ain
Nullifying your light
