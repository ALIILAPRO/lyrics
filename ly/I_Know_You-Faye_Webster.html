		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're holding me and holding back
I don't really care for that
Just you
There's a pause between every minute
Feeling like I need something
It's just you

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you

I'll quiet down if it's what you want
I understand I'm not the only one
For you
So tell me what you're looking for
Is it a picture-perfect girl
For you?

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you

I'm here regardless of the pain
Don't ever tell me to go away
From you
When we're old and have to leave the Earth
I'll still remember all I've learned
From you

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you

I know
I know
I know
I know
You, you
