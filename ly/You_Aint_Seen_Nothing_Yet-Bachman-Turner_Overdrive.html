		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said, I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get, mmh
Ooh, ooh, she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet

Nothin' yet, you ain't been around
That's what she told me

And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something you're never gonna forget, baby
You know, you know, you know you just ain't seen nothin' yet

You need educatin'
Gotta go to school

Any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then
She looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something
Here's a lover you will never forget, baby
Baby, baby, baby, you ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet

You ain't been around
You ain't seen nothin' yet
That's what she told me
She said, I needed educatin', go to school

I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You got something for me when I get home
Better be good
I been everywhere
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
Ah, she said, said, she said I ain't seen nothin' yet
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo and I ain't seen nothin' yet
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I ain't seen nothin' yet
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
If you wanna come show me what I ain't seen, where I ain't been
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
