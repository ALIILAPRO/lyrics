		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The ground reaches out to catch me softly in her baseball mitt
I'm tired of the dirt and grit
I want something soft

I'm a fish in a bucket, thrashin', he tried to take me out
Hooks in my mouth
Listen to me when I say, "Ouch"
I want something soft

So I give into the fall, fall, fall (it's cold out here)
I need something soft
Down feathers over rocks
I died and I land with both of my hands in the mud, the mud
It felt like a God, how she held me
I slept on her shoulder, I gave her my all (is there anyone?)
I bathed in her waterfalls
And continued to fall, fall (I'm entering the exosphere)

Burnin' like a dying star
Invasive weeds rooted in my heart
Set in a crooked trajectory
The journey here was hard
I was almost pulled apart
Tryna leave this orbit, took what's left of me

The forest reaches out to guide me
Blue fire paths of will-o'-wisps
Illuminate the darkness' old tricks
I'm nobody's captive (mmh)
I asked him not to kill me politely
He drained my magic core, bottled up at the source
I washed upon the sea glass shores
I'm nobody's captain (mmh)

It felt like a God, how she held me
I slept on her shoulder, I gave her my all
I bathed in her waterfalls
And continued to fall, fall

Burnin' like a dying star
Invasive weeds rooted in my heart
Set in a crooked trajectory
The journey here was hard
I was almost pulled apart
Tryna leave this orbit, took what's left of me

Burnin' like a dying star
Invasive weeds rooted in my heart
Set in a crooked trajectory
The journey here was hard
I was almost pulled apart
Tryna leave this orbit, took what's left of me

The ground reaches out to catch me, softly in her baseball mitt
I'm tired of the dirt and grit
I want something soft
