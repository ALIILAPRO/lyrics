		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake your punk ass up for the 93 shot 
MC Eiht's in the motherfuckin' house... yeah 
And it ain't nothin' but a Compton thang y'all 
And we ain't nuttin' but niggaz on the run 
And this goes out to my niggaz... gyeah 

A fucked up childhood, is why the way I am 
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn, hmm 
Somebody help me, but nah they don't hear me though 
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto 
Ain't no escapin', cause I'm way too young 
Pops is dealin', and on top of that got moms sprung
Scheamin' off the top, pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga 
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the foot steps of the homies from the hood 
And where's the role model? 
Niggaz putting brew in my fuckin' baby bottle! 
Damn, and through all the motherfuckin' pain 
They done drove my moms insane
So I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a straight up menace, yeah

Uh, come on y'all 
Straight up menace 

Now I'm of age, and livin' in the projects 
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks 
I'm Fil-ia fresh outta high school, never did I wonder 
That the motherfuckin' hood would take me under 
Gyeah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps 
Off to the corner store, owned by the fuckin' Japs
See a bitch in the right lane so I comes with the mack
Astro Bam pulls a motherfuckin' jack from the back 
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head 
See him play that shit cool, and don't be a fool! 
He shot my nigga in the fuckin' head 
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead 
Now I'm layin' in the hospital bed 
Thinkin' about them punk motherfuckers and my eyes is bloodshot red 
Yeah motherfuckers, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for the straight up menace, yeah

Uh, whassup y'all 
Straight up menace... damn! 
Really...
Straight up menace... damn! 

I'm in too deep 
I done killed a motherfucker and I just can't sleep 
One-Time's tryin' to do a smooth, creep 
And on top of that 
Niggaz after me for fuckin' one of they hood rats 
I ain't got time for the fuckin' bitch's story 
Niggaz want me gotta come to my territory 
And ain't no "You Can Get the Fist"
Niggaz come, and they get done on they own risk 
What is it all about? 
Should I leave or should I stay cause I don't want to punk out 
Oh what should I do? The homies say 
"The hood's where it's good, homeboy, I thought you knew"
So in the process to show the hood my best 
No time to react, caught two in the chest 
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished 
I go out like a straight up menace, yeah 

Uh, come on y'all 
Straight up menace, damn! 
And on and on 
I guess we outta here 
Peace to my niggaz on the run 
And it ain't nuttin' but straight up menaces, damn!
Just like I said before y'all 
It ain't nuttin' but a Compton thang 
And MC Eiht's in the house for the 93 shot 
And this one's for the niggaz, yeah
