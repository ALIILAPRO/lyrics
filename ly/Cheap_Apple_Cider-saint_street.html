		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were in my dream again
You know I think that's a sign
And you said that you'd meet me there
So was I on your mind
Mmm
Mmm

Tell me what makes you smile and
What you like about the moon
Tell me if you like who you are because I do
I do
I do

If I reach my hand out will you grab it
To save me from falling off the planet
Coz baby you've got me forgetting all about gravity
You're just that pretty
Baby

I wanna see your face tonight
To stop me sitting here pretending that I feel alright
I wanna hold your hand and look at the stars
And talk about our lives in the back of your car
Mmm
Mmm

Lay down and let the lights wash over your face
The reds and yellows that hang around this place
It's getting colder, come a little closer
Feel time passing as we're getting older
Mmm
Mmm

If I reach my hand out will you grab it
To save me from falling off the planet
Coz baby you've got me forgetting all about gravity
You're just that pretty
Baby

She said "Get out of my head, I can't stop thinking about you" but
Her pretty face is a place my brain goes to
Can't help but smile when I'm sitting here beside her
She smells like cigarettes and cheap apple cider

If I reach my hand out will you grab it
To save me from falling off the planet
Coz baby you've got me forgetting all about gravity
I said reach your hand out so I can grab it
To save me from falling off the planet
Coz baby you've got me forgetting all about gravity
You're just that pretty
Baby
You're just that pretty
And you've got me
Baby
