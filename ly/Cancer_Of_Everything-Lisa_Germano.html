		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't settle down, I can't settle down
I won't cut it out, I won't quit
I'm not trying hard, I not getting well
I'm not improving, I won't do anything
This is a happy song
'Cause I want cancer of everything, yeah right
And if I fall down in a face of scars, I get attention
Cancer of everything
I won't? Up, I can't? Up
I must feel sick, I sure you do
I'm not trying hard, I'm not sleeping well
I'm not growing, I won't do anything

This isn't good for me
But you just wait and see how much attention I get
Oh, I got cancer of everything
It sure works for me
So this is a happy song
And nobody seems to care
And my shit is everywhere
Too much of this too much of that
Surround yourself with your?
Get some attention
And if fall down in a face of scars, well I don't know
You could leave me alone
I got cancer of everything
Yeah, I don't fell so good
