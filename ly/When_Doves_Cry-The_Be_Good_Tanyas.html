		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling? Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
See how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

Just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Well maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
And maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
