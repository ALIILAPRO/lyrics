		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do

So why didn't you stop me?
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over?

I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one

Where you look how I remember?
Look how I remember
Look how I remember paint it over
