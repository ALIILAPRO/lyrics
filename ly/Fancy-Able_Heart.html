		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm fancy
Ima put it all on display
I'm a trend setter
I be reinventing the wave
I'm fancy
Take a look
I'll show you the way
I got the laws of the universe
holdin the weight
I'm fancy
Put me up as one of the greats
Let it flow
all I had to do was leave it to fate
I'm fancy
I was put on earth to create
I'm feelin good right now
Yeah you know what they say
I'm fancy

Ain't tryna fool ya
I movin
Everybody lookin at me when i pull up
Everybody wanna know
just how I do it
I go and tell em what I know and keep movin
I'm rolling round with all the new money
When I pull out the cash it attract all the hunnys
We only live once gota run it
My head to my feet so clean I'm stunnin

720 mine now
I'm bumpin out da tech house
The doors they open way out
I'm paid now
I ain't ever had doubt
Only had to reroute
I had to block the noise
That shit played out
I had to put it up
It's anything but luck we did it on our own
No frontin
I did it for the love Now
I just live it up
I'll say it Once again
I'm stunnin
