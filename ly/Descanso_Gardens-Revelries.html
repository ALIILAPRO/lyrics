		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When our story started
We were nothing more than kids
In Descanso Gardens
Kissing for the thrill of it

I thought I saw the one when I looked at you
Tell me this was more than some rendezvous
I’m lying on the ground, I’m crawling
Look how far we’ve fallen
I’m looking for the pieces we left in 
Descanso Gardens

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Descanso Gardens
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Descanso Gardens

Your flight's departed 
Now the pain is sinking in
'Cause my lonely heart will
Forever feel you lingering

I thought I saw the one when I looked at you
Tell me this was more than some rendezvous
I’m lying on the ground, I’m crawling
Look how far we’ve fallen
I’m looking for the pieces we left in 
Descanso Gardens

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Descanso Gardens
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Descanso Gardens

I thought I saw the one when I looked at you
Tell me this was more than some rendezvous
I’m lying on the ground, I’m crawling
Look how far we’ve fallen
I’m looking for the pieces we left in 
Descanso Gardens

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Descanso Gardens
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Descanso Gardens

I thought I saw the one when I looked at you
Tell me this was more than some rendezvous
I’m lying on the ground, I’m crawling
Look how far we’ve fallen
I’m looking for the pieces we left in 
Descanso Gardens

Descanso Gardens
Descanso Gardens
