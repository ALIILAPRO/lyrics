		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
You're gonna lose your soul, tonight
You're gonna lose your soul
You're gonna lose your soul tonight, tonight

Oh
You're gonna lose control, tonight
You're gonna lose control
You're gonna lose control tonight, tonight, tonight

I get up in the morning
To the beat of the drum
I get up to this feeling
Keeps me on the run
I get up in the morning
Put my dreams away
I get up, I get up, I get up again

Oh
You're gonna lose your soul, tonight
You're gonna lose your soul
You're gonna lose your soul tonight, tonight

Oh
You're gonna lose control, tonight
You're gonna lose control
You're gonna lose control
Tonight, tonight, tonight

I get up in the morning
To the beat of the drum
I get up to this feeling
Keeps me on the run
I get up in the morning
Put my dreams away
I get up, I get up, I get up again

I get up in the morning
To the beat of the drum
I get up to this feeling
Keeps me on the run
I get up in the morning
Put my dreams away
I get up, I get up, I get up again

Oh
You're gonna lose your soul, tonight
You're gonna lose your soul
You're gonna lose your soul tonight, tonight

(I get up in the morning
To the beat of the drum
I get up to this feeling
Keeps me on the run
I get up in the morning
Put my dreams away
I get up, I get up, I get up again
I get up)
