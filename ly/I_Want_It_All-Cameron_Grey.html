		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I give her that vibe she can't get nowhere else
Cigarettes in the air, she touchin' herself
Glass walls, top floor of the hotel
Reoccurring dream that we both fell
Me and her cool if we chillin' in hell
Fixin' to fuck her, she fixin' to yell

I wanna feel you, I want it all
I wanna feel you, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all
I wanna feel you, I want it all
I wanna feel you, I want it all (yeah)

I give her that vibe she can't get nowhere else
Cigarettes in the air, she touchin' herself
Glass walls, penthouse in the hotel
Reoccurring dream that we both fell
Me and her cool if we chillin' in hell
She in chinchilla and love white like cartel
Rippin' her fur and she feelin me swell
Fixin' to fuck her, she fixin 'to yell
Fuck her like I just got outta the cell
Both love the powder, no powder for sale
Tony Montana, the power for sale
Givenchi tux, I'ma cum on her veil
She's high maintenance, got no patience
Girl, get naked, this is X-Rated

Baby, I wanna touch you, I wanna breathe into your well
See, I gotta haunt you, I gotta bring you to my hell
Baby, I wanna fuck you, I wanna feel you in my bones
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna tear into your soul
I'm gonna fuck you

I wanna feel you, I want it all
I wanna feel you, I want it all (yeah, yeah)

I think she wants it worse than I do
Got her wetter than Kauai do
Got her wetter than a hurricane on the bayou
Got me thinkin' 'bout maybe sayin' I do
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
When I'm inside you, baby, I'm gone
Got her hands on the wall
Rain runnin' down glass
Heard her say
Baby, I wanna fuck you

I hear ya girl, I know it's true
I feel the tension, it's overdue
Let's do what we came to do
Let's do what we came to do
I ain't here to play games with you
No, I ain't here to play games

Homicide, she killin' me, so good, she might be billin' me
Mirrors on the ceilin', see, we should prolly film it
Homicide, she killin' me, so good, she might be billin' me
Mirrors on the ceilin', see, We should prolly film it, uh
