		  (These, eyes, only, we gon' see)
(These, eyes, only, we gon' see)

Yeah, what goes up originally comes down
Let the dollars levitate as the world goes 'round from the ground 
Keep fallin' up (keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up fallin' up)
Eyes fall up on the ceiling so high (envy)
Can't feel it 'less I put my hand on it like the killer did my money
Keep fallin' up (keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up (fallin' up)

Now that I got my shit together, better than ever
These motherfuckers habitual line steppers
Make a nigga wanna write a Dear John letter
Mh, make her disappear, had to get the Penn & Teller
A best seller, interstellar, good fella
This a long kiss goodnight, ciao, bella
My Air Force 1s steppin' on that Air Force One
Leavin' fuckin' footprints on the sun
Thirty-six shots and I only just begun
One man band soundin' like a hundred drums
Make that ass clap back, rum-pum-pum-pum
Give it to me raw, that shimmy-shimmy, all that
Brand new Ford Mach, this is what you call that
You don't see that caution tape? Nigga better fall back, heh
I got Hov on the line, I gotta call back
Life's a bitch, and I'm takin' off the bra strap

Well, they don't make real niggas like (these)
Gon' with it, bitch, you could see it in my (eyes)
Post somethin' for them real motherfuckers (only)
Oh, you a boss in this motherfucker? (We gon' see)
No, they don't make 'em like (these)
Envy is a motherfucker, see it in they (eyes)
Private invitation, this is members (only)
Fuck what you thought, niggas love to talk (we gon' see)

What goes up originally comes down
Let the dollars levitate as the world goes 'round from the ground 
Keep fallin' up (keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up (fallin' up)
Eyes fall up on the ceiling so high (envy)
Can't feel it 'less I put my hand on it like the killer did my money
Keep fallin' up (keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up (fallin' up)

I hit you with no delayin', so what you sayin', yo?
Last nigga that tried to play me was on the radio
Hear we go, lot of my career, built off dope
Got everybody rollin' The Chronic, tryin' to smoke
Okay, fuck it, get high, trendset', deny
Niggas swear they could compete, shit, I just sit by
Put a bunch of motherfucking Crips on the red-eye
Pay to get that ass removed, now that's a goodbye
Allow me to reintroduce myself
It's that same nigga from the hard city, who else?
Ha, live at the barbecue, genuine article
I'm fuckin' diabolical, you better call a audible
I swarm with the killer bees, yeah, it's time to bring that pain
Shame on the nigga playin' old dirty games
Shoutout to Long Beach, they goin' insane
Dollar signs is the set I claim

Well, they don't make real niggas like (these)
Gon' with it, bitch, you could see it in my (eyes)
Post somethin' for them real motherfuckers (only)
Oh, you a boss in this motherfucker? (We gon' see)
No, they don't make 'em like (these)
Envy is a motherfucker, see it in they (eyes)
Private invitation, this is members (only)
Fuck what you thought, niggas love to talk (we gon' see)

These, eyes, only, we gon' see
