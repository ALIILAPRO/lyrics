		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you call out loud
Will it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
So give yourself
A chance

'cause you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And, little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground

Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself no matter what it's gon' take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith

gon' keep it brother
You got it
And when you think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of when you're all alone
And you can go by feel
'stead of circumstance
But the power's in beliving
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you only try

So keep the faith, ow
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

I told my brother how to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride
Go for what you want, don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner,
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it brother
You got it
I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has
To make it right
Makes it
Makes it right

Keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
Keep the faith
Baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Better stand up and act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith
Look at yourself and what you're doin' right now
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together, 'cause you got to keep the faith
Uh, uh, uh

Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Lift up your mind
Before your mind gets blown
Some things in life you best just leave them alone
Go for what you want
Don't let it get in your way
You can make it happen
But ya got ta keep the faith

Gon' keep it brother
You got to keep the faith
Yeah keep the faith
Gon' keep it sister
You got to keep the faith now, now

I'll show my brotha
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner if you keep the faith

Straighten out yourself and get your mind on track
Dust off your butt and get your self-respect back
You've known me long enough to know that I don't play
Take it like you want it but you got to keep the faith
Gon'

Don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And get your feet back on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

But till that day
I said you've got to keep the faith!
