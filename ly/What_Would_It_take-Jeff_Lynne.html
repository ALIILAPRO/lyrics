		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember what you told me 
That you would always be there 
If you change your mind now 

Oh, what would it take to save me 
What would it take to save me now 

Here comes another night 
And all the stars are shining 
Could I make it right 

Whoa, what would it take to save me 
What would it take to save me now 

Oh, What would it take 
Woo, What would it take 
To save me 

What would it take to save me 
What would it take to save me now 

Oh, What would it take 
Woo, What would it take 
To save me 

Of all the things I do 
And everywhere they take me 
You know what I go through 

What would it take to save me 
What would it take to save me now 

What would it take to save me 
What would it take to save me now
