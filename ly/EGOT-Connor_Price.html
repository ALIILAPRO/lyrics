		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to call this a hobby but now all the hours I put it it's more of a job
I'm never calling in sick or be thinking of packing my stuff up when its four o clock
Stay independent I don't want a label they calling me up but I don't want a boss
Until my catalog making six figures a month off of streaming, I don't wanna stop
I'm not gonna stop, yeah, look
I got a flow for every occasion
I got some goals I'm steadily chasing
I got some foes like Freddie and Jason, woah
Quit acting like everybody's in love with you
Like there's only one of you
Buddy I promise you I seen a couple you's
And I ain't talking W's
I got some friends who talking that trash all behind my back they saying I suck
They the same ones who in my dm's, they showing me love, can't make this stuff up
That's why I'm paying no mind to things that they all gotta say when I'm dropping
I do not know anybody who's winning who's taking the time to leave negative comments
I'm in control, just show me the ropes, I know how to steer
I keep it quiet, I don't hear the laughs, I don't hear the hate, I don't hear the cheers
Don't need to smoke, I don't need to drink, but do what you do, whatever you feel
Switching it up, I do what I want, they hearing the beat but this not a drill
No this not a- woah
Used to hang around with some kids who had no goals
Didn't ever wanna grow old
We stayed still never showed growth
Feeling like I'm on a stone road with a row boat, had no hope
So now a days when they see me, tell me that I've changed, I just say I hope so
Took a detour, had to see more
Missed the opportunity knocking, now it's c4 on these doors
Blowing up and I ain't ever knocking
Going up I and I ain't ever stopping
Growing up I always knew that I was meant to be something
I leave nothing on the table now no second options
Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony, yes you know that I need those
I know I probably sound a little cocky when I'm saying that I can reach those
I been hot since ninety-seven, thats word to the man Ebro
What I'm trying to say is you can't spell egot without a little ego
No tension on cloud nine
I ate beats since seventh grade
In the six they be giving high fives
They can't reach when I levitate
Got foresight from my third eye
No second place I already won, and they know it now
You should check your numbers cause they going down
Nah wait, hold up I ain't done with it
Brand new flows no dust in it
Five foot seven might dunk with it, like what physics
Ball hog and and I run with it
No cold feet, just jump in it
I'm all in no bluffing it
My words cursed no cuss in it
My first words was come get it
I'm in control, just show me the ropes, I know how to steer
I keep it quiet, I don't hear the laughs, I don't hear the hate, I don't hear the cheers
Don't need to smoke, I don't need to drink, but do what you do, whatever you feel
Switching it up, I do what I want, they hearing the beat but this not a drill
No this not a- woah
