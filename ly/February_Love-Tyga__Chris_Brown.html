		<p>
		  Shoot it, aim, cock back (D.A got that)
Shoot it, aim, cock back
Shoot it, aim, cock back
Shoot it, aim

My baby, how you fine
You give me a vibe, oh yeah (Shoot it, aim, cock back)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
That's why I need you in my life
Do your body right, yeah
This that love that make you feel like
Girl, that vibe that make you feel right
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
You a star, you're my universe
Girl, you're so down to earth

February love (Love), you be my valentine ('Tine)
I showed you to the world (World), I put it on the line (Line), yeah
Mister Fallback, too busy with my life
You got me thinkin' marriage, I'm talkin' kids and wife
You want that settled life (Life), I'm on that road life
Different city every night, slowin' down ain't the vibe
And you try, you fly to come and see the boy
Wanna spend time, I know you finna get annoyed
Ooh, baby, lay back, panties on my bedspread
And I know how your body works, let me lick that
Got that fire, got that fire, let me lick that
Shoot it, aim, cock back, maybe let me bust that

My baby, how you fine
You give me a vibe, oh yeah (Shoot it, aim, cock back)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
That's why I need you in my life
Do your body right, yeah
This that love that make you feel like
Girl, that vibe that make you feel right
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
You a star, you're my universe
Girl, you're so down to earth
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
This that love that make you feel like
Girl, that vibe that make you feel right
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
You a star, you're my universe
Girl, you're so down to earth

You know I got your back
They front, I'm on they neck
My girl need her respect
Expect nothin' less
More, less, I need my check
So add a couple commas
They can't judge me, your honor
I found out you love me (Love me)
Wanna kiss me (Kiss me), in public (public)
Wanna lock me down, wanna use me (Use me)
Wanna tease me (Tease me), like it used to be (Used to be)
But I ain't havin' that, you so bad with that
Pick up my call, you like, "Roger that"
P-Prada bag (Prada bag), G-Gucci bag (Gucci bag)
Uh, the Fendi, Hermes, you get all of that (All of that)
I take my time with you (With you)
Give me all of you (All of you)
You could take my heart with you, I'm all for you

My baby, how you fine
You give me a vibe, oh yeah (Shoot it, aim, cock back)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
That's why I need you in my life
Do your body right, yeah
This that love that make you feel like
Girl, that vibe that make you feel right
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
You a star, you're my universe
Girl, you're so down to earth
My baby, how you fine
You give me a vibe, oh yeah (Shoot it, aim, cock back)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
That's why I need you in my life
Do your body right, yeah
This that love that make you feel like
Girl, that vibe that make you feel right
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
(Shoot it, aim, cock back)
You a star, you're my universe
Girl, you're so down to earth

Shoot it, aim, cock back
Shoot it, aim, cock back
Shoot it, aim, cock back
Shoot it, aim, cock back
