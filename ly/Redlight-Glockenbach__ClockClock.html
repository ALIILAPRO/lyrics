		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pull up to the red light, late night
Saw you in the backseat of the car
I saw into your red eyes, your red eyes
You've been lookin' at me from afar

Imagine what you do to me, do to me, babe
I didn't make a move, now you drive me insane
Imagine what you do to me, do to me, babe
I didn't make a move, now you drive me insane

I pull up to the red light, late night
Saw you in the backseat of the car
I saw into your red eyes, your red eyes
You've been lookin' at me from afar
I pull up to the red light, red light
(Red light, red light)
I saw into your red eyes, red eyes
(Red eyes, red eyes)

I was out for a ride, out in the break of a day
I was on my mind, drivin' about to forget
Let it go for a while, let it go for a night again
Just a moment before I was fallin' off the edge

I pull up to the red light, late night
Saw you in the backseat of the car
I saw into your red eyes, your red eyes
You've been lookin' at me from afar

Imagine what you do to me, do to me, babe
I didn't make a move, now you drive me insane
Imagine what you do to me, do to me, babe
I didn't make a move, now you drive me insane

A moment can change your life
I tried my best not to smile
I'm stuck in the traffic with you
I gaze in your eyes and you gaze in mine

A moment can change your life
Two people cross and collide
We just met out of the blue
I gaze in your eyes and you gaze in mine

I pull up to the red light, late night
Saw you in the backseat of the car
I saw into your red eyes, your red eyes
You've been lookin' at me from afar

Imagine what you do to me, do to me, babe
I didn't make a move, now you drive me insane
Imagine what you do to me, do to me, babe
I didn't make a move, now you drive me insane
