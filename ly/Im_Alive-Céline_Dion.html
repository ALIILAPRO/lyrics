		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get wings to fly
Oh-oh, I'm alive, yeah

When you call on me
When I hear you breath
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive

When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive

When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive

You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman on clouds above, yeah

I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
'Cause I'm alive, oh

(When you call on me)
When you call on me
(When I hear you breath)
When I hear you breath
(I get wings to fly)
I feel that I'm alive
I am alive

(When you reach for me)
When you reach for me
(Raising spirits high)
God knows that

That I'll be the one
Standing by
Through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life

(When you call on me)
When you call on me
(When you reach for me)
When you reach for me
(I get wings to fly)
(I feel that)

(When you bless the day)
When you bless, you bless the day
(I just drift away)
I just drift away
(All my worries die)
I know that I'm alive, yeah

I get wings to fly 
God knows that I'm alive
