		  I'm in my head again, but it's fine (it's fine, yeah)
Caught myself falling hard, it's a sign (this time)
This time (this time)
I like to think of you as mine (mine, mine) (mine, mine, yeah, yeah)
I called you back again, but it's fine (it's fine)
It's fine (it's fine)

We can go if you'd like to
I can't go without you
We can go if you'd like to
I can't go without you

I've been running in circles
You're bruising up my heart, and
I wanna show you
I'll say it like
Please stay 'cause I really want you to want me
You say, "Okay, I really want you to want me"

Found you in my head again, but it's fine (it's fine, yeah)
I'll leave it up to you this time (this time)
It's fine but (this time, this time, yeah)

We can go if you'd like to
I can't go without you (yeah, yeah)
We can go if you'd like to
I can't go without you (it's fine, it's fine, it's fine)

I've been running in circles
You're bruising up my heart, and
I wanna show you
I'll say it like
Please stay 'cause I really want you to want me
You say, "Okay, I really want you to want me"

I've been running in circles
You're bruising up my heart, and
I wanna show you
I'll say it like
Please stay 'cause I really want you to want me
You say, "Okay, I really want you to want me"

Yeah
I want you too
I want you too
I want you too
I want you too

I've been running in circles
You're bruising up my heart, and
I wanna show you
I'll say it like
Please stay 'cause I really want you to want me
You say, "Okay, I really want you to want me"

I've been running in circles
You're bruising up my heart, and
I wanna show you
I'll say it like
Please stay 'cause I really want you to want me
You say, "Okay, I really want you to want me" (yeah)

Pick it up fast, you can waste my time
And I'll be much better if you call my line
Pick it up fast, you can waste my time
And I'll be much better if you call my line
