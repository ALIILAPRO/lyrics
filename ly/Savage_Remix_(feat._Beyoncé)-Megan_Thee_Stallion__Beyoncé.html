		  Queen B, want no smoke with me (okay)
Then turn this motherfucker up eight hundred degree (yeah)
My whole team eat, chef's kiss, she's a treat (mwah)
Ooh, she so bougie, bougie, bon appetit

I'm a savage, attitude nasty (yeah, yeah)
Talk big shit but my bank account matchin'
Hood, but I'm classy, rich but I'm ratchet
Haters kept my name in they mouth, now they gaggin', ah, ah
Bougie, he say the way that thang move it's a movie
I told lil' bro we gotta keep it low, leave me the room key
I done bled the block and now it's hot, bitch, I'm Tunechi
A mood and I'm moody (ah)

I'm a savage (okay)
Classy, bougie, ratchet (okay)
Sassy, moody, nasty (hey, hey, yeah, nasty)
Acting stupid, what's happening? (Woah, woah)
Bitch, what's happening? (Woah, woah)
Bitch, I'm a savage, yeah (okay)
Classy, bougie, ratchet, yeah (okay)
Sassy, moody, nasty, huh
Acting stupid, what's happening?
Bitch, what's happening? (Ay, ah)

Hips tik tok when I dance
On that Demon Time, she might start an OnlyFans (OnlyFans)
Big B and that B stands for bands
If you wanna see some real ass, baby, here's your chance
As I say, left cheek, right cheek, drop it low, then swang (swang)
Texas up in this thang (thang)
Put you up on this game (game)
Ivy Park on my frame (frame)
Gang, gang, gang (gang)
If you don't jump to put jeans on, baby, you don't feel my pain (hol' up)
Please don't get me hyped (I'm hyped), write my name in ice (ice, ice, ice)
Can't argue with the lazy bitches, I just raised my price
I'm a boss, I'm a leader, I pull up in my two-seater
And my momma was a savage, nigga, got this shit from Tina

I'm a savage (yeah)
Classy, bougie, ratchet (ratchet)
Sassy, moody, nasty (okay)
Acting stupid, what's happening? (Wassup?)
Bitch, what's happening? (Wassup?)
Bitch, I'm a savage, yeah
Classy, bougie, ratchet, yeah (okay)
Sassy, moody, nasty, huh (okay)
Acting stupid, what's happening?
Bitch, what's happening? (Ay, ah)
 
Like Beyoncé, like me (like me)
He want a bitch like the Stallion with the knees (with the knees)
He be like, "Damn, how that thang movin' in them jeans?", Ay (them jeans)
Even D4L couldn't do it like me, like me

Oh, ooh
I done got this body ready just for you
Girl, I hope he don't catch me messin' 'round with you
Talkin' to myself in the mirror like, "Bitch, you my boo"

I'm the shit, ooh
I need a mop to clean the floor
It's too much drip, ooh
I keep a knot, I keep a watch
I keep a whip, ooh
Let's play a game, Simon says 
I'm still that bitch, ay (still that bitch)
I'm still that bitch, yeah (ah)

I'm a savage (okay)
Classy, bougie, ratchet (okay)
Sassy, moody, nasty (yeah)
Acting stupid, what's happening? (Wassup?)
Bitch, what's happening? (Wassup?)
Bitch, I'm a savage, yeah (okay)
Classy, bougie, ratchet, yeah (okay)
Sassy, moody, nasty, huh
Acting stupid, what's happening?
Bitch, what's happening? (Ay, ah)
 
I heard they askin' for the Queen, they brought some cameras in here
I'm a bad bitch, she's a savage, no comparisons here
I'ma flip my hair and look back while I twerk in the mirror
All this money in the room, think some scammers in here
I'm comin' straight up out out that third, ah
Whipped the whip like I stirred it
Woodgrain, we swervin', keepin' his mind on all on these curves
Coupe fly like a bird, cold on 'em like, "Burr"
Always keep my word, no I don't do crossword
Stallion when I'm riding, like them hot girls, them hips, uh
I hopped that shit, the way I hopped out and slid, uh
I pop my shit, now watch me pop up again, uh
I mop the floor, now watch me sweep up these M's, uh

I'm a savage, yeah (savage)
Classy, bougie, ratchet (okay)
Sassy, moody, nasty (ugh)
Acting stupid, what's happening? (Wassup?)
Bitch, what's happening? (Wassup?)
Bitch, I'm a savage, yeah
Classy, bougie, ratchet (okay)
Sassy, moody, nasty, yeah (nasty)
Acting stupid, what's happening? (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Bitch, what's happening? (What's happenin'? What's happenin'?)

I'm a savage
It's the Stallion and the B
H-town, goin' down
