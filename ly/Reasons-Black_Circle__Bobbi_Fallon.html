		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It’s over now
It’s the end
Racing against
Thoughts in my head

One thing I know I’ll miss
Is how you took care of me in this

The reason that I walked away
The reason that I want to stay
The reason that we found some peace
The reason that we broke to pieces

If only I had known before all
The things that I know today boy
I wish I could turn the time back
There’s so much that I want to say now

The reason that I never call
The reason that I gave it all
The reason that I needed more
The reason that we broke our promise

If only I had known before all
The things that I know today boy
I wish I could turn the time back
There’s so much that I want to say now

So much that I want to say now
So much that I want to say now

Sometimes I wish you would take
Your own advice for gods sake
It’s always one step forwards
Two steps back
I love you but I won’t do that

The reason that I walked away
The reason that I want to stay
The reason that we found some peace
The reason that we broke to pieces

If only I had known before all
The things that I know today boy
I wish I could turn the time back
There’s so much that I want to say now

The reason that I never call
The reason that I gave it all
The reason that I needed more
The reason that we broke our promise

If only I had known before all
The things that I know today boy
I wish I could turn the time back
There’s so much that I want to say now
