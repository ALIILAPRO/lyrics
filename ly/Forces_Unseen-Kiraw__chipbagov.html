		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So much talk
But his words are just cap bitch
Move on my own
'Cause I don't need no fake shit
Bend her over
Now come give me brain bitch
Too much coke
My brain's going apeshit
Too much rage in my heart
I'm a mess
Fuck with my fam
Put my blade through your chest
Let's brawl lil bitch
I'm the wrong one to test
Making so much money
That I ever need to rest
Hope that you wanna fight
Bitch you don't know my way
Walk in this bitch like a god
Finna ruin his day
Up all night
My blade make a pussy pray
Show him god
He thought that I fucking play
No lean in my double cup
Xans in my Hennessy
Lurk in the dark he scared
Yeah you better be
Flow so good
I'm feeling your jealousy
You watch how I move
'Cause I'm part of your fantasys
All these bitches
Want to fuck me bad
I don't want them though
I'm busy stacking
All of my bread
Too much money bro
So much talk
But his words are just cap bitch
Move on my own
'Cause I don't need no fake shit
Bend her over
Now come give me brain bitch
Too much coke
My brain's going apeshit
Too much rage in my heart
I'm a mess
Fuck with my fam
Put my blade through your chest
Let's brawl lil bitch
I'm the wrong one to test
Making so much money
That I ever need to rest
