		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's falling in love right now

Take me with your eyes
Hold me like we're out of time
Drink me like the cheapest wine
And disappear in a day

I'm not going for the win
And I don't need to know where you've been
Ooh, 'cause what's happening is clandestine and amazing

No more waiting
I'm just saying
So amazing

Oh, oh
Everybody's falling in love right now
Oh, oh
Everybody's falling in love right now
Everybody's falling, everybody's falling
Everybody's falling in love right now
Everybody's falling, never saw it coming
Everybody's falling in love right now

What's your rising sign?
John, Paul, George or can't decide?
No, don't tell me nevermind
I wanna be surprised
Yeah, you know it's not that deep
Casual, no casualties
Just a little company
Can get you through this life

No more waiting
I'm just saying
So amazing

Oh, oh
Everybody's falling in love right now
Oh, oh
Everybody's falling in love right now
Everybody's falling, everybody's falling
Everybody's falling in love right now
Chasing down the moment, never saw it coming
Everybody's falling in love right now

Te amo, just enough, so you know
Just a touch of a heart I can hold
Te amo, just enough so let go
Everybody's falling in love
All I wanna know is your love
(Everybody's falling in love right now)

Oh, oh
Everybody's falling in love right now
Oh, oh
Everybody's falling in love right now
Everybody's falling, everybody's falling
Everybody's falling in love right now
Chasing down the moment, never saw it coming
Everybody's falling in love right now
