		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby you're perfect for me
You are my gift from heaven
This is the greatest story of all times
We met like in a movie
So meant to last forever
And what you're doing to me
Feels so fine

Angel, I wake up
And live my dreams
Endlessly
Crazy for you

Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beats going Düm Tek Tek
Always out it like there's no limit
Feels like there's no way back
Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beat's going Düm Tek Tek
Always out it like there's no limit
Feels like there's no way back

Baby I read all answers
In your exotic movements
You are the greatest dancer of all times
You make me feel so special
No one can kiss like you do
As if it's your profession
Feel so fine

Angel I wake up and live my dreams
Endlessly
Crazy for you

Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beats going Düm Tek Tek
Always out it like there's no limit
Feels like there's no way back
Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beats going Düm Tek Tek
Always out it like there's no limit
Feels like there's no way back

Can you feel the rhythm in my heart

Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beats going Düm Tek Tek
Always out it like there's no limit
Feels like there's no way back
Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
The beats going Düm Tek Tek
Always out it like there's no limit
Feels like there's no way back

Always out it like it no minute
Feels like there's no way back
Always out it like there's no limit
Feels like Düm Tek Tek
