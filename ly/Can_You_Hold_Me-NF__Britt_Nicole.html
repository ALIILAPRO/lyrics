		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels like a tear in my heart
Like a part of me missing
And I just can't feel it
I've tried and I've tried
And I've tried

Tears on my face I can't take it
If lonely is a taste then it's all that I'm tasting
Do you hear my cry?
I cry, oh

Can you hold me? 
Can you hold me? 
Can you hold me in your arms?

Just wrap me in your arms, in your arms
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Take me from the dark, from the dark
I ain't gonna make it myself
Put your arms around me 
Put your arms around me 
Let your love surround me
I am lost
I am lost

If I ain't got you here
If I ain't got you, I ain't got nothing at all

Can you hold me? 
Can you hold me? 
Can you hold me in your arms?

In your arms? (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I feel like it's just me, feel like it's just me
What it gon' take? What it gon' be?
I don't even know (it's not just you)
But I'm lonely
Feeling like I don't even know me, I don't even know me
(I feel it too) Gotta have you gotta see you
(Yeah the only thing I have to think about
The only one I that can't live without) I see you
(I need you to hold me now)

If I ain't got you 
If I ain't got you 
I ain't got nothing 
I ain't got nothing 
If I ain't got you
I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
I'm lonely
If I ain't with you I'm lonely
I'm lonely
I need you
I need you

Can you hold me? 
Can you hold me in your arms?

Feel like it's just me, like it's just me
What it gon' take? 
What it gon' be?
I don't even know, I don't even know
But I'm lonely, lonely
Feel like I don't even know me
Feels like I don't even know me
I don't even know me

(Can you hold me in your arms?)
