		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Rockin with me

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Rockin with me


Told you I could never stay
if you hesitated
Only one side passing blame
And I tolerate it


Keep waiting all day
Say where do you go?
You try to restrain
Just like I don’t know


How to play it your way
Let’s go back & forth
Until my soul gives into you 


You, you, you
Until my soul gives into you


Keep waiting all day (yeah)
Say where do you go? 
You try to restrain (oh yeah)
Just like I don’t know


How to play it your way (I can play it your play)
Let’s go back & forth (let’s go back, let’s go back)
Until my soul, until my soul, until my soul gives into you 


Until my soul gives into you
Ooh


So, say what’s on your mind
Hopelessly entwined
Up in your lies now 
Falling behind now


Keep waiting all day
Say where do you go?
You try to restrain
Just like I don’t know


How to play it your way
Let’s go back & forth
Until my soul gives into you 


You, you, you
Until my soul gives into you


Until my soul gives into you 
You, you, you (let’s go back, let’s go back)
Until my soul gives into you


Until my soul gives into you
