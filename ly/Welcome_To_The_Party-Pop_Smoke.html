		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a Melo beat

Baby, welcome to the party
I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean
That's why I'm movin' retarded
(That's why I'm movin' retarded)
Baby, welcome to the party, uh
I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari
Baby, welcome to the party
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit (get me lit)
Gun on my hip (gun on my hip)
One in the head (one in the head)
Ten in the clip (ten in the clip)
Baby, baby, don't trip
Just lower your tone (lower your tone)
'Cause you could get hit

Don't let that Henny in my system (nah)
I catch a body, next day I forget it (next day I forget it)
Nigga, Dread just caught a body (nigga, Dread just caught a body)
And that's on the gang, nigga, I was just with him, look
Free all my 'rilla niggas, all my villain niggas
All my killer niggas out the cage
Since a youngin' nigga, I been drillin' niggas
Ma, I'm sorry I'm stuck up in my ways
Ain't nobody ever gave me shit
With this big chip, I had to get paid
And it's 10K to go on stage
And you know the treesh gettin' laid

Baby, welcome to the party
I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean
That's why I'm movin' retarded
(That's why I'm movin' retarded)
Baby, welcome to the party, uh
I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari
Baby, welcome to the party
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit (get me lit)
Gun on my hip (gun on my hip)
One in the head (one in the head)
Ten in the clip (ten in the clip)
Baby, baby, don't trip
Just lower your tone (lower your tone)
'Cause you could get hit

It's Big 092MLBOA (uh), I make a call and it's war
I bet I kick down the door, I bet I send him to the Lord, uh
Got a bad bitch from overseas
Got a 10 pack up in my jeans, I'm in Manhattan in these stores, uh
Don't try and run up on my V
I knock a nigga out his sneaks while I'm shellin' down his V, uh
Double G for the tee
No Alicia, I got keys, don't get your car Swiss cheese
Neno cooler than a cooler, he still an ooter, he don't settle for nothing, uh
Bluffin', pussy boy, stop all that bluffin'
.380 hold a ruler, I know some niggas that'll shoot you for nothing
Run, Ricky, yeah, he runnin'
Run, Ricky, yeah, he runnin'

Baby, welcome to the party
I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean
That's why I'm movin' retarded
(That's why I'm movin' retarded)
Baby, welcome to the party, uh
I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari
Baby, welcome to the party
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit (get me lit)
Gun on my hip (gun on my hip)
One in the head (one in the head)
Ten in the clip (ten in the clip)
Baby, baby, don't trip
Just lower your tone (lower your tone)
'Cause you could get hit
