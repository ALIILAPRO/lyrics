		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I got a smile on my face
Sometimes I guess that I've gotta fake it
'Cause honesty is so out of place
And everyone's afraid to be naked
I don't know how much more I can take
Yeah, I'm broken into so many pieces
Would be easy just to throw them away
But I don't wanna give up on feeling

'Cause now that I'm shattered, I'm all kinds of me
Was knocked off the shelf, but I'm also complete
I'm under the weather with no place to be
But maybe that's just what I need (Kintsugi)

Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue, me back together (oh)
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me (Kintsugi)
I'm broken, b-b-broken 
But I'm ready to feel better (better)
Glue me back together 
Glue, glue, glue me (Kintsugi)

All my scars are golden
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me back together
(Yeah) all my scars are golden
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me (Kintsugi)

My life will be a map you can trace
Every little part of the story
Make it beautiful and golden with grace
But keep a little stain to remind me

That even when I mess up, that mess is still me
Was knocked off the shelf, but I'm also complete
I'm under the weather with no place to be
But maybe that's just what I need (Kintsugi)

Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me back together (oh)
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me (Kintsugi)
I'm broken, b-b-broken
But I'm ready to feel better (better)
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me (Kintsugi)

All my scars are golden
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me back together
(Yeah) all my scars are golden
Glue me back together 
Glue, glue, glue me back together

(Ah, all my scars are golden)
I'm under the weather with no place to be
But maybe that's just what I need (Kintsugi)

Glue me back together 
Glue, glue, glue me back together (oh)
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me (Kintsugi)
I'm broken, b-b-broken 
But I'm ready to feel better (better)
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me (Kintsugi)

All my scars are golden
Glue me back together 
Glue, glue, glue me back together (oh, yeah, yeah yeah)
All my scars are golden
Glue me back together
Glue, glue, glue me (oh, yeah, yeah yeah, kintsugi)

(Nobody need you ?)
All my scars are golden 
(Nobody need you ?)
Kintsugi
