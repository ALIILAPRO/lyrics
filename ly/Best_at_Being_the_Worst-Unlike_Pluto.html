		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the best at being the worst
You are the best at being the worst
With a little bit of love and a little more hate
It always hurts to say
You are the best at being the worst

You seem so amazing (flashing lights)
Always paraphrasing (it's do or die)
It took time to see
The birds eye view of your maze
It took time to leave
It's hard to part when you're part of me
So I say

You are the best at being the worst
You are the best at being the worst
With a little bit of love and a little more hate
It always hurts to say
You are the best at being the worst

Heart beat, heart beat
Throbbing when you hurt me
Retreat, retreat
Run from the anomaly
Toxic intentions
Ooh, the reality is

It took time to see
The birds eye view of your maze
It took time to leave
It's hard to part when you're part of me
So I say

You are the best at being the worst
You are the best at being the worst
With a little bit of love and a little more hate
It always hurts to say
You are the best at being the worst

The way you make me feel is so twisted
The way you make me feel is so twisted
Every moment of happiness
Was an orchestrated play
You made me feel so twisted, ooh
So I say

You are the best at being the worst
You are the best at being the worst
With a little bit of love and a little more hate
It always hurts to say
You are the best at being the worst
