		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tina was no deceiver
Few were inclined to believe her
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
She was lucky to marry
A rich rich man handsome like Harry
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Harry was a charmer
No one believed he could harm her
Aba Tina oh (oh, Aba Tina), who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina oh (oh, Aba Tina), who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, Aba Tina, Aba Tina, Aba Tina

The wedding was the talk of the town
The girl gone down in a long long white gown
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Said she wanted to marry above her
All she want was someone to love her
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
News came first, they called her a liar
Had no sound, mouth full of wire
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, Aba Tina, Aba Tina, Aba Tina

In the end Tina was buried
By the church where she got married
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Tina should have outlived us
Now we pray that she will forgive us
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Tina was no deceiver
Few were inclined to believe her
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina oh, who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, Aba Tina, Aba Tina, Aba Tina
Aba Tina, Aba Tina, Aba Tina
