		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Propaganda war ensemble
Burial to be
Bones shining by the night
In blood laced misery

Campaign of elimination
Twisted psychology
When victory is to survive
And death is defeat

Infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds

Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph
The numbers that are dead

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When the end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
How many people I can kill?

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When the end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
How many people I can kill?

Be dead friend from above
When darkness falls
Descend into my sights
Your fallen walls

Spearhead break through the lines
Flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition
Forward their ground

Regime prophetic age
Old in it's time
Flowing veins run on through
Deep in the Rhine

Center of the web
All battles scored
What is our war crimes
Era forever more, war

Propaganda war ensemble
Burial to be
Bones shining by the night
In blood laced misery

Campaign of elimination
Twisted psychology
When victory is to survive
And death is defeat

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When the end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
How many people I can kill?
