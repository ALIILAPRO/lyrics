		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reason never seems to come to guilty men
Things that meant so much mean nothing in the end
Their function is dysfunction and to hide the truth
Distracted by their faith, ignoring every proof

A bicycle, a garden wall
A mother's call, a love is born
And after all, the sleep that falls on me

In this city there are these who'd live alone
Twilight brings them from the gloom into our homes
And hiding there among the wreckage left behind
They see things that haunt them when they close their eyes

Come back if you want to
And remember who you are
'Cause there's nothing here for you my dear
And everything must pass

When the world doesn't want you
It will never tell you why
You can shut the door but you can't ignore
The crawl of your decline

Come back if you want to (child, come, child, come)
(Child, come, child, come)
Come back if you want to (child, come, child, come)
Come back (child, come, child, come)

A bicycle, a garden wall
A mother's call, a love is born
And after all, the sleep that falls on me
