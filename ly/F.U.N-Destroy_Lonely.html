		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm with my bro and we smokin' dope
I'm with my bro and he pour me up
I'm with this bit and she cool as fuck
I'm in this bit I'm just coolin' bruh
And my fists is filled with colors bruh
Yes, I'm fly for real, somethin' like doves
And I make sure my bitches feel all my love
And this dope my best friend, I'm kickin' shit with my bud
Damn, I'm so high I see different colors
Yes, I'm shoppin', I'm thinkin' bout different colors
No, I don't love these bitches, let 'em fuck my brother
I think I'm goin' crazy, all I see is numbers
Yeah, at the bank finna make a withdrawal
I got her wet now she droppin' her drawls
I'm on the top floor, can't receive a call
Lil' bitch I'm on a heist, this money get it all
And this window so big, see the stars
I had bloody knuckles now my fists filled with stars
I'm thinkin' bout beautiful women and wonderful cars
Do this shit for the young niggas, that's the cause
I'm with my bro and we smokin' dope
I'm with my bro and he pour me up
I'm with this bit and she cool as fuck
I'm in this bit I'm just coolin' bruh
And my fists is filled with colors bruh
Yes I'm fly for real, somethin' like doves
And I make sure my bitches feel all my love
And this dope my best friend, I'm kickin' shit with my bud
Yea I'm havin' fun (I'm havin' fun)... fun, dawg
I'm havin' fun (Money!)... fun... fun, dawg
I'm havin' fun... fun... fun, dawg
I'm havin' fun (Diamonds!)
Watch for the gun, yeah
