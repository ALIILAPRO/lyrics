		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I spend a lot of time wondering why
There's "I owe you" in you and I
With innocent devotion to the fiction living up in the sky

The woman I am
Is taken back to nothing
The woman I am
Is taken back to nothing

I found the only woman I need to love (the only, the only)
The only woman I need to love (the only, the only)
The only woman I need to love (the only, the only)
The only woman I need to love

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I think my sense of humor might have made things confusing for the heart
Complicated, it's getting to be happy with the who you are

The woman I am
Is taken back to nothing

I found the only woman I need to love (the only, the only)
The only woman I need to love (the only, the only)
The only woman I need to love (the only, the only)
The only woman I need to love

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Expectations, obligations draining the beauty that you got
Complicated, it's getting to be happy with the who you are

I found the only woman I need to love
The only woman I need to love
The only woman I need to love
The only woman I need to love

Complicated, it's getting to be 
Complicated, it's getting to be 
Complicated, it's getting to be 
Complicated, it's getting to be
