		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Barbara
Maybe I can get you some wine
My Sylvia
How can I say that you are mine
Hey Beverly
Eyes are blue from what I can see
Hey Stephanie
So you wanna dance with me

I don't care what they say
I'm just trying to be one of the boys
So you can't change your mind
You can never stand alone in the dark oh baby so

Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start
Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start

Olivia
Tell me if you are satisfied
My dear Sandra
Someday you'll be a superstar yeah bow
Hey my Ramona
Eyes are blue from what I can see
Hey Margarita
So you wanna dance with me

I don't care what they say
I'm just trying to be one of the boys
So you can't change your mind
You can never stand alone in the dark oh baby so

Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start
Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start

Hey I don't care
Hey I don't care
Hey I don't care
Hey I don't care
Hey I don't care oh
Hey I don't care oh
Hey I don't care
Hey I don't care

Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start
Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start (whoa)

Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start
Dance now dance now baby
Give it all and I'm gonna start
