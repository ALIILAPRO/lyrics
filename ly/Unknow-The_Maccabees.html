		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just while love remembers

Unknow me as hard as it seems
Decide it and feel light on the breeze
And it's alright you can lean it on me
And I know it's all you can see and to shake it
To make it fall from the tree

And you're called into the water
And it holds you like a tropical disease

And you lean into the weather and it drops you
Just while love remembers

I was given these lungs
And I won't be ashamed no more
We were ripped from those arms
They no longer protect us
Unknow me pour me away
Just while love remembers
