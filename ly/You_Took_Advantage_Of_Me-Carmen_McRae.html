		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a sentimental sap, that's all,
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me.
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow,
So what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me.
I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.
Here I am with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.
