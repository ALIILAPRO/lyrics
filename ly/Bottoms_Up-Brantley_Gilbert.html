		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Going ninety five, burning down 129, yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
And she's ridin' shotgun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing right
Pull into the party like, "Y'all, wassup?"

Tonight it's bottoms up (up)
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town and get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make you wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up?"
Yeah, tonight it's bottoms up (up, up)
Get 'em up
Tonight it's bottoms up (up, up)
Get 'em up

Damn
Girl, I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song would make you move like that, yeah
And she's doing it in Daisy Dukes, girl
She got ya tappin' on a boy's shoulder
"Hey dawg, check this out"
Man, it's how them girls do it in the dirty south, yeah
She'll have you on a knee, "Can I marry you?"

Yeah, tonight it's bottoms up (up)
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town and get up (get up)
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make you wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up?"
Yeah, tonight it's bottoms up (up, up)
Get 'em up
Tonight it's bottoms up (up, up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up

Get 'em up

Ayo, whatever you sipping on
Get it up in the air one time
Bottoms up

Let's give a toast to the good times
All y'all, get your drinks up high
Everybody feeling alright
Damn right

'Cause tonight it's bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town and get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make you wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up?"

Tonight it's bottoms up (up)
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town and get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make you wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up?"
Yeah, tonight it's bottoms up (up, up)
Get 'em up
Tonight it's bottoms up (up, up)
Get 'em up
