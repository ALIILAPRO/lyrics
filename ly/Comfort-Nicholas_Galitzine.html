		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been searching for home in hotel rooms
Looking for love where I left her
Something to tether my heart to
But I let go when I get it
Last time I left the door open
They messed up the clothes in my suitcase
I keep running back to that moment
I should let go and I'll get it

I need comfort but I hate being comfortable
I wonder why I hate getting what I want
It's torture but I can't seem to shake it off
(Shake it off, shake it off)

If I could retrace my footsteps 
To see where I lost my direction
Then maybe we'd never look back 
'Cause you push and I pull back
And you know I wish I could change 
But if I don't blame the past
I'll break this anyway (ah)
'Cause if I could retrace my footsteps
It'd be me and I know that

I need comfort but I hate being comfortable
I wonder why I hate getting what I want
It's torture but I can't seem to shake it off
It's all in my head, I fuck up again and again
I need comfort but I hate being satisfied
Don't hope, it's the hope that kills me every time
Come close but not close enough to change my mind
It's all in my head and I know I'll do it again

Wanna stay, wanna run, wanna disappear
I keep biting my tongue just to keep you here
Made you wait for someone I could never be
And it's killing me
Wanna stay, wanna run, wanna disappear
I keep biting my tongue just to keep you here
Made you wait for someone I could never be (whoa)

I need comfort but I hate being comfortable
I wonder why I hate getting what I want
It's torture but I can't seem to shake it off

Comfort but I hate being satisfied
Don't hope, it's the hope that kills me every time
Come close but not close enough to change my mind, change my mind

Gimme comfort, gimme comfort, gimme comfort
Gimme comfort, gimme comfort, gimme comfort, get me high
Gimme comfort, gimme comfort, gimme comfort, get me high
Gimme comfort
