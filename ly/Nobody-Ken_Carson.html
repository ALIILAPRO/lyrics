		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need no lean to tweak
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
I don't need no perk to geek
Huh, huh, huh, fuck that shit 
I don't need no molly
Huh, huh, huh, fuck that shit
I don't need nobody
Huh, huh, huh, I don't need these hoes
I don't need these beans
Huh, huh, huh, I don't need these loads
I don't need these fiends
Huh, I just need my dough
It's just me and me, uh
Huh, I just need my dough
It's just me and me, uh

Fuck it, I don't want no smoke
I don't need no weed
You just get high off drugs
I get high off other things
I get high when I make a half a mil' in a week
If money was a high these broke-ass niggas would be sober
I get so much money, I woke up with a money hangover
I'm sipping blue hunnids and I popped a pink 50
Alex Moss post my jewelry and the whole world like, "Damn, he shittin'"
I done copped so much damn jewelry
Like damn how much money he gettin'?

These nigga pocket watching, my pistol hold a 50
I got a drum on this bitch it look like a titty
I make a fuck nigga dance just like P Diddy
I make that motherfucker sing like Pretty Ricky
That stick turn a nigga into a bitch like he got ass and titties
Got Glocks and sticks, yeah, they came with dicks
Yeah, they came with ass and titties
And you know I rock fashion with it
My shoes came from Balenci'
My fit match my glizzy, I cock it back and blick it
Yeah

I don't need no lean to tweak
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
I don't need no perk to geek
Huh, huh, huh, fuck that shit 
I don't need no molly
Huh, huh, huh, fuck that shit
I don't need nobody
Huh, huh, huh, I don't need these hoes
I don't need these beans
Huh, huh, huh, I don't need these loads
I don't need these fiends
Huh, I just need my dough
It's just me and me, uh
Huh, I just need my dough
It's just me and me, uh

It's just me and me, uh
It's just me, uh
It's just me and me, uh
It's just me, uh
It's just me and me, uh
It's just me, uh
It's just me and me, uh
It's just me, uh
