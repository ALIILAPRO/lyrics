		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, we heard church people say
They are in the holy way
There are strange things happening everyday

Oh, the last man judgment day
When they drive him all away
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

If you want to view the climb
You must learn to quit your lyin'
There are strange things happening everyday

If you heal right through the lies
You can live right all the ties
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

Jesus is the holy light
Turning darkness into light
There are strange things happening everyday

He gave the blind man sight
When he pressed Him with all his might
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday
