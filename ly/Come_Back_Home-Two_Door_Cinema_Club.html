		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another Saturday, another careless move
Tell the world that you're thinking of what to do
A window opens up and some one calls your name
But I can tell you don't know how to play this game

I know this isn't it
You'll hit your target some day

So now your on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength
To find another way

To find another way
To find another way
To find another way

So tell me what you need
And I'll accommodate
But if too long goes by
You just might be too late
An opportunity you can't afford to waste
So have the lines in your head first
For heaven's sake

You hear the day beckoning
Know what its all in your head

So now your on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength
To find another way

So now your on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength

So now your on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength
To find another way
