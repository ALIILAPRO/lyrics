		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Round here fast is how the grass grows
Lost is what you find on a back road
Proof's in the whiskey, red's in the dirt
And hard work stops at the fence row

We stand for the flag, and if you don't like it, we don't care
'Cause we do things a little different 'round here

Where brave is eighteen wearin' army green
Truth is in the words, in red we read
Proud is what you say about where you're from
Heroes are daddies and mamas are love
Where right is right, and wrong is wrong, yeah, we're
Doin' things a little different 'round here

Easy's at the end of a long day
Free's how you feel, not what you pay
Simple's how we live (yeah), thanks is what we give (c'mon)
Roots in the ground's why we stay (why we stay)

Brave is eighteen wearing army green
Truth is in the words, in red we read
Proud is what you say about where you're from
Heroes are daddies and mamas are love
Yeah, right is right, and wrong is wrong, yeah, we're
Doin' things a little different 'round here
Doin' things a little different 'round here

Rain on a roof is what a song is
And home is where the heart is

Brave is eighteen wearing army green (army green)
Truth is in the words, in red we read (red we read)
Proud is what you say about where you're from
Heroes are daddies and mamas are love
And right is right, and wrong is wrong, yeah we're
Doin' things a little different 'round here
Right is right, and wrong is wrong, yeah, we're (yeah, we're)
Doin' things a little different 'round here
Yeah, we do things a little different 'round here
