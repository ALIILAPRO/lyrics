		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gimme that, gimme that
She says she can throw it back, throw it back
Make a nigga have to double back, double back
Nigga pull up, don't know how to act, how to act
And I'm rolling hella deep shit

Ooh, doing what you do
Know you heard the news, yeah, I'm acting brand new
Shit, I got the money, have you seen the cars?
Let me take you to Mars
I guess if you wanna go

Clutch and watch me drift
The wrist is hieroglyph
Diamond therapy
Carat clarity
Oh, you thought it was a myth?
Well, the comets do exist
I got gold dependency
I need diamond therapy

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

See me as a ticket to foreign lands
I'm the pathway

Bad bitch
Bad bitch
Bad bitch
Bad bitch
Bad bitch
Bad bitch
Bad bitch

Chain is loud
I want 'em to hear me
Talk with it
Twenty-five the earpiece, make you weary
She into that?
Dim the lights
'Cause she know where it's at
(Yeah, yeah)

'Bout to take your bitch
She already gone
I don't even want her
Where she goin'?
She wanna take a trip
Leave and get away
See me as a ticket to foreign lands
I'm the pathway

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
