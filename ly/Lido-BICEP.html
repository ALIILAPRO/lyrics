		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought we need to see belief
And so I know I’m nothing over all
In time I’ll sleep in seamlessly
My soul doth growl for love ignored the call

I can see a pair of lies
I’m conceited paralyzed
I can see the peril lies on your guise

It was but a disguise
It was nice
But it was not right

Lost my hope
I can’t trust
On my own
When is us
Broken home and no one’s alive

I have grown
Made to must
I’ve atoned and favored just
Wonder why they’d still desire I die

Why go on this way
I’m not home today
Might reach bone again
As I cope to stay
I’m all alone but they won’t go away

My heart it marches on yet on
It’s start to darken; I was born
The sharpened harpoons don’t belong
I’m lost where are you hope is gone

I don’t want to continue like this
I’m not as strong with no fists to fight this
The dust looks succulent I might bite this
If I was wrong then let me fucking right this

Picking up the pace
But there’s no winner of a race
With it’s beginning at the end of
Everything isn’t in place
I hear the ringing of a bell
It tell me rearrange his face

It isn’t right how I like to fight
So I try to lie
To hide my design
It hides right behind
(What I mind to mind to mind) x3


Try to find my end
(Time but time again) x3
I 
Try to find my end
(Time but time again)x3
