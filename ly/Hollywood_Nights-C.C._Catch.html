		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Daytime friends and nighttime fools
Oh, they're breaking golden rules
Dreaming all that dreams come true
Dreaming like the big guys do

From a day in paradise
And a life without a lie
Little dreams can go along, long way

Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Stand up and fight
Hollywood nights

Stop these Hollywood nights
Know that it's right
Hollywood nights

Dreams are more than a little wish
Broken promise's maybe your reach
There is a will and there is a way
You'll build the pain another day

You can make it if you try
Don't give it up
Oh baby, why
Little dreams can go along, long way

Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Stand up and fight

Hollywood nights
Stop these Hollywood nights
Know that it's right
Hollywood nights

Hollywood nights
Stand up and fight

Hollywood nights
Know that is right

Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Stand up and fight
Hollywood nights

Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Know that it's right
Hollywood nights
