		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pick myself up off the ground
Tired of hearing the sound
Of the hands of the clock go round
Misery countdown
Lately I've been in a daze
Scared, but I'm not afraid
I'm just partin' tryna find an escape
Picking the lock on the cage

Where have you been?
Where did you go, go?
How can you sleep knowing you don't know
If I'm okay or I'm not
If you care, I can't tell
You put up walls knowing I can't see
How can you die knowing I can't breathe?
Am I okay or I'm not
If you care, I can't tell

Do you know how it felt?
A question that I answer myself
I'm standing here in amazement
You really showed me yourself
Making it hard to engage (mm, mm)
There's nothing left to say (mm, mm)
Instances that you can't erase
Wasting away
What a waste

Where have you been?
Where did you go, go?
How can you sleep knowing you don't know
If I'm okay or I'm not
If you care, I can't tell (whoa)
You put up walls knowing I can't see
How can you die knowing I can't breathe?
Am I okay or I'm not
If you care, I can't tell
