		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh girl, drinking by by by yourself
Smooth girl, what a crime you've done to my health
Ooh girl, tell me why why why I stare
Got those hips like magic and I'm under your spell

Your sweet perfume it lingers on through my night
Getting me higher, getting me higher
Don't leave the room I'm dreaming you're in my mind
We're turning off the lights

Because I'd love
Every little bit of you, bit of you all night long
You're so deliriously good
And I want
Every little bit of you, giving you all my heart
You're so deliriously good

Ooh girl, pull up by by by your church
Move girl, set me straight with all of your crimes
Ooh girl, there's a way way way you hurt
Like a deadly weapon in a dangerous world

Your sweet perfume it lingers on through my night
Getting me higher, getting me higher
Don't leave the room I'm dreaming you're in my mind
I'm turning off the lights

Because I'd love
Every little bit of you, bit of you all night long
You're so deliriously good
And I want
Every little bit of you, giving you all my heart
You're so deliriously good

(You call me lover)
(Take me home to paradise)
(You call me lover)
You're so deliriously good
(You call me lover)
Every little bit of you, bit of you all night long
(You call me lover)
You're so deliriously good

Because I'd love
Every little bit of you, bit of you all night long
You're so deliriously good
And I want
Every little bit of you, giving you all my heart
You're so deliriously good

Every little bit of you, bit of you all night long
You're so deliriously good
(You call me lover)
Every little bit of you, bit of you all night long
You're so deliriously good
You're so deliriously good
You're so delirious
You're so deliriously good
You're so delirious
(You call me lover)
Every little bit of you, bit of you all night long
You're so deliriously good
You're so delirious
You're so deliriously good
You're so delirious
You're so deliriously good
You're so delirious
