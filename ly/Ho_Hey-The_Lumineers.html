		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ho)
(Hey)
(Ho)
(Hey)

(Ho) I been tryin' to do it right
(Hey) I been livin' a lonely life
(Ho) I been sleepin' here instead
(Hey) I been sleepin' in my bed
(Ho) I been sleepin' in my bed
(Hey)
(Ho)
(Ho) so show me family
(Hey) all the blood that I will bleed
(Ho) I don't know where I belong
(Hey) I don't know where I went wrong
(Ho) but I can write a song
(Hey)

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet

(Ho)
(Hey) come on, now
(Ho) hey
(Hey)

(Ho) I don't think you're right for him
(Hey) think of what it might've been if we
(Ho) took a bus to Chinatown
(Hey) I'd be standin' on Canal
(Ho) and Bowery
(Hey)
(Ho) she'd be standin' next to me
(Hey)

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart

Love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
'Cause, oh, we're bleedin' out

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet
(Ho)
(Hey)
(Ho)
(Hey)
