		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Mmm-hm, uh, it's me)

Ooh, I love the way she say, "That pussy mine" (pussy mine)
Ooh, I work that pussy out like nine to five (nine to five)
Ooh, can't get that pussy off of my mind (of my mind)
Ooh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind

Twist your- twist your- twist your leg
Break it, break it, break your neck
I'm a dog (woof), what you expect?
Ooh, I'ma make you sweat
Ooh, I'ma wreck myself
Ooh God, what's that?
Got your feet up by your neck
Never break up, but I fuck you like it's make-up sex
You go run and tell all your friends my dick the best
Like a waterfall, the way I keep the pussy wet (wet)
Wet (wet), wet, hahaha, fuck your ex
Oh, yeah, bring the tray
Ice cream paint job on your chest
Oh yeah, don't check your text
We gon' have a fuck fest
(Oh) You a dirty bitch
That's some shit I never guess
(Oh) We gon' make a mess
Fuckin' up your mattress

Ooh, I love the way she say, "That pussy mine" (pussy mine)
Ooh, I work that pussy out like nine to five (nine to five)
Ooh, can't get that pussy off of my mind (of my mind)
Ooh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love the way she say, "That pussy mine" (pussy mine)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I work that pussy out like nine to five (nine to five)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, can't get that pussy off of my mind (of my mind)
Ooh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind

Ooh yeah, switching positions, we might not ever finish
Ooh yeah, our sex the illest, that's why we need a witness
Oh yeah, look at me hit it, while you rub on your clitoris
Swear you the shit, the way you whipping that wrist
Got my hands on your hips, you all on top of my dick
That shit so tight, I didn't think it could fit
Got a little waist, but that ass so thick
She got a pretty face but she fuck me like a freaky little bitch
Make me wanna throw a tip
When she drop it to the floor
Can't believe she didn't strip
I'ma need a lil' more
Make you do a back flip
I'ma fuck her 'til she's sore
I'ma pimp without a limb, ay get it B

I love the way she say, "That pussy mine" (pussy mine)
Ooh, I work that pussy out like nine to five (nine to five)
Ooh, can't get that pussy off of my mind (of my mind)
Ooh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love the way she say, "That pussy mine" (pussy mine)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I work that pussy out like nine to five (nine to five)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, can't get that pussy off of my mind (of my mind)
Ooh, hit it from the front, then I hit that pussy from behind
