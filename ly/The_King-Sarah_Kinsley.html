		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I built a time machine to see you again
To hear your phone call, your voice down the hall
The way we were back then
We were dancing in the rain
Our feet on the pavement
You said I was your second head
I knew exactly what you meant

So tell me
Before we get older, let's do everything
You're scared of when it's over
You're still young and you're still free

I want to be the king of your heart
Let's fall apart and start again
You'll see the end of me

I built a castle far away in the sand
We were higher than we knew with nothing to lose
Until it washed away in our hands
And you said you could never love again
Well, it must've been fate then
'Cause I know exactly how it ends

So tell me
Before we get older, let's do everything
You're scared of when it's over
You're still young and you're still free

I want to be the king of your heart
Let's fall apart and start again
You'll see the end of me
I want to be the king
I'm the king
I'm your king

I wanna be the king
