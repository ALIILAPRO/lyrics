		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
(Major Lazer) Word
Straight up

Outlaw, outlaw, like I hit the PowerBall
Once all eyes is on me, floating off like South Paul
Niggas love to count yours, hopin' that your people fall
Wishing death upon me, but I'm here forevermore
I just get debated on, I just get my greatest on
Saint Laurent on speed dial, I just put the latest on
Bring it on, bring it on, you want more, then bring it on
Set this bitch on fire, nigga, we can have a sing-along

You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time

I got a California king in my condo
Got a motherfuckin' big screen by the front door
Got a guest bedroom filled up with fur coats
Nigga, ain't no room in this bitch to even jump rope
Yeah, the fire and desire and I'm higher than my prior
My attire I acquire might require a Maliah
Whoa, might accept ya and deny ya, no denial
I'll be in the court room on the table screamin', "Rider!"

You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time

Tell them likkle pussy deh nuh violate, violate
21 Outta di clip me fire straight
White line, yellow tape, book your flight, look a date
Send di pussy back to di maker
Whether hell or higher gate, yeah!
Clip big, diss badman, you get a split wig
Split wig undertaker look see what a sick did
West coast, East coast, we love weapons
Bullet through your fuckin' vest left your chest exposed

You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time

All we do is relax, sit back and smoke
We ain't got no job, we goin' from broke
That ain't stoppin' from gettin'
Gettin' inside of ya
Takin' off in our cars
Feel like we in the air screaming

(Street mental, street mental)

You need to know that I'm a rider

You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time (straight up)

(Major Lazor)
(Straight up)
