		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't get me wrong
I went along for the madness
Two of a kind
A match lit with heaven and sadness
But oh, what rings will bring us to

Don't make it seem like I walked away
Don't ever doubt my desire
I took a beating, I took your love
Like a fighter

Oh
I'm sorry, my love
But the wings of a dove were the answer
Insecurity sucks at the breast of a patient
Disaster
But oh, the kiss that hits so true

Don't make it seem like I walked away
Don't ever doubt my desire
I took a beating, I took your love
Like a fighter

Years go by in the pouring rain
You made it feel like a holiday
It was a pleasure to take your pain
I'm a fighter

Years go by in the pouring rain
You made it feel like a holiday
I'm a fighter
Oh

Don't make it seem like I walked away
Don't ever doubt my desire
I took a beating, I took your love
Like a fighter
