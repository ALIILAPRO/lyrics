		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You Swan, Go On
As good as I could possibly imagine my life getting, it did after I met you.  
The way you reached inside my chest and pulled out things and sent them off and breaths blew.  
And as good as it got with all the layers peeling off, and though I writhed, I could not upset you.  
With your hand down my throat you held onto my heart and pumped blood through.  
And then It's time to go. you said, It's time to go out you little grey goose.  
Get out from under my wing. you said You swan, go on, go out.  You're turned loose.  
Oh! so it's over.  Oh! so we died.  Oh! so your hand on my heart pumping blood went limp and oh! I flied!  
Oh swan inside!
