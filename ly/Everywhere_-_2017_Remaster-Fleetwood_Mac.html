		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calling out your name
Calling out your name

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say

I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out

Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly

C'mon baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon before you break my heart

Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)

Can you hear me calling?
Out your name
You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say

Oh come along baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon before you break my heart

Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)
