		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It is a dangerous undertaking
You will be risking your life
It is a dangerous undertaking
His only hope is to find the place
Where real knowledge is being kept alive
It is a dangerous undertaking
You will be risking
Your life, but at the right moment
There will be a guide wolves start howling
Wolves start howling the Shahmen

Look what has risen out the bad patch
Shell cracked be the last of
The batch to hatch
I'm here to blaze with my
Last bag and last match and feel the fade
Then I have to get my bags packed
I'm out for days on my
Way and a thousand pass
There is no way to count
Up years with an hourglass
So I don't ever watch the
Clock while the hours pass
I'm busy chiseling this rock
Flipping knots of cash
2 pounds of grass and a
Couple different blocks of hash
A home studio, a couch and a spot to crash
And I be digging in the
Mountain where the fountain's at
You think you found it
But I'm bound to bring the power back
I did my studies and I
Never pulled the coward act
I'm feeling lovely but some
Loves didn't ever last
Still not for nothing
A couple drugs left a sour flash
You seen my mug? It would
Probably turn the flowers black
But every step they would reach
From the ground to catch
My heels and my ankles as I wrangle past
Doing the tango with destiny's sexy ass
Feeling the strangle of the danger
Right upon my back
But I maintain though with the
Fate right upon my grasp
It's BLS right there on that
