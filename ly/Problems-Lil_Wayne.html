		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Zaytoven

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, little house, telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

Off button
Pause button
Stop button
Lock button
Belly button
Big old tittiess, she pop buttons
Head butting
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percosets that's my buttons
Hit the pop button
Psychopath
Blunt big
Big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smoking science lab
I should have tattoo that say "I'm nothing like my dad"
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand
She see righteous plans
I see business plans, then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, "ooh Lordy"
Smelling like Cool Water
Just got the new Cartier
The Rollie was too salty
That's rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning
Sunglasses smilin' emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God calling (brr, hello?)
Making an impact my nigga
We not just black, nigga
We rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse?
To get on my flying horses
That's rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
My lil' bitch body'll solve it
And when you say timber please will you whisper 
My nigga I'm quietly falling, shh

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

Hello? Hello? Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
That's rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong, bitch I was only mistaken
I live all alone, little house, telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

Rest in peace
I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak
After I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn the piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doing nothing 
While they say nothin' ain't never worth nothin' but it's always free
Psychopath
Blunt big
Big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smoking science lab
I should have tattoo that say "I'm nothing like your man"
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic' hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the hyphy dance then I wipe my hands
Feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse?
To get on my flying horses
That's rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie

You got penny pinch nigga problems, lil' whoadie
On the bench nigga problems, lil' whoadie
I got a bitch nigga problem, lil' whoadie
More bitches more problems, lil' whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
What is this nigga problem, lil' whoadie?
I got rich nigga problems, lil' whoadie
Yeah

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home it was only the matrix
