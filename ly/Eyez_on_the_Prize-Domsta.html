		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We just trynna figure everything out
Hit detours but we still on the route
You be the glue
I'll be the grout
Eyes on the prize
And we'll get it no doubt
Never said I had it all figured out
Hit detours but we still on the route
Always the glue
Always the grout
Eyes on the prize
And we'll get it right now

Surrounded by smoke 
Need it straight out the ground
Pulled out the mud
But look at us now
We said fuck a job
And still prevailed
They counted us out 
While they live in their hell
Cash everywhere and they chasing some tail
Same boys pay for hair and they nails
Unless she make money
That pussy a jail
Mind on dead-stock
You always on sale

We just trynna figure everything out
Hit detours but we still on the route
You be the glue
I'll be the grout
Eyes on the prize
And we'll get it no doubt
Never said I had it all figured out
Hit detours but we still on the route
Always the glue
Always the grout
Eyes on the prize
And we'll get it right now
