		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were right
I know I can't get enough of you
Leave it all to bloom 
You were right
I don't know I can't get enough of you, no
The things that I would do

Under the water, I'm sinking further down
Floating, I'm nothing, I'm nothing
Arms are wide open, I'm calling out your name
Sitting and waiting, I'm waiting

You were right
I know I can't get enough of you
You were right
I don't know I can't get enough of you
Leave it all to bloom 

You were right
I don't know I can't get enough of you, no
The things that I would do

I'm cold in the river
Lips moving, there's no sound
Pulling me under, I'm under

You've given me nothing
Keep telling me I'll be fine
Keeping me kissing, out guessing

You were right

You were right
I know I can't get enough of you
You were right
I don't know I can't get enough of you

You were right
I know I can't get enough of you
Leave it all to bloom 
You were right
I don't know I can't get enough of you, no
The things that I would do
