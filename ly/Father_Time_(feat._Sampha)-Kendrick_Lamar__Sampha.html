		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You really need some therapy
Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin' about?
Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck
Shit, everybody stupid
Yeah, well, you need to talk to someone
Reach out to Eckhart

I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues run across my head, told me, "Fuck a foul"
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my life
Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well
Mama said, "That boy is exhausted," he said, "Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin", I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues

Early mornin' wake ups (ah) practicin' on day-offs (ah)
Tough love (ah), bottled up, no chaser (ah)
Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser (ah)
Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chase
Early mornin' wake ups (ah), practicin' on day-offs (ah, day-offs)
Tough love (ah), bottled up, no chaser (ah)
Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser (ah)
Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser

I got daddy issues, that's on me
Lookin' for, "I love you," rarely empathizin' for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Man should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His mama died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
His first reply was, "Son, that's life, and bills got no silver spoon"
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your mama'n'em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (ah)
Need assistance with the way I was brought up (ah, ah)
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues

Early mornin' wake ups (ah), practicin' on day-offs (ah)
Tough love (ah), bottled up, no chaser (ah)
Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser (ah)
Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser
