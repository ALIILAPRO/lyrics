		  Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you

Woke up this morning, to your sleepy smile
I realized I haven't told you in a while
That you're my life, you're my dream
You're the reason for every song I sing
You're my rock, your my world
Your my always and forever girl

Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart
One kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason, I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me

Yeah, you're sweet like chocolate
Hot like sriracha
Yeah, girl you got me right in your back pocket
You're smooth like whiskey, fine like wine
I love how you're making my blood sugar rise

Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart
One kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason, I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me

When the world gets cold
On those sleepless
Oh, girl you should know that you will always be mine

Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart
One kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason, I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me
Ooh yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me
Ooh yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me, oh
