		  Thrift store fashion
Imperfect tattoos
Taking showers
Minus shampoo

You are my favorite everything
Been telling girls that since I was 16
Shut up, I love you
You're my best friend

Get you under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
'Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talkin' under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
That it's better, you and I, under pink skies

Underwear, I kinda care
Wanna look good for you
British bomb, you turn me on
No matter what ya do

You are my favorite everything
Been telling you that since 2015
Shut up, I love you
You're my best friend

Get you under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
'Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talkin' under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
That it's better, you and I, under pink skies

We can work it out
You and I are meant to be together
This is how it's supposed to feel
I'm in love with how this feels

Get you under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
'Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talkin' under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
That it's better, you and I, under pink skies

Get you under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
'Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talkin' under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
That it's better, you and I, under pink skies
