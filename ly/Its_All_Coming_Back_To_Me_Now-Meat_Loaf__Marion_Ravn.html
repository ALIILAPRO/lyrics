		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust and I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I have ever made

But when you touch me like this (touch me like this)
And you hold me like that (hold me like that)
I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this (touch you like this)
And I hold you like that (hold you like that)
It's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me now

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now

There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again but then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow, baby, baby!

If I kiss you like this (kiss you like this)
And if you whisper like that (whisper like that)
It was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this (if you want me like this)
And if you need me like that (if you need me like that)
It was dead long ago but it's all coming back to me

It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then!

But if I touch you like this (touch you like this)
And if you kiss me like that (kiss me like that)
It was so long ago but it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this (touch me like this)
And if I kiss you like that (kiss you like that)
It was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me now

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now

There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again but they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow, baby, baby, baby!

When you touch me like this (touch me like this)
And when you hold me like that (hold me like that)
It was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this (see me like this)
And when I see you like that (see you like that)
Then we see what we want to see, all coming back to me

The flesh and the fantasies, all coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this (forgive me all this)
If I forgive you all that (forgive you all that)
We forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me now
And when I touch you like that
It's all coming back to me now
If you do it like this
It's all coming back to me now
And if we
