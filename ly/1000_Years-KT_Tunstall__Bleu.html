		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A thousand years is a long, long time
Even for a star up in the sky
I could count the tears and the long, long nights
But I'd rather just remember how you smiled

In a thousand years
I know that our love will still be here
So close your eyes, my dear
Knowing that our love is going to last one thousand years

The time flies by in a blinking eye
No matter how we try to make it last
But if souls are strong they'll go on and on
And we will hardly know the time has passed

In a thousand years
I know that our love will still be here
So close your eyes, my dear
Knowing that our love is going to last one thousand years

We'll disappear if we can keep each other here
Inside our hearts
We will never be apart, so don't you fear
Dry your tears

In a thousand years
I know that our love will still be here
In a thousand years 
Oh
So close your eyes, my dear
Knowing that our love is going to last one thousand years
