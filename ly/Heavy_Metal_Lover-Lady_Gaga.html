		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)

(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)

I want your whiskey mouth all over my blond south
Red wine, cheap perfume and a filthy pout

Tonight bring all your friends, because a group does it better
Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Heavy metal lover

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Heavy metal lover

Dirty pony, I
Can't wait to hose you down (down, down)
You've got to earn your leather
In this part of town (town, town)

Dirty girls, in a patch, follow the Remington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets
Drink beer and get into trouble

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Heavy metal lover

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Heavy metal lover

I could be your girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me
If I ruled the world, world, world

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Heavy metal lover

Whip me slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Dark like liquorice, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam

Wash the night, with St. Jam-eson
Like a baptism
Heavy metal lovers play
Baby, we were born this way

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Heavy metal lover

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Heavy metal lover

I could be your girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me (heavy metal lover)
If I ruled the world, world, world 

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (heavy metal lover)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (heavy metal lover)
Heavy metal lover

(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover)
