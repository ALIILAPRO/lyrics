		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait right here (wait right here)
I'll be back in the mornin' (mornin')
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (yeah)
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now, I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I can work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it ring
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me
Get comfortable with me, once I got it comin'
I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats
You helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I fall into pieces

Look at the sky tonight
All of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine
And I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight
All of them stars have a reason
