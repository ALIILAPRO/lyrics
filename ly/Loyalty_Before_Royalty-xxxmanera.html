		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even know
Why I lost a friend
But you know I still keep griding
Starting getting bread
Get my momma help
Ye, you know my boy, you make me shining

Every time I fell
Like I keep it real
When I even get my diamond
Diamonds on me frozed
Frozed biting and it hurts
Shit is look like even get fighting

Wake up in the morning with my style shit insane hoe
I'm going hard, fell like I never change though
Back to old me I was always lonely
Never know that I'm going writing foreign
I, I, I, I, I'm so fly
Ye, my money doubleup bands, go die
I saw that bitch amago like, then wassup
Ye, I saw her before I take it tonight

I don't even know
Why I lost a friend
But you know I still keep griding
Starting getting bread
Get my momma help
Ye, you know my boy, you make me shining

Every time I fell
Like I keep it real
When I even get my diamond
Diamonds on me frozed
Frozed biting and it hurts
Shit is look like even get fighting
