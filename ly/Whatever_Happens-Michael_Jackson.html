		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand (don't let go of my hand)
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand (don't let go of my hand)
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
He tries to explain, "you're what makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand (don't let go of my hand)
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand (don't let go of my hand)
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand (don't let go of my hand)
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
(See don't you do it baby) don't let go of my hand
I say yeah, don't let go baby (don't let go of my hand)
See, now baby, yeah
See you (don't let go of my hand)
Don't you do it

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't let you go of my hand baby

Don't you, don't you let go
I say yeah

Can I get a witness baby?
Don't you let go baby, yeah
Oh, whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand

Thank you, man
Thank you, Carlos
