		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My libido's a beating drum
Everything is yet to come
Lizard king that I've become
Preparing for the future run
Everything is yet to blend
Mixing with my dirty friend
Our group has always been
And always will until the end

You know I'm a black unicorn
I'm a magnetic flare, uh, uh, uh, uh
And don't know me at all
Nevermind, I don't care

My libido's a beating drum
Everything is yet to come
Loser in the diamond sky
And it's ok, all right
And it's over, totally hangover
Completely goddamned loner
And you can takeover
But you won't

My libido's a beating drum
Everything is yet to come
Someday, somehow I'm not sober enough
For prediction and that's alright
Live fast and die young, woo!
