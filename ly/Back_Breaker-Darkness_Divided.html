		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Restore. 
Simplicity of the innocent, 
Something taken for granted, 
Follow reason to find the end,
Until there's no more times to lend, 

Push, push, push until your worn,
Pull the rope until it's torn,

What you have is more than what you conjugate, 

Chorus:
I will not remove,
The essence of my morality, 
Forsaking, my misdeeds,
For the need, to believe, 

But now I stood tired and hungry,
Looking at my past unloving, 
How did I forget my direction, 
Guided by misguided affection, 

Everything has felt the same,
Faults initiate my blame,
Time to revive,
Time to restore. 

Chorus

Grab hold of moments worth remembering, 
While the beat in your heart is still pumping, 
This is something resonating in me,
Now that I have returned and I am starting to see.
