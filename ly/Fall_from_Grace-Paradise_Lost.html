		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No celebration for the damned
One last defiance on command
Receiving malice for mistakes
Rejoice as adversaries fall

As we fall from grace
And we touch death's hand too soon
As we fall from grace like you
Would the eyes of another god decide to end your life?

The defamation of the damned
This poison chalice you withstand
Receive, decry, and slowly fail
Neglected, self-inflicted loss

As we fall from grace
And we touch death's hand too soon
As we fall from grace like you
Through the eyes of another god
Decide to end your life

We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone

There's something inside me
There's something unknown
A suffering sublime speaks
Words I don't know
There's something inside me
There's something unknown
A suffering that finds me
The eyes don't show
We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone
We're all alone

As we fall from grace
And we touch death's hand too soon
As we fall from grace like you
Could the eyes of another god decide to end your life?
