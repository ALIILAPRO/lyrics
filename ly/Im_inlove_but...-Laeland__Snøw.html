		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ride around in my whip
Told you you got it flipped, yeah
Trust that I won't do shit 
I've used up all my attempts yeah 
Don't give a fuck and I know 
You're gonna be a no show, yeah
Hanging out with them hoes,
It's your pic you might as well pose, yeah
You got my mind messed up 
Look in my eyes and fess up
Do you want this relationship with me 
Abandon the ship or should I sink 
Not your brother, your dude, or your homie 
More than a friend so don't throw me 
Don't call me that shit then the next night be talking bout
Do you wanna come and hold me, yeah 

""Come and hold me?""
Baby girl you don't know me
Hate that you call when you're lonely
All you do is disappoint me
But I'm in love and you're fucked up
God I'm feeling so damn numb
Sorry that I am not enough (oh)
But tell me how you feel, the silence is real
I smoke on the herbs just to deal (aye)
You say you love me, I know you ain't mean it
But for some odd reason I feel like believin'
Your feelings they change like the seasons
Your feelings they change like the seasons
Your feelings they change like the seasons
Oh...

Ride around in my whip
Told you you got it flipped, yeah
Trust that I won't do shit 
I've used up all my attempts yeah 
Don't give a fuck and I know 
You're gonna be a no show, yeah
Hanging out with them hoes,
It's your pic you might as well pose, yeah
You got my mind messed up 
Look in my eyes and fess up
Do you want this relationship with me 
Abandon the ship or should I sink 
Not your brother, your dude, or your homie 
More than a friend so don't throw me 
Don't call me that shit then the next night be talking bout
Do you wanna come and hold me, yeah
