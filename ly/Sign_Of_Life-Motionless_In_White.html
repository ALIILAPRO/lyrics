		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's starting again, 'cause I let you in
This seed I've sown
Create to condemn, replace to relive
Despite its growth

(Am I unknown?)
Spinning out of control
I bury it 'til I choke
On ashes scarring my throat

You fall away into the light
Where numbness and pain are synchronized
If there's a grave behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?

Trapped in a maze in my mind and it's toxic
I'll scratch my nails through this coffin
Wasting away in the dark's not an option, not an option, not an option
I'll scratch my nails through this coffin

Too far away to cut the ties
Where numbness and pain are synchronized
If there's a grave behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?
(Find a sign of life)

Bare your soul
Bare your soul (it's starting again, I won't let you in)
(A world unknown)

You fall away into the light
Where numbness and pain are synchronized
If there's a grave behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?

Pull me close and twist the knife
And drag me to hell with heaven's lies
If there's a grave behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?
(Find a sign of life)

Trapped in a maze in my mind and it's toxic
I'll scratch my nails through this coffin
Wasting away in the dark's not an option, not an option, not an option
