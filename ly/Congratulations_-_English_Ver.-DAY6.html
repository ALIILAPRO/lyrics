		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even know how I can talk to you now
It's not you that you who talks to me anymore
And sure I know that sometimes it gets hard
But even with all my love what we had
You just gave it up

Thought we were meant to be
I thought that you belonged to me
I'll play the fool instead
Oh but then I know that this is the end (oh oh)

Congratulations glad you're doing great
Congratulations how are you okay
How could you be so fine
I can see it in your eyes
The same look that you gave me
That kills me inside ah

I don't even need to ask yeah
I know you too damn well yeah
I can see that smile and can tell that you did more than move on

I hate that you're happy
I hope that you can't sleep
Just knowing that I could be with someone new
That I'd be just like you

So hey, there's a couple things I should
Say to you I promise I'd be good if I could
But yeah
I'm sorry I'm not sorry
I can't be happy for you now

And hey that's great
Must be nice to not feel anything
'Cause I'm feeling just the same way okay
I don't give a ahahah

Congratulations glad you're doing great
Congratulations how are you okay
How could you be so fine
I can see it in your eyes
The same look that you gave me
That kills me inside ah

I don't even need to ask yeah
I know you too damn well yeah
I can see that smile and can tell that you did more than move on

I hate that you're happy
I hope that you can't sleep
Just knowing that I could be with someone new
That I'd be just like you, yo

Really wow girl congratulations
You couldn't wait two months, so impatient
Your SNS pages are now full of smiley faces
But I'm singin' this with Day6
So I give you my best wishes 'cause I am over you, we overdue
No problem sayin' how do you do
Oh I been good
My days have been so good to me thankfully
Oh you used to be muse to me
My best memory, truthfully
But that's about it the end

Congratulations so you win again (oh oh)
Congratulations you just took away
Our memories so far
They're gone just like you are
Now all I have is me and it's getting to hard (ah ah)

I saw it on your face yeah
I knew you too damn well yeah
I heard you laugh and knew that you did more than move on

I hate that your happy
I hate that I can't sleep
Keep thinking 'bout how he now seems better off, too
Just like I was with you
