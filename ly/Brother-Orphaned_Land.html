		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""This story began before I was born A childless woman cried sadly at home Her maid gave birth to a child of her own My father felt joy yet he was torn A conflict began one day at dawn The maid took your hand and you were gone To the desert you left towards the unknown I reckon you were so alone God will hear you oh my blood For the years you roamed in dirt and mud Forsaken like a nomad deserted in the flood Forgive me brother You did nothing wrong and took all the shame I suffered myself yet I am to blame The lord blessed us both but we still fight and claim That kid on the mountain - what was his name? Brother hear my plea tonight I grew tired from these endless years of (Our) fight From a tiny corner stone we may build our realm of light Please hear me brother""
