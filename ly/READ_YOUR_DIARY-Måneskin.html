		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brought you some roses, you didn't take them
So I shed a tear
Pouring some champagne over your panties
So that we can cheer
Counting the hours, counting the seconds
'Till I can feel your bones
There is a diamond on your pillow
When you're coming home

Alone, I've been waiting
So long, it's true

Dance in your shoes, read your diary to
Get inside of you, you, you
Forever and ever and ever
Cried on your nudes, wearing your perfume
Now I taste like you, you, you
Forever and ever and ever
I was dancing in your shoes
When I read your diary to
Try to get inside of you

Put on your lipstick, show me your kinks
I'm not afraid of them
Show me the lovin', the lovin', the lovin'
That you'll never give to a man
I'm not a coward, I'm not a hero
But I can be your toy
I'll be the pill that you wanna swallow
When you're looking for the joy

Alone, I've been waiting
So long, it's true

Dance in your shoes, read your diary to
Get inside of you, you, you
Forever and ever and ever
Cried on your nudes, wearing your perfume
Now I taste like you, you, you
Forever and ever and ever
I was dancing in your shoes
When I read your diary to
Try to get inside of you

Oh, why don't you give a little love now, baby?
A little bit of love

Alone, in the shower
Using my left hand so it feels like you
So please, I'm begging 
To feel something new

Dance in your shoes, read your diary to
Get inside of you, you, you
Forever and ever and ever
Cried on your nudes, wearing your perfume
Now I taste like you, you, you
Forever and ever and ever
I was dancing in your shoes
When I read your diary to
Try to get inside of you
