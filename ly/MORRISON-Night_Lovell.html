Thought I made it known, I wonder why they cannot seem uh
I got good intentions, it was just a bad idea
All these ups and downs come around, this shit makes up my life
(this shit makes up my life, bitch) ay, yeah, ay
If she say she's hungry then it's probably dick I'll feed her
Bitch, I fuck with you so much I'll climb the Burj Khalifa
I got too much pride, too much envy, yes, I got my fucking vices
(yes, I got my fucking vices, bitch) yeah, ay, yeah
Every since the start, there was just one thing that I said (ay)
I would never let this find a way into my head (yeah)
I just fight, I don't want it
but it's nice, fuck it, run it, what's the price?
(What's the motherfucking price) yeah, ay, yeah
We came from the block, there was no way we could ascend
So all this money that I spend, what the fuck did you expect? 
Bitch, I see it, then I want it, so I get it, I don't got no damn regret
(I don't got no damn regret, okay) ay, yeah, yeah
Every day that pass, it's another thing I lose
Overwork myself until I blow the fucking fuse
Now I'm running off, ain't run far enough
this shit hurts me so I'm signing off
Ay, let's go (shit)

I go where I want, I don't pay no fucking fee
They just wanna roll with me, I guess this the place to be
Dot my I'd and cross my Ts
I don't let nobody get this shit for free, ay, uh
Running through these motherfucking hoes, they be tryna move the goalpost
Ask me what's her name, what I look like, bitch? I don't know
I need time alone, I be driving 'round solo
bumper scrape the motherfucking ground 'cause it's so slow
She say wanna link, don't wanna fuck, I'm a no-show (no)
Met that bitch in SoHo, face pretty, ass so-so ('kay)
Throwback fifteen years we would buy our shoes at Globo
Now this my reality, I travel 'round the whole globe
It don't make no sense

Try to take me down
They did not succeed
And they miss me now
They miss me now
Now
Now, ay
Ah, ahh
