		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were a light
And a different point of view in retrospect
You're the one thing that was true
And you could take this darkened sky
And make it bright blue
And you could fix this
Broken mind and make it brand new

When I'm passing through all these hotel
Rooms like a silhouette
You're not making it easy to walk alone
I have to let you go

You were a light
And a different point of view
I just regret that I never let you through
But I can feel this life won't
Be so bright without you
'Cause we just need someone to
Say it's worth seeing through

When I'm passing through all these hotel
Rooms like a silhouette
You're not making it easy to walk alone
I have to let you go

When I'm passing through all these
Hotel rooms like a silhouette
You're not making it easy to walk alone
I have to let you go

When I'm passing through all these hotel
Rooms like a silhouette
You're not making it easy to walk alone
I have to let you go

When I'm passing through all these
Hotel rooms like a silhouette
You're not making it easy to walk alone
I have to let you go
