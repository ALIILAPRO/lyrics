		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My knife it's sharp and chrome
Come see inside my bones
All of the fiends are on the block
I'm the new king
I take the queen

See here we are all anemic
In here anemic and sweet, so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
So go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down

Go get your knife, go get your knife
Now kiss me

Ooh, I can float here forever
In this room 
We can't touch the floor 
In here
We're all anemic
In here anemic and sweet so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And kiss me

I could float here forever
You are ever sweet
Oh, I could float here forever
Oh, anemic and sweet, so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Can't feel a thing
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And kiss me
