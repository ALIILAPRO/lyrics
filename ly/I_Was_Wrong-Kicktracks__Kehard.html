		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try to build honesty
Give me time to be free
Can I use it
I thought you jump over it
But not, you don't freeze to stop this
And then I feel you gonna break the wall
Just let me know
I was thinking all the time, that I was wrong
Try to build honesty
Give me time to be free
Can I use it?
I thought you jump over it,=
But not, you don't freeze to stop this
And then I feel you gonna break the wall
Just let me know
I was thinking all the time, that I was wrong
