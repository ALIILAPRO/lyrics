		  (Mustard on the beat, ho)

Give me all that you got now
Make you want me 'cause I'm hot now
I'm gone, so faded, I'm on one
Bang, bang, pop off like a long gun

If you a lame nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice

We can mob all in the whip (make the money)
Make the money, make a grip (I be stuntin')
I be stuntin' with my clique (gettin' faded)
Getting faded 'til we trip (oh)

Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, bruh
Pour it on up 'til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll

I love to get 2 on
Let's roll
I love to get 2 on
I love to, let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let's roll
I love to get 2 on
I love 2, let's roll

Yeah we can get active
And all
My bitches attractive
We go
You know who we are now
Get high
Hotbox in my car now

If you a lame, nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice

We can mob all in the whip (make the money)
Make the money make a grip (I be stuntin')
I be stuntin' with my clique (gettin' faded)
Getting faded 'til we trip (oh)

Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, bruh
Pour it on up 'til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll

I love to get 2 on (I love it)
Let's roll
I love to get 2 on (I love it)
I love to, let's roll

Uh, pull your panties down from under you
Beat that pussy up, make you wanna holla Q
Drunk than a bitch, high on that Mary Jane
Pussy in my mouth, pussy on my pinky ring
Nasty, baby do it in the backseat
Swear this marijuana keep it cracking
Lights, camera, action
I ain't doing nothing 'til the cash
Money, money, money, weed, fashion
Draped up and dripped out, keep the trees passing
Girl toot that thing up, fuck me, fuck rapping
Days of our lives so clap, clap that cake
Spreading your thighs I pump, pump your brakes, ay

Just give me the trees and we can smoke it ya (smoke it ya)
Just give me the drink and we can pour it ya (pour it ya)
And my enemies, they see me living now (living now)
And if you roll with me, then you'll be winning now, oh

Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, bruh
Pour it on up 'til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll

I love to get 2 on (I love it)
Let's roll
I love to get 2 on (I love it)
I love to, let's roll
