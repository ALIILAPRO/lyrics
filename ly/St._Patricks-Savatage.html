		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey there Lord it's me
I wondered if you're free
Or not asleep
This just won't keep
It seems I just don't see

Why all the things we asked
Or prayed would come to pass
Have gone unheard
Like silent words
That slip into the past

For Lord they're not schemes
Can't you tell dreams
Why do you
Let them slip by
Never even tried

It isn't you don't hear
There's far too many tears
Or can't you feel
Are we unreal
To one who knows no peers

You say we must pay dues
But still I am confused
I need to walk
And with you talk
Instead of to statues

For Lord they're not schemes
Can't you tell dreams
Why do you
Let them slip by
Never even tried

You take all the fame
But who'll accept the blame
For all the hurts
Down here on earth
Unnecessary pain

For surely you must care
Or are you only air
Built in out minds
When we're in binds
And never really there

And can we be tired of you
Is that something that we're allowed to do
For even the blind change their view
And it's time we tried something new

And so I plead my case
I'll now pull my escape
Didn't mean to doubt
What it's about
Seems I forgot my place

But if you find the time
Please change the story line
Or give a call
Explain it all
I'll even leave the dime
