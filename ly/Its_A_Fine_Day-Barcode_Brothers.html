		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short walk
They walk by the cross
They look at the cross
They look at the sky

It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow

It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short walk
They walk by the cross
They look at the cross
They look at the sky

It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short walk
They walk by the cross
They look at the cross
They look at the sky

It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow
Repeat until endâ€¦
