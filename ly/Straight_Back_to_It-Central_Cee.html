		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You are now listening to Young Chencs)
"Always remember that, bro
When you was sleepin' on trains, and you're homeless
And your mums kicked you out and all them ting there?
People would've loved to shit on you
So now that you're doing your ting and you're gwarning, stay cooking"
Done a graveyard shift last night, woke up today and got
Got straight back to it

Done a graveyard shift last night
Woke up today and got straight back to it
Took me an L, no problem
I got on my grind, got straight back to it (back to it)
Had to handle a call in the middle of jeetin'
I put down my phone, got straight back to it
They freed my bro, got straight back to it
Bro-bro fresh home, got straight back to it (back to it)
Done a graveyard shift last night
Woke up today and got straight back to it
Took me an L, no problem
I got on my grind, got straight back to it (back to it)
Had to handle a call in the middle of jeetin'
I put down my phone, got straight back to it
They freed my bro, got straight back to it
Bro-bro fresh home, got straight back to it

Look, we all go through hard times
That's why it's "live yours" and it's not "live mine"
You gotta turn up sometimes, live life
You gotta work hard or you're not gon' shine
Told the promoter, "I'm not performin'
If I can't come with all of the guys"
I got the ball right now, it's my time
But I told bro-bro, "Go long, go wide"
They shot their shot but it was offside
It's from Virgil when I rock Off-White
No cap, this shit ain't no made up rhymes
Got a way with words, got away with crimes
Told lil' bro, "You're the next in line
But be patient, it'll take some time"
Don't think 'cah we ain't got back just yet
That we just gon' let it slide (slide)

Done a graveyard shift last night
Woke up today and got straight back to it
Took me an L, no problem
I got on my grind, got straight back to it 
Had to handle a call in the middle of jeetin'
I put down my phone, got straight back to it
They freed my bro, got straight back to it
Bro-bro fresh home, got straight back to it (back to it)
Done a graveyard shift last night
Woke up today and got straight back to it
Took me an L, no problem
I got on my grind, got straight back to it (back to it)
Had to handle a call in the middle of jeetin'
I put down my phone, got straight back to it
They freed my bro, got straight back to it
Bro-bro fresh home, got straight back to it

I thought this shit was hip-hop
Not gonna lie, I'm a bit disappointed
Certain man wanna move like divas
What can I say? It's for entertainment
I fucked shawty, and I left her high and dry
It's deep, she thought I was stayin'
Fuck, I just lived up to the stereotype that we're all the same, shame
Uh, she wanna get slapped in the face, uh
I'm afraid it's a bit too kinky, and I'm not tryna catch me a case
Say what I want, you don't have to relate
Unlike most of these artists that's lyin', I'm actually paid
I don't want aftermarket diamonds, man, I want factory made
OGs need to get back to reality
I don't wanna hear about back in the day
Go on the 'net, all I hear is "Cench"
I don't wanna hear them chattin' my name
All of these guys try cat the campaign
I feel like Usher, I trap in the rain
Been through a lot, I can handle the fame
I waste no time gettin' straight back to it (back to it, back to it)

"You need to remember, brother, yeah
First they love you, then they hate you
Then they love you again"
(Can't waste no time, get straight back to it)
"And when you come up you're off
You know you can't do no wrong
You know you're golden boy
And then they start tryna slowly find chinks in your armor
And things to tear you down"

Done a graveyard shift last night
Woke up today and got straight back to it
Took me an L, no problem
I got on my grind, got straight back to it (back to it)
Had to handle a call in the middle of jeetin'
I put down my phone, got straight back to it
They freed my bro, got straight back to it
Bro-bro fresh home, got straight back to it (back to it)
