		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since they wanna know
Since they wanna know
(I said)
Since they wanna know
Here's the formula on O, now let's go

(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know

Second rounds on me
Obie Trice, Emil hit 'em, let's go

Ob Trice, the giant, standing a 5'8" stature
Back with a second album, supplying ya Fear Factor
But Joe ain't the host my nigga, you have the access to the most
Noted flow on Shady's faction

And I ain't being cocky, if so accept my apology
Except, know I process my thoughts logically
First weeks sales tops the toll from tsunami
But haters like the L, it's the white boy behind me

But you couldn't inhale a flow that's more grimy
It would still prevail if another label sign me
Obie so timely, must Obie remind 'em
The first nigga to shine solo from the place ya find 'em

Native Detroiter, ghetto reporter, hit you wit some
Heavy metal for supporting what ya caught us
A little something different from the homie from Michigan
Basically, Obie's ripping on any instrument he's given, come on

(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(End what's right and why am I immature?)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know

Four niggas in a whip
All fo' say they ain't fucking with Trice shit
Somebody's lying, I'm undenying, denying me means that
The driver got influence over you on certain things

Be distinguished just 'cause you ain't feeling his favorite emcee
Don't mean you speak no English
Hop out the car, catch the bus
At least you be established as the man that you are

I hate to take it so far and so tedious
But niggas bleed like bitches, I'm truly believing this
Once a month, they wake up
With a Obie tampon inserted in they nuts

Give em the flux 'cause my bucks is up
And no this ain't eBay, so please be easy
Gotta be delusional to think Obie is losing yo
Let 'em get a whiff of some shit, they quick to abuse it though

(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(End what's right and why am I immature?)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know

Peep what O's selling when I hit 'em with Van Halen
But it's just a man from the ghetto rebelling
Rebel without a 'cause, 'cause I'm in them Superman drawers
Running around the shack momma had us living

Now ya mans living a inch from truly killing 'em
A dude or ambition, a gift, given from the man who invented 'em
When the system scrooged just like Lil' Tim and Em'

Will bless the child who maneuvers the censors, then
Spitting venom, have them same dudes interested in him
My visions unlimited, music's my outlet, I rock a outfit

For all the foul shit I witnessed, make it my business
To get a listener of one clear description
If you hearing them, you would catch what I'm pitching
Guarantee to serve your addiction, come on

(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine, I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(End what's right and why am I immature?)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
