		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (The fuck?)

You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights
We walked in comfy silence
Footsteps down familiar sidewalk
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night

All my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Ridin' shotgun next to your free Slurpee
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true

Mmm
Mmm, hmm

We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac and cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights

Oh, all my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Oh, they just stand there while we're takin' shots of Brandy
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true

I can see it now
The wedding of the year
I can see it now
He stands up there and wipes his tears
I can see it now
When all my ghosts disappear
I can see it crystal clear

You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

And all my ghosts were with me
I know you felt them too
Watchin' as I started to get dizzy
'Cause I hate all of my habits
But I happen to love you
I hope that's true

(Fuck yeah)
(Fuck yeah)
