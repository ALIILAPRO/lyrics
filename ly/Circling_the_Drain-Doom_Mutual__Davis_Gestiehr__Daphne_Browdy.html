		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted you to find me
I wanted you to feel the way that I
Fell and hit the bottom
I wanted you to taste the mess inside my mind
I try to put fires out
I need a little bit of help
If you're the trap, I'm the mouse
But I did it to myself
Bleach is pouring slowly
Watch it as I'm circling the drain
A hollow plastic body
Knowing how to chase the pain with pain
I try to put fires out
I need a little bit of help
If you're the trap, I'm the mouse
But I did it to myself
I wanted you to find me
I wanted you to feel the way that I
Fell and hit the bottom
I wanted you to taste the mess inside my mind
I try to put fires out
I need a little bit of help
If you're the trap, I'm the mouse
But I did it to myself
I try to put fires out
I need a little bit of help
If you're the trap, I'm the mouse
But I did it to myself
