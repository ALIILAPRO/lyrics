		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world doesn't need another dream girl (dream girl)
The world doesn't need another dream girl (dream girl)

I don't care, this is life
It's not fair, it's not right
All that hope and that pride
It's a waste, it's a lie
All you want is to breath
Little girls should run free
But your corset's too tight
And your heels are too high

This treasure you found, bury it
The only way out, marry it
That shadow of doubt, carry it
Carry it down to your grave, oh
The world doesn't need another dream girl (dream girl)
The world doesn't need another dream girl (dream girl)

You're too dumb, you're too young
Full of heart, so naive
You're so blind, you're so green
You'll give up, just like me, oh
The wings are ornamental
They have no intention of letting you fly
Don't be sentimental, from legend to born in a wrong time

Treasure you found (bury it)
The only way out (marry it)
That shadow of doubt (carry it)
Carry it down to your grave

(Bury it)
Marry it
Carry it
Carry it down to your grave (bury it)
Your grave, your grave (marry it, carry it)
(Oh-oh)
(Go bury it) bury it
(Marry it) I marry it
(Carry it) carry it
No, no, no, no, (the world doesn't need another dream girl)

(Go bury it) bury it
(Marry it) I marry it
(Carry it) carry it
Oh (so bury it, marry it, carry it, carry it)
(Carry it down to your grave, your grave, your grave)

Down to your damn grave
There's no way out
No, we don't have a choice
They always win and then we lose our voice
Don't you know you're leaving
Don't you know you're leaving
Don't you know you're leaving me on time

The world doesn't need another dream girl (bury it, marry it, carry it)
The world doesn't need another dream girl (bury it, marry it, carry it)
Another dream girl

The world doesn't need another dream girl
