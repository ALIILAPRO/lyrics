		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why you wanna climb up the waterfall
Truth be told, just fight the way you think cause it's over now

I wanna believe you, but it's falling apart
Stop bringing me down as I'm living my dream like a wonder
Every breath that I take makes me younger
Living my dream like a wonder, every breath that I take makes me younger

What do you see, what do you see from behind the wall
Angel in descies it's the game we play I can't wrap my head around 

You say I'm beneath you, you wanted it all
I don't think I need you, I'm making the call

Stop bringing me down as I'm living my dream like a wonder
Every breath that I take makes me younger.
