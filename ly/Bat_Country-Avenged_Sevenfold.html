		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (He who makes a beast out of himself)
(Gets rid of the pain of being a man)

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried to drive on through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

As I adjust to my new sights 
The rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger and I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction follows me, show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me 
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by 
Don't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it right

I'll make a beast out of myself 
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me 
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all 
These good ideas will tear your brains apart
Scared but you can follow me 
I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die
