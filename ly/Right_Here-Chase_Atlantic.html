		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so far from the line, yeah
I'm too deep in my mind, yeah
If she calls, I'll be right there
That's three calls in a night, yeah

Well, tell me what you think about
Staying right here instead
I didn't hear a word she said
I wasn't that high, I swear

Well girl, what do you think about
Staying right here in bed?
I didn't hear a word you said
I wasn't that high, I swear

It's happening again
Well, I don't give a fuck about your friends
I'm right here
Here

Oh, baby, take a look around
I'm the only one that hasn't walked out
I'm right here
Here

One draw at a time, yeah
One more, you'll be fine, yeah
And I swear she was right there
The blue glow and the nightwear

Tell me what you think about
Staying right here instead
I didn't hear a word she said
Wasn't that high, I swear it

And she don't wanna fuck around
And I don't wanna leave this bed
I didn't hear a word she said
Wasn't that high, I swear (one, two, three)

It's happening again
Well, I don't give a fuck about your friends
I'm right here
Here

Oh, baby take a look around
I'm the only one that hasn't walked out
I'm right here
Here

I'm always ready to go
I'm calling you, pick up your phone
I'm on my own, girl, I've been taking it slow
You know I've been taking it slow

You're sitting alone
Why are you sitting alone?
Baby, just pick up your phone, oh
'Cause I've been rolling all damn night, woo

It's happening again
Well, I don't give a fuck about your friends
I'm right here
Here

Oh, baby take a look around
I'm the only one that hasn't walked out
I'm right here
Here
