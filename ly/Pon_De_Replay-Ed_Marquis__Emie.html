It goes one by one, and two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
Let's go, dip it low, then you bring it up slow
Wind it up one time, wind it back once more

Come run, run
Everybody move, run
Lemme see you move and rock it 'til the groove done
Shake it 'til the moon becomes the sun (sun)
Everybody in the club, give me a run (run)
If you ready to move say "Yeah, yeah"
One time for your mind say "Yeah, yeah"
Well, I'm ready for ya
Come let me show ya
You want to groove, I'ma show you how to move
