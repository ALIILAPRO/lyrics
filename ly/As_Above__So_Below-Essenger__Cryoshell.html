		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this real,
The fear I feel when the noise starts dying down
Is it true
That there’s a place for you when the sun burns out

Don’t you fear that it’s too late to turn the tide
These machines were never built to make things right

Wake me now
The world outside is dying
While we slowly drown
Not living, just surviving
Locked in your paradise
Our sanctuary burns while you play god
As above, so below
So below

Is there a cure
The sky obscured and the monsters crawling out
I’m not scared
I won’t die in here while the world burns down

Don’t you fear that it’s too late to turn the tide
These machines were never built to burn alive

Wake me now
The world outside is dying
While we slowly drown
Not living, just surviving
Locked in your paradise
Our sanctuary burns while you play god
As above, so below

Who will take our place
If this becomes our fate
(Have we sealed our fate)
(Could it not be too late)
I want to see the stars
Before they fade too far
(I can’t see the stars)
(Have we gone too far)

Wake me now
The world outside is dying
While we slowly drown
Not living, just surviving
Locked in your paradise
Our sanctuary burns while you play god
As above, so below
So below

As above, so below
