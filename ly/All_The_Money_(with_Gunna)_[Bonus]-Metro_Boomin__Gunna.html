		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Metro)

This time around we want all the money (yeah)
This time around we want all the money (yeah)
This time around we want all the money (all of it)
This time around we want all the money
Twenty-six bitches and all 'em love me (yeah)
Watch on they wrists and all 'em flooded (ice)
We the real big dogs, and y'all some puppies
(Y'all some puppies)

Yeah, it's the Young Wunna, robust
Got his smoke on and this ain't no Obama
Straight from Atlanta, finesse, Arm & Hammer
I say that with honor in Dior pajamas (ayy)
Couldn't play no sports but I went got that set (uh-uh)
Bring it back to trap, got respect from my brother (yeah)
C.I.P. Troup, I'm with Duke, he wit' slime and that slatt
Yeah, that slatt, we don't care 'bout no color (slatt)
Put that shit on, put that drip shit on the map
Yeah, the trap, and I bought a few homes
Spent the six-fifty, Rolls Cullinan and a Bentley (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Then I went Maybach, two-tone
Got a two-tone, this a motherfuckin' pandemic
Must be too rich, I can't feel it (I can't feel it)
Told them to kill it, they tryna cutthroat the city
These niggas sweeter than Chevy (sweet)
Rappers mad, all in they feelings (shit, they mad)
Gunna fuckin' they bitches (so?)
Drop top, parkin' lot pimpin' (uh-huh)
Pimped out my whips like Xzibit
All my life I just wanted a mili'
What's on your wrist? Richard Millie
With Lil Uzi when I'm out in Philly
Don't show you broke boys no pity

This time around we want all the money (yeah)
This time around we want all the money (yeah)
This time around we want all the money (all of it)
This time around we want all the money
Twenty-six bitches and all 'em love me (yeah)
Watch on they wrists and all 'em flooded (ice)
We the real big dogs, and y'all some puppies
(Y'all some puppies)

Act like you rich, you don't take care of your people (no)
Those the type niggas that can't get a feature (no)
'Member fuckin' hoes under the bleachers (yeah)
You know I hit like a beeper
Who the fuck said it was cheaper to keep her? (Who?)
Worker get so fresh I thought it was Easter (ah)
A lot of these rappers just follow the leader (follow the leader)
FN on my lap, but I got a few ninas
Look at my chest, you gon' see Aquafina (look it)
Look at my bitch, got a fat ass like Trina (look)
Motherfuck the cost and adjust the subpoena (whoa)
It's hot on my block, check your top like a fever (ha)
Everybody sharp, ain't got no snooze on the watch
Ain't got no snooze on the watch
Count up when it drop, in school, I had drugs in my socks
Been had the love for a knot

This time around we want all the money (yeah)
This time around we want all the money (yeah)
This time around we want all the money (all of it)
This time around we want all the money
Twenty-six bitches and all 'em love me (yeah)
Watch on they wrists and all 'em flooded (ice)
We the real big dogs, and y'all some puppies
(Y'all some puppies)

This time around we want all the money
This time around we want all the money
This time around we want all the money
This time around we want all the money
