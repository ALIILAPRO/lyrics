		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE 01:
I can't deny,
After last night I can't help 
But to think bout' your body in stride,
So when I look in your eyes,
All I see, all I know is

PRE-CHORUS 01:
Lay down, lay down for me,
And you'll finally be,
Laid down, lay down,
Just come my -

CHORUS 01:
Way, cause even if I'm here for some fun,
I'll stay, a little while until this is done,
So I'm only here right now,
Said I'm only here for now,
So baby just come my way,
Just come, don't come, 
Don't come in my way

VERSE 02:
Cautious, cautious,
Taking your time, spending your nights in regardless,
You know what you want when you're honest,
Won't you lay down, Just lay down just

PRE-CHORUS 02:
Lay down, lay down for me,
And you'll finally be,
Laid down, lay down,
Just come my -

CHORUS 02:
Way, cause even if I'm here for some fun,
I'll stay, a little while until this is done,
So I'm only here right now,
Said I'm only here for now,
So baby just come my way,
Just come, don't come, 
Don't come in my way

POST-CHORUS 01:
If you need someone,
I'm better off alone,
If you need someone,
I need you back at home
