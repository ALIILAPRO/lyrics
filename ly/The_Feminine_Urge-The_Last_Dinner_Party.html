		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A room at dusk
Mastering the art of lying still
Breathe like a girl
'Til my lungs fill

Oh, pull your boots on, boys
And push me down
I'm only here for your entertainment

I am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks
All the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love
Here comes the feminine urge, I know it so well
To nurture the wounds my mother held

Oh, ballerina bend under the weight of it all
Ain't it fun to hold the world in your hands?
Do you feel like a man when I can't talk back?
Do you want me or do you want control?
Failure to commit to the role, I admit
Was a failure you achieved on your own
Do you want me to care when you just disappear?
I can't win them all (I can't win them all)

Run 'til I fall
How I wish the trees would swallow me
Make me a forest
Take away my soul

I could never give
The curse to her
I- I could never live with the guilt of lying
That people are kind

I am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks
All the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love
Here comes the feminine urge, I know it so well
To nurture the wounds my mother held

Oh, ballerina bend under the weight of it all
Ain't it fun to hold the world in your hands?
Do you feel like a man when I can't talk back?
Do you want me or do you want control?
Failure to commit to the role, I admit
Was a failure you achieved on your own
Do you want me to care when you just disappear?
I can't win them all (I can't win them all)

I am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks
All the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love
Here comes the feminine urge, I know it so well
To nurture the wounds my mother held
Give me that dark red liquor stretched out on the rocks
All the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love
Here comes the feminine urge, I know it so well
To nurture the wounds my mother held
