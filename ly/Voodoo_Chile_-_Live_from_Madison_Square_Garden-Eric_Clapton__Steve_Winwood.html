		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'm a voodoo chile
Oh no, I'm a voodoo chile

On the night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
On the night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
My mother cried "lord, the gypsy was right!"
I seen her fell down right dead

Mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagle's wing
Mountain lions found me waiting
And set me on a eagle's wing
He took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he came me back
It gave me a venus witch's ring
And I said "fly on, fly on"
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile, yeah

I made love to you in your sleep
Lord knows you'll feel no pain
Made love to you in your sleep
Lord knows you feel no pain
I'm a million miles away
But at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows, 'cause I'm a voodoo chile

My arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
My arrows are made of desire
From Jupiter's far away sulphur mines
Humming bird hums so loud
But you think you're losing your mind

Float in liquid gardens
And Arizona's new red sand
Float in liquid gardens
In Arizona's new red sand

Taste the honey from a flower named Blue
In California and then New York drowns as we hold hands

'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows, 'cause I'm a voodoo chile
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows, oh, 'cause I'm a voodoo chile
