		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause all I just wanted was your love 
Then birds in the sky sing our old songs 
You never really know what you got 'til it's all gone (all gone)
'Cause all I just wanted was your love 

It's like I hear you callin'
It's like I hear your fears 
I wake up in the morning
And you are never here

Stay with me, don't you leave
I can feel your heart, it's floating through the breeze 

'Cause all I just wanted was your love 
Then birds in the sky sing our old songs 
You never really know what you got 'til it's all gone
'Cause all I just wanted was your love 

I can hear your body
I can taste your tears
I'm drowning in your ocean
You watch me disappear 

Don't tell me that it's over
We're just getting older 
Remember what we said
No matter what's ahead 
Will only make us stronger

'Cause all I just wanted was your love 
Then birds in the sky sing our old songs 
You never really know what you got 'til it's all gone
'Cause all I just wanted was your love (your love)
