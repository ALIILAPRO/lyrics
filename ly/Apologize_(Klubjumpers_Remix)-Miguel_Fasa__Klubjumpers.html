		  Apologize by Miguel Fasa

I didn’t think I’d ever see your eyes
Fading away in the sunrise
I didn’t wanna let you leave my life
No, No

Never knew we’d ever say goodbye
Searching my mind trying to find out
How do I control the sands of time, ha

Cause when we got together, 
just couldn’t take it, 
energy rising, 
chemistry blazing, 
wearing that black dress 
lookin just right

But now I’m running 
to that place where 
I can see that pretty face 
and now it only happens 
closing my eyes

Cause all I feels remorse
And now I recognize 
That it’s all my fault
And I apologize

This distance drives me crazy
One kiss it took you to Breakthru 
I would love to travel the world baby
Slow dancing up in the moon

It’s you tonight, 
in the candle light, 
just hold me tight, 
would you

Cause when we got together, 
just couldn’t take it, 
energy rising, 
chemistry blazing, 
wearing that red dress 
lookin just right

But now I’m running 
to that place where 
I can see that pretty face 
and now it only happens 
closing my eyes

Cause all I feels remorse
And now I recognize 
That it’s all my fault
And I apologize

Cause all I feels remorse
And now I recognize 
That it’s all my fault
And I apologize

Cause all I feels remorse
And now I recognize 
That it’s all my fault
And I apologize
