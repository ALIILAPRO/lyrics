		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me to, where they have Dune seas. 
I don't care what they've done to me.

The girl in the sky, her blue in blue eyes
she's holding up the world
with her hands in the pockets constructing the prophets 
that you tried to ban.

So, how high must I go? 
Before I know,
that it's too far to fall? 
So, how high must I go? 
Before I know,
that it's too far to fall?

Wake me up, when we reach the sea. 
I donâ€™t care, nothing is waking me.

We pray to the sky, our blue in blue eyes -
we're holding up the world
with our hands in the pockets constructing the prophets 
that you tred to ban.

So, how high must I go? 
Before I know,
that it's too far to fall? 
So, how high must I go? 
Before I know,
that it's too far to fall?

Breaking the bones cuz i've known what i've known too long 
Holding the phone, cuz i've shown what i've shown - it's wrong. 
Breaking the bones cuz i've known what i've known too long 
Holding the phone, cuz i know what i know - it's wrong.
