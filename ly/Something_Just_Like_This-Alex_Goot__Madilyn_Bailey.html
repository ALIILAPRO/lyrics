		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see
Myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and it's eclipse
And Superman unrolls a suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fit's

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

I want something just like this
I want something just like this

Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
