		  My bitches love me, yeah
My bitches love me, yeah (yeah)

They give me loyalty
I throw 'em money, yeah (uh)
I get my bread up (ah)
I got my bread up (yeah)

I put my mack down
She got her legs up
I'm in the background
Bitches lapped up
Throwin' ass up
Got me actin' up
I got it untucked
I got it untucked
Niggas schemin' up
Thinkin' I'ma bluff

My bitches love me, yeah (yeah)
My bitches love me, yeah (yeah)

They give me loyalty
I throw 'em money, yeah
I get 'em Gucci
They send me coochi (yeah)
She got that wet, wet
She in a 2 piece

We take the Bentley (skrt)
We got floor seats
Sittin' courtside
You in the nosebleed
I got gang, hoe
Gang hoe
They wanna see it, they know, they know
And I gotta keep the cash on, repeat
And my bitch with the shit, rob a nigga when he sleep, yeah

My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)
My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)
They get me everyday except the holiday (everyday, holiday)

Come and holla if you hear me
Got a watch, it worth a milli
And I get my ring on, ice froze, need a thermal
I just made that bitch my wife for the summer
And I'm catchin' W's, check the numbers
When she with the boy, she just do what she wanna
When she with you nigga, she just wanna get it over
Go both ways, she go both ways, no strip tease, a lot of foreplay

My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)
My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)

They get me great sex
They keep me comin' back
I get her Gucci
I get her Cartier
I get her Gucci (aye)
We up in Barney's (aye)
Show the 2 piece, spread that ass cheek (aye)
Keep it ghetto for me, like a swap meet (aye)
Keep it ghetto, like a swap meet (ghetto, swap meet)
You can find me, at the top suite (find me, top suite)

My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)
My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)

They get me room service, bring it to my bed
'Cause I'm a good lookin' nigga, I ain't tryna stunt (tryna stunt)
She get so fuckin' happy when I light the blunt (light the blunt)
Got these hoes goin' crazy 'cause I'm single now (single now)
If you cherish that girl, don't bring her around (her around)
I'm a good lookin' nigga, I'ma stunt (I'ma stunt)
I'm a good lookin' nigga, I'ma stunt (I'ma stunt)
Said, I'm a good lookin' nigga, I'ma stunt (I'ma stunt)
Said, I'm a good lookin' nigga, I'ma stunt (I'ma stunt)

My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)
My bitches love me, yeah (love me, yeah)
