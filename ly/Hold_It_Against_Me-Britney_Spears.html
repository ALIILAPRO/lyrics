		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
Little hazy
But, you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
Yeah, uh-huh, oh

Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
