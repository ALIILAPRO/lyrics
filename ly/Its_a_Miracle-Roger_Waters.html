		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miraculous you call it babe
You ain't seen nothing yet
They've got Pepsi in the Andes
McDonalds in Tibet

Yosemite's been turned into
A golf course for the Japs
The Dead Sea is alive with rap
Between the Tigris and Euphrates

There's a leisure centre now
They've got all kinds of sports
They've got Bermuda shorts
They had sex in Pennsylvania

A Brazilian grew a tree
A doctor in Manhattan
Saved a dying man for free
It's a miracle

Another Miracle
By the grace of God Almighty
And the pressures of the marketplace
The human race has civilized itself

It's a miracle
We've got warehouses of butter
We've got oceans of wine
We've got famine when we need it

Got designer crime
We've got Mercedes
We've got Porsche
Ferrari and Rolls Royce

We've got choice
She said meet me
In the Garden of Gethsemene my dear
The Lord said Peter I can see

Your house from here
An honest family man
Finally reaped what he had sown
A farmer in Ohio has just repaid a loan

It's a miracle
By the grace of God Almighty
And the pressures of the marketplace
The human race has civilized itself

It's a miracle
We cower in our shelters
With our hands over our ears
Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff

Runs for years and years and years
An earthquake hits the theater
But the operetta lingers
Then the piano lid comes down

And breaks his fucking fingers
It's a miracle
