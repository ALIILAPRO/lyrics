		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up alone
In the morning, with no one at my side
Could it be
I've waited too long
Waiting for the lucky one

My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend my time with
To give and share all my love

Back in bed
It's 3 AM with no one at my side
It gets real cold
Because these blankets
Will never warm my heart

My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share my love

My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone spend time with
To give and share all my love

My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
