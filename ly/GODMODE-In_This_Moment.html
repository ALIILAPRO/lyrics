		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)
What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)
What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)

Whatever you said to me
I wonder, wonder why
Whatever you said to me
I wonder, wonder why
Whatever you said to me
I wonder, wonder why
Whatever you said to me
I say "Fuck this"
I won't take this anymore
Your time has come for me to break
I won't fake it
I can't fight it anymore
I feel the split inside my head
I feel conquered
In the earth below, again
I'm gonna push and tear your throat
So keep coming
Back and forth and back again
Watch me now as I tear your sky down

You've got me feeling like God, yeah, yeah (godmode)
You've got me feeling so high, high (godmode)
You lift me off of my feet, yeah, yeah (godmode)
You've got me feeling like, feeling like I'm in godmode

(What did you say to me?)
I won't bow down
I won't bend the knee again
I've died a thousand deaths by far
Feel the walls crack
I feel them crashing into me
I feel it all my life
On this you can't stop me
I'm gonna shake the earth again
I'm gonna push and tear your throat
So keep coming
Back and forth and back again
Watch me now as I tear your sky down

(Godmode)
You've got me feeling like God, yeah, yeah (godmode)
You've got me feeling so high, high (godmode)
You lift me off of my feet, yeah, yeah (godmode)
You've got me feeling like, feeling like I'm in godmode
(Godmode)

What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)
What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)
(Godmode, godmode)

What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)
What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)
What did you say to me? (What did you say to me?)
Whatever you said to me
I wonder, wonder why

You've got me feeling like God, yeah, yeah (godmode)
You've got me feeling so high, high (godmode)
You lift me off of my feet, yeah, yeah (godmode)
You've got me feeling like, feeling like I'm in godmode
