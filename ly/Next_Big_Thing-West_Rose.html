		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn it up real loud
Bring the lights on down
If you wanna go then honey let's roll
And when can pick it up right now
Ima take it too far 
Ima tear you apart 
Everywhere I go ya everybody knows
I'm stunning like a work of art
 
Ohhhhh
Now Say My Name
Imma give you more
 
I'm coming out with a bang
Blowin' up I'm the next big thing
Everybody want my shine
If you want a piece better get in line
Ain't nobody do it like this
Go so hard no I just don't quit
I'm coming out with a bang
Blowin' up I'm the next big thing
 
Ya I run with the wolves
Always knew that I would
Put me to the test ya I'm about to flex
Like no one ever thought I could
They don't make 'em like me
Ima show you my teeth
When I get the call I'm coming for it all
I'll knock it out 1, 2, 3,
 
Ohhhhh
Now Say My Name
Imma give you more

I'm coming out with a bang
Blowin' up I'm the next big thing
Everybody want my shine
If you want a piece better get in line
Ain't nobody do it like this
Go so hard no I just don't quit
I'm coming out with a bang
Blowin' up I'm the next big thing
 
Do do you like me now
Do do you like
Do do you like me now
Do do you like

I'm coming out with a bang
Blowin' up I'm the next big thing
Everybody want my shine
If you want a piece better get in line
Ain't nobody do it like this
Go so hard no I just don't quit
I'm coming out with a bang
Blowin' up I'm the next big thing
