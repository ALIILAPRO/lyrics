		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just another busy day
With your favorite Thai tea and a bag of ice
You hand me a cup of Chamomile
Saying "be careful it's hot" as I'm occupied
With the work we've been working
There's no time for dating
I'm on my comfort zone to be alone
With you, as friends.. but
What if I love you
Would that be alright
And if I miss you
Would I be fine tonight
Its killing me
Its killing me
Oh Oh
I've been closing every door
Cause I'm afraid to lose it all
I'd rather hurt seeing you with someone
Than being in love just to hurt you
And I'm sorry for last night
When I left you hanging
From a kiss that should've been easy
I need my time, to think
What if I love you
Would that be alright
And if I miss you
Would I be fine tonight
Its killing me
Its killing me
Oh Oh
And if you love me
Would everything stay the same
And if you miss me
Would i feel some kind of way
Like butterflies, stay up til midnight
Thinking bout giving you my all
But all I see is you're so out of reach
Pull me close
Push you far
You're the red I'm the blue
But I'm lost without you
To be fair it's unfair
There's just something that can't keep us together
Even when both of us are doing fine
Maybe we're different, maybe we're not meant for each other
But what if I love you
Would that be alright?
