		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm fading away off some kind of drug
Maybe it's lust, maybe it's love
I know I said I'd straighten out a week ago
I'm feeling though, 'bout to reach my peak, you know
The city's got me falling off
I'm fading away, I'm losing my head
I know you said leave but fuck what you said
'Cause you've been steady, crawling on your knees again
You need a friend and I've been on the pills again

Baby's only twenty-three
Dancing under lights since she was seventeen
Her brain's flooded with ketamine
High from everybody, low from self-esteem
It's selfish but she never sleeps
Honestly, she needs a little sympathy
Look what's gotten into me?
But baby's only twenty-three
Baby's only twenty-three

I'm caught in the buzz
Another one down, I'm pushing my luck
The future's never looked so bright, it's blinding me
It's hard to see, I'm swimming through dopamine
Your body looks like heaven and
I wanna give up, I just wanna leave
I'm floating away, I'm caught in the breeze
But she's been so dramatic with these paragraphs
Her broken heart, chemicals can mend it fast

Baby's only twenty-three
Dancing under lights since she was seventeen
Her brain's flooded with ketamine
High from everybody, low from self-esteem
It's selfish but she never sleeps
Honestly, she needs a little sympathy
Look what's gotten into me?
But baby's only twenty-three
Yeah, baby's only twenty-three

I can't believe this is happening
What did I do? What did she do to me?
This isn't true to me, she's quite acute it seems
Now I'm seeking therapy, she won't be there for me
Mending my brain again, please don't give up on me
This hurts tremendously
How will this end for me? Deal with this happening
Deal with this

Fuck it she's dead to me
I'm on her frequency
I know the shit that she's thinking
I know the shit that she's thinking
I'm on her frequency

Baby's only twenty-three
Dancing under lights since she was seventeen
Her brain's flooded with ketamine
High from everybody, low from self-esteem
It's selfish but she never sleeps
Honestly, she needs a little sympathy
Look what's gotten into me?
But baby's only twenty-three
Baby's only twenty-three
