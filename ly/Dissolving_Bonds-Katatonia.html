		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And here you are
So much time did you waste from times before
So shut down your sky
Bow down, lights out and die

And now you go
The cold chill cracks a positive self-detach
Inanimate heart
Hurting razor throat

A destined goodbye
Bells rang out the day of your worst fear
Obscure grduation day
Left you but with memories to bear
Lost in the hopelessness
Seclusion cut your just as deep as knives
Dissolving the bonds
Time was set to fade away your lives

You said you would always your love
You said you would always be caring
Y ou said you would never abandon
You said you said
