		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything costs something bro
When it's somewhere somewhere else you just lost something yo
The cost of opportunities is always good to know
But if you know that then you're good to go
Yeah, no dreams too big
Chase anything you have the passion to do
Only a dream 'til it happen to you
Finally seeing money now I'm acting a fool
Never thought touring the world all year
Would be something I might actually do
Friends came through got me so high
I forgot who I was passin' it to
Party in a mansion splash in a pool
Reminiscing those days back in the school
My whole crew would come through and rap with us too
Couple of them big goes packin' it too
Go ahead try and talk shit on me
I squad up come back with a crew
Call me a bitch see what that's gonna do
Fights in the streets like that shit was cool

Yeah, we used to do dumb shit daily
Dreamed since I was just a baby
Now I'm here it's "Fuck you, pay me"
I just had enough of waiting
I worked hard, they stuck with lazy
If I stayed I just went crazy
People change, everything's in constant motion
My old girl's across the ocean
Some stuff stay well that's devotion
Some folks stay some come and go
And what you think is what you know
I must run fast you're running slow
Smoke, break down some Kush and roll a Dutch
Right now my vibe is so alive so please
When we smoke just hush
Me and some of those who's closest to me haven't spoken much
Crazy when you learn the cost of blowing up
Yeah

I know I should keep in better touch
But that door it never shuts
Even when we chill I never said that much
Sometimes it's worth the bullshit sometimes you should let it flush
Yeah, but when I'm on tour now I just get a rush
Everything is hella plush
Get caught up in all the girls I get them stuff
Meanwhile I see some girls I used to know and get her wet and stuff
Having kids with full salary jobs while I'm just getting jumped
Missing every birthday and anniversary
Yesterday my moms got out of surgery
Wasn't even in town
Shows and after parties what I've been 'round
Finding out the news late
Imagine how that shit sound
Sit down priorities are all over the place and shit
Stress levels rise and that J gets lit
Try on shoes that Jay Z fit
Fuck all that complacent shit
I'm just dropping crazy shit
Trying to outdo those fool who think they can spit
But I can't even lie
All this real life shit is passing me by
Talking to myself and I'm asking me why
Would I feel better as an average guy
But I know that's just a lie
Pour up a glass and get high
Wondering if this Rockstar life taking a toll on me like I'm asking to die
Going on tour for 6 months,
Hug moms right after she sigh
Look up wish me luck
When you see that plane passing the sky
No Stress bullshit gets passed to the side
Working hard to make sure I'ma be the man when I die
Yeah

Hey Gerald, I just wanted to leave a message
And repeat just how proud I am of you
You have risen to the peaks of a behavior
And ah
Creativity, and
It's just the beginning Gerald
And it's going to be your life by the sounds of it
And I'm just so proud
I just had to call and sound like my
Cheery self when I'm happy
So anyway, it's just the beginning
You're going to be blown away
And you have your grounding, and yourself and that's so rare
So I'll talk to you soon and
Play on
Okay sweetie I love you, bye bye
