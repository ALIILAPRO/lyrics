		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're broken, so am I
I'm better off alone
No one to turn to and nothing to call my own
Outspoken, so am I
Explosive words that your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again

You're beaten, so am I
I've got a heart of stone
No medication can cure what has taken hold
You're hurting, so am I
When I awaken, remember why I've been running from your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

My blood is cold as ice
Or so I have been told
Show no emotion, and it can destroy your soul
Another sacrifice
To a tormentor your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again

You're angered, so am I
A thousand fires burn
A land of darkness from which I cannot return
You're aching, so am I
When I awaken, discover that I have been damaged by your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

You'll never be welcomed
Amongst the heartless monsters you surround yourself with
Feeding off the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal breed of sub-human parasites
Thrown into a feeding frenzy at the smell of fresh blood
Open your eyes and see the creatures for what they are
A swirling mess of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough to think you're unaffected
The conversion has already begun

You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching the movements and filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so am I
When I awaken, discover how I have been ravaged by your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world
