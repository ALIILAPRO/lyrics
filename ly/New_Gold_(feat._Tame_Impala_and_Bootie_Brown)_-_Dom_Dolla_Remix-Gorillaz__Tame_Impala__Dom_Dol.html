		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this city wonder

Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear (yo)
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear (yo)
Someone's out here
Who traveled far too many years
Nowhere, nowhere
Nothin' here is ever real (yo)
New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

Tilted in a Tesla, pardon the ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca, pardon the ex-wrest-, yo
Yo
Tilted in a Tesla, pardon the ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca, pardon the ex-wrest-, yo
Yo
Tilted in a Tesla, pardon the ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca, pardon the ex-wrest-, yo

New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear (yo)
Someone's out here
Who traveled far too many years (yo)
Nowhere, nowhere
Nothin' here is ever real (yo)
New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear, disappear (yo)

Desolate city where it hurts to smile
Ran into the Reverend, says it's been a while
I'm reining in a rando, she's a social scandal
Ran into the Reverend, says it's been a while
I'm moved to the spot, I'm one of a few
A whole lot of everything, but nothin' to do
Tilted in a Tesla, pardon the ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca, pardon the ex-wrest- (go)
Pardon the ex-wrestler, pardon the ex-wrestler

Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear

New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear (yo)
Someone's out here
Who traveled far too many years (yo)
Nowhere, nowhere
Nothin' here is ever real (yo)
New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

New gold, new gold (disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear)
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear (yo)
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

Tilted in a Tesla, pardon the ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca, pardon the ex-wrest-, yo
Yo
Spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, I'm wonderin'
Spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, yo
Yo
Spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, I'm wonderin'
Spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, spot, yo

New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear (yo)
Someone's out here
Who traveled far too many years (yo)
Nowhere, nowhere
Nothin' here is ever real (yo)
New gold, fool's gold
Everything will disappear

Yo
