		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in armor
You can't get close to me
You did that to me
Won't get warmer
Climate's changes for worse yeah
Rain and thunder alerts yeah
Gave it to me all yeah
Watched me get destroyed and
Crawl my way back up
Just to see me when I fall
Was it lust or
Was it just for fun or
Did you bend your soul to keep me happy?
But baby holding you is difficult
I see it in your eyes, they change
I see it when you're next to me
Loving you is difficult
I see the love on your gun yeah
Fire it straight to my heart yeah
No
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh broken woman
Left me out alone in these streets
Cold and unforgiven
Look at what you did to me
If you would only stop building those walls around your heart
Maybe we could spend less time on drifting apart
But I wouldn't even know where to start
Yeah you've been closed off from the get-go
It's like you don't see much potential in us
But I won't let you go
(You don't mean that)
Even if you're holding back
Baby I'll keep trying to bring your memories back
Trying to remind you of the times when it was real
(You remember that?)
Yeah
But was it ever real?
(It was real to me)
You got me questioning
Was it even love
Or was it always someone else above?
Was it lust then
Was it just for fun and
Did you bend your soul to keep me happy?
You tell me loving me is difficult
I see it in your eyes, they change
I see it when you're next to me
Loving you is difficult
I see the love on your gun yeah
Fire it straight to my heart yeah
No
Difficult
Ohh yeah
Difficult
Ohh
