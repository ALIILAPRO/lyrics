		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I don't cry anymore, I been waiting to see
Just how long I could go before my feelings got a hold on me
Gettin' out of the way, said I'm watching it fall
For too long I been underneath just looking up with no regard at all, oh

Got a heart like paper, said it's nothing major
The shit just makes it easy to fold, yeah
Got a mind like stone, but I could never know what's weighing me down
Said the nights been racing, running out of patience
Never worried 'bout it before
So if you're lighting can you keep it low?
And if you're blowing smoke you better blow it out your window

(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
Only until we got somewhere that we can go
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
So if you're lighting can you keep it low?
And if you're blowing smoke, baby
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)

Got a heart like paper, said it's nothing major
The shit just makes it easy to fold, yeah
Got a mind like stone, but I could never know what's weighing me down
Said the nights been racing, running out of patience
Never worried 'bout it before
So if you're lighting can you keep it low?
And if you're blowing smoke you better blow it out your window

(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
Only until we got somewhere that we could go
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
So if you're lighting can you keep it low?
(Could you blow it out the window, window?)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
(Could you blow it out the window?)
(Could you? Window, window)
