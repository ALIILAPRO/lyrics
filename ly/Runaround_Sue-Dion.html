		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Hey, hey
Whoa (bum de hey, de hey, de hey, hey)
Whoa (bum de hey, de hey, de hey, hey)
Whoa (bum de hey, de hey, de hey)
La, la, la, la

Whoa (hey, hey, bum de hey, de hey, de hey, hey)
(Bum de hey, de hey, de hey, hey)
(Bum de hey, de hey, de hey)
(Ah)

Yeah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl'll leave me with a broken heart
Ah, listen people what I'm telling you
A keep away from a Runaround Sue, yeah

I might miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of our hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't want to cry like I do
A keep away from a Runaround Sue

Whoa (hey, hey, bum de hey, de hey, de hey, hey)
Whoa (bum de hey, de hey, de hey, hey)
Whoa (bum de hey, de hey, de hey)
(Ah)

She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys

Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
Keep away from a Runaround Sue

Yeah, keep away from this girl
I know, know what she'll do
Keep away from Sue
(Ah)

She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys

Here's the moral and the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
Keep away from a Runaround Sue, yeah

Stay away from that girl
Don't you know what she'll do now
Whoa (hey, bum de hey, de hey, de hey, hey)
Whoa (hey, hey)
