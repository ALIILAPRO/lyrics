		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all

I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, woo ooh, woo ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, woo ooh, woo ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, woo ooh, woo ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground
How I spend my daytime
Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive
I make it fast and greasy
I'm numb and way too easy

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, woo ooh, woo ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, woo ooh, woo ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryin' to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, woo ooh, woo ooh

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain, oh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, woo ooh, woo ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, woo ooh, woo ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryin' to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, woo ooh, woo ooh

Uh-uh
