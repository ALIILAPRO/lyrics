		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind
Blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
One remains
Can only be what's true
If all was lost
Is more I gain
'Cause it led me back
To you

From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight
Tonight
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on

I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years
I chased their cheers
The crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop
And see you here
I remember who all this was for

And from now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
From now on

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again! 

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again! 

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again! 

From now on!

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again! 

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!

And we will come back home
And we will come back home (yes!)
Home, again!

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!

From now on!

These eyes will not be blinded by the lights!

From now on!

What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight!
It starts tonight!
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on!
From now on!
From now on!

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again!

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again!

And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home again!

From now on
From now on
Home again! (Ooh ooh)

From now on
From now on
Home again!
