		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still got a shoebox full of money
Sittin' at the top of my closet
From workin' like a dog
Got a chicken-scratch note pad
Of what I woulda said once I bought it
'Til she called it off
Now she's pickin' out menus and venues and DJs
And his cake and her cake, where the honeymoon gon' be
With a new 'do, with boo-coos of old cash
I swear that's the furthest damn thing from me

He went to Ole Miss, I went to work
He pushes paper, I push the dirt
He's got that clean cut, drivin' him a clean truck
I'm just sittin' here with a beer and my jeans tucked
He's tyin' cans on the bumper of a car
I'm tyin' one on, takin' it hard
Thinkin' 'bout him there with a white horse and carriage
Nearly three karats, he went to Jared
I went to the bar
Yeah, I went to the bar
What's your story, Wallen?

Haha, well
I got my own ceremony goin' on right here in the neon
With my best man Jack
It'll be a meter-on-a-dash smellin'-bad yellow cab takin' me home
He'll be in a Cadillac
On his ride to the airline
Saint Lucia next to the girl I should still be with

But he went to Ole Miss, I went to work
He pushes paper, I push the dirt
He's got that clean cut, drivin' him a clean truck
I'm just sittin' here with a beer and my jeans tucked
He's tyin' cans on the bumper of a car
I'm tyin' one on, takin' it hard
Thinkin' 'bout him there with a white horse and carriage
Nearly three karats, he went to Jared
I went to the bar
Yeah, I went to the bar
Yeah, I went to the bar

Yeah, well maybe I'm drunk and it ain't that bad
'Cause I ain't into girls, into guys like that
Hell naw

'Cause he went to Ole Miss, I went to work
He pushes paper, I push the dirt
He's got that clean cut, drivin' him a clean truck
I'm just sittin' here with a beer and my jeans tucked
He's tyin' cans on the bumper of a car (bumper of a car)
I'm tyin' one on, takin' it hard
Thinkin' 'bout him there with a white horse and carriage
Nearly three karats, he went to Jared
I went to the bar
Yeah, I went to the bar
Yeah, I went to the bar
Yeah, yeah, I went to the bar
