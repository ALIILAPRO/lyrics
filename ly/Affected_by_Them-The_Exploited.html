		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its sad to say that children
No longer scared of dead bodies
Pass corpses everyday
No longer affected by them
No longer affected by them
No longer affected by them
No longer affected by them
No respect for human life
They become insensitive
Children all alone
What's the reason why
No longer affected by them
No longer affected by them
No longer affected by them
Once they were best friends
Now they're enemies
Drawn by the smell
Was the remains of children dying
