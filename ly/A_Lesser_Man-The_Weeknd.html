		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you don't even know
I'm a deadbeat man, never know when to fold
Spent a lot for your soul
You gon' make that back, I'ma take what I own
Far away from my home
In this hot-ass town, but my blood's still cold and
Better let them know

When you see them that you make sure they pay you
Pay you in cash
I don't do favors
I don't do that
You don't want to see me
See me get mad
No matter how bad you
You think I am, am

I'm a lesser man, a lesser man
A lesser man than you think I am
You think you know, but you have no idea
I'm a lesser man
You're the best of them, fuck the rest of them
I'm a lesser man
Than you know

Show the world what I know
How you work that tongue to collect their souls and
Seen you do it before
Make them fall in love, make them beg for more and
You could put on a show
You're my one top star, you're my bottom girl
And before you kiss 'em and go

Don't leave until you make sure they pay you
Pay you in cash
I don't do favors
I don't do that
You don't want to see me
See me get mad
No matter how bad you
You think I am, am

I'm a lesser man, a lesser man
A lesser man than you think I am
You think you know, but you have no idea
I'm a lesser man
You're the best of them, fuck the rest of them
I'm a lesser man
Than you know

A lesser man than you think I am
A lesser man than you think I am, I am, am
But I swear she know a long time
Ah
