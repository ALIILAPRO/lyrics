		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Diamond, diamond
Shinin', shinin'
Ooh boy
You so fine
Gotta be the finest thing
That I've seen in my life
I will pay whatever
Just to get a better view
And yeah, your body looks so sick
I think I caught the flu

Look at you
Look at you
Be my sweetie
Be my honey tonight

Look at you
Look at you
Be my sweetie
Be my honey tonight

'Cause you're beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop-drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

Boy, you know
You're beautiful
I know you heard it before
Boy, you know
You broke the mold
Nobody even come close
Nobody even come close
You're some kind of fine

You must be B-I-G
Because you got me hypnotized
Whoever said that beauty on the inside is a liar
'Cause, what I'm looking at right now
Would make a big girl cry
So fasten up your seat belt
It's gon' be a bumpy ride

Look at you
Look at you
Be my sweetie
Be my honey tonight

Look at you
Look at you
Be my sweetie
Be my honey tonight

'Cause you're beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop-drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

Boy, you know
You're beautiful
I know you heard it before
Boy, you know
You broke the mold
Nobody even come close
Nobody even come close
You're some kind of fine

Oh, I think I like you
Sabi
Boy, boy
Look at you
I wanna get, get, get next to you
Got me kinda hot
But, I ain't sweatin' you
Steamin' like like a pot full of vegetables

Boy, boy
Look at me
I know you wanna touch
But it ain't for free
I don't need your money
I just want your D
Boy, come over here with your sexy ass

'Cause you're beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop-drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
Beautiful
(Drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

Boy, you know
You're beautiful
I know you heard it before
Boy, you know
You broke the mold
Nobody even come close
Nobody even come close
You're some kind of fine

Oh
Yeah
Oh
Boy you know
