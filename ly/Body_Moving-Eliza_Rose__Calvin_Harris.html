		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, the beat in my body is looking to groove
Wanna get down, yeah, I'm looking to move
The beat in my body marches to a groove
Wanna get down, yeah, I'm looking to move
Deep, deep down, baby
Deep, deep down, baby (move)
De-deep, deep down, baby (baby)

When the lights go down
Moon goes up and the music sounds
Oh, I love it when the lights go down
Bodies moving like no one's around
Oh, I love it when the

Moon goes up
Oh, I love it when the
Bodies moving like no

Deep, deep down on the basement floor (deep)
That's where I grow, baby, that's where I flow
My body heats up as my figure goes numb
Toing and froing, bodies are flowing

The beams of the moon let the sun in (go in)
And your look of love keeps me running back
Running back, running back

When the lights go down
Moon goes up and the music sounds
Oh, I love it when the lights go down
Bodies moving like no one's around
Oh, I love it when the

Moon goes up
Oh, I love it when the
Bodies moving like no

Deep, deep down, baby (move, move)
Deep, deep down, baby (move, move), move
De-deep, deep down, baby (move, move)
Deep, deep down, baby (move, move)
Deep, deep down, baby (move, move)
Deep, deep down, baby (move, move)
De-deep, deep down, baby (move, move)
Deep, deep down, baby (move, move)
