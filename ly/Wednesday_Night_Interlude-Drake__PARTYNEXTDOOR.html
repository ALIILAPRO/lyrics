		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain't my fault, girl, 'cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I'm lonely
Mixin' Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm runnin' on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody's yacht
That you didn't buy
You're young, girl, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
'Cause fuck it, I'm not here to judge
Fuck it, I'm not here to love
Everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell ah ring
You and I got options, bae

But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I'm lonely
Mixin' Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm runnin' on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely

This shit ain't my fault
