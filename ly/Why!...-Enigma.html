		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was childish and unfair
To you, my only friend
I regret, but now it's too late 
I can't show you any more
The things I've learned from you
'Cause life just took you away 
I'm asking why
I'm asking why
Nobody gives an answer
I'm just asking why 
But someday we'll meet again
And I'll ask you 
I'll ask you why
Why it has to be like this
I'm asking you why
Please give me an answer 
Many years and stupid fights
Till we accept to see
How it was and it'll always be 
Why it has to be like this
Why we don't realize
Why we're too blind to see the one
Who's always on our side 
I'm asking why
I'm asking why
Nobody gives an answer
I'm just asking why 
Just tell me why Why it has to be like this
That the good ones disappear
I'm asking you why 
I'm asking why
I'm asking why
Nobody gives an answer
I'm just asking why 
I'm asking why
