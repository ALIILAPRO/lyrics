		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you say that I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Ooh, teach me tonight

Let's start with the A-B-C of it
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teachers stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Come on and teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write, I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teachers stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me, please teach me tonight
