		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been quite a while
You've really kept me wanting you
You've got some style, so unique
You're beautiful, so warm, so deep
Stay with me tonight
Let me know the kind o' love
that will remain forever be
A dream that you had made reality

Lovin' you, whoa
Is such an easy thing to do
No, you never know
It's drivin' me  crazy
Cause it grows and grows
But I won't let it stop, 
No I'm not givin' up
Lovin' you, lovin' you
Just a bit too much

It's been quite a while
I never felt so easily
Wonder how you broke my style
You're close to me I need you now
Stay with me tonight
It's got to be just too much love
I could remain and forever be
A dream that had become reality

Lovin' you, whoa
Is such an easy thing to do
No, you never know
It's drivin' me  crazy
Cause it grows and grows
But I won't let it stop, 
No I'm not givin' up
Lovin' you, lovin' you
Oh, lovin' you just a bit too much

Woh, lovin' you, whoa
Is such an easy thing to do
No, you never know
It's drivin' me  crazy
Cause it grows and grows
But I won't let it stop, 
No I'm not givin' up
Lovin' you, woh oh lovin you
Oh, lovin' you just a bit too much

Lovin' you, whoa
Is such an easy thing to do
No, you never know
It's drivin' me  crazy
Cause it grows and grows
But I won't let it stop, 
No I'm not givin' up
Lovin' you, lovin you
Oh, lovin you just a bit too much
