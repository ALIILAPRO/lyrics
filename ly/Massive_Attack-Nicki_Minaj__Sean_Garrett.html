		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Barbie bitches
We got Tom Tom's over here bigger than a monster
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

We got tom tom's over here bigger than a monster
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

Tom Tom like in Lebanon
Hotter than in Pakistan
Click click click young nick, the atomic bomb
Yeah, see ya then you lick ya tongue, bet that
It tastes good getcha some
Wicked, got ten bad bitches
We sh sh shut it down
Now the club got glitches, dig it?
And while you do that G-T's pullin' up
Yeah, spaceship E.T's in the cut, yeah
Pop a bottle just to get my head right
Tell a doctor go and get my meds right
Monster, you know it wouldn't be proper
If we didn't return with a big rocket launcher

Massive attack, mm massive attack
Got the bomb bombs make the whole club go back, eh
Bend the knees, jig 'em bring this one back back, eh
Like a swagger mom, bring on this track, eh
Massive attack, mm massive attack
What's been done done, mean no more say, that's that
Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night until we see the sun

So, so hot in here it feels like a jungle (yeah)
Me no like boys that ain't jumbo (yeah)
One time bust a shot for my champion
Girls, tell em guys super size me a combo
Kn-kn-know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the lambo
In the middle east on a camel
Running through the jungle rambo
Liberache's hand go
Swinging on a vine, mango (mango?)
So call me Simba little mama
Cause mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I, flyin' on that choppa just to buy balenciaga
It's just me Mr. Miagi and the phantom of the opera
Goin' blocka mothafucka
Got that big rocket launcher

Massive attack, mm massive attack
Got the bomb bombs make the whole club go back, eh
Bet the DJ gonn' bring this one back
Like a swagger mom, bring on this track, eh
Massive attack, mm massive attack
Whats the numba mean, no more say that's that eh
Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night until we see the sun

Detonate the bomb, detonate in the fire
Rose by the bucket
Money make an attire
Detonatin' my bomb, detonatin' them hits
Gonna buy out the bar
Oh my bitches is rich
Ya better duck when it comes
Better duck cause it's comin'
Best believe when you ru-ru-ru-runnin'
Now tell them rap bitches that Nicki said this
We got tom tom's over here bigger than a monster

We got tom tom's over here bigger than a monster
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
We got tom tom's over here bigger than a monster
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

Massive attack, mm massive attack
Got the bomb bombs make the whole club go back, eh
Bet the DJ gonn' bring this one back
Like a swagger mom, bring on this track, eh
Massive attack, mm massive attack
Whats the numba mean, no more say that's that eh
Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night until we see the sun
