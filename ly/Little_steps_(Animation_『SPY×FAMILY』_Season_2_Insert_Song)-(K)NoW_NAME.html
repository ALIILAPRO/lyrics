		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that there's a bell on the hill
Nobody's ever heard it ring
You were praying somebody would tell you
Tell you how to find your way

Now you found your true self
In little steps that you've been avoiding
It may take you a while
But maybe you'll find a flower
Along the way
The sun comes shining through for you

Now is the time for you to walk this way 
You can be the one who rings that bell
Everything is like hide-and-seek
Ready or not, here you go
Tomorrow you will see that yesterday
Was just like any other day
You only have now in your hands
You hold only now in your hands

When you're down finally you'll see
Good friends are with you
Wiping away bitter tears
They'll always be there for you
Telling you how much you're cared for

Now you found your true self
In little dreams that you've been drawing
It may take you a while
But maybe you'll find a good thing
Along the way
The sun comes shining through for you
For you

There's a bell only you can ring
Somebody is waiting for the time
To hear the sound coming from the hill
Just remember
you're braver than you believe

It is the time for you to walk this way 
You can be the one who rings that bell
Everything is like hide-and-seek
Here you go, here you go

Now is the time for you to walk this way 
You can be the one who rings that bell
Everything is like hide-and-seek
Ready or not, here you go
Tomorrow you will see that yesterday
Was just like any other day
You only have now in your hands
You hold only now in your hands
