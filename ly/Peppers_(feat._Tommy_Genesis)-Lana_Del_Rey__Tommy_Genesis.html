		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha

Me and my boyfriend listen to the Chili Peppers
We write hit songs without trying like all the time, all the time
I take off all my clothes, dance naked for the neighbors
I'm like, "Fuck it, gonna give a show", I open up the blinds

I threw caution to the wind, get onto the bike
Take a minute to yourself, skinny-dip in my mind
I'm in love
I'm in love
Got a knife in my jacket, honey, I'm divine
Baby, I'll bring the coffee if you bring the wine
I'm in love
I'm in love
('Cause I'm in love)

Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha

I sit upskirt, I don't have much to lose
I got a dog, I take it for a midnight, a midnight drive, yeah
My boyfriend tested positive for COVID, it don't matter
We've been kissing, so whatever he has, I have, I can't cry

I threw caution to the wind, get onto the bike
Take a minute for myself, skinny-dip in my mind
I'm in love
I'm in love
(I'm in love)

Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha

You know, you should, like, merge the songs (maybe you should do something like)
The Dick Dale type song (you know that song that's like)
Where like, the Wipeout I think?
You know what I'm saying? The one that's like, "Wipeout, Wipeout"

Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha

Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
