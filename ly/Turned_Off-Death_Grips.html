		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm smoking cigarettes in the shower when they get wet I just light another
Fatal cardiac over cancer don't gimme no suffer
Steal me over, feel me linger until I'm six under
Ain't a fucking thing sacred when I get naked

I'm lighting up like Vegas
All sevens king of pentacles
I'm chaining like it's money dirty money surgeon's general
As if my flesh keeps me prisoner
As if
I've been spinning chambers since the day I was born
Like what's it all for?
Like why the fuck not?
Fuck if I don't get off I don't know how to be caught

I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow

I'm turned off, won't be back soon
Look up, see my nuts slap the moon
I'm turned off like a myth
Can't look me up I don't exist
I spin the chamber 'tween my lips
I pull the trigger like a giff
I can't get hit I've never lost
I'm a rumor I'm turned off

My footprint precedes me, follow me
I'm all the way over my species
My footprint so dropped it's bottomless
Species call my Red Wings apocalypse
You want this bitch, I drop a bitch
Snuff your bloodclot metropolis
Trail of anonymous casualties
Pah pow boom mastery
I've been over that glass house
All my windows blacked out
Straight jacked up the fuck up
Guts up man down
My man stand down
I'm not with it
I drop liquid
Red light district
Can't be finished
You never started
You run for martyr
While I'd push harsher
Lose it more further
Lose it more nerder
Boom boom boom boom
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I get off at all cost
I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow

Take off my shirt cause it hurt form of murder
Art of indifference trump consequences
Like first off I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow

Trust me you, can't trust me try trust me you'll see why
When I see you through the ringer my ringer catch deuce deuce
I repeat like pi my ringer catch deuce deuce divided seven times
I'll lead you to where am I
I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow

I get off at all cost
I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
