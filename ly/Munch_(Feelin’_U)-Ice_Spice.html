		  Grrah
(Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT) grrah

You thought I was feelin' you? (Nah)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie, I get what I want, like
You thought I was feelin' you? (Nah, thought I was feelin' you?)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie, I get what I want, like (get what I want like)

Bitches ain't bad, let's keep it a bean
Know they be mad I be on the scene
Ass too fat, can't fit in a jean
You was my stitch but it's not what it seam
I got that wetty, I'm keepin' it clean
Fuckin' with niggas that's totin' a beam (grrah)
Sayin' you love me but what do you mean? (Grrah)
Pretty as fuck and he like that I'm mean
Baddest bitch out, you shittin' me? (Shittin' me)
If you ain't a baddie can't sit with me (sit with me)
I swear that these bitches my mini-mes (mini-me, grrah, grrah)
He wanna sex, niggas be dreamin' (dreamin')
I'm from the X, niggas be schemin' (schemin')
I'm on they necks, they is not breathin'
Thumbin' a check, blow it in Neiman's

You thought I was feelin' you? (Nah)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie I get what I want, like
You thought I was feelin' you? (Nah)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie I get what I want, like

Bitch, I'm a baddie I get what I please
You know my body, I do it with ease
He want my body, he tellin' me, "Please" (grrah)
I'm walkin' past him, he sniffin' my breeze
He jackin' me, but he not my boo (grrah)
He like the jewelry I wear on my boobs
How can I link you when I got a shoot? (Huh?)
Don't want your love, I just want the blue (huh?)
Grabbin' my ass while I'm doin' my dance
She keep on starin' 'cause shorty a fan (damn)
Gotta stick to the plan
He mad as fuck, I won't give him a chance
But still he gon' do what I say (do what I say)
I swear I be stuck in my ways (stuck in my ways)
But still he gon' do what I say (do what I say)
I swear I be stuck in my ways (grrah)

You thought I was feelin' you? (Nah)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie I get what I want, like
You thought I was feelin' you? (Nah, thought I was feelin' you?)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie I get what I want, like
