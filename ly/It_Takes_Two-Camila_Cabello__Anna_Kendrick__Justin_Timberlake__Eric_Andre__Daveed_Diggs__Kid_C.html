		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

There's somethin' stirrin' up inside of me
I never felt before
(Doesn't it hit you right?)
It's like I met another side of me
That I gotta explore
(Come and see what you'll find)

Now that you're with me, I can finally see
Colors that were up in my mind, didn't know I was blind
Now that I'm with you, sparks are flyin' loose
Fireworks go off in my brain, and I'll never be the same

I didn't know until I found you
Havin' the time of our lives, it takes two (it takes two)
When I look up, the stars are brighter
Now I know everything's better with you (it takes two)
You got me feelin' right, feelin' right
Feelin' like good vibes are at my door
Every day, every night, ooh-ooh (it takes two)
I didn't know until I found you
Havin' the time of our lives, it takes two (it takes two)

It takes me and you

Kaleidoscopic
I'm seein' different when I look at you
(Everything's lookin' bright)
No, I can't stop it now
I'm gettin' swept up in a feel good mood
(Feeling I can't deny)

Now that you're with me (yeah), I can finally see
Colors that were up in my mind, didn't know I was blind (didn't know I)
Now that I'm with you, sparks are flyin' loose
Fireworks go off in my brain, and I'll never be the same

I didn't know until I found you
Havin' the time of our lives, it takes two (it takes two)
When I look up, the stars are brighter
Now I know everything's better with you (it takes two, everything's better with you)
You got me feelin' right, feelin' right
Feelin' like good vibes are at my door (good vibes are at my door)
Every day, every night, ooh-ooh (it takes two)
I didn't know until I found you
Havin' the time of our lives, it takes two (it takes two)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Now (now), now that, now that we got it all together
Now we're together, we got it all (hey)
Now (now), now that (now that), now that we got it all together (hey)
Now we're together, we got it all (hey)

Now that you're with me, I can finally see
Colors that were up in my mind, mm-mm
Now that I'm with you, sparks are flyin' loose
Fireworks go off in my brain, and I'll never be the-
And I'll never be the same

I didn't know until I found you
Havin' the time of our lives, it takes two, ooh-ooh-ooh (it takes two)
When I look up, the stars are brighter
Now I know everything's better with you, ooh-ooh (it takes two)
You got me feelin' right, feelin' right
Feelin' like good vibes are at my door
Every day, every night, ooh-ooh (it takes two)
I didn't know until I found you ('til I found you)
Havin' the time of our lives, it takes two (it takes two)

It takes me and you
