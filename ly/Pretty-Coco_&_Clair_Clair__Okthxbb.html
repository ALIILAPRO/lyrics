		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woah
Yeah
Hey
Oh
Yeah
Aye

(Boy you look like a cock-a-doodle-doo)
Ah
Aye
Woah
Woah
Woah
Yeah, here's the track, yeah
(Ooh ah)

Y'all thought we left?
We'll never leave
New York City to Atlanta, baby

Alright

Yeah I'm sitting pretty
But I'll leave you scarred
Bout to pop some bottle on the fuckin boulevard (okay)
I don't need your car (pow pow)
Yeah my Uber's large (uh huh)
Lip gloss shining you see it from afar (pow pow)
Just like Michael Jackson I'm a smooth criminal
Just like Michael Jackson I'm a moon-walking hoe
I'm hanging with the cutest crew
You know how I do
Clair Clair too
We be pulling though
In the nicest silks
With the strongest drinks (pow...pow...pow)
You know what I mean
It's the sweetest thing
Honestly
Just look at you, then look at me (whoo, yeah)
I'm feelin pretty, no matter the city, we packin knives
And we out here ending lives
(All day, babyyy)

If I die tonight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude
Actin real goofy, but if I cuss you out, imma make it look pretty
If I start a fight imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if I get kicked out, imma make it look pretty

Get up out my face you look like a reptile (bow)
Need Bindi Irwin in case it's about to get wild (bow bow)
Don't follow me when you're looking like Vincent Gallo
Keep a taser in my purse, no that shit's not hollow
If I beat you up, imma make it look pretty, nails still intact and
Yeah I'm still witty
If we in this thing its about to get litty (bow)
You can have the spot light - in a little bitty, okay okay

If I die tonight, imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude
Actin real goofy, but if I cuss you out, imma make it look pretty
If I start a fight imma make it look pretty
Yeah I'm in your spot, yeah I'm in your city
Actin real rude, bad attitude, actin real goofy
But if I get kicked out, imma make it look pretty

Make it pretty make it pretty make it pretty make it pretty make it
