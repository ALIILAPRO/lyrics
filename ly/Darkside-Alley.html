		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cant see those signs, but they're all around you
Lonely in the night I lay without you
If you take yourself out, take me out to
Always feel like I’m running out of hours to
Call me over doing 90 down 65, I don’t see a sign not a red light
I’m always alive on a dead night
Never surprised to see my dark side
You're clouding up my mind never part time you’re always there
Miss you in the winter like the summer air
Won’t catch me complaining cause' it’s never fair
So hard to contain my mind is never there
You’re the only one that keeps me grounded, I don’t understand
I keep pretending I don't see the signs around you
I cant escape, can't find a way to get around you
My dark side when its all about you I can't
Escape my dark side it's all about you, Oh
Take another shot down and I'll be okay
I don't think this part of me will ever change, so
I can't find another way out, so stay out
I can't escape, can't find a way out, so stay out
I can't see those signs, but they’re all around you
And I can't escape, I can't escape
My dark side when its all about you
Take another shot down and hope that I'll be okay
but I can't escape, I can't escape
My dark side when it's all about you
I see it clearly now
You bring it out of me
I've got no room to fall for you and thats a tragedy
I'm not gonna lie
Might be the hardest thing
If I'm around you all the time but you cant tell its me
I keep pretending I don't see the signs around you
I cant escape, can't find a way to get around you
My dark side when its all about you I can't
Escape my dark side it's all about you, Oh
Take another shot down and I'll be okay
I don't think this part of me will ever change, so
I can't find another way out, so stay out
I can't escape, can't find a way out, so stay out
Take another shot down and hope that I'll be okay
but I, I can't escape, I can't escape
My dark side when its all about you
