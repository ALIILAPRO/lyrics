		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will dedicate and sacrifice my every-thing
For just a seconds worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer
Is there something more
Than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer

Help me carry on
Assure me it's ok to
Use my heart and not my eyes
To navigate the darkness
Will the ending be
Ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see
The ending to my story?

Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer
Is there something more
Than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer

So when and how will I know?

How much further do I have to go? (have to go)
And how much longer until I finally know? (finally know)
Cause I am looking and I just can't see what's in front of me
In front of me
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer
Is there something more
Than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer
