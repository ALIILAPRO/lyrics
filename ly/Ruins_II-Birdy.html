		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say what you want to 
Never cared much for talking 
Watching the walls move 
And all our secrets coming out 
What's left between us? 

You have the right to walk away 
It's all right in your hands 
But there's a dreamer that wants to believe that we're good enough 

If we lie here
We made our bed 
Stay forever 
In the lion's den 
But if we choose it 
We could see the light again 

If we die here 
What'll they say?
Another young love 
Gone to waste 
We're in ruins 
But oh, oh, babe 
I know that we can make it out 
I know we're gonna make it out 
Say we're gonna make it out 
Are we gonna make it out? 

All of the rest go 
Sitting back and losing 
Cracks in the ceiling 
And if you want to 
I'll fall right in your hands 
There's a dreamer that wants to believe that we're still enough 

If we lie here
We made our bed 
Stay forever 
In the lion's den 
But if we choose it 
We could see the light again, oh 

If we die here 
What'll they say 
Another young love 
Gone to waste 
We're in ruins 
But oh, oh, babe 
I know that we can make it out 
I know we're gonna make it out 
Say we're gonna make it out 
Are we gonna make it out?

Mm, out, out, out, out, out
Out, out, out, out, out

(We can make it out) you and I, you and I 
Were golden once 
You and I, you and I 
Were golden once 
You and I, you and I 
Were golden once 
You and I, you and I
