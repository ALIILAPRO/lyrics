		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I donʼt even know what Iʼm off of
just woke up and I still feel awful
Forever Club baby come join us

i live in a free world

but lately I feel locked up
Charged like a proton

I can hear the ocean
Backslash semicolon
My       heart is a giant igloo

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a  soulja

OK

I know TSA donʼt like me
why they wanna know
what I put inside my ice tea
Charged like a proton

I can hear the ocean
Backslash semicolon
Orange Tesla rollin

Logged into my space like it was 2003
Hit the weed but it feel like itʼs LSD
Paparazzi snappin pics

Celery

That boy dressed

like he work at Chuck E. Cheese


I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

OK

I donʼt even know what Iʼm off of
just woke up and I still feel awful
Forever Club baby come join us

i live in a free world

but lately I feel locked up
Charged like a proton

I can hear the ocean
Backslash semicolon
My heart is a giant igloo

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a murakami soulja

I donʼt know what they told ya
Iʼm a  soulja
