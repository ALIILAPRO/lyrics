		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Huh, uh, uh, uh (808 Mafia)
Huh, huh, uh, uh
Huh, huh, uh, uh

Barely holdin' on
This life get scary as it goes on
Burdens while we carry on
I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong
Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone
Starin' at the writin' on these headstones
They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong
That's what you wanted to tell me all along

Ain't hard to figure him out 'cause all his thoughts was tweeted
We blew some shots and shot him up, that's why his top was leakin'
'Cause I ain't never seen a nigga from his coffin speakin'
We picked that nigga off, he ain't think that we saw him creepin'
Sometimes I miss them days when me and bro was off it, tweakin'
I hate September 18th, that's when we lost a demon
Why the real ones always leave? That's what I get exhausted thinkin'
Can't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it
I'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead
They sent that text that Twinnem check, can't stomach what I read
Like life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on their ass
Don't wanna party, I stay in this lonely room instead
And I'm just

Barely holdin' on
This life get scary as it goes on
Burdens while we carry on
I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong
Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone
Starin' at the writin' on these headstones
They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong
That's what you wanted to tell me all along

Death in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine
Even though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine
Shots from that steel nine, ain't from that hillside
I'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time
A heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless
Sorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence
Gotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin'
I hope you know this
That I'm just

Barely holdin' on
This life get scary as it goes on
Burdens while we carry on
I ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong
Hope my secrets get buried when I'm gone
Starin' at the writin' on these headstones
They keep on tryna tell me, but I'm strong
That's what you wanted to tell me all along

Ooh, there's a power in your soul
Ooh, and I wanted you to know
