		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Diamonds shining on my body so heavenly
She a bad bitch from the hills
Call her Beverly
My mama told me keep up with the veggies
Know everyday I'm smoking some celery
Can’t fuck with a job, I need my own salary
No, not at all, I need my own calendar
I'm ready to ball, got my own cheerleaders
I won't ever fall, my time is always here
(yeah, yeah) i’ve been working, grinding it
For about a year, yeah
And now that this money came through
I'm looking like a chandelier

Stacking my chips like Dorito's
I came with that bitch she
Wanted all thе regals (yeah)
I fall like a bird a rеal seagull
Told that bih to do it with good real evil
(yuh) came with that bih not a regal
I do this for my team and my people
No, I am not a stunt double no Evel Knievel
I'm stacking these bands you
Know that shit regal
Movie Type, feel a bitch
Yeah, she's sucking my dick and
She ride on it
New money with my bitch she have
A fun time on it
Addicted to the pussy just like a vitamin
Rocking different slayers rocking
Some Vetements
Going out sad if you rockin the Lettermans
I run with that war, yeah Spider Man
All the kids hate it new kiddigran
Micheal Phelps, I'm wet are you kiddin me?
Boot off the drugs, don't care bout my kidney
All of them copy they want to be mini-me's
This bitch again, yeah you are killing me
Came with her friend again
The back of the Benz
Bitches go crazy they jump out the fence
Never renting, never bending
Diamonds on me they Peter Pan (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, this bitch she swears that I am dumb
Told her I never met
Said that we done got into that
I told that bitch she was a rat
Glocky yeah that was a wrap
But she was stupid as fuck said "can
You put some money into my CashApp"
(uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh)

Diamonds shining on my body so heavenly
She a bad bitch from the hills
Call her Beverly
My mama told me keep up with the veggies
Know everyday I’m smoking some celery
Can’t fuck with a job, I need my own salary
No, not at all, I need my own calendar
I'm ready to ball, got my own cheerleaders
I won’t ever fall, my time is always here
(yeah, yeah) i've been working, grinding it
For about a year, yeah
And now that this money came through
I'm looking like a chandelier

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah
I won't never bend I won’t fold, yeah
