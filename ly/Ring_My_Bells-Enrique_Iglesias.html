		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

Sometimes you love her
Sometimes you don't
Sometimes you need it then you don't and you let go

Sometimes we rush it
Sometimes we fall
It doesn't matter baby, we can take it real slow

'Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny
And the way that you move oh you make me feel alive
Come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

You try to hide it
I know you do
When all you really want is me to come and get you

You move in closer
I feel you breathe (I feel you breathe)
It's like the world just disappears when you're around me, oh

'Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny, oh yeah
And the way that you move oh you make me feel alive
So come on

And ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

I say you want, I say you need
I can tell by your face, you love the way it turns me on
I say you want, I say you need
I will do what it takes, I would never do you wrong

'Cause the way that we love is something that we can't fight, oh yeah
I just can't get enough, oh you make me feel alive, so come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
I say you want, I say you need (ring my bell, ring my bells)
(I can tell by the way you're looking at me, I turn you on) 
I say you want, I say you need
(If you got what it takes we don't have to wait, let's get it on)
Get it on
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
