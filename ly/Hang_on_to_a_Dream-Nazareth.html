		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I say she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do still loving you
It's all a dream
How can we
Hang on to a dream
How can it really be the way it seems
What can I do she's saying we're through
With how it was
What will I try still don't see why
She says the things she does
How can we
Hang on to a dream
How can it really be the way it seems
What can I say she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do still loving you
Is it all a dream
How can we
Hang on to a dream
How can it really be the way it seems
