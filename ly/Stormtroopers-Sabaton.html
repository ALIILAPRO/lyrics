		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now there's a standstill in the war, repeating what's been done before
It must come to an end, a few will transcend
They were under twenty five, and under fire they would thrive
The Sturmmann is born, their enemies scorn
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise

JÃ¤gers led the way, the pioneers would join the fray
Initiative gained, advancement sustained
Lead through direct command, as they're advancing through the land
Encircling their flanks, and ravage their ranks
Expose their reinforcements, destroying their lines
New doctrine in combat aligns
Infantry attacks, exposing the cracks
New combat ideals, on the Kaiserschlacht's fields

Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise
