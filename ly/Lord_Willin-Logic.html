		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay now this how I'm feeling
Lately I'm like the villain
'Cause while they on that other shit I been posted, out here chillin'
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin' in your whip while you drive
I've been living life, and I hope that you do the same
'Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
By that time they know the name
Numb it down for the pain
This music my Novacane
Lord willin' we over came
It's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back and I swear it's all the same
And what I learned, a profit don't do it for the profit gone get off
Check the topic watch me drop it, can you stop it
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before
But I'm still here and I just hope I'll make a difference, make a killin'

Lord willin'
Make a difference, Lord willin'
Uh, Lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em hold on
And yeah, you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em

I guess I'm back at it
I ain't done, I ain't had it
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit, I'm an addict
But can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass
They probably think it's automatic
Yes sir, I've done this shit before like your baby mama mama
I'ma tell 'em like it is, I'ma tell 'em like it is
Life isn't picture perfect
We use the negatives to develop
I'm well up I'm way up
Nothing but net fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions
I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way
But no not quite like this, live it like that
In a way, yes, you could say
Made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this on my level
I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Are you listening?
I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime
Waiting for the bus number nine
Through the city all alone
Not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing, maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl
Just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a living
Take this advice that I'm giving
Make a difference make a killin' make a killin'

Lord willin'
Make a difference, Lord willin'
Uh, Lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em hold on
And yeah, you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell 'em
