		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, mama liked the roses 
she grew them in the yard
But Winter always came around 
and made the growing way too hard
Oh, mama liked the roses 
and when she had the time
She'd decorate the living room
for all us kids to see

When I hear the Sunday bells 
ringing in the morning
I remember crying 
when she used to sing

Oh, mama liked the roses
but most of all she cared
About the way we learned to live
And if we said our prayers

You know I kept the family bible
With the rose that she saved inside
It was pressed between the pages
Like it had found a place to hide

Oh, mama liked the roses 
in such a special way
We bring them every Mother's Day
And put them on her grave
Oh, mama liked the roses

Mama liked the roses

Oh, mama liked the roses
