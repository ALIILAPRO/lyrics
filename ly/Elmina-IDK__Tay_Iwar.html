You are perfect

But I'm tryna see what's up, I want for we to grow
Your heart been vacant for some time, my lovin' need a home
Mister The, The Right Size
The way I feel, homie, bite-sized
This electric slide, ooh baby, let's electric slide

I really need to take my time
But I don't wanna waste no time
I wanna see yo' waist slow wind
I wanna see yo' body slow grind
I really need to take my time
But I don't wanna waste no time
I wanna see yo' waist slow wind
I wanna see yo' body slow grind

Expensive love got me feelin' nah-nah
This girl's too bad, I feel to give her my life

When you push up on me
You're movin' so hypnotic
You and me we on lovin'
Just keep it comin', yeah
