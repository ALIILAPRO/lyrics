		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Dark is the night
And all that is bright
Seems so far away
Hope for longer days

The sun seems so old
The light feels so cold
Stuck in a daze

The sky is so low
The clouds so mean
I'll take it slow
Until I've found out what remains

One step outside
There's nowhere to hide
No rules to abide by
I'll soon say goodbye

Always the same
How fragile a frame
It feels like a game

The sky is so low
The clouds so mean
I'll take it slow
Until I've found out what remains

Dark is the night
And all that is bright
Seems so far away
Hope for longer days

Oh they seem to be coming my way
And I've been craving them
But the light is here and I cherish it so"
