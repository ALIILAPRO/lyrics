		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The state of the nation, violation!
A broken promise is as good as a lie
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
And we will burn because we won't unite!

We won't witness anymore freedom.
Where is anybody? do we need 'em?
I would rather fight,
Than let another die.
We're the problem,
But we're also the solution
All hope is gone!

If you want you cannot take it from me
If you think you can, you still don't know me
Let me tell you, when I said it, I meant it
And I will always have the right to defend it

Fifty seconds, a hundred murders
The bill of rights is a bill of sale.
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your systems fail!?

We have made the present obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!
We've seen the fall of the elite.
Bury your life,
Take your disease.
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life
Take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone

The wretched are the wounded
The hungry starved to death
At a place where no-one goes
The air itself is a final breathe
So discontinue
The antiseptic cash charade
As the cry of justice comes
Our malignant fire fades

I am the reason your future suffers
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure distinction
I am the remedy, spit in my face
All your lies and wars are out-dated
All your subjects are dulling mind games
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
But doesn't matter when the only thing we love will die

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life,
Take your disease
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life,
Take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone
