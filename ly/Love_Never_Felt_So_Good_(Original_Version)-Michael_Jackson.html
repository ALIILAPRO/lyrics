Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, I can't wait
I can't take it 'cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in out baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good

Oh baby, love never felt so fine (so fine)
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night's good but it gets deep
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it 'cause

Baby, every time I love you
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, drivin' me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good

Aww baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if you're mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Aww baby, love never felt so good (so good)
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night's that is good
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it 'cause

Baby every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in 'n out baby
Tell me if you really love me
It's in and out my life, driving me crazy
'Cause baby, love never felt so good
So Good, oh we never felt so good oh
So good, it never felt so good, never felt so good
Yeah yeah it never felt so good
Uh never felt so good

Alright that's fine
That's it
