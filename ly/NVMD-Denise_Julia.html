		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh, back to where we started)
(Back to where we started, oh)
(Oh, back to when)
(Hey, baby)

It's been forty-five minutes you been blowing my phone
I mean, shit situation, it's outta control
My bad, I been so fired up in here
So when the coast is clear
I'm moving far out of reach

What I got on my mind
Is that I'm hurt and you like it
This ain't chess I ain't no side piece

But I bet you're too upset to even notice
I been trying hard to keep us floating
You wouldn't mind if I rewind it
Shit got me pretty honest
And I'm tired (I'm tired) of being open (being open)
'Cause we keep on going back to where we started (oh)

Never mind I said I wish you'd mind

Never mind I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind
If I end up with you one more time
Then I guess you're my favorite crime

That's right (that's right)
I'm out (I'm out)
But that's fine (that's fine)
'Cause I'm back to ('cause I'm back to)
Lying when I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind

Never mind I'll miss you
Before I kiss you
This song on repeat then reminisce you
I don't get the issue of being untrue, baby

When it all comes down I'm still up, waiting, wasting my breath
No, never get rest out of my impatience
Used to you I don't know if I can repent

But I bet you're too upset (upset) to even notice (notice)
I been trying hard to keep us floating
You wouldn't mind if I rewind it (rewind it)
Shit got me pretty honest
And I'm tired (I'm tired) of being open (being open)
'Cause we keep on going back to where we started (oh)

Never mind I said I wish you'd mind 

Never mind I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind
If I end up with you one more time
Then I guess you're my favorite crime

That's right (that's right)
I'm out (I'm out)
But that's fine (that's fine)
'Cause I'm back to ('cause I'm back to)
Lying when I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind

Oh, back to where we started
Back to where we started, oh
Oh, back to when
Never mind I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind
