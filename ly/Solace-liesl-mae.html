		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How
How do you go on
When it's been so long
Since you've woken up to feel the warmth of someone

I confess this hasn't been the easiest
I've watched the world transform right in front of me
All from my bed
Can you see why I feel so helpless

So just sit with me in the silence
Away from all the violence
At least just for a little while
Will you stay with me for a little while hm

I know that you feel it too
My dear so just stay
This is a safe place
To feel all the pain
And I know that you feel that all of this won't just go away
There's nothing I can say
That'll make it all okay

But for now just
Sit with me in the silence
Away from all the violence
At least just for a little while
Will you stay here for a little while
With me

And we'll just sit here in the silence
Away from all the violence
At least just for a little while
Just two of us for a little while

And when you're ready
We'll open our eyes again
I'll take your hand my friend
Things will be fine again
And so until then
Let's just pretend
