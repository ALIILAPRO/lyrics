		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes when I
Wanna run away and hide
When there's no one on my side
And all my pride had disappeared
I take it off my mind
And leave it all behind
Nothin' left to do but
Try to take the leap and follow through
And that's exactly what I'll do
I know to you I don't seem very strong
But I assure you before you can find me I'm gone
So come on and catch me you've still got a chance
But not for long
I'll be rollin' place to place
Won't stop till I win the race
Although I may have crossed the line
No time to waste on you
I don't plan on slowing down
No I'll keep on going
Even if you think I'm in the wrong
Just know that
Although I may not think everything through
I don't take back what I say or regret what I do
I know that some stay in line and they stick to the plan
But if you leave it to me I'll do whatever I can 'cause
I know that's what I'm here for
I don't wanna wait around anymore
Even if you can't see
The good inside me
I don't have the time to tell you
Why I do the things that I do
Just please hold on and soon you'll see
That I'm not the villain I appear to be
Movin' along, no I won't settle down
Until I'm locked behind bars or I'm kicked outta town
So you can keep on a runnin' around and around and around
But you will never quite catch up to me!
And I know you
Think I'm crazy
But I hope that maybe
Now you'll see why
I had to try!
