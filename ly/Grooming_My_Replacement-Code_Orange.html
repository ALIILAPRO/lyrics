		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Truth comes in twos
One is mine, one is yours
Gossip reaffirms
What you thought that you heard
Now you're deaf, blind dumb and confused
So you spew like a sewer of your truth
Until you purge it out
All those words that you puked
Turned our blue into brown

I'm grooming my replacement
Consuming all their hatred

The insects come to life
Under the movie lights
Keep a list in my mind of the times (all the times)
That you cried "neophyte" (that you whined)
You wear me like a suit
Spine upright, filled with screws
Stand up tall
Like your old man wanted you to
Show some gall and be mean
Like I want you to be

I'm grooming my replacement
Consuming all their hatred
I'm grooming my replacement
Consuming all their hatred

Accruing a debt that you can't afford
But you've heard it all, said it all, done it before
I gnawed at your center, I rotted your core

But you've heard it all, said it all (right?)
I'm already in your mind
Your brain's a vehicle for my failures

So give me the fucking light
Give me the light
Give me the fucking light
Give me the
