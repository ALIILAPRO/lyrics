		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to learn
When this thing called love
When it's a mirror baby
Can you see, all those parts of me
Broken across the world

I need to find
Some kind of peace of mind
It's a demon baby
When it comes
Like my oldest friend
Have you got a friend
In the night, you say

You miss me now
What a way to lose your head
You say
You miss me now
What a way to lose your head

What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to get ahead
What a way to go to bed
With those thoughts inside your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to go to bed

There's a place
I see it in your head
Full of evil baby
Can you see
All those parts of me
Broken across the world

You say
You miss me now
What a way to lose your head
You say
You miss me now
What a way to lose your head

What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to get ahead
What a way to go to bed
With those thoughts inside your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to go to bed

What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to get ahead
What a way to go to bed
With those thoughts inside your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to go to bed

What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed, babe
What a way to get ahead
