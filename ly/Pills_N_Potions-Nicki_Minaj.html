		  Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin' be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible that they love you
When really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em
I just reflect on 'em

Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

Yo, people'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you out a niggas' lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in the Benzy
I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy 
So I pop pills for 'em
Cop cribs in the hills on 'em

Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time we'll be fine
In due time

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
