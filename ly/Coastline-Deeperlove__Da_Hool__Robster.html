		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm moving far away

To a sunny place

Where it's just you and me

Feels like we're in a dream

You know what I mean

I'm leaving home for the coastline

Some place under the sun

I feel my heart for the first time

'Cause now I'm moving on, yeah I'm moving on

I'm moving far away

To a sunny place

Where it's just you and me

Feels like we're in a dream

You know what I mean

And there's a place that I've dreamed of

Where I can free my mind

I hear the sounds of the season

And lose all sense of time

I'm leaving home for the coastline

Some place under the sun

I feel my heart for the first time

'Cause now I'm moving on, yeah I'm moving on

I'm moving far away

To a sunny place

I'm moving far away

To a sunny place

I'm moving far away

To a sunny place

I'm moving far away

To a sunny place

I hear the sounds of the season

And lose all sense of time

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart

I'm leaving home, I feel my heart
