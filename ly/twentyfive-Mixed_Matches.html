		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You talk to much when i have something that i want to say
When all the time i look at you i wonder if I hate it and
Well i just to never see your face at twenty five
And if i do well i just think that i would run and hide
And i just hope to not recall your name at thirty five
And if i do then i guess i just wanted too much time

I didn't wanna make a fuss when i was eighteen at your house
But you just did too much to the point that i didn't know how
And i don't want to know what i
Could do to pass the time
Does it make sense to be bored well i can't tell
You always had something to say just to think i was dumb and
I guess you're right cause i don't think that i learned enough
But

You talk to much when i have something that i want to say
When all the time i look at you i wonder if I hate it and
Well i just to never see your face at twenty five
And if i do well i just think that i would run and hide
And i just hope to not recall your name at thirty five
And if i do then i guess i just wanted too much time
