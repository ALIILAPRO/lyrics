		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was Jesus' name
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on

Mary, Mark, Luke and John
All these prophets are dead and gone
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on 
Oh Lord, oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on

Well, I've never been to Heaven
But I've been told streets up there
Are lined with gold
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
