		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just walk in with the Taliban (BenjiCold, why you icy?) (Woo)
Ayy, I just walked in with the Taliban (woo)
Ayy, I just walked in with the Taliban (woo)
Ayy, ayy, I'm rockin' Chane'-ne, Dior the lens
(We got diamonds on us, on all the bands)
Yeah, I got the Tonka outside (woo)
I got these thots outside (ayy)
I'm on a Perc inside
I'ma geek up, ruin my life (yeah)
I'm on the phone with my demon (hey)
Poured a three in that bitch, that bitch bleedin' (ayy)
Mix it with the Perc, bitch, I been leanin', yeah
Pull up to the show, broke the ceilin' (yeah)
I'm in NY as high as the buildings
You a bitch, you just be in your feelings
I just pulled out the Lamb' and they billed me (ayy)

Yeah, tell me what ya said? (BenjiCold, why you icy?) (Ayy)
I went and put that bitch on, but I left her on read (ugh)
Bitch, just been loco on Percs, and some of 'em sittin' on my bed (ugh)
I don't do nothin' for nobody, bitches, they hear when I'm pressed (ugh)
We just been sending out packs
And we just be high all day (hey)
We only been speakin' 'em facts (huh)
And y'all like to lie all day (cap)
We really be gettin' them racks (yeag)
And y'all like to hide all day (hey)
These bitches really love us, no cappers (no cappers)
They all 'bout to come our way (woo)
I ain't even talkin' 'bout shit, I'm just talkin' 'bout life 
I'm just talkin' 'bout facts all day (woo)
I ain't even take yo' bitch, that bitch took me and she suck my soul away
I really just ran it the fuck up, I just made some M's, yeah, and I stayed out the way
Everything we do is real, we makin' some money, bitch, we don't got time to play
I don't know what the fuck you thought this was (ugh)
I don't know what the fuck you thought this was, you not nobody (ugh)
I don't know what the fuck you thought this was, ho, not yo' buddy (ugh)
I don't know what the fuck you thought this was, ho, you don't got no money (ugh)
Tell 'em I'd do it again (fuck 'em), tell 'em it's fuck on they friends (fuck 'em)
I got diamonds on my arm (yeah), I got diamonds on my lens (yeah)
All y'all rockin' is some Rick (some Rick), they don't got no fashion sense (lame)
Got no time to take a pic' (pic'), I got time to fuck her friend (hey)
I got time to buy the Benz (ugh), bitch, I did this shit the best
Bust a nut up on her chest, now that girl not playin' chess (yeah)
Is you doin' what I told you? Is you doin' what I said? (Ayy)
It ain't shit for me to hold you, all I do is count the bread (go)

I just walk in with the Taliban (BenjiCold, why you icy?) (Woo)
Ayy, I just walked in with the Taliban (woo)
Ayy, I just walked in with the Taliban (woo)
Ayy, ayy, I'm rockin' Chane'-ne, Dior the lens
(We got diamonds on us, on all the bands)
Yeah, I got the Tonka outside (woo)
I got these thots outside (ayy)
I'm on a Perc inside
I'ma geek up, ruin my life (yeah)
I'm on the phone with my demon (hey)
Poured a three in that bitch, that bitch bleedin' (ayy)
Mix it with the Perc, bitch, I been leanin', yeah
Pulled up to the show, broke the ceilin' (yeah)
I'm in NY as high as the buildings
You a bitch, you just be in your feelings
I just pulled out the Lamb' and they billed me (ayy)
