		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said that i am on your mind,
but im not yours and your not mine
This hole never felt like home
Now you'll reap what you have sown
Doe at age seventeen
Blind I gave him everything
Wounded by your selfish fangs
Black and blue you love the taste
So Hide within that empty hole
The one you dug all on your own
Bite the hand that fed your soul
Lonely boy is all you know
God sees through those broken eyes
Repent for your countless crimes
Your sins will be crucified
Absence will be bliss with time
Said that I am on your mind
but im not yours and you're not mine
This hole never felt like home
And Now you'll reap what you have sown
