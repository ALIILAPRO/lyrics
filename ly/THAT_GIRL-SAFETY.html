		  That girl
So tonight with this
What we're doing here
It all came together
We have to realise that, well
This is special
So tonight with this
What we're doing here
It all came together
We have to realise that
That girl
This is special
I've given my skin
But you haven't seen it all
You've shown me what you want
But I'll never be that girl
So tonight with this
What we're doing here
It all came together
We have to realise that
That girl
This is special
I've given my skin
But you haven't seen it all
You've shown me what you want
But I'll never be that girl
Yeah
I've given my skin
But you haven't seen it all
You've shown me what you want
But I'll never be that girl
That girl
So tonight with this
What we're doing here
It all came together
We have to realise that
That girl
This is special
Yeah
That girl
This is special
So tonight with this
What we're doing here
It all came together
We have to realise that
That girl
This is special
I've given my skin
But you haven't seen it all
You've shown me what you want
But I'll never be that girl
I've given my skin
But you haven't seen it all
You've shown me what you want
But I'll never be that girl
