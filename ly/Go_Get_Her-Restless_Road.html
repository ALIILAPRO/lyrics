		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're laying there in an empty bed
Thinking 'bout what you'd say
If you could say what you should've said
Before you let her go
If you spin around in your head
Circles like a ceiling fan
If you're living in the reckoning
That you might've lost the best thing you ever had

Go get her
Throw that bag in the truck bed
Chase her down like a sunset
I know you think she's gone
But she ain't that gone yet
Boy, swallow your pride like whiskey
Don't let her fade into a memory
'Cause, oh, there ain't that many one in a million
So, if you know she's your forever
Won't forget her, boy, you better
Go get her

I promise you, you won't regret
Owning up to your mistakes
So, say a prayer for a second chance
Do anything but hit the brakes

Go get her
Throw that bag in the truck bed
Chase her down like a sunset
I know you think she's gone
But she ain't that gone yet
Boy, swallow your pride like whiskey
Don't let her fade into a memory
'Cause, oh, there ain't that many one in a million
So, if you know she's your forever
Won't forget her, boy, you better
Go get her, oh
Oh, go get her

'Cause what you're 'bout to lose, boy
Some never find at all
Don't send it in a text, no
Don't say it in a call

Go get her
Throw that bag in the truck bed
Chase her down like a sunset
I know you think she's gone
But she ain't that gone yet
Boy, swallow your pride like whiskey
Don't let her fade into a memory
'Cause, oh, there ain't that many one in a million
So, if you know she's your forever
Won't forget her, boy, you better
Go get her, oh
Oh, go get her, oh
Go get her
