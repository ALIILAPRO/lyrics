		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in love
Wrote these anthems to lift you up
Apologize when I let you go
I'm still your man
I'm just not at home
I get it in
I've been on the road
You're faithful to me
And it shows
You deserve more

I belong to the streets
I aint lyin
Just pray for me, I got pride
Soul ties I relive the old times
Need some intervention
I mention I know
Hit a model in the bathroom
Like I didn't have you
I thought to myself
Oh my God
What am I doing
It's the truth I aint lyin
Gave myself a higher ceiling
I rise up i feel it
Oh, no
I broke trust you gave me off a pole
You would not trust me if you know
Someone like you
Deserves better

I'm in love
Wrote these anthems to lift you up
Apologize when I let you go
I'm still your man
I'm just not at home
I get it in
I've been on the road
You're faithful to me
And it shows
You deserve more

Mhm
And I don't want you too afraid
You've got so much life to live anyways
You're too good for mess I display
In every single way I could lie
I did uh
It's hard out here for a pimp like me
Even though a queen right in front of me

I'm in love
Wrote these anthems to lift you up
Apologize when I let you go
I'm still your man
I'm just not at home
I get it in
I've been on the road
You're faithful to me
And it shows
You deserve more
