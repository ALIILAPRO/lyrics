		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You want someone who wants you for who you are
I want someone to try, then let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight
Honey, it's no secret that with matters of the heart
Unreserved, I'm irrational and rarely ever start
But since the world's dark and often inhumane
Relish our condition, come drinking in the rain
'Cause you remember when, after Paris
We all decided the best way to fight it was
Drink wine, dance here and pray
And make love that lasts with avengeance
So you can join the cowards all aboard the outrage train
You can stay afraid, or slit the throat of fear and be brave
And scratch the little itch
'Til you're moving like a motherfucker up in this bitch

You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and fall in love
Don't stop, don't stop believing
In truth and grace in the grievance
You want someone who wants you for who you are
I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

So look at me and tell me what I already know
That I trialed and I failed and it's good to let it go
Sometimes life sucks, everything is lame
Not everything's as easy as making lemonade
And so dismembering our state of balance
With lust requited, a gaze undivided
With a cool mind and warmth in your face
A good heart, a grace under pressure
You give me a good reason to be heartsick again
To be here, to be strong, to be oddly and boldly estranged
From the loss and bitter years
I found myself descending into tedium and fear

You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and fall in love
Don't stop, don't stop believing
In truth and grace in the grievance
You want someone who wants you for who you are
I want someone to try, then let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

If it's late, you're drunk and wanting
A reason, some reason to live
I always, I always say
Just put on some Whitesnake

Honey, it's no secret that I've been losing my way
In the weirdest of moments and the stupidest of ways
But hey, I'm still young and it's gonna be okay
I got solipsism, baby, and I brought lemonade
I'll surrender then, all my balance
And be excited and drink to tonight
It's not a, a bad time, time spent with you
There's cool lights and songs with good lyrics
We never have to talk again, whatever, up to you
But since you're putting up with me
Here's another toast just to you
Let's dance, off the beat
Then mosey out together and say goodbye on the street

You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and love someone
Don't stop, don't stop believing
In truth and personal freedom
I want someone to want me for who I am
I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

Easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight
