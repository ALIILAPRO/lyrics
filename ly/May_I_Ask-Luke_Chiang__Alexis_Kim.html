		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  May I ask you how you've been
Would I have the words to say 
I've forgotten how to feel 
How to call you by your name

Barely recognize you now 
All your words have turned to stone 
You've forgotten all my songs
You've forgotten all my love 

Don't you know 
You make me nervous still  
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind

Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love

And by now your smile has changed
You don't look at me the same
It's naive of me to think
That one day you'll miss my name 

Promises you said you'd keep
Empty lines between the scenes
Was it wrong for me to trust 
I'm still only seventeen

Don't you know 
You make me nervous still  
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind

Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love

It's just my natural reaction to you
Making me feel like I've lost sanity
And I can't help but to miss you though I know there's never a chance 

Don't you know 
You make me nervous still  
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind

Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love

Don't you know 
You make me nervous still  
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been trynna get you off my mind

Give me time
Cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love
