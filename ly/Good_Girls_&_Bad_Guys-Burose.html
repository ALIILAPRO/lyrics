		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess it pays to be the villain nowadays, huh
It's always good girls messing with the bad guys
Why do good girls always love the bad guy
I only seen your good side, but you giving bad vibes
I don't even know where we could've been
But it's always good girls messing with the bad guys
Why do good girls always love the bad guy
I only seen your good side, but you giving bad vibes
I don't even know where we could've been
Good girls and them bad guys
Bad, bad guys
Bad, b-b-bad guys
B-b-bad, bad guys
Bad, bad guys
Bad, b-b-bad guys
I know you out right now, said you out of town
And even if we just friends, said you'd still be down
And you ain't even see my potential, that's what killed me baby
Let me show you who I am, because I wasn't me
Why don't you spend a little time? You'll be feeling me
I know you want to let him go, you'll be feeling free
Red flag after red flag
I tried to catch them all, but caught a setback
And you just using me to try and get back
'Cause you were sleeping on the kid, you off the jetlag
And that's cool, I ain't even really tripping
I'm just tryna show you what you missing
I had a feeling off the rip I'd catch you slipping
With the bad guy, Pippen and the Pistons
It's always good girls messing with the bad guys
Why do good girls always love the bad guy
I only seen your good side, but you giving bad vibes
I don't even know where we could've been
Good girls and them bad guys
Bad, bad guys
Bad, b-b-bad guys
B-b-bad, bad guys
Bad, bad guys
Bad, b-b-bad guys
I've seen this cycle repeat itself
Time and time again
And when I think I found a real one
You always run back to the bad guy
But maybe it's my fault
Getting drawn in by the caution signs
Instead of turning back
Or maybe it's you
Maybe you're the bad guy
