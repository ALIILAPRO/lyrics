		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That first step is troubling
Trouble is nothing to you
cnd that's fair

You wide eyed girl, will you put your walls down here? 
cnd that's fair

Just me and friends
No free events keep you entertained
You wide eyed girl, will you put your walls down here? (cnd that's fair)

cnd at first glance, we could dance
We could laugh over the screams that's upstairs
Who hurt you deep?
Now they answer to me here
cnd that's fair

Just me and friends
No free events keep you entertained
You wide eyed girl, will you put your walls down here? (cnd that's fair)

Lazy river underneath a bridge
Talking to your inner little kid
Blow a bubble wait on it to pop (It pop)
("Indigo Jack!")
