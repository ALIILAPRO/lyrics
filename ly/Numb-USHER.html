		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long

Time, some things never change here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care any more

Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb
I can feel you now

Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expectin' change
Well is that really insanity
Or just a losers' game
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long

Time, some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care any more

Just go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now (numb)
(Numb)

I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now

But you can't feel it, do ya?
Numb
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore
(Numb) numb

I can feel you now (numb)
I can feel you now, yeah (numb)
Oh, oh
I can feel you now, hey (numb)
I can feel you now (numb)
Can you feel it?
