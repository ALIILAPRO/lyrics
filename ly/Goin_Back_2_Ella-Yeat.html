		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just hit NY
And you know I was on a private jet flight
Going back to LA, going back to LA, yeah
Yeah, yeah, finna go hit LA
Finna call my twizz up, yeah
Finna go back to re-up, yeah
Finna go back (yeah)

Going back to LA bitch, I'm going back to LA
I spent a week in NY, but
I'm going back to LA, going back to LA
(Going back to LA)
Yeah, I got some pints on the way
And some Percs on the way
So I'm going back to LA
(Going back to LA, yeah)
I got a couple of vibes that's gon' slide
To the crib and eat a lil' supper
Yeah, I woke up when it's night
Finna boot off this X and go to
Sleep when I see the sun (Boot up, yeah)
I hit the double R dealership
I got a Rolls Royce umbrella
Yeah, bring back the coupe
I ain't feeling it
High with the gods, then I'm up 'til infinity
Yeah, Maison Margiela that bitch
I went and put paint on her face
All of my twizzies been running this
Shit the fuck up every day
They can't keep up the pace (Run it up)
I'm in a mansion by myself (yeah, yeah)
And the cologne came from YSL (yeah, ow)
Fucking this bitch up in any room
She can't contain herself (yeah)

Yeah, bitch, you know what's going on (yeah)
Uh, bitch, you know who going up (Uh, huh)
Yeah, all my brothers know it's up
Yeah, bitch, I always run it up (Ayo)
Yeah, bitch, all that ain't nothing to us
(Nothing to us)
Bitch, all I do is run it up (Woo)
Yeah, bitch
I took the coupe to the telly and valet
Bitch, I came out the beast like I'm in Belly
All of my diamonds is flawless
I left the bank, I ain't make no deposit
You would've thought my twizzy went off his
Mop pulling up with a 556 (yeah, woo)
And you would've thought I would've
Been the one that died
But the gun got the tit's on it (Tit's)
I only rap 'bout the shit that I do, I live
I sip on the Wock', I don't sip on no Pibb
(yeah) i can't even say that they fell off
'cause they ain't even get on (yeah)
Yeah, they wanna sit back and talk they shit
They don't got nothing to piss on
(Nothing at all)
Called up Eliantte, canary diamonds
All them pissed on (Brrt, brrt)
Called up my wrists and told 'em I'm
Finna put a hundred thousand on 'em
Yeah, my AP speaking in French
That bitch got baguettes on it (yeah, oui)
I ain't rocking no twenties, no fifties, no
Old hundreds, yeah, new blue hundreds, yeah
All that's on me (No)
I done lost my grills
Called the tooth fairy up and
Took a loss on it (Took a lil' L)
Yeah, I ain't in no telly, I'm
In the belly, in Corvette
Let's floor the gas now (Ride out)
Who is your brodie? Why they capping 'bout
They rapping? They ain't even live 'bout
(Cap 'bout) yeah, I been doing this shit
For so damn long, i done learned everything
(yeah)

Going back to LA
Yeah, bitch, I'm going back to LA
I spent a week in NY, but
I'm going back to LA, going back to LA
(Going back to LA)
Yeah, I got some pints on the way
And some Percs on the way
So I'm going back to LA
(Going back to LA, yeah)
I got a couple of vibes that's gon' slide
To the crib and eat a lil' supper
Yeah, I woke up when it's night
Finna boot off this X and go to
Sleep when I see the sun (Boot up, yeah)
I hit the double R dealership
I got a Rolls Royce umbrella
Yeah, bring back the coupe
I ain't feeling it
High with the gods, then I'm up 'til infinity
Yeah, Maison Margiela that bitch

All of my twizzies been running this
Shit the fuck up every day
They can't keep up the pace (Run it up)

Fucking this bitch up in any room
She can't contain herself (yeah)
