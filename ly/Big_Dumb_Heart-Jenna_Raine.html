		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you need a ride to the airport
I'll push my plans aside just to get you there on time
If you need to vent 'bout your stupid ex
I will take your grudges and treat them like they're mine
I got problems too, but I got no time to solve 'em
An emotional overachiever, people-pleaser

Yeah, they play me like a game show, jumping if they say so
Wish that I could say no

With my big dumb heart
Always dropping everything 
To help out anybody else but me
Give it 'til it falls apart
My big dumb heart
I just keep on getting burned
When am I ever gonna learn?
All my problems seem to start
With my big dumb heart

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb

Every flag was red with every word he said
Gave that boy the benefit of the doubt
I tried to fix his world, but mine just ended up broken
Stupid and foolish, why do I put myself through this?

Yeah, they play me like a game show, jumping if they say so
Wish that I could say no

With my big dumb heart
Always dropping everything 
To help out anybody else but me
Give it 'til it falls apart
My big dumb heart
I just keep on getting burned
When am I ever gonna learn?
All my problems seem to start
With my big dumb heart

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
My big dumb heart

Yeah love's too much, sometimes it kinda sucks
I've had enough of my big dumb heart
It's so insane that "yes" is all I say
Guess I've gotta blame

My big dumb heart
Always dropping everything (dropping everything)
To help out anybody else but me 
Give it 'til it falls apart (oh)
My big dumb heart (dumb heart)
I just keep on getting burned
When am I ever gonna learn? (I'm never gonna learn)
All my problems seem to start
With my big dumb heart

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
My big dumb heart

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, dumb
My big dumb heart
