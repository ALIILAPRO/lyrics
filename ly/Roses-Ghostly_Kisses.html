		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running fast, out of breathing 
Calling more than my own answer 
From where or when, I don't know 
In hope to meet you somewhere, or there 

I'm wasting all my will 
No worries for you, my dear 
I wander all my years 
This journey is not mine 

Faded roses in the backyard 
Reminding me of how long it has been 
Just a small place called our home 
With my heart, far from yours 

I'm wasting all my will 
No worries for you, my dear 
I wander all my years 
This journey is not mine 

Time is not on our side 
As you come and I go 
As I come back and it's too late 
You are already gone
