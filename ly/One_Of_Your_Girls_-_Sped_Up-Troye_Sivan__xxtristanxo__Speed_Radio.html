		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls
I'll be like one of your girls

Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls
I'll be like one of your girls, I'll, I'll
I'll be like one of your girls, I'll, I'll
I'll be like one of your girls

Say what you want and I'll keep it a secret
You got the key to my heart and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls
I'll be like one of your girls
I'll be like one of your girls
I'll be like one of your girls
I'll be like one of your girls

I'll be like one of your girls, I'll, I'll
I'll be like one of your girls, I'll, I'll
I'll be like one of your girls

Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls
I'll be like one of your girls, I'll, I'll
I'll be like one of your girls
