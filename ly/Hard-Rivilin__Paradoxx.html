		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  jealousy got me messed up
fade out with a cloak made of pain
brittle bones start to snap I watch you come back
the mental illness covers my eyes black

empathy isn't needed
this world that I create is my own little hell
watch your family just concede when they ask you to leave
yeah the cracks in my skin start to fray

it's like my bodies stuck in static, all my emotions going manic
as the floor just starts to crumble and im falling, falling down
I harbor guilt from the resentment, maybe love was never mentioned
mind is filled with ignorance as the devil starts to consume

aspirations with the drugs take some more it's not enough
id rather feel something empty than deal with all the pain
a cloud it forms around my head depression says he's now my friend
im always empty all alone, I guess ill face this on my own

it's what I see in my dreams, is this real watcha mean
contradicting on every word that I try to say
I try to be only me, it's all the hate yeah it seethes
there's complications yeah every time that I try to stay

im on my knees now crawling pushing down, try to leave
this hallucination is clouding up your mental state
feel the flame at my feet watch the sky swallow me
their's hesitation on all the words that I try to say

On all the words i try to say
But i can't get them out of me

It's a double edged sword
every time i speak i get blood on my palms

I try to stay calm and collected but everything's breaking down on me
I'm selective of the words that i speak but it's counquering me
I get trapped in my mind all the time

I feel my body rotting away from inside out
But i can't be bothered to scream , I'm too weak to make a sound

And all this angst , all this doubt is eating me up alive
But i let it happen so who can i blame , I'll seek myself out
