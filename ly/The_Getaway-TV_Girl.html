		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ("You are very young you are clever and you
Are very beautiful because of your youth
You should be exceptionally valuable to us")
("And I was very lonely so I thought
Tonight I will have an adventure")
("If I'm never to see you again I can
Forget you in a minute! You'll see!")

("She's just pretending")
("You were wrong i wasn't! I loved you!")

Well this thing that we had built
Was flaying into shreds
It was sharp and it was dry
Like the hair on a shrunken head

And all the king's men
Spread the pieces on the floor
By the time they fit together
We had forgotten what they were for

Pretending like she's beautiful
In the pictures I can see
But she only picks the good ones
And that's more than I can say for me

But that's the way it always starts
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
Always making out like bandit's
Until you get away and it falls apart
It falls apart

You're always dressed up like a priest
You're always drilling through the wall
Cracking the safe and skipping town
While poor Rosemary takes the fall

You're always looking for the future
Rinsing out the dye
Looking for a moral to the story
That sounded good and happened to rhyme

Rosemary on the gallows
Dressed like nothing's wrong
No funeral no flowers
For an outlaw in a song

But that's the way it always starts
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
Always making out like bandit's
Until you get away and it falls apart
It falls apart

("She's just pretending")
("You were wrong i wasn't! I loved you!")


But that's the way it always starts
(that's the way it always starts)
You feel like Lily and the Jack of Hearts
