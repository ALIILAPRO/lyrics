		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been playing in the dark
And you showed me
You let your guard down when we go slowly
We've been dealing all the cards
Now you know me
With all the messed up feelings inside me

I feel you're the one guiding me through it all
When clouds to rain and wind turn to storm
I feel we're the ones standing up while they fall
We bend, we don't break, we stay, we won't fade

Don't you break up

We've been playing in the dark
And you showed me
You let your guard down when we go slowly
We've been dealing all the cards
Now you know me
With all the messed up feelings inside me

I've been feeling like a stranger without you
Never thought I'd meet someone who turns orange into blue
Didn't know how much I needed the answer
If I'm your song
Will you be my tiny dancer?

I feel you're the one guiding me through it all
When clouds to rain and wind turn to storm
I feel we're the ones standing up while they fall
We bend, we don't break, we stay, we won't fade

Don't you break up

We've been playing in the dark
And you showed me
You let your guard down when we go slowly
We've been dealing all the cards
Now you know me
With all the messed up feelings inside me

You let your guard down when we go slowly
With all the messed up feelings inside me
Don't you break up
