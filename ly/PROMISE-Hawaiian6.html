		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard. It's painful.
It's lonely. It's sad.
It's fated.
The heart is shrinking.
No more dreams.
We climb the stairs
step by step.
I try not to miss my footing.
Don't make a mistake. Slowly.
Doubt me. Keep me.
Betray me. Tell a lie. Get hurt.
I'm tired of being criticized.
I see we are getting cowardly.
Slowly. I put my heart back
in my treasure box
and locked it.
I don't wanna get hurt anymore.
I don't wanna drop
tears anymore.
I had wanted to be
skilled with passion.
But I notice
I hold a dirty treasure box
and cry.
The blue sky.
Do you remember my promise?
oh, that day.
The wound from that day has not.
Hasn't healed yet.
The blue sky.
Many season pass and my heart
has become dirty.

I don't wanna get hurt anymore.
I don't wanna drop
tears anymore.
I had wanted to be
skilled with passion.
But I notice
I hold a dirty treasure box
and cry.
The blue sky.
Do you remember my promise?
oh, that day.
The wound from that day has not.
Hasn't healed yet.
The blue sky.
Many season pass and my heart
has become dirty.
P.S. Since then, I planted
a beautiful seed on this hill.
I decided to wait here
until the seed grew big
and became a pure tree.
I still could not
keep my promise.
la la la la la la la...
Tell me why must we grow up
and turn into adults.
The same blue sky today.
