		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm falling out of love with you LA
Running out of reasons I should stay
I'm overwhelmed, I'm over it
It's too cold here anyway
I'm falling out of love with you LA

Back to Alonica
Where the sun is out all the time
My favorite beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singing la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancing 'til the morning comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica

Darling, I have finally settled in
The water's perfect for a midnight swim
It's paradise, the stars and I
Are catching up like old friends
My heart is learning how to love again

Back to Alonica
Where the sun is out all the time
My favorite beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singing la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancing 'til the morning comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica

Made up of a thousand colors
Everything is in its place
I don't know the last time there were
Tears like this upon my face
Every artist falls in wonder
Even Michelangelo
If God is really out there somewhere
This must be his other home

Back to Alonica
Where the sun is out all the time
My favorite beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singing la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancing 'til the morning comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica
