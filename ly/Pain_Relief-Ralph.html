		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Secretly, I'm suffering
Losing all my sparkle like a summer fling
Pain reflief comes easily
When the blame is placed on everyone but me

You make me go numb like I'm standing in the sun
But I can't feel the warmth on my body (on my body)
Use me as your ammo, crush me like an anvil
'Til you come around speaking softly

Every time I hear those bitter voices in my head
Tell myself that jealousy is such a fickle friend
(Break up with my bitterness)

This envy is so empty
Green has never even looked that good on me
Self-esteem, it gets messy
Didn't know that I was my worst enemy

You make me go numb like I'm standing in the sun
But I can't feel the warmth on my body (on my body)
Use me as your ammo, crush me like an anvil
'Til you come around speaking softly

Every time I hear those bitter voices in my head (in my head)
Tell myself that jealousy is such a fickle friend

Break up with my bitterness
break up with my bitterness
Break up with my bitterness
break up with my bitterness

Break up with my bitterness 
(break up with my bitterness, break up with my bitterness)
(Tried to get along but now I'm just getting sick of it)
Break up with my bitterness 
(break up with my bitterness, break up with my bitterness)
(Tried to get along but now I'm just getting sick of it)
Break up with my bitterness
