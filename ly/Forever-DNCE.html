		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll never forget the first time I realized
That the darkness in me can be lightnin' in the night
Shooting fire 'cross the sky, burnin' out
And changin' lives, yeah they can try, I'll never die

I'll never forget the first time I saw the truth
That the power in me, it shines brighter than the moon
Every dream that I see, it becomes reality
Yeah they can try, I'll never die

Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever, ever, ever

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, forever

I'm lost in the rush, that keeps rushin' through my veins
Oh, who needs love, who needs love
When the people scream your name
I'm the one, only one who can save us from all the pain
Yeah, they can try, I'll never die

Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, forever

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, forever

The future brings, champion rings on every finger
You gotta take some time to let the gold just linger
Going gold, yeah solid gold, no time for silver
Look in these eyes, these stealin' eyes, and watch them shimmer
The purple haze fill up the days, awards the feelin'
Walls of stone, they came to home of new beginnings
The moment's now, the broken place, we're dreamin' bigger
The future brings, champion rings on every finger

Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, forever

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh, forever
