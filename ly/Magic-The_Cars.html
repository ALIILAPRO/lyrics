		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summer, it turns me upside down
Summer, summer, summer
It's like a merry-go-round

I see you under the midnight
All shackles and bows
The high shoes with the cleats a-clickin'
A temperamental glow

Oh, don't you let me go
Oh, got a hold on you
I've got a hold on you
I've got a hold on you tonight
Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you (I got a hold on you)
That's right

(Uh oh, it's magic)
When I'm with you 
(Oh, it's magic)
(Uh oh, it's magic) 
Just a little magic
You know it's true
I got a hold on you

Oh, twisted 
Under, sideways, down
I know you're getting twisted
And you can't calm down

I see you under the midnight
Love darts in your eyes
How far can you take it?
'Til you realize
There's magic in your eyes

I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
(I got a hold on you) 
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, when I'm with you
(Oh, it's magic)
(Uh oh, it's magic)

Just a little bit of magic
Pulls me through
I've got a hold on you

I've got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(I got a hold on you)
That's right, it's magic

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, it's magic
When I'm with you 
(Oh, it's magic)
Uh oh

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Just a little magic 
Inside of you 

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Takes a little bit of magic
That's true
When I'm with you

(Uh oh, it's magic)
(Gotta be magic)
Your magic pulls me through
Oh, it's magic
(Uh oh, it's magic)
