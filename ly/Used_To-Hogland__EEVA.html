		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something about you now
I can feel it in the air
Used to be close but now you're always in your head
It doesn't matter what you say
I'm lonely in your atmosphere
We could be more, but now you act like you don't care

We are running out of time
Tell me we'll be fine cause I need you now
I don't wanna start a fight
Say what's on your mind cause I need to know

Why don't love me like you used to
Say why don't you love me like you used to
Little by little we got stuck in the middle now
Why don't you love me like you used to
Love me now like you used to do


Why don't you love me like you used to
Say why don't you love me like you used to
Little by little we got stuck in the middle now
Why don't you love me like you used to
Love me now like you used to do


You been having second thoughts
Maybe you could think again
You should be here but now it's colder on your side of the bed
And it leaves me thinking
Where did we go missing
I wish that we could figure it all out


We are running out of time
Tell me we'll be fine cause I need you now
I don't wanna start a fight
Say what's on your mind cause I need to know


Why don't you love me like you used to
Say why don't you love me like you used to
Little by little we got stuck in the middle now
Why don't you love me like you used to
Love me now like you used to do


Why don't you love me like you used to
Say why don't you love me like you used to
Little by little we got stuck in the middle now
Why don't you love me like you used to
Love me now like you used to do

Why don't you love me like you used to
Say why don't you love me like you used to
Little by little we got stuck in the middle now
Why don't you love me like you used to
Love me now like you used to do
