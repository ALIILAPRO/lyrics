		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

I was just a teen, a boy with a dream
In love with the flow, with a sight on the scene
Not many know what it's like to be seen
But I'm getting to know now, to know now
Just a teen

Lil' black boy with a dream
With the craziest mind and the lowest esteem
Trying to find what happens at the highest esteem
So I had a dream and a couple called me extreme
I was thinking about what could make me better
'Cause these terms at school never made me clever
Too cool a fool to retain that error
I was tryna be great, they were telling me never, so
I gotta craft, put the work in it
A couple had a laugh when they saw me working it
And I was trash at the start and I stunk like a fart
But the heart in my work had me murkin' it
And now it's five years gone, I've been doing it strong
Working night 'til dawn, and they're singing my song
Nobody telling me I'm doing it wrong
'Cause I was telling them that really

I'm just a teen, a boy with a dream
In love with the flow, with a sight on the scene
Not many know what it's like to be seen
But I'm getting to know now, to know now
Just a teen, a boy with a dream
In love with the flow, with a sight on the scene
Not many know what it's like to be seen
But I'm getting to know now, to know now
Just a teen

Lil' black bruddah with a dream
That's faced and placed in a diabolic regime
That made it seem like I was never part of the team
But I was David, never let it ruin the dream
'Cause I was hitting up a giant that was bigger than most
It's bigger than me
Couldn't see the hell of a ghost that's living in me
'Cause I was just the relevant host
To a degree you could say I was better than most
'Cause I kept on working, put the time in
Though they hate, see, I kept on shining
Now the flows dividing, ultra sounding
And I will never stop trying, I'm tightening
Until the flow get them shocked like lightening
And make the smile on their face excitement
See I was told that's my one assignment
So now I'm telling that really

I'm just a teen, a boy with a dream
In love with the flow, with a sight on the scene
Not many know what it's like to be seen
But I'm getting to know now, to know now
Just a teen, a boy with a dream
In love with the flow, with a sight on the scene
Not many know what it's like to be seen
But I'm getting to know now, to know now
Just a teen

I'm just a teen
Started at 16
With a dream so big
No self-esteem
He's just a teen
Started at 16
He won't make it but we have to watch him though

See I'm just a teen and now I'm getting bigger than ever
I'm better and better and ready to take on whatever
The people throw, 'cause it took five years of pressure
And there were ties to sever, so many lines to better
And I know I'ma get this grow, to a place where the people know
That my words don't play, and until that day I'ma rap this way
Practice so they see a mad display
Of a teen they claimed never rapped this way
And it was true but I dreamt I may
Be the best and the rest in the words I prayed
I said that

I'm just a teen
Started at 16
With a dream so big
No self-esteem

I'm just a teen, a boy with a dream
In love with the flow, with a sight on the scene
Not many know what it's like to be seen
But I'm getting to know now, to know now
Just a teen

Yeah, see I'm just a teen
Just a teen
Just a teen

A boy with a dream
In love with the flow, with a sight on the scene
Not many know what it's like to be seen
But I'm getting to know now, yeah
