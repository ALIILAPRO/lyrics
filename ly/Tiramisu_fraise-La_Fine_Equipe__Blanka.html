		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got a thing about you
I just can't live without you
I really want you, Eleanor near me
Your looks intoxicate me
Even though your folks hate me
There's no one like you, Elenore really

You got a thing about you
I just can't live without you
I really want you, Eleanor near me
Your looks intoxicate me
Even though your folks hate me
There's no one like you, Elenore really

I really think you're groovy
Let's go out to a movie
What do you say now, Elenore, can we?
They'll turn the lights way down low
Maybe we won't watch the show
I think I love you, Elenore, love me (yeah)

You got a thing about you
I just can't live without you
I really want you, Eleanor near me
Your looks intoxicate me
Even though your folks hate me
There's no one like you, Elenore really
