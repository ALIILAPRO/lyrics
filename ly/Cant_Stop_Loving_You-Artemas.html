		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talking about nothing in the dead of night
Sipping your drink till I’m paralysed
I’m so numb it’s true
I can’t stop loving you

Well the rain looks pretty on your front side porch tonight
And it’s a big old city I should be elsewhere but I 
Couldn’t help myself I was hoping you would hold me one more time

I’m gonna miss my train and it looks so warm inside
So could you let me in either way I’m gonna try
Couldn’t help myself I was hoping you would kill me one more time

Talking about nothing in the dead of night
Sipping your drink till I’m paralysed
I’m so numb it’s true
I can’t stop loving you
Every freckle on your back got em memorised
I take one hit now I’m out my mind on your perfect blues
I can’t stop loving you, you

And the sirens sang out the sweetest lullaby
It’s the best I’ve slept in a hundred thousand nights
Couldn’t help myself I was hoping you would love me one more time
I, I’m perfectly sane I’m fine
Do you think I’ve lost my mind?
You shouldn’t be surprised
Swear that I just really miss you
I’d go to hell just to kiss you
And I’ve got a couple of issues.
(Go on go on give it to me shoot me in the chest)

Talking about nothing in the dead of night
Sipping your drink till I’m paralysed
I’m so numb it’s true
I can’t stop loving you
Every freckle on your back got em memorised
I take one hit now I’m out my mind on your perfect blues
I can’t stop loving you, you
