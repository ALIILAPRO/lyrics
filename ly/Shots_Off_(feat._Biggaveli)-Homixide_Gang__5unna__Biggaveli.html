		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, pull up on your gang, let shots off
Pull up on your gang, let shots off
Yeah, pull up on your gang, let shots off
Pull up on your gang, let shots off 

Homixide Gang do walkdowns
I'm pushing the cat, do a burnout
I'm popping my gat and my gun now
Vetements come in a lil' bag
I step in designer when I come out
War on them, ready to get nasty
Jump in a moshpit, rockstar
Jump out the stage, let's rock out

I ride with the stick, I'ma rock out
These fuck niggas talkin', they Instagram poppin', but where the fuck snot at?
They gone pop out
100 round drum, make a fuck nigga move
Homixide spin with the cops out
Young nigga Dray, gone slide in the uber
Lil' fuck nigga, better pipe down
Playin' at the time
You want some bags? Oh, I'ma send them bitches
Opp hoe, fuckin' for the gang
Shit, let's get it bitch
When I'm at the top, I'm just getting head
I don't love these bitches
Man, these times get crazy
Caught 'em lackin', hit 'em with that stick

Hit â€˜em with a stick
Huh, all this money, too many hunnids', thought it was counterfeit
I'm already popped' by the time I'm at the spot, we need to count them fits
I ain't gone play you, we gone slide, I'm gone ride with that stick
Truckhawk truck, geeked up, with a wild kitty
Yeah, shell catcher, with a 10, that's a sidekick
Too much diamonds, H5, I'm on some fried shit

Huh, huh, huh
Homixide Gang, we gone rockout
Yeah we like G6 Pills
We the rockstar trap, we done turned into some rockstars
Lil' bitch took a small pink pill
We dressed in all black

Pull up on your gang, let shots off 
Pull up on your gang, let shots off 
Yeah, pull up on your gang, let shots off
Pull up on your gang, let shots off
