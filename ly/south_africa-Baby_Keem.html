		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love

Blocked from a distance
Everybody want some attention
Money make a bitch go missin'
Everybody on a lil' mission
Bless up
I can turn you on in an instant
Everybody battlin' a mistress
Touchin' on your booby, get 'em lifted
She wanna get lit-lit
She fuckin' on a rap nigga, fuckin' on a star
Drinkin' tap water, diabetes in a jar
I'm takin' shit back, bitch, you won't get far
Baby Keem poppin'
No long' talkin', ha-ha-ha, I'm laughin' at you
Baby Keem poppin'
Still don't fuck with ra-ra-ra (yeah)

Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love

Huh, dodgin' turbulence, I'm a pop star like Prince
I buy house, no den, I'ma hold down my kinfolk
My mama tried to warn these hoes not to break my heart again
I never shake my hoes, I'ma pay my hoes, then pay my rent
Heads up, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, and many more
Allah, Allah, Shabba Rank, we be fuckin' 'til it stank
We be fuckin' off the drank and I love that pootie tang
I took my clothes off for you, what the fuck you think about me?

Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
