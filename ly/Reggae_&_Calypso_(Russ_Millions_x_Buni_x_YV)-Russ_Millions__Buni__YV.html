		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ha ha ha ha (ay, J1, that's flames, my bro)
How you shell the high notes? (YJay made this)
Ahaha, ahahaha (Chee on the beat)
Yo, yuh haffi shell 'em switch on a wah? some street, man (Josh)
Yo, yo

She only dance to Reggae and Calypso (foot)
She want gunman in her tight hole (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
See the killers make racks, it's vital (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
B-bare boom bang for a rival (feet)
HK, I'm claimin' that title
They hear W.O.T say, "Crud" and slide through

Do my dance like Shiggy, go viral
Like the new age Jackson Michael (hee-hee)
Ganja spliff likkle chip not Ital
Sex your girl, took her back, it's a cycle
We don't slide, we glide and ride
Slime time, everyone hold bine
It's the other side where we let that shine
One fuck make your girlfriend mine
Why they just chat when they ain't on piss?
I could buy breast for my favorite bitch 
All of these freaks do amazing things 
Miraculous neck from a Asian ting
Unforgettable dick have your girl falling 
Course I made her cum, push my hood all in 
Now she's on all fours but she ain't crawling 
Give her D all night 'til the next morning (tek buddy, gyal)

She only dance to Reggae and Calypso (foot)
She want gunman in her tight hole
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
See the killys make racks, it's vital (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
B-bare boom bang for a rival (feet)
HK, I'm claimin' that title
They hear W.O.T say, "Crud" and slide through

She only want Killy Milly, she don't want them man 
Give a man the business, pepper that, clap a man (shatta)
Tryna get them man, bup bup, bang bang 
Sun's out, guns out, Glo Gang, bang bang (bullet, bullet, shatta)
Pree my shooter, come like a Taliban 
Donny thinks he's mad but I'm a madda man 
Her ex is a wasteman now she got a badda man 
Stay with my killy killy, can't trust a bagga man (feet)
We don't party poop, we party shot 
We get the party locked 
Dot-dot or a big six-shots
Turn mad man when I get pissed off
They see mad man and their car skid off
The mash in my hand make ya car lift off
.44 bulldog and it's barking off
Spot my target and I'm clartin' off

Michael Jackson bad (hee-hee)
One of a kind, one unruly camp 
Why they just talk on the 'net? It look sad 
Brazilian hair for a baddie I smash 
I consider it clear that them niggas just brass 
She wanna dance to Calypso 
It's the way that I wuk she won't let go 
It was me that made your girl tip-toe, why? (Feet)

She only dance to Reggae and Calypso (foot)
She want gunman in her tight hole
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
See the killys make racks, it's vital (feet)
She only dance to Reggae and Calypso
B-bare boom bang for a rival (feet)
HK, I'm claimin' that title
They hear W.O.T say, "Crud" and slide through

B-bare boom bang for a rival
She want gunman in her tight hole (feet)
Do my dance like Shiggy, go viral
Like the new age Jackson Michael (hee-hee)
HK, I'm claimin' that title
See the killys make racks, it's vital 
They hear W.O.T say, "Crud"
