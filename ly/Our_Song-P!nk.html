		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where to start
When only love breaks your heart
Watching this fall apart
As we dance in the dark

Eyes wide shut
Where did we lose our touch
I needed you so damn much
Why is everything hard

We win in the war
But you lose so much more
Is it worth it, I don't understand
Used to die for each other
That song made us lovers
All over and over again

Now we don't know even know the words to it anymore
And you don't look at me that way like you did before
Now it's just another song on the dance floor
And we don't even know the words to it anymore

Took for granted
Both of us empty-handed
But if I had one more chance
I would do it again

We win in the war
But you lose so much more
Is it worth it, I don't understand
Float away in the covers
That song made us lovers
All over and over again

Now we don't know even know the words to it anymore
Oh, you don't look at me that way like you did before
Oh-oh, oh, now it's just another song on the dance floor
And we don't even know the words to it anymore

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
And now it's just another song on the dance floor
And we don't even know the words to it anymore

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
La-la-la-la-la-la-de, la-la-la-de
