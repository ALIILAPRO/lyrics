		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's talk about all those things that we shouldn't talk about
Those kind of words that would change all the things we talk about
Tell me do you ever think of us?
Should I ask for more or should I stop?

What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?
What if we are taking chances just to loose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing the writing on the wall?

What if I say

I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?

What if I told you I like you?

What if I told you I like you?

I hear everything you saying, saying 'bout us
It's not about right or wrong, it's about what we love
Would it be simple or would it be too complicated?
Should I keep going or maybe it's better to stop?

What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?
What if we are taking chances just to loose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing the writing on the wall?

What if I say

I know, you know
What if I told you I liked you?
We stay, we go

What if I told you I liked you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?

We stay, we go

What if I told you I like you?

What if I told you I like you?

What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I liked you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I liked you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I liked you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I liked you?

I like you, oh yeah
What if I told you I like you

What if I told you I like you?
Let's talk about all those things that we shouldn't talk about
