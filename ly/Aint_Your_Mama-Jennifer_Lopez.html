		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you're gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no

Wake up, rise and shine
Let's get to work on time
No more playing video games
Things are about to change, 'round here, 'round here

We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
'Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you're gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no

Lucky to have these curves
Stop getting on my nerves
You still tryna ride this train?
Some things have got change, 'round here, 'round here

We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
'Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama 
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama 
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you're gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama 
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
I ain't your mama, no
I ain't your mama, no

We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
'Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama 
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hey
I ain't your mama, boy (no, no, no)
I ain't your mama (no, no)
When you're gon' get your act together? ('cause I ain't your mama, hey)
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama ('cause I ain't your mama, hey)
I ain't your mama, boy (na, na, na)
I ain't your mama, boy (na, na, na)
When you're gon' get your act together? (no, I ain't your mama, no)
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
