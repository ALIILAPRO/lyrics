		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down
It's me against the music (uh-huh)
It's just me (and me)
Yeah (come on)
Ooh
Hey, Britney
Are you ready? 
(Uh-huh, are you?) Uh

When no one cares
It's whipping my hair
It's pulling my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is dripping all over my face (to hell with it)
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancing up in this place (it's just me)
Tonight I'm here
To the beat of the drum, gotta give it that bass (uh)

I'm up against the speaker
Tryna take on the music
It's like a competition me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone (get in the zone)
I wanna get in the zone (wanna get in the zone)

If you really wanna battle
Saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryna hit it chic-a-tah
In a minute, I'ma take-a ya on (I'ma take you on)
I'ma take-a ya on (I'ma take you on)
(Hey, hey, hey)

All my people on the floor let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people wanting more let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)
All my people 'round and 'round let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people in the crowd let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)
(How would you like a friendly competition? Let's take on the song)
Let's take on the song, let's take on the song
(It's you and me, baby, we're the music, time to party all night long)
All night long (all night long) 
Oh, huh (uh), yeah (uh), let's go (uh)

We're almost there (oh)
I'm feeling it bad and I can't explain
My soul is bare
My hips are moving at a rapid pace (I'm going crazy)
Can you feel it burn?
From the tip of my toes, running through my veins (ooh)
And now's your turn
Let me see what ya got, don't hesitate (here we go)

I'm up against the speaker
Tryna take on the music
It's like a competition me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone (get in the zone)
I wanna get in the zone (wanna get in the zone)

If you really wanna battle
Saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryna hit it chic-a-tah
In a minute, I'ma take-a ya on (I'ma take you on)
I'ma take-a ya on (I'ma take you on)
(Hey, hey, hey)

All my people on the floor let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people wanting more let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)
All my people 'round and 'round let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people in the crowd let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)

Get on the floor
Baby, lose control (yeah)
Just work your body (uh-huh)
And let it go (let it go)
If you wanna party
Just grab somebody
Hey, Britney, we can dance all night

Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here I got something to show you
Sexy lady, I'd rather see you bare your soul
If you think you're so hot
Better show me what you got (hey, hey, hey)

All my people in the crowd 
Let me see you dance (grab a partner take it down)
Come on, Britney, lose control (all my people, all my people)
Watch you take it down (grab a partner take it d-)

Get on the floor
Baby, lose control
Just work your body
And let it go
If you wanna party
Just grab somebody
Hey, Britney, we can dance all night

All my people on the floor let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people wanting more let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)
All my people 'round and 'round let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people in the crowd let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)

All my people in the crowd 
Let me see you dance (grab a partner take it down)
Come on, Britney, take it down (all my people, all my people)
Make the music dance (grab a partner take it down)
All my people 'round and 'round
Party all night long (grab a partner take it down)
Come on, Britney, lose control (all my people, all my people)
Watch you take it down (grab a partner take it d-)
