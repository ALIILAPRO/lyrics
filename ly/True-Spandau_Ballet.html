		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh

So true funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh I want the truth to be said

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin (all night long)
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh I want the truth to be known

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true

I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh I want the truth to be said

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true

This much is true

This much is true
This much is true
I know, I know, I know this much is true
This much is true
This much is true
This much is true (huh huh)
This much is true
I know this much is true
This much is true (huh huh)
This much is true (I know this much is true)
This much is true (huh huh)
This much is true (I know this much is true)
I know, I know, I know this much is true
