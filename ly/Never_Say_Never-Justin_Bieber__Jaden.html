		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never say never
(Pick it up, pick it up)
(Pick it up, pick it up)
Yeah, yeah
(Never ever, never-ever-ever-ever-ever)

See, I never thought that I could walk through fire (ayy)
I never thought that I could take the burn (ayy)
I never had the strength to take it higher (ayy)
Until I reached the point of no return (ayy)

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight 'til forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
(Never say it, never-never say it)

I never thought that I could feel this power (ayy)
I never thought that I could feel this free (ayy)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh-oh)

And there's just no turning back (oh, no)
When your heart's under attack (oh, no)
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

I will never say never (never say never) (I will fight)
I will fight 'til forever (never fightin', but I'm still fightin') (to make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Here we go
Guess who?
Jsmith and JB (uh-huh)
I gotcha little bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood (let's go)
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)

I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight 'til forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never (never say it, never say it)
Never say never
I will fight 'til forever (okay, okay)
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
And never say never (never say never)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it)
Ne-never say never
And never say never
