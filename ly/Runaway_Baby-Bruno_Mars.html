		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well looky here looky here ah what do we have?
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night it is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me baby, baby please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay
To every girl that I meet here, this is what I'll say

Run run runaway, runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true

You poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run runaway, runaway baby
Uh, ah yeah

Well let me think, let me think, ah what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me baby, baby please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay
To every girl that I meet here, this is what I'll say

Run run runaway, runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true

You poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run runaway, runaway baby
Uh, check it out

See I ain't tryna hurt you baby
No no no I just want to work you baby
See I ain't tryna hurt you baby
No no no I just want to work you baby

If you are scared, you better run (you better run)
You better run, (you better run)
You better run, (you better run)
You better, you better, you better

Run run runaway, runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true

You poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run runaway, runaway baby
