		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So sweet,
Memories,
Istanbul to Paris,
Remember your first kiss
but all of this is gone.

and I don't want to wait for you, wait for you
and I don't want to wait for you, wait for you
and I don't want to wait
you shouldn't hesitate
when I'm all the way, all the way for you

na na na
darari darari and darida

I hold on to memory
like the last star in the sky
can you light it up for me
and tell me why
I feel so many many many things
when you're around me baby
and I know I feel I feel I feel
I feel for you
What should I do
