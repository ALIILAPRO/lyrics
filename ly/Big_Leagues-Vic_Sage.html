		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m in the big leagues told em don’t miss me
I’m balling like Houston, ey
Feeling like Whitney i need the bag bruh
Send it through quickly
I’m making hit's dawg
Like I’m in the big leagues

Told em that I gotta go dawg
I’m right on the road y’all
I think that I’m back I’m in my bag now
So I need that Goyard
Got hit's when they throwing the fast bar
Just too quick for it
Peeling off like the whip orange
Seen they effort it’s piss poor
Got too much I gotta tend to
Car payments and the rents due
Bruh I told y’all that I’m 6 foot but
With the money stacked man I’m 10-2
Too much that I been through
So I put it all in that rear view
Clean money and a black whip
Got old problems, but the friends new

I’m in the big leagues told em don’t miss me
I’m balling like Houston, ey
Feeling like Whitney, yeah
I need the bag bruh send it through quickly
I’m making hit's dawg
Like I’m in the big leagues, yeah

Told em Imma hit it out the stands
I deserve another hunnit bands
I deserve another hunnit fans
Told em this was always in the plans
I just did it cause they said I can't
Blowing Euros when I’m down in france
Labels asking how I built the brand
Told put the check up in my hands
Ooo, I got time no cap
Made a few checks but they all in the raps
Had a few friends but they stuck in the past
I don’t even trip when I thinking bout that
Hopped in the whip and we all in black
Shawty wanna ride told her hop in the back
0 to a hunnit see it rev on the dash
They ain’t catching up dawg
I’m moving too fast

I’m in the big leagues told em don’t miss me
I’m balling like Houston, ey
Feeling like Whitney i need the bag bruh
Send it through quickly
I’m making hit's dawg
Like I’m in the big leagues
