		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She planned ahead for a year, he said let's play it by ear
She didn't want him to run, he didn't want her to fear
Nobody said it'd be easy, they knew it was rough
But, tough luck

I fell in love today, there aren't many words you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's enough for me, she's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
Your only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

So, she put his heart in a bag, he wouldn't ask for it back
He didn't want her to cry, she didn't want to be sad
She said, you better not leave me
This shit'll be fucked for days and weeks and months, but

I fell in love today, there aren't any words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's enough for me, she's in love with me

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
Your only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

Add it all up, I can find it
The problem with love is I'm blinded by
It rattles my lungs, but my mind is
Tangled between your little flaws
Your flaws, your flaws, your flaws

You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
Your only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love

Wait for love, I won't wait for love
Wait for love, I won't wait for love
Wait for love
