		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Story starts, quiet town
Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way
Then streets of red, red, I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my god, how it all did change

Now they all pray
Bloodstain, wash away

He said, lost my way this bloody day, I lost my way
I heard it
He said, lost my way this bloody day, I lost my way
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said there's something wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles
The gallows calls, son, I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change

Now they all pray
Bloodstain, wash away

He said, lost my way this bloody day, I lost my way
Yeah, I heard it
He said, lost my way this bloody day, I lost my way
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today, yeah

Yeah, well all the green things died
When Ronnie moved to this place
He said, don't you dare ask
Why I'm cursed to wear this face
Well, now we all know why children called him Ronnie frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket
And they all fall down, down, down

He said, lost my way this bloody day, I lost my way
Yeah, yeah, I heard it
He screamed lost my way this bloody day, I lost my way
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

That's right, all things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today, yeah, yeah
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today
