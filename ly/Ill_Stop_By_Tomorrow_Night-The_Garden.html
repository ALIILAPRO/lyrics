		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seriously taken, oh
I am Shears
Threaten me with a weapon
I won't fear
I'll burn a pig
On your front yard lawn
As you sleep
As you dream

Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket
Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket
Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket
Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket

Seriously taken, oh
I am Shears
Threaten me with a weapon
I won't fear
I'll burn a pig
On your front yard lawn
As you sleep
As you dream

Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket
Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket
Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket
Duck, duck, goose
I've got the goose in my back pocket
