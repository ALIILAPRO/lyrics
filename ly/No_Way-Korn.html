		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, things won't go my way
Lately, everything is gray
It feels like something
It feels like nothing

So I came too far
To end up this way
Feeling like I'm God
Feeling there's no way

So I'm angry for today
Anger's the only thing I've made
It feels like something
No, it's nothing

So I came too far
To end up this way
Feeling like I'm God
Feeling there's no way

To live this way
Hating, feeling, falling
To the place where people haunt me
I can't help but keep from falling
To the place where people call me

I can't wait to give them 
These feelings of hating
Keeping inside me for all to take
Picking at me, they're ripping at me
Ripping at me

So I came too far
To end up this way
Feeling like I'm God
Feeling there's no way

(Hating, feeling, falling) So I came too far
(To the place where people haunt me) To end up this way
(I can't help but keep from falling) Feeling like I'm God
(To the place where people call me) Feeling there's no way

To live this way
Live this way
