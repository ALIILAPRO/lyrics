		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders?
Why do I always help you carry your boulders?
You wonder why I carry such a weight on my shoulders
And why would I, such a load?
But someday you'll see, next time I'll try it another way

Why would you try to make me friends with them soldiers?
When you know that I've never been familiar with orders
When you know that my heart is in a pretty disorder
And you should know that in my heart you fill every corner
And someday you'll see that all I want is to please
Oh, next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will it take?
How many summers will I wait?
How many shoulders will I break?

Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders?
Why am I always by your side when you're down?
Why did I help you build a beautiful house?
And why did I break my back for you in the cold?
And someday you'll see, next time I'll try it another way

Why would I have to quit if time makes me older?
Why do they wonder why I never get bored?
And how could I tell them that I'll never let go
But hey, you're my man but they just won't understand
Someday you'll see that all I want is to please, oh
Next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will it take?
How many summers will I wait?
How many shoulders will I break?

Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders?
Why do I always help to carry your boulders?
You wonder why I carry such a weight on my shoulders
And why would I, such a load?
'Cause someday you'll see, all I want is to please, oh
Next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will it take?
How many summers will I wait?
How many summers will I wait?
