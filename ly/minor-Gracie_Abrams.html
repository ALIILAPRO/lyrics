		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit me 3-1-0
And I'll be home at some point
Past sundown, because traffic
You already know that, oh
I'll put on a show
If you just come over
I'm sorry your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and mom's up at home
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand, I can't 'cause

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck, oh

Hit me 3-1-0
We'll meet by the freeway
It's shady, but better than nothing
Oh, take my word
I grew up not far, but never been down here
At this time
Your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and dad's at the door
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand, I can't 'cause

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck, oh-oh

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck
