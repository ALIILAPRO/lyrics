		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the morning when I wake
And the sun is coming through
Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness
And you fill my head with you

Shall I write it in a letter?
Shall I try to get it down?
Oh, you fill my head with pieces
Of a song I can't get out

Can I be close to you?
Oh-oh-oh-ooh, ooh
Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh

Can I take it to a morning
Where the fields are painted gold
And the trees are filled with memories
Of the feelings never told?

When the evening pulls the sun down
And the day is almost through
Oh, the whole world it is sleeping
But my world is you

Can I be close to you (ah)?
Ooh (aah), ooh (aah)
Can I be close to you (ah)?
Ooh (aah), ooh (aah)

Can I be close to you (ah)?
Ooh (aah), ooh (aah)
Can I be close to you (ah)?
Ooh (aah), ooh (aah)

Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh
