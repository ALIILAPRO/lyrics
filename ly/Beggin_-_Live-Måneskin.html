		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your lovin' hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin' 

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

Ridin' high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you want me dead
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, anytime I feed, you get me? No
Any time I see, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Oh, put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I wanna paint a picture, tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can gave it away, you had and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on
Keep open the door
Keep hopin' for
That the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin'

Yeah-yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm 'bout to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out
