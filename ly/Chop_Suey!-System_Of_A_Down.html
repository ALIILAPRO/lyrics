		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (We're rolling suicide)

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make up
Hide the scars to fade away the shake up (hide the scars to fade away the)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake up, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my
Self-righteous suicide
I cry
When angels deserve to die

Ah
Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make up
Hide the scars to fade away the (hide the scars to fade away the)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
(Here you go) create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake up, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my
Self-righteous suicide
I cry
When angels deserve to die
In my
Self-righteous suicide
I cry
When angels deserve to die

Father (father), father (father)
Father (father), father (father)
Father, into your hands
I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes forsaken me
In your thoughts forsaken me
In your heart forsaken me, oh

Trust in my
Self-righteous suicide
I cry
When angels deserve to die
In my
Self-righteous suicide
I cry
When angels deserve to die
