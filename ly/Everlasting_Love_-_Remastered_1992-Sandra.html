		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Hearts go astray
Leaving hurt when they go
You went away just when i needed you so
Finding your way
You come back on to me
I'm gonna stay loving you endlessly

Open up your eyes
Then you realize
Here i stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love

You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Look in my eyes
See my love burning strong
No more goodbyes
In your arms i belong
Our time has come
All my dreams have come true
Two hearts as one
Loving me loving you.

Open up your eyes
Then you realize
Here i stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love
