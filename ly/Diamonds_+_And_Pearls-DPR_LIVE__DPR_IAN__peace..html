		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll never know if what she wants is possible
Or if it's wrong to want what we don't have
But if all the diamonds in the world 
Can buy her tea and all the pearls
It doesn't matter what I say (ooh)
'Cause mama wants it anyway
(You are now listening to 88rising
Coming to you, LIVE
Coming to you, LIVE)

I stole all the diamonds in the sky
Looks like Lucy's all alone tonight
I told her one day I'll make it right
On the day I die

I stole all the diamonds in the sky
Looks like Lucy's all alone tonight
I told her one day I'll make it right
On the day I die

I did it for these
Diamonds, tea, pearls
I'm gonna get
Diamonds, tea, pearls
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, oh
Diamonds, tea, pearls
I'm gonna get
Diamonds, tea, pearls
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

Top down, middle of the city
Speeding through the night
And the sun is coming with me
So what you gonna do?
Dream job, make a mil' a minute
Used to park a Beamer, now I'm rollin' in it
So what you gonna do?

I'm gonna get, uh
Diamonds tea pearls
I'm gonna get 
diamonds, tea, pearls
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

Don't stop
Get it, get it, get it
Top speed
I'm way above the limit
So what you gonna do?

I stole all the diamonds in the sky
Looks like Lucy is all alone tonight
I told her one day I'll make it right
On the day I die
I'll ride my dragon up to heaven
And I'll let you know if I get in

I did it for these
Diamonds, tea, pearls
I'm gonna get
Diamonds, tea, pearls
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, oh
Diamonds, tea, pearls
I'm gonna get
Diamonds, tea, pearls
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

(IITE COOL)
