		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night was a car crash
Was a dead conversation
But you were dead right
It's been twenty-five since our last goodbye
I wanna know how you're sleeping
If you're still mine

Yeah, we could dive if you wanna, we could slow it down
It's a cold kinda love from a distance
So, can we strip down to our vitals?
I'm obsessed with your design
And I've missed your soul forever
And I've missed your soul forever

Last night, do you remember it right?
I'm still holding onto the patience like a sunrise
And it's bloody and it's gory, but that's quite alright
And I hate telling these stories 'cause I'm petrified

We can take a flight, drive a car or we could slow it down
It's a desperate kind of love that I'm missing
So, can we strip down to our vitals?
I'm obsessed with your design
And I've missed your soul forever
And I've missed your soul forever

So, superbloodmoon in the sky
Can you see it from where you are?
Can you see it from where you are, yeah?
Can you see it from where you are?
So, superbloodmoon in the sky (superbloodmoon in the sky, uh)
Can you see it from where you are? (Ain't no matter where you are)
Can you see it from where you are? (Ain't no matter where you are)
Can you see it from where you are?
