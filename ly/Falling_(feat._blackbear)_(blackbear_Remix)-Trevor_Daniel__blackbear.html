		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Ooh, ooh

My last made me feel like I would never try again (Try again)
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt (I never felt)
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again (Ooh)
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt (Ah)
Come closer, I'll give you all my love (Ah)
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore that I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Think I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough (Oh)
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

Baby, I'm needin' all your time
Bae, I'm on your mind
I wanna be lit, lit, baby, you comin' in here
Fuck is you sayin'? You know that's a wrap
Keep it a buck, keep it a man
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh

You know that I'm gon' get this shit all for you, babe
You know I ain't gon' keep this shit from you, babe
If I can't have you, I know I'll go insane
If I can't have you, I know I'll go insane

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

I'll never give my all again (Yeah)
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust (Ah-ah-ah)
They find a way to break it down (Yeah)
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down
