		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I did something bad
Don’t know if you should know this Promise I’d take it back
Just can’t seem to control it Trying to move on
Easier said than done

I see his angel eyes Fantasize
Like he’s still mine
How did I stoop this low I’m into you
There’s nothing I can do To stop this deja vu

One strike
I let him in my mind Two strikes
I remembered that time Three strikes
I went and hit reply I know I know
I crossed the line
I know it makes you mad When I romanticize my past Bye bye
Sorry to waste your time I know I know
I crossed the line

I don’t want to break your break your trust and run to him But every time his tide it pulls me in
Trying to move on Easier said than done

I see his angel eyes Hypnotized
Like I’m paralyzed Losing all self-control I’m into you
There’s nothing I can do To stop this deja vu

One strike
 
I let him in my mind Two strikes
I remembered that time Three strikes
I went and hit reply I know I know
I crossed the line
I know it makes you mad When I romanticize my past Bye bye
Sorry to waste your time I know I know
I crossed the line

I never meant to hurt you baby
You know I’m trying I’m trying I’m trying Swear I’m into you
Swear I’m into you

One strike
I let him in my mind Two strikes
I remembered that time Three strikes
I went and hit reply I know I know
I crossed the line
I know it makes you mad When I romanticize my past Bye bye
Sorry to waste your time I know I know
I crossed the line

One strike
I let him in my mind Two strikes
I remembered that time Three strikes
I went and hit reply I know I know
I crossed the line
I know it makes you mad When I romanticize my past
 
Bye bye
Sorry to waste your time I know I know
I crossed the line
