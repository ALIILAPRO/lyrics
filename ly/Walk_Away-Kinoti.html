		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kweli si tulifaana
Lakini sasa 'shaachana
My emotions overwhelm me
Over this unhappy ending
Nilikupenda
The words I told you back in November
I had it all figured out with you
Na nilisema
I'd travel to the moon, ningeenda
I'd do it all, do it all for you
Mapenzi yangu, roho yangu nikupee
Even sent you chocolate and some flowers every day
Where'd I go wrong, tell me what was my mistake
I'm left to wonder why you had to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Why you had to walk away
Nilikucheki juzi kwa mathree
And it hurt to see you happy without me
Can't you see that all this time nimesumbuka
'Cuz everytime I sing this song ninakumbuka
Ulinipenda
The words you told me back in December
It was the world against us two
Na ulisema
You'd travel to the moon, ungeenda
It was us in a love that's true
Mapenzi yangu, roho yangu nikupee
Even sent you chocolate and some flowers every day
Where'd I go wrong, tell me what was my mistake
I'm left to wonder why you had to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Why you had to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Why you had to walk away
