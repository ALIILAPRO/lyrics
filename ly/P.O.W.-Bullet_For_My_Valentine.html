		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my darkest hour
A place where there's no light
I'm trapped here in this nightmare
And there's no end in sight

My body lies here frozen
No voice to scream or shout
Escaping feels untouchable
I know I must get out

Wake, my
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw, my
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more

These feeling's overwhelming
It just won't go away
I'm captive in this nightmare
And this is where I'll stay

Wake, my
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw, my
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more

My anxiety is rising
It just won't go away
Why does this tension keeps building? 
You just leave me to die

Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day
Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day

Live another day

Wake, my
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw, my
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more
