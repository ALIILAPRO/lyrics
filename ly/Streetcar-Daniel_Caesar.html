		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know

Seems like streetlights glowing happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these streetlights glowing happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, I'm just not there

In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

Seems like streetlights glowing happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these streetlights glowing happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination, I'm just not there

In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
I don't know what else to say
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
Don't go live your life in vain
