		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
You're taking all the sunshine away
Making out like you're the main line (I knew that)
'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, huh!
Feeling the beat of my heart

Ooh you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Ooh messing with the beat of my heart yeah!

Ooh you used to be a mean kid
Ooh making such a deal of life
Ooh you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen? Happen, no!
You're speeding too fast, slow down
Slow down, you'd better slow down, slow down

You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove
Cool cat tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah!
Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling every feeling.
