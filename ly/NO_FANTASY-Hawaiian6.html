		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The door on the hill
opened again
There are no dreams here
We spin eternally
like a circus troupe on the road
This road is a thorny path
I walk and must bleed
Keep looking straight
in front of myself
and keep myself steady
Black sea and rotten air
The glaciers melting
under the sun
This is the world
we were hoping for
This is Utopia
Covet forbidden fruit
in the search for
more stimulation
The hands
on the clock of destruction
have begun to turn around

As time passes by
The environment
continues to change
We are in crisis,
close to the edge
Create and destroy
That's not why we are here
and that's not our rightful
occupation
Wasn't supposed to be this way
But no one can say such words
The door is already open wide
There is no fantasy
But it's possible that I way,
I may still be in time
To serve and protect our planet
This is our true work
Look straight in front of myself
Look straight on, straight on
I look straight on, straight on
Straight ahead
