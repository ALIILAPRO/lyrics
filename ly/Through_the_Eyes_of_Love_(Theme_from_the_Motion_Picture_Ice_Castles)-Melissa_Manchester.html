		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please, don't let this feeling end
It's everything I am
Everything I want to be
I can see what's mine now
Finding out what's true since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

Now, I can take the time
I can see my life
As it comes up shining now
Reaching out to touch you
I can feel so much since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

And now I do believe
That even in a storm
We'll find some light
Knowing you're beside me
I'm all right

Please, don't let this feeling end
It might not come again 
And I want to remember
How it feels to touch you
How I feel so much since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

And now I do believe
That even in a storm
We'll find some light
Knowing you're beside me
I'm all right

Now, I can take the time
I can see my life
As it comes up shining now
Reaching out to touch you
I can feel so much since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love
