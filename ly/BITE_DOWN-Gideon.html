		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll show you pain,
Bite down,
Dig deep when you taste defeat,
Pain,
Bite down,
Dig deeper,
The thing about life is,
It don't owe you shit,
All the way down,
Turn this shit up,
I've given up on,
Giving a fuck,
Can't stop won't stop,
I'm bout to go in,
Start up a mosh pit,
Shut down the function,
Aye,
I did it on my own,
It wasn't given,
Fuck you if you think I'm bout to give in,
You wanna know what it took to make this,
Fall, get up, repeat,
I'll show you pain,
Bite down,
Dig deeper,
All the way down,
All the way down,
Turn this shit up,
All the way up,
I've given up on,
I've given up on,
Giving a fuck,
Talkin' about the misery and pain,
Let me show you what it feels like,
Talk is cheap,
These are words that I live by,
Bite down or quit,
But dig deep if you think that you can fuck with this,
Bitch.
