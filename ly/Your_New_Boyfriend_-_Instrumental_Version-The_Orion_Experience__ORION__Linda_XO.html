		  Your New Boyfriend

I remember when we were together and 
We used fancy words just like “forever” and
We controlled the Moon, and willed the stars to shine.
Now, it seems I can't, can't get you off of my mind.

I know that I was the one running ‘round the town.
But something told me that you might stick around,
Then yesterday I saw

You and your new boyfriend, were walking hand in hand.
cnd I just can't remember when it hurt so bad.
cnd yeah, I know, I know, I know I'm the one to blame
For getting caught up in the game. You've got a new boyfriend,
cnd I'm alone again.

I recall a time when we were hand in hand
Taking on the world without a second glance.
Friends would stop to say “Oh, what a perfect pair”.
I recall a time, a time when you were there.

It's such a sorry old song, you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
But all our friends that used to carry on,
Well, they're all talkin' ‘bout

You and your new boyfriend, are walking hand in hand.
cnd I just can't remember when I felt so sad.
cnd yeah, I know, I know, I know I'm the one to blame
For getting caught up in the game. You've got a new boyfriend,
cnd I want you back again.

cnd I wonder, is this how it's meant to be?
Do you tell him all the things that you told me
When we were beautiful, and brilliant like the sun?
Well how am I to keep on going, knowing that we're done?

cnd I know, I know it's over, and I can't go back in time.
If I could I would, cause you should still be mine.
But that's all over now.

You've got a new boyfriend, and you're walking hand in hand.
cnd I just can't remember when, it hurt so bad.
cnd yes, I know, I know, I know I'm the one to blame
for chasing my fortune and fame. You've got a new boyfriend,
cnd I'm alone again.
