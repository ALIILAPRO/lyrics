		  21, 21, 21 21 21
I'm from out the gutter, middle finger, Zone 6
Turned sixteen and I got my first stick
I ain't even fuck the other side, catch a body, sending hits (21)
You call that shit extended clip, we call that bitch a dick (21)

Bitch, I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalkers (21)
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalker

Offset!
Mad Max with me, I'm Biggs (Mad Max)
Run through the draco, we got six (six)
Busting all on your bitch face (ugh)
Make the bitch play with my kids (hey)
This nigga stripped, shot him in the ribs (steak)
Baby bottles, ain't no bibs (lean)
Twenty models all goin' in (twenty models)
Breathing with this water like gills (water)
I done got a low boat on the low note (shh)
And I got an 80 corner that'll choke throats (ugh)
Sipping on hi-tech, Four Lokos (lean)
Wrist brr, fur coat way to go ho
Don't pass out, pop an Addy (Addy)
Won't smoke niggas in the attic (smoke)
I gets the bank roll in the mattress (racks)
I got, drip sauce like relish (drip sauce)
Diamonds slippin', drippin' I'm a problem (hey)
Heated my flow with the marble (marble)
Stand on the stove cook it all up (cook it up)
Trap on the north with the gualas (Migos)
I met some enemies, could've bought a helicopter
Do the surgery on the coupe like a doctor (skrt)
Heard that nigga popped a couple goblins (brr)
Gang, gang nigga, fuck the opposite (ay)

Bitch, I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless (21)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
Bitch, I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless (21)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
Bitch, I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless (21)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious (bitch)
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalkers
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalkers (21)

Hold on, let me kick my shit (yeah)
Audemar drowning my wrist (yeah)
Put a double G on my kids (yeah)
Put a double G on your bitch (yeah)
I'll probably leave you before I leave the lean
Lil' bitch, don't play with my sip (on god)
I ain't even fuckin' round with no stylist
I got too much drip (on god)
You know you too much bitch (on god)
You got too much hips (yeah)
When she suck me off
She got too much lips (21)
4L gang, got a whole lot of choppers, lil nigga
We'll shoot the shit (we'll shoot the shit)
Ran up a whole lot of Ms, lil nigga
I'm trying not to lose this shit (facts)
Rims staggered, bad bitch, I'ma bag her
On my face, issa dagger
Private flights, I'm a jet lagger
Bitch, you ain't got no standards
Where's your manners?
Hundred choppers, roll the window down
MC Hammer

Bitch, I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless (hey)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious (brr)
Bitch, I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious (woo, woo, woo)
Bitch, I'm mad balling, all my diamonds mad flawless (21)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious (brr brr)
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalkers (woo)
I got mad dick, turning these hoes into mad stalkers (21)

If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
