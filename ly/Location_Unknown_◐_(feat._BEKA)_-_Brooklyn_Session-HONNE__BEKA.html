		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Traveling places
I ain't seen you in ages
But I hope you come back to me
My mind's running wild
With you far away
I still think of you a hundred times a day

I still think of you too
If only you knew
When I'm feeling a bit down
I don't wanna pull through
I look over your photograph
And I think how much I miss you
I miss you

I wish I knew where I was
'Cause I don't have a clue
I just need to work out some way of getting me to you
'Cause I will never find love like ours out here
In a million years
A million years

My location unknown
Tryna find a way back home
To you again
I gotta get back to you
Gotta, gotta get back to you

My location unknown
Tryna find a way back home
To you again
I gotta get back to you
Gotta, gotta get back to you

I just need to know that you're safe
Given that I'm miles away
On the first flight
Back to your side
I don't care how long it takes
I know you'll be worth the wait
On the first flight
Back to your side

Traveling places
I ain't seen you in ages
But I hope you come back to me
My mind's running wild
With you far away
I still think of you a hundred times a day

I still think of you too
If only you knew
I just need to work out some way of getting me to you
'Cause I will never find love like ours out here
In a million years
A million years

My location unknown
Tryna find a way back home
To you again
I gotta get back to you
Gotta, gotta get back to you

My location unknown
Tryna find a way back home
To you again
I gotta get back to you
Gotta, gotta get back to you

I just need to know that you're safe
Given that I'm miles away
On the first flight
Back to your side
I don't care how long it takes
I know you'll be worth the wait
On the first flight
Back to your side

I don't want to be wasting time, without you
Don't want to throw away my life
I need you
Something tells me we'll be alright
Something tells me we'll be alright, alright

I don't want to be wasting time, without you
Don't want to throw away my life, I need you
Something tells me we'll be alright
Yeah, something tells me we'll be alright, alright

My location unknown
Tryna find a way back home
To you again
I gotta get back to you
Gotta, gotta get back to you

My location unknown
Tryna find a way back home
To you again
I gotta get back to you
Gotta, gotta get back to you

I just need to know that you're safe
Given that I'm miles away
On the first flight
Back to your side

I don't care how long it takes
I know you'll be worth the wait
On the first flight
Back to your side
