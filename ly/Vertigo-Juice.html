		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna rewind
Take me back in time
Take me to last night
Just the right dose of sugar and spice
The way you stared into my eyes
Like a reflection in the mirror
Feel like I known your forever
But you are barely just a stranger
The feelings overflow
Im getting vertigo
Bring me to the floor, spin me around give me a show
I want some more , give me some more
You got my mind messed up
Dreaming
Of you still when I wake up
Tell me what did you did
To get me so Caught up
Wonder if the next time you'll be showing up
To give me some more love
You got my mind messed up
Dreaming
Of you still when I wake up
Tell me what did you did
To get me so Caught up
Wonder if the next time you'll be showing up
To give me some more love
So let's go
I'll follow
You tonight
So take me out
The feelings overflow
Im getting vertigo
Bring me to the floor, spin me around give me a show
I want some more
You got my mind messed up
Dreaming
Of you still when I wake up
Tell me what did you did
To get me so Caught up
Wonder if the next time you'll be showing up
To give me some more love
You got my mind messed up
Dreaming
Of you still when I wake up
Tell me what did you did
To get me so Caught up
Wonder if the next time you'll be showing up
To give me some more love
