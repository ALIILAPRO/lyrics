		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this our first? Or second nature?
When's that rapture? Will there be merch?
Where is mother? She was a stunner, can we page her?
What mine eyes have seen could really take the purse
Are we charged now? Or are we fakers?
Parade around or get in work or just desert

We will see you next time
They'll be water in the rain
Territories pay fines
All long day (say it will be, say it will be)
All may not be just fine (all long day)
There is another fate, a way
To not be too late, unobfuscate

Is this our fault? And are we just too damn used to it
The cipher too elusive, that tale it just won't stop
You could vaguely on top, strike the key, lay down the mop
As if endings ain't endings and feet they just won't drop
Ain't this real time? And aren't we takers?
You want what's more and don't excuse
And just refuse

We will see you next time (is this mercy?)
They'll be water in the rain
Territories pay fines
All long day (say it with me, say it with me)
All may not be just fine (all long day)
There is another fate, a way
To not be too late

We will see you next time
They'll be water in the rain
Territories pay fines
All long day (say it with me, say it with me)
All may not be just fine (all long day)
There is another fate, a way
To not be too late, unobfuscate
