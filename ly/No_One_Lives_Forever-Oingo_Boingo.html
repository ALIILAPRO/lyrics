		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You worry too much
You make yourself sad
You can't change fate
But don't feel so bad
Enjoy it while you can
It's just like the weather
So quit complaining brother
No one lives forever

Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky 
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die

I'm so happy
Dancing while the Grim Reaper
Cuts cuts cuts but he can't get me
I'm clever as can be
And I'm very quick
But don't forget
We've only got so many tricks
No one lives forever

You think you've got it rough
What about your darling doggie
Ten short years
And he's getting old and groggy
I don't think it's very fair
Cold Chop Low
But it's all relative my friend cause
No one lives forever

Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky 
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die

I'm so happy
Dancing while the Grim Reaper
Cuts cuts cuts but he can't get me
I'm clever as can be
And I'm very quick
But don't forget
We've only got so many tricks
No one lives forever

You worry too much
You make yourself sad
You can't change fate
But don't feel so bad
Enjoy it while you can
It's just like the weather
So quit complaining brother
No one lives forever

Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky 
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die

No one beats him at his game
For very long but just the same
Who cares there's no place safe to hide
Nowhere to run no time to cry
So celebrate why you still can
Cause any second it may end
And when it's all been said and done
Better that you had some fun
Instead of hiding in a shell
Why make your life a living hell?
Have a toast, down the cup
Drink to bones that turn to dust

Cause
No one, no one, no one... 
No one lives forever!
