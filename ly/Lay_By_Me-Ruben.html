		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stripped it down for your naked eyes
So you could understand and let me inside
So I hope you know through the rising tide
That I'll be here and you can lay by my side
Oh, oh, oh-oh
You can rely on me, you know
Oh, oh, oh-oh
When this town is locked and closed
You can

Lay by me, I still care
When you need, lay by me
Lay by me, if you're here
You can still lay by me

Hey-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh

I know the places you go to hide
I've been in all those rooms, I know what that's like
Staring at paint as you watch it dry
But don't forget your room is right next to mine

And you can lay by me
If that is something you would need, yeah
Lay by me, if you need
You can

Lay by me, I still care
When you need, lay by me
Lay by me, if you're here
You can still lay by me
Lay by me, I still care
When you need, lay by me
Lay by me, if you're here
You can still lay by me

Hey-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh
Hey-oh

Lay by me, I still care
When you need, lay by me
Lay by me, if you're here
You can still lay by me
