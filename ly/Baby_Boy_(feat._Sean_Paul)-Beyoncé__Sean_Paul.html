Ah dat di gyal dem need and ah cry for every day without apology
Buck dem di right way, dat ah my policy (ya man, right way)
Sean de Paul 'longside Beyoncé (uh-huh), now hear di man say
Dis ah dutty yeah (a big tune), dutty yo (yo, yo)
Dutty yeah (yo, yo), dutty yo (yo, yeah)
Beyoncé sing it now, girl

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies (come on, girl, tell me how you feel)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams 
(I see you in my dreams, you done know di love is real)
Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (come on, girl tell me what's the deal)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
(I see you in my dreams, you done know di love is real)

Ah, oh, my baby's fly, baby, oh (oh, na, na, na)
Yes, no, hurt me so good, baby, oh (this hot, oh, na, na, na)
I'm so wrapped up in your love, let me go (yo, oh, na, na, na)
Let me breathe, stay out my fantasies (yo, yo, yo, alright)

Well, woman ah ready fi gimme da ting, they ready fi really get it live
Tellin' me all about di tings weh you ah fantasize
I know you dig di way me step, di way me mek mi stride
Follow your feelings, baby girl becah they cannot be denied
Come check me inna di night and mek we get it amplified
Me nuh quick fi run da ship, me nah go slip, me nah go slide
In other words the love I got to give is certified
Fi give you di toughest, longest type ah ride, girl

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies (come on, girl, tell me how you feel)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
(I see you in my dreams, you done know di love is real)
Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (come on, girl tell me what's the deal, bye, bye, bye)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
(I see you in my dreams, you done know di love is real)

Picture us dancin' real close
In a dark, dark corner of a basement party (oh, na, na, na)
Every time I close my eyes
It's like everyone left but you and me (oh, na, na, na)
In our own little world
The music is the sun
The dance floor becomes the sea (oh, na, na, na) (ah we dat, girl)
Feels like true paradise to me (oh, na, na, na) (intimacy)

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies (come on, girl, tell me how you feel)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams 
(I see you in my dreams, you done know di love is real)
Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (come on, girl tell me what's the deal, bye, bye, bye)
I think about you all the time (oh)
I see you in my dreams
(I see you in my dreams, you done know di love is real)

Baby boy, you stay on my mind (yo, yo, B)
Baby boy, you are so damn fine (yeah, yeah, girl)
Baby boy, won't you be mine? (Yo, yo, B)
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel

Baby boy, you stay on my mind, oh (yo, yo, B)
Baby boy, you are so damn fine, oh (yeah, yeah, girl)
Baby boy, won't you be mine? (Yo, yo, B)
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel

You's a top, top girl

Drive 'round di town inna your drop top, girl
You nuh stop shop, girl
Likkle more di Dutty wan' rock dat world
