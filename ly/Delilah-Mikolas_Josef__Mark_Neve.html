		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My, my, oh my, Delilah
My mind be on a high now
I lie at night and light up
My, my, oh my, Delilah

Every morning
I wake up to your ghost, yeah, I'm haunted
Can't let go
Though I'm trying
Every time I see the car you were driving
I wave hello

And I've been lying to all of my friends saying I moved on
Oh, but I know they all know I would lose it if you would call

My, my, oh my, Delilah
My mind be on a high now
I lie at night and light up
My, my, oh my, Delilah
One mile high in Nevada
She baila lambada
Like midnight in Havana
My, my, oh my, Delilah

My, my, oh my, Delilah
My mind be on a high now
I lie at night and light up
My, my, oh my, Delilah
One mile high in Nevada
She baila lambada
Like midnight in Havana
My, my, oh my, Delilah

Eyes on you, 9th of June
In the heat of our summer in the sand on Corfu
And your T-shirt said "Lover"
Rum and lime, body high, we'd be moving like Jagger
And we swore on our lives
It'd be like this forever

I've been lying to all of my friends saying I moved on
Oh, but I know they all know I would lose it if you would call

My, my, oh my, Delilah
My mind be on a high now
I lie at night and light up
My, my, oh my, Delilah
One mile high in Nevada
She baila lambada
Like midnight in Havana
My, my, oh my, Delilah

My, my, oh my, Delilah
My mind be on a high now
I lie at night and light up
My, my, oh my, Delilah
One mile high in Nevada
She baila lambada
Like midnight in Havana
My, my, oh my, Delilah

Every morning
I wake up to your ghost, yeah, I'm haunted
Can't let go
Though I'm trying
Every time I see the car you were driving
I wave hello
