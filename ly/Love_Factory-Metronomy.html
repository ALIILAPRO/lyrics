		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Each day's a little victory, she knows how to win a fight
And watching the deserters leave, I've got to make it right
Her love is like a factory
And every day, she's making me
Her love is like a factory
And every day, she's making me

I'll handle for the fallout
And you can take all the heat
We can drive for hours and hours on end
But we'll never even see the sea
Let's go to the theatre
Let's catch up with friends
Let's pray to God that they're still here
When we need them on side again
And again and again

Each day's a little victory, she knows how to win a fight
(She knows it, she knows it)
And watching the deserters leave
I've got (I've got) to make it right (I've got to make it right)
Her love is like a factory (she's so industrious)
And every day, she's making me (work so hard)
Her love is like a factory (so hard)
And every day, she's making me

I can be the bad cop
And you can be the good
I can make us all the things we need
Just give me some sap and wood
Let's go see a movie
Let's buy a brand-new car
Let's climb the highest mountain range
And forget just who we are
Who we are, who we are

Each day's a little victory
She knows (she knows) how to win a fight (she knows it, she knows it)
And watching the deserters leave
I've got (gotta, I got) to make it right (I've got to make it right)
Her love is like a factory (oh, she's so industrious)
And every day, she's making me (work so hard)
Her love is like a factory (so hard)
And every day, she's making me
Miss work

Work with me

I can make a bandage
I can fix a splint
I can recall anything about everything I've seen
Let's get that leg seen to
Let's keep each other warm
Let's wait for this storm to pass
And head out at the crack of dawn

Each day's a little victory
She knows how to win a fight (oh, she knows it)
And watching the deserters leave
I've got to make it right (I've got to make it right)
Her love is like a factory (oh, she's so industrious)
And every day she's making me (work so hard)
Her love is like a factory (so hard)
And every day she's making me
