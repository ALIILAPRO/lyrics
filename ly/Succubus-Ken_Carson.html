		  (Wake up-)
Yeah-ah, yeah-ah
Yeah-ah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-ah

My emo bitch like to slit her wrists, yeah, she's so dark
She was moving too fast, I had to put that bitch in park
She said "Boy, don't start with me," but I already started
How you let your ex drive you crazy, and he ain't got no car? Yeah-ah
If this ain't Heaven, this bitch goin' to hell
This bitch a succubus, she suck me, yeah
Yeah-ah, yeah

I'm off the shits right now, these drugs got me talking sideways
I can't control myself, I'm doing the opposite of what my mind say
I can't find the exit, huh, huh, I'm on the highway
But I just found a bitch that'll let me help her, yeah, my way (my way)
And me and that bitch do whatever I say
Bitch, I'm not Tom, but I need my space (my space, yeah)
Don't be afraid, if you want to leave, don't let me get in your way
If you want to try something new, that's okay (that's okay)
Make your own decisions, I'm not phased
Just like Lil Uzi, baby girl, my love is rage
And I can fully understand if you can't deal with it
Every time I switch time frames, I text a ho like, "I'm in your city"
She wanna fuck me, I wanna fuck her, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, she with it
I'm off the lean, she off the Casamigos and she 'bout to get it
Shawty fell in love with my swag, and now she takin' off my Rick
Why your ho staring so hard? I'm 'bout to take off with your bitch
These niggas be talking like Phineas, but I'm like Ferb, I don't say shit
Yeah, I heard the word, but before I repeat it, I'ma forget it
Raf Simons swag, the pants pleated, the sweater knitted
Every time she pop out, yeah, yeah, they know that's my bitch
Every time I pop out, it's a party, yeah, it's lit

My emo bitch like to slit her wrists, yeah, she's so dark
She was moving too fast, I had to put that bitch in park
She said, "Boy don't start with me" but I already started
How you let your ex drive you crazy, and he ain't got no car? Yeah-ah
If this ain't Heaven, this bitch goin' to hell
This bitch a succubus, she suck me, yeah
Yeah-ah, yeah
