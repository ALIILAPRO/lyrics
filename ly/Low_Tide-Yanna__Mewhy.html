		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please keep your eyes on the floor
For my pain will be ignored
I ache in despair
And you ran away
Who are you to tell me what to do?
If you have never even walked in my shoes
I'll show you
Caught up in a moment
Lady we were just fine
Tell me why it's over
What if you had found your piece
I need the low tide
I need the low tide
I mean I won't cry
I need the low tide
No matter how hard I've tried, no words came out
Grown kids we are
Playing with the love that we're hating at the same time
Picked up this life I know so much
I miss your vibe and your soft touch
What have I done am I a lost cause?
My feet are burning when I'm on pause
Let me be your shelter outside your shell
All you need is feathers in an empty sky
We can build a treasure if you let me in
