		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been on my own for the longest time
Searching for my own through uncertainty
Got no place to go in this state of mind
Tryna find a meaning in life, but I still got ways to go

Searching through the darkness now, heartless
Don't know where my heart is, wondering where the spark went
I don't know where to go, but I know that I'll find my way
Trusting in the process, trust I'm making progress
I'm on the cusp, so just trust me, yeah, I got this
I know, if I just hold on, that I'll have my day
Mm-mm, mm

I've been on my own for the longest time
Searching for my own through uncertainty
Got no place to go in this state of mind
Tryna find a meaning in life, but I still got ways to go

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ways to go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ways to go

Easily forgotten, I'll be in the lost and found
Off, yeah, runnin' out of options
Oh, I wish that there only was a way to make it all so down
And if I had the answers maybe I could solve this
Maybe it'll be easier than dealin' with my conscience
It's a shame that I carry all this weight on my shoulders now (yeah)

I've been on my own for the longest time (I don't wanna be by myself no more)
Searching for my own through uncertainty (yeah)
Got no place to go in this state of mind (state of mind)
Tryna find a meaning in life, but I still got ways to go

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ways to go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ways to go
