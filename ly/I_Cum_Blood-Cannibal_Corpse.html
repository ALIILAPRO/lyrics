		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
Twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole 
Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity 
The smell was unbearable as I unburied her

I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
Down her throat, swallow 

Eyes glassy and vacant
Body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
Tonguing her rotted anus 

I need a live woman
To fill with my fluid
A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill

Her body exceptional
She thought I was normal
But I wanted more 
I came blood inside of her
Choking on the clot
Gagging on the snot

Gushing blood, from her mouth
Bloody gel leaking out

Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
The sickness I have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
The greatest thrill of my life
Slit my own cock with a knife 
Violent, climax, serging serum on my skin 

Back from the dead
I am resurrected to spew, putrefaction
