		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh yeah, Xanitsage)

Uhm, tell me what would you do
Puttin' my position
Waking up confused 
And with a new addiction
I'd say I'm addicted to this life I chose 
She thinks I'm addicted to that powder dope

She said hit me first so I can really feel it
I'm not tryn' to hit you girl
That shit's forbidden 
I'm up in the far rest
Tryin' to kill demons
Standing way to hate
For the pills screaming 

Woohoo, it's right now, right now
I ain't got the time to fuck around now
Every body told me set it down-body, 
it's right now, right now
Woohoo, it's right now, right now
I in cup of booty make it come yeah 
I ain't got these times; fuck around know no
it's right now, right now, know no

She told to me to quit it
Yeah I gotta listen 
I'm not tryin' to kill myself from sense from loveless
kissing 
I've been saying insane enough to let it go
Once I get a hold of it
I let it blur

Maybe we should talk about this new decision
Every one pussy 'V,V' like a new religion
I just took another now I'm set going
Want to feel it now
It's taking too long

Woohoo, it's right now, right now
I ain't got the time to fuck around now
Every body told me set it down-body, 
it's right now, right now
Woohoo, it's right now, right now
I in cup of booty make it come yeah 
I ain't got these times; fuck around know no
it's right now, right now, know no

This is the way
Baby ride it like a more than fuckin' tidle wave yeah
I've been putting in the work every single day
Yeah this is that real shit
We just tend to do shit
These growing real quick
Yeah this is the way
We art in the lane now
Finally getting fucken paid now
Yeah
This is the wet weather
We riding the wave way wet
This is the way

Woohoo, it's right now, right now
I ain't got the time to fuck around now
Every body told me set it down-body, 
it's right now, right now
Woohoo, it's right now, right now
I in cup of booty make it come yeah 
I ain't got these times; fuck around know no
it's right now, right now, know no
