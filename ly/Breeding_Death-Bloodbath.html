		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling into your demise
Reaping death across their eyes
Born as a freak in a killing breath
Ignorance prevails, breeding death

A dream contorted, a victim of death
Throughout reality devoid of breath
For the only plain site of gore
Rise from the crypt writhe no more

Wrapped in cold see the light mist
Scream in the night with a final hiss
Roasting the innards for me to bless
Drowning in bile, enjoying the mess

They begin to fade 
Into the dreadful maze like the taste
Painted the wall with the blood of a slut
Everlasting scrolls are beginning to rot
I flow around you like a flood
Running as a mortal silhouette of a soul to die
Don't turn around, 'cause it's you I saw!

I see this evocation
I see young dead is there
I see decapitation
In the wake of pain, breeding death!
Breeding death!
Breeding death!

Embrace my doom!
The dead I screw!
Life is no more!
My sole existence in gore!
Conjure up my grave
Come near; be brave.
This vine I will lift, rip
The rapture deep in my head

Undertaker, fake servant of god
Followers they will take me to god
Fucking fools, doesn't matter that you pray!
You will die, 'cause it's you that I will slay!

Time to meet thy maker!
The noose tied around your neck!
But my eyes are open wide!
Evil and wicked ways!
You believe in god, just another broken neck
Mutilated delay the call 
The sound of the bell remains

Falling into your demise
Reaping death across their eyes
Born as a freak in a killing breath
Ignorance prevails, breeding death

I see this evocation
I see young dead is there
I see decapitation
In the wake of pain, breeding death!
