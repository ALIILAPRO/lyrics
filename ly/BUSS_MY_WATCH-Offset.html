		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Buss my watch, yeah
Buss my watch
Maison Margiela on the thot 

Buss my watch (Wheezy outta here)
Maison Margiela on a thot 
CPN, put her in the spot 
Turn it up, make another knot
Flexin' on the 'Gram, where you stay?
Savin' these bitches with a cape
Stayin' out the way, gettin' paid
Teach 'em how to surf on a wave

I took a nigga bitch, doggystyle on the floor
Pretty bitches in the party doin' coke (let's go)
He ain't really rich, say it ain't so
Got money, I don't like to showboat
I had to get on my feet
When I fell, these niggas some wannabes
I can tell, I trapped on the corner street
Any weather I'm livin' life luxury, hot as hell 
It won't be another me and she can tell
Feel like I'm dreamin', this Gucci, Chanel
I told 'em get 'em some money, don't steal
She wanna swim in this money like wells

You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, let that thing talk to 'em
Talk to 'em baby

Men lie, women lie, but the money tell the truth, though
Lamborghini, but the roof ghost
Patek on me, not a Hublot
10th grade, kickin' doors
Climbin' through a nigga window
Real life, no pretend though
Choppa shootin', catch the memo
Hallelujah for your kinfolks
Sorry, we gon' have to spin more
I'm a target, so I keep a big .40
(Spin more, spin more, spin more, spin more)
I know them niggas got the memo
Pointers hangin' out the window
Droppin' ashes on my Rick-O

Buss my watch (Wheezy outta here)
Maison Margiela on a thot 
CPN, put her in the spot 
Turn it up, make another knot
Flexin' on the 'Gram, where you stay?
Savin' these bitches with a cape
Stayin' out the way, gettin' paid
Teach 'em how to surf on a wave
(Teach 'em how to surf on a wave)
