		<p>
		  I could take a loss
I could take a loss
I ain't took a loss in so long I forgot
I forgot, I forgot
Awful lot
I forgot, yeah, I forgot
I forgot, yeah, half a God, yeah, out for God, yeah
Out for God, yeah, I'm a God
Why, I'm a God

Ooh, I know you mad, you love I'm disrespectful
Don't you love that I got condos out up on the moon?
I could sell you something that you never thought you knew
Yeah, I could sell you peace, but I could kill it too
Watch (watch me), watch, and they
And they watch, and I know they load it up before they do it on the spot (yeah, yeah)
And these diamonds on the spot, on the spot (yeah, yeah)
'Fore you talk to me again, I do a lot, do a lot
Yeah, why you talk a lot, talk a lot? Oh my God (yeah, yeah)
Why you talk to me so much? Yeah, oh my God
I try to take you seriously, but I laugh a lot (yeah, yeah)
I could sell ya hope, yeah, or I could sell you lies (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I look between the lines (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look me in the eyes
Tell me that you fucking God, I tell ya lies
I'm the only one of them, that's no despise

I could take a loss
I could take a loss
I ain't took a loss in so long I forgot
I forgot, I forgot
Awful lot
I forgot, yeah, I forgot
I forgot, yeah, half a God, yeah, out for God, yeah
Out for God, yeah, I'm a God
Why, I'm a God
