		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me yes
Tell me yes
Tell me you like it boy
Tell me I make it good
I wanna hear you say
Yes, yes
That I'm the only one
That you've been thinking of
I wanna hear you say

When the lights go down
Feelings coming round, do you think of me?
Do you picture me?
Do you like it baby when I call you daddy all up in your ear, ear
What you're wanna hear, hear?

Boy I'm not a freak to give everything take it like a choice
Do you want my love as much as I want yours
Baby tell me if I if I'm doin' your right?
'Cause I need to hear it boy

Tell me yes
Tell me yes
Tell me you like it boy
Tell me I make it good
I wanna hear you say
Yes, yes
That I'm the only one
That you've been thinking of
I wanna hear you say
Yes
Tell me I'm the one that you love
Yes
Tell me I'm the one and only
I'm the one and only

I let you feel on me without your fantasy
Put you in control, pleasure to your soul, soul

Boy I'm not a freak to give everything take it like a choice
Do you want my love as much as I want yours
Baby tell me if I if I'm doin' your right?
'Cause I need to hear it boy

Tell me yes
Tell me yes
Tell me you like it boy
Tell me I make it good
I wanna hear you say
Yes, yes
That I'm the only one
That you've been thinking of
I wanna hear you say
Yes
Tell me I'm the one that you love
Yes
Tell me I'm the one and only
I'm the one and only

Baby just keep on lovin' me right
Never let go off me
Baby you keep this fire alive
I'm giving you all of me

Tell me yes
Tell me yes
Tell me you like it boy
Tell me I make it good
I wanna hear you say
Yes, yes
That I'm the only one
That you've been thinking of
I wanna hear you say
Yes
Tell me I'm the one that you love
Yes
Tell me I'm the one and only
I'm the one and only
Yes
Tell me I'm the one that you love
Yes
Tell me I'm the one and only
I'm the one and only
