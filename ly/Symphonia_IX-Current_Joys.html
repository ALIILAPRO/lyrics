		  Verse 1
I try and try to make you cry
And make you love me
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say yes
The need to be the best before the need to rest
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say yes

Chorus 1
See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
And I won't go on

See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
And I won't go on

Verse 2
To make the pain defuse the flame can be trying
But I would say yes, I would say yes
So as you fade away alive, I lay dying
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say

Chorus 2
See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
And I won't go on

See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
And I won't go on
