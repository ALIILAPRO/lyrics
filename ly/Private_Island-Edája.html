		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you inside me, don't want you beside me
It's my private island just you invited
If I let you hit it won't, it won't do no damage
Just don't put me off track
Or you can't come back, no you can't come back
No catching feels tonight
Boy you know I ain't the one for you
But you can be the right distraction
No catching feels tonight
Boy you know I ain't the one for you
But you can be the right distraction
I know exactly what I want, I like you around
I never had the time to be tied down
I need you in my crib, how does that sound
But don't you feel a way
If I let you hit it won't, it won't do no damage
Just don't put me off track
Or you can't come back, no you can't come back
No catching feels tonight
Boy you know I ain't the one for you
But you can be the right distraction
No catching feels tonight
Boy you know I ain't the one for you
But you can be the right distraction
