		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember there was mist
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around
And on the lake, there was a boat
And in the boat, there was a man

Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?

Damn you! You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see? Curse you!
You little lying Delilah! You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free! Damn you!
Curse you! Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look
Or bear to think of me?
This loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell
But secretly yearns for heaven
Secretly secretly but Christine

Fear can turn to love you'll learn to see
To find the man behind the monster
This repulsive carcass, who seems a beast
But secretly dreams of beauty
Secretly secretly oh, Christine

Come, we must return
Those two fools who run my
Theater will be missing you
