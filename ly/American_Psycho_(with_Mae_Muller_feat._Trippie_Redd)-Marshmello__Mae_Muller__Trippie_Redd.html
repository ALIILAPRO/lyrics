		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a trainwreck, kinda jealous
Sometimes I get a little bit selfish
Pessimistic, a little twisted
But at least I'm not the one that can't admit it

If I had to blame somebody
Then you would be that body
You put the T in toxic
Yeah, you do

Oh, you're so bad for my health
When I should've hated you
You made me hate myself
But I know better now
All the lies that I believed in
Why are you surprised that I'm leaving?
Put on quite a show
True American Psycho

Whoa, she said that I'm a psycho
Whoa, she said I'm not her type though (yeah)
Ooh, I'm out my mind, out my mind
I didn't mean to fall in love
I didn't mean to lose your trust
You used to call me on the phone
Nowadays, you're only calling me psycho

Oh, you're so bad for my health
When I should've hated you
You made me hate myself
But I know better now
All the lies that I believed in
Why are you surprised that I'm leaving?
Put on quite a show
True American psycho (I'm so out my head)
True American psycho (I'm so better off dead)
True American psycho

If I had to blame somebody
Then you would be that body
You put the T in toxic
Yeah, you do

(I'm so done)

All the lies that I believed in
Why are you surprised that I'm leaving?
Put on quite a show

True American psycho
True American psycho
Yeah, yeah
True American psycho
