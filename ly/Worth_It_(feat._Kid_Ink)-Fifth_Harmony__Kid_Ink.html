		  Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh-huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it (uh)
Uh-huh, I'm worth it (uh)
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it (uh)

Okay
I tell her bring it back like she left some' (got some)
Bring it bring it back like she left some' (got some)
Uh, in the club with the lights off
What you actin' shy for?
Come and show me that you're
Wit 'it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it
Stop playin' now you know that I'm
Wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it
What you actin' shy for?

Just gimme you, just gimme you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
I may talk a lot of stuff
Guaranteed I can back it up
I think I'ma call your bluff
Hurry up, I'm waitin' out front

Uh-huh, you see me in the spot like
"Ooh, I love your style"
Uh-huh, show me what you got
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh-huh, see me in the spot like
"Ooh, I love your style"
Uh-huh, show me what you got
Now come and make it worth my while

Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh-huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it (uh)
Uh-huh, I'm worth it (uh)
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it

It's all on you, it's all on you
It's all on you, so what you wanna do?
And if you don't have a clue
Not a clue, I'll tell you what to do
Come harder just because
I don't like it, like it too soft (soft)
I like it a little rough
Not too much, but maybe just enough

Uh-huh, you see me in the spot like
"Ooh, I love your style"
Uh-huh, show me what you got
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh-huh, see me in the spot like
"Ooh, I love your style"
Uh-huh, show me what you got
Now come and make it worth my while

Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh-huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (know what I mean?)
Baby, I'm worth it (uh, give me everything)
Uh-huh, I'm worth it (uh)
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it (uh)

Okay
I tell her bring it back like she left some' (got some)
Bring it bring it back like she left some' (got some)
Uh, in the club with the lights off
What you actin' shy for?
Come and show me that you're
Wit 'it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it
Stop playin' now you know that I'm
Wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it, wit' it
What you actin' shy for?

Uh-huh, you see me in the spot like
"Ooh, I love your style"
Uh-huh, show me what you got
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh-huh, see me in the spot like
"Ooh, I love your style"
Uh-huh, show me what you got
Now come and make it worth my while

Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh-huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (know what I mean?)
Baby, I'm worth it (uh, give me everything)
Uh-huh, I'm worth it (uh)
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it

Give it to me, I'm worth it
