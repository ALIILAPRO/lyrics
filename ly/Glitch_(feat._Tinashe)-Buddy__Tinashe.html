		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh, shit, system got a glitch, bitch (oh, shit)
Money comin' in, it got an itch, bitch (yeah)
Everyday you know I'm gettin' rich, bitch (rich, money)
Niggas hatin', I don't give a shit, bitch
Guilty conscience, I ain't innocent, yeah (yeah)
Tryna make a nigga cease and desist (ayy)
I command you bitch, I Saran the whip (ah)
I demand some chips, I'm bringin' the clips
My back in, flip, I hang 'round some Crips (sh)
Some Bloods, pimps, some thugs, yuh, 'sup?

Oh, yeah, that's right
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's right
You goddamn right
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's right
We don't play nice
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's right
Just rate my price
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's
Money bags, cash cars, clothes
Hunnid racks, stack tall, whoa
Money bags, cash cars, clothes
Hunnid racks, stack tall, whoa

Yeah, out late night with some moves (moves)
We stay breakin' all the rules (rules)
Me and three bitches in the nude (nude)
I'm the realest nigga in the room (room)
Another twenty K came through (yes)
I'm runnin' through, but not actin' foolish
Nothin' to prove, got somethin' to lose
So, buckle your dues, to pay for my doom (ooh)
From the west side it's true (true)
In a designer suit (suit)
Watch who you talkin' to (who?)
Out of my mind I'm glitchin'
Probably 'cause I been sippin', smokin', trippin'
All of these bitches dancin' on top of my Dickies
Countin' up hundreds and fifties
It's gettin wicked, I'm 'bout to black in a minute
I'm gone

Oh, yeah, that's right
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's right
You goddamn right
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's right
We don't play nice
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's right
Just rate my price
Oh, yeah, that's right, oh, yeah, that's-
Money bags, cash cars, clothes
Hunnid racks, stack tall, whoa
Money bags, cash cars, clothes
Hunnid racks, stack tall, whoa

Oh, yeah that's right
Oh, yeah that's right
Oh, yeah that's right
Oh, yeah that's right
