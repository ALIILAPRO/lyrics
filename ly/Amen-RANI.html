		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever felt like giving up
Because you tried and tried 
But for the 100th time the stars just won’t align
Have you ever had a broken heart
That even time won’t heal
Because you’d rather feel the pain than say goodbye

I know I have
Drowned in holy water
Had my spirit shaken
If you ever felt like this
CHORUS
Can I get a AMEN
AMEN 
Can I get a AMEN
AMEN 
But we won’t be knocked down forever 
We will RISE back up again
So can I get a AMEN
AMEN

Have you ever found you lost your
Sailing a see of tears
Caught in a storm of fears that rages through the night
And do you ever wish that time could stop
So you can finally breathe
And find a little piece your life has been denied

I know I have
Drowned in holy water
Had my spirit shaken
If you ever felt like this

Can I get a AMEN
AMEN 
Can I get a AMEN
AMEN 
But we won’t be knocked down forever 
We will RISE back up again
So can I get a AMEN
AMEN 

Know we’re gonna rise up
Know we gonna stand tall
Anytime our backs up against the wall 
No ones gonna break us
They don’t know what we’re made of 
Know we got the strength to get through it all 

Can I get a AMEN
AMEN 
Can I get a AMEN
AMEN 
But we won’t be knocked down forever 
We will RISE back up again
So can I get a AMEN
AMEN
Can I get a AMEN
AMEN
