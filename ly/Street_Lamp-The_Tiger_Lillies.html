		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Underneath the unlet street lamp
He is sleeping
Without a penny in his pocket
I wonder what he is dreaming
Stranger wherever he goes
Whatever door he knocks on
He's got no momma to go to
Not even to wash his clothes
His home is an unlet street lamp
And for light he has the moon
You who passing by
You who passing by
Do not disturb his dreams
His home is an unlet street lamp
That is his home
Under which he dreams
Under which he dreams
Cold and alone
His home is an unlet street lamp
That is his home
Under which he dreams
Under which he dreams
Cold and alone
