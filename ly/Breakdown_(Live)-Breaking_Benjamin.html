		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breakdown!

Let the fun and games begin
She is spayed and broken in
Skin is cold and white
Such a lovely lonely night

Heaven is on the way
You could feel the hate
But I guess you never will
I'm on a roll again
And I want an end
'Cause I feel you creeping in

What I found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound, you're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown

Drank up all my alcohol
This is not a free for all
I'll be there for you
'Til my heart is black and blue

Heaven is on the way
You could feel the hate
But I guess you never will
I'm on a roll again
And I want an end
'Cause I feel you creeping in

What I found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound, you're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown

What I found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound, you're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown

You breakdown, you're so proud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
What's that sound, it's so loud.
I'm heading for a breakdown.
No!
