		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a space in my heart
When it all comes crashing down
Any time I hear your name out in public
There's a place that I go
Every time that you're in town
It's just me and the knots in my stomach

And it's true, it wasn't easy
Getting over you
But that's just what I had to do

Whatever, whatever
We were never good together
I'll be here and you stay there
Truth is, I never cared
Whatever, whatever
Two years, that ain't forever
I'll be here and you stay there
Won't see me cry no tears

(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears

Never mind, never mind
Feels like you were never mine
Go lose myself in the arms of a stranger
And, yeah, it sucks, sometimes in love
You try your best, but it doesn't work out
And it don't matter either way, oh yeah

Whatever, whatever
We were never good together
I'll be here and you stay there
Truth is, I never cared
Whatever, whatever
Two years, that ain't forever (oh yeah)
I'll be here and you stay there
Won't see me cry no tears

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (won't see me cry no tears)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whatever, whatever)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (won't see me cry no tears)
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears

Whatever, whatever
We were never good together
I'll be here and you stay there
Truth is, I never cared
Whatever, whatever
Two years, that ain't forever
I'll be here and you stay there
Won't see me cry no tears
