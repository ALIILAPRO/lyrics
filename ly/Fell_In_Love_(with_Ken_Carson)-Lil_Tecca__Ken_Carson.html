		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wanna know who I am, she don't give a fuck who I was
I know that she was a fan, for real, that's why I'm fuckin' with her
I know you ain't havin' bands for real, and you know my pockets stuffed
I don't remember her name for real, but I know that she fell in love
DMT, ecstasy, yeah, I'm off them drugs
Yeah, I'm rockin' Givenchy, paid two bands for these, yeah
And I ain't talkin' coffee, but I walk 'round with a mug
Three shots get that nigga off me, bet you won't survive these slugs

I think I'm too young to fall in love
I think she too sprung, I been stopped callin' her
Yeah, uh, I think she too spoiled, she get what she want, yeah
I just blocked her number, she said, "What you on?"

She said, "You trippin', you movin' Holly"
I said, "You trippin', see you on molly"
Gas, ridin' around in big bodies
Oh, that's your ho'? Link her, I said, "Copy"
I got these bands, now she can't get off me
It been a lot of niggas tryna cross me
No, it ain't shit to cut a nigga off
A blessing or lesson, nigga, what you taught?

You ain't heard what I heard, you ain't saw what I saw
I walk through TSA with contraband, I'm breakin' the law
I go shopping and I spend a couple bands, that's how I get off
Saw shawty, she was with another man, so I cut her off
I'm titanium, these niggas soft
And I control these hoes like a crane, oh yeah, I'm way too raw
I had to stop talkin' to my Armenian, 'cause she way too far
I was fuckin' with her twin, but she stopped fuckin' with me 'cause I couldn't tell them apart

I was fuckin' on both of them hoes, that's on God
The Maybach, it came with the Rolls, the Rolls came with the stars
The Patek, it came in rose gold, yeah, I'm livin' large
I got Balenciaga boots on like I'm ready to march
I put cologne all over my clothes like a star
I'm still fuckin' on my ex bitch, she say I stole her heart
You might not understand it but it's beautiful, my love art
I got under her panties, I'm under her leotard
I pour lean up, I pour fours when I'm parched
See me, I'm all bite, all these niggas do is bark
I put the codeine on the ice, yeah, before my night starts
She ain't gonna pull up tonight, unless you got the right car

She wanna know who I am, she don't give a fuck who I was
I know that she was a fan, for real, that's why I'm fuckin' with her
I know you ain't havin' bands for real, and you know my pockets stuffed
I don't remember her name for real, but I know that she fell in love
DMT, ecstasy, yeah, I'm off them drugs
Yeah, I'm rockin' Givenchy, paid two bands for these, yeah
And I ain't talkin' coffee, but I walk 'round with a mug
Three shots get that nigga off me, bet you won't survive these slugs

I think I'm too young to fall in love
I think she too sprung, I been stopped callin' her
Yeah, uh, I think she too spoiled, she get what she want, yeah
I just blocked her number, she said, "What you on?"
