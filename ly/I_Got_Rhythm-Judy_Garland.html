		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days can be sunny, with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their day full of song
Why shouldn't we sing along?

I'm chipper all the day, happy with my lot
How do I get that way? Look at what I've got

I got rhythm, I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies, in green pastures
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?

Old man trouble
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more ?

Old man trouble
I don't mind him
You won't find him, 'round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more ?

I got rhythm, I got music
I got daisies, in green pastures
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more ?
