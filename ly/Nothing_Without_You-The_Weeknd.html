		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I realized, I belong to you
I feel the darkness, went away from you

Hey, don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') hey

I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')

Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it? Woah-woah

Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') oh
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')

I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')

When I feel the love, girl I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch, touch
Touch (I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you)
