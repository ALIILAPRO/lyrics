		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She comes from silver spoon, golden rule
Private school, never miss Sunday church
And I come from blue-collar, low-dollar
Out here where concrete meets old red dirt
And I don't know what happened
But it sure don't add up on paper
But when I close my eyes late at night
You can bet I thank my maker

She keeps on lovin' me, loves me the way I am
She's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan
Lord, it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night
She keeps on lovin' me and I keep on wondering why

She's got a wicked smile, angel eyes
Every guy wantin' to hold her close
She's as pretty as sin
Like the sun sinkin' down on the California coast

She keeps on lovin' me, loves me the way I am
She's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan
Lord, it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night
She keeps on lovin' me and I keep on wondering why

I don't know what happened
But it sure don't add up on paper
And as long as she lets me
I'll take her wherever she wants me to take her, oh

She keeps on lovin' me, loves me the way I am
She's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan
And it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night
She keeps on lovin' me and I keep on wondering why
She keeps on lovin' me and I keep on wondering why
