		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to be friends with Ana
Walk down the hall like Ana
She looks so pretty in that skirt
I want to be friends with her

But she knows that I can't
She whispers in my ear and then she says
That she knows what I hate about myself

Yellow teeth
Scalp is weak
Swollen blisters on my knees

She knows that I can't
She whispers in my ear and then she says
That she knows what I hate about myself
