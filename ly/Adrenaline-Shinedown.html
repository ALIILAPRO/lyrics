		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me the wheel
So we can move a little faster
I make it real
I'm not a glorious disaster
What part of living says you gotta die?
I plan on burning through another nine lives
One more for measure, that's ten for the soul
That never sleeps, so are you ready to go?

Bloodshot against the clear blue sky
Tick tock, I think the well is running dry
My, my, I can't lie
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head
Bang, bang 'cause the needle's in the red
My, my, I can't lie
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
My, my, my sweet adrenaline

Crack in the vision
Who said the motivation's all wrong?
Not your decision
The detonation of a time bomb
Which way is up
When your high is low?
It's time to find it
Are you ready to go?

Bloodshot against the clear blue sky
Tick tock, I think the well is running dry
My, my, I can't lie
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head
Bang, bang 'cause the needle's in the red
My, my, I can't lie
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
My, my, my sweet adrenaline

My, my, I just can't lie
It's the speed and the sound that I'm dying to try
My, my, I just can't lie
It's the love of the chase that created the ride

Bloodshot against the clear blue sky
Tick tock, I think the well is running dry
My, my, I can't lie
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head
Bang, bang 'cause the needle's in the red
My, my, I can't lie
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
My, my, my sweet adrenaline
My, my, (my, my) I can't lie (can't lie)
I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline
My, my, (my, my) my sweet adrenaline
