		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run, run
Run, run

Run, you'd better find somewhere to run
You've made a fool of everybody
But you're not fooling anyone

Hide, you always need someplace to hide
But you can't hide from what's inside yourself
You just can't face it

Run, run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
From loneliness inside

You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
Before it gets too late

Run, you're gonna run like out of time
You let the suffering behind now
And all the years have passed you by

Lies, I used to listen to you
Lies, but now I've learned to read between the lines
I've got your number

Run, run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
From loneliness inside

You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
Before it gets too late

Run, run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
From loneliness inside

You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
What's eating you inside

You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
Yeah

Run for cover
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Yeah
