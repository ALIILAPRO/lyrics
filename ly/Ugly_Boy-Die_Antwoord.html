		<p>
		  Ooh, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me

Yo

Ooh, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me (uh)
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me

Ayy

You and me make the whole world jealous
God knows I know my homegirl's precious (ya)
Life is crazy I know god lets us
Chill the fuck out, I got this you

Got nothing to worry about, trust me
You trust your Ninji cause he don't play
Everything's going to be okay
I can make your problems go away

And I ain't scared of shit
Whatever the fuck it is, I take care of it
If you're strapped for cash
Heading straight for a crash
I can make cash rain on your ass

Anything you want (you got it)
Anything you need (you got it)
Anything at all (you got it)
Just keep it real with me (you got it)

Ooh, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me

Ugh

Yes, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me (yeah)
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy (yeah)
Just crazy about me

You fucking mental, my crazy little girl
Maybe the most psycho chick in the world
You mystical shit's not just physical
What you and me got's unfuckwithable

Respect me, receive my protection
I'm always right by your side like a weapon
Love me, I grant you there will be love
Fuck with my girl, there will be blood

All my bitches love me, aw man it's tough
But one crazy girl's more than enough (yeah)
This ain't no ordinary love
This thing you and me got girl
I believe it's magic (magic)
I believe it's magic (magic)
I believe it's magic (magic)
Magic (magic)

Ooh, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me

Yeah

Ooh, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me

Ugly on the skin
But you're lovely from within
An angel kiss from me to you
Always there for me when I'm feeling blue

You say you'll stick with me and I know you well
I just get so emotional
When I'm down and feeling weak
With tears streaming down my cheeks (shame)

You say the sweetest things
Like material stuff don't mean a thing
But you take care of me to keep you safe
You so freaky, babe

Yo

Anything you want (you got it)
Anything you need (you got it)
Anything at all (you got it)
Just keep it real with me (you got it)

Ooh, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me (hey)

Yes, I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough
Don't care about anything but me
And I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me

Nigga, nigga

Ooh, I love my ugly boy
Me love you long time
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
He one crazy motherfucker (why?)

I love my ugly boy
So rough and tough (ah)
He fuck you up boy
Yes, I just love him 'cause he's so crazy
Just crazy about me

I love him
