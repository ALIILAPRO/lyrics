		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late nights in a wild town
We go out, roaming around
Holding your hair in my hand
Friday nights felt like they'd never end
You were Miss Hollywood
I was your chic chauffeur
Take you where you want to go
Get you there, nice and slow
You look up at me from your back seat
With that same old grin

And I said wait just a little while
And tell me where you've been
I've been staying up at night
Thinking about it
And it's been, oh so long
That I've been feeling like this
And I know that I've never been more sure, hoo

We went to the cinema
And you wore your shades inside
I couldn't stop laughing, when you put on mine
And knocked that drink from your hand onto the floor
And then ran to 'Theater 8', and you hid behind the door
You look up at me from your back seat
With that same old grin

And I said wait just a little while
And tell me where you've been
I've been staying up at night
Thinking about it
And it's been, oh, so long
That I've been feeling like this
And I know that I've never been more sure

Tell me what you want, what you really want
Tell me what you need, what you want to believe
I've got the soul, and you've got to know
That together we have everything
My time was dim
My love was gone, my life was thin
Then you walked in

And I said wait just a little while
And tell me where you've been
I've been staying up at night
Thinking about it
And it's been, oh, so long
That I've been feeling like this
And I know that I've never been more sure
