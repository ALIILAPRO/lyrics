		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something 'bout the look on your face
Has you feelin' a way, baby, I feel it too
You don't gotta tell me about it
We could dance around it, we could rendezvous
Maybe it's the weather, maybe it's the season
We should get up out of this room (this room)
I'm overprotective, baby, we're connected
Gotta get you out of this mood

Why don't we, drive a little (drive a little)
Ride a little (ride a little)
Find a place with a view (ooh)
We could, smoke a little (smoke a little)
Float a little
Vibin' under the moon
Why don't we?

When you're this alone
I'll be at the end, I'll follow you

Why don't we, mix a little
Kiss a little
Take a moment or two (ooh)
Just to love a little (love a little)
Pour a triple
We got nothin' to lose
Why don't we?

(Why don't we?)

I'm alone with you
That's all that it take
I'm home with you
No matter the place
I've grown with you
Yet our love stays the same
Alone with you
(Why don't we, why don't we?)
Why don't we?

Look at you and I see versions of me that I need
Places that I never seen, take my hand, relief
Alone with you
Alone with you
Alone with, alone with, alone with you
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Alone with you
Alone with you
Alone with, alone with
