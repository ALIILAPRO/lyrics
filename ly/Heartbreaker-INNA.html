		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes on the window while you go
It breaks my heart and
Everything's cold and running slow
In silence and
You're lookin' back and I don't know
If I can take it
I wanna go back one year ago

You hurt me like nobody, messed up my soul
You, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You killed me slow
You hurt me like nobody, messed up my soul
You, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You killed me slow

(You hurt me like nobody)

Back to my room, I see the nights
When we were one, but
All that we had was lost in fights
And those lies
Carried for you deep down inside
But I'll drink my sorrow
Playing my favorite lullaby

You hurt me like nobody, messed up my soul
You, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You killed me slow
You hurt me like nobody, messed up my soul
You, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You killed me slow

(You hurt me like nobody)

You know, I know you know
I was a victim of the game you played
Nothing left to say
And I'm done, now I'm done
'Cause I don't recognize myself no more
What I've become

You hurt me like nobody, messed up my soul
You, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You killed me slow
You hurt me like nobody, messed up my soul
You, heartbreaker, heartbreaker
You killed me slow

(You hurt me like nobody)
