		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby baby when you make your escape
Make sure that you do it at
The right time of day
In the middle of the night a moment of grace
As she hit's every green light
From here to LA

Your friends blew your cover
As sluts turn to mothers
And the legendary lovers
Get sick of one another
As dreams turn to daydreams
And punks learn to behave
Don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I’ll never change i'll never change

How many platitudes can you say
In the time that it takes for beauty to fade
Sedentary fireworks going bad
Like pouring out a bottle of
Gin on a drowning man

Shiny new fighter jets getting
Strafed on the deck
For every insolent B-boy who tripped
And landed on his neck
Untameable stallions that got
Turned into glue
But don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I worry about you yes I do
