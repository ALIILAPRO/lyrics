		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, ooh wee oh, oh
When I'm lookin' at you
I keep thinkin'
Why can't she be like you?
So I'm schemin'
I can't go on like this
Believin' that her love is true, oh
Standing on the dance floor
While she trickin'
You are all I want girl
She's a chicken
We might be together
But love is missing
Girl I want you
So what can we do, oh

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl, but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Now she's lookin' at me
But keep talkin'
Oh, now she tryna ice you
Let's start walkin'
Over on the dance floor
It's her fault but
What can she do?
Tell me baby, yeah

Girl if you're ready (I'm ready)
We can get it on (We can get it on)
I know where I went wrong
(She's where you went wrong)
With you is where I belong, belong

Girl if I could find the words to say
I gotta get away from a love
That kills me everyday
I'd gladly say to you

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl, but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl, but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl, but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight
