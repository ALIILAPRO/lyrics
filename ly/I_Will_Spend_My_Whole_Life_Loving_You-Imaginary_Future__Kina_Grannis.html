		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  August afternoon
I can picture you
Walking with your father at your side
In the summer heat
California speaks
Softly like she's making up her mind

And now, as I stand beside you, I say

Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die?
Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars
'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you

Through your shining eyes
Sweet like Jeffrey Pines
I pretended I could read your thoughts
Now it's just the truth
Seems our hearts have fused
Soldered like the gold your sister brought

And how am I lucky enough to say

Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die?
Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars
'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you
Loving you, loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you

And I said 

Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die?
Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars
'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you
