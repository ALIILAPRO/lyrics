		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Runnin' away from you takes time and pain, and I don't even want to
So I'm gettin' high all week without you
Popping pills, thinking about you (thinking about you)
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So I'm gettin' high all week without you
Popping pills, thinking about you

I wish I didn't have a heart to love you (I wish I didn't have a heart to love you)
I wish I didn't play a part to break you (I wish I didn't play a part to break you)
I wish I didn't do a lot of the shit I do (the shit I do)
And I wish you didn't too

Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So I'm gettin' high all week without you
Popping pills, thinking about you

I wish I didn't have a heart to love you (I wish I didn't have a heart to love you)
I wish I didn't play a part to break you (I wish I didn't play a part to break you)
I wish I didn't do a lot of the shit I do (the shit I do)
And I wish you didn't too
Tell me that you hate me

Sometimes life gets fucked up (fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (we get fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up (fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs

That we used to do
I was used to you (I was used to you)
"What have you been through?"
She asked me
Every fun kind of abuse
If you love me too
You would give me you (you would give me you)
Hide me in your room
Don't tell me the truth
Everything you said (everything you said)
Stares inside my head (stares inside my head)
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled

Sometimes life gets fucked up (fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (we get fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up (fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
