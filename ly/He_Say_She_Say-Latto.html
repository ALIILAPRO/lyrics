		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't do the he say, she say
Ayy, ayy
He say, she say

I love me a country ass nigga with some gold teeth (oh)
Fuck all of that talking, just show me (yeah)
I don't even know nothin' 'bout no basketball
But on the 'Gram flexed up, with the floor seats (on God)
Y'all new to this, I'm the young OG (on God)
Ain't a soul on this Earth that owe me (what?)
It's that rich bitch shit
I just put my daddy in a bust down Rollie
I got a mil' in the bank (uh-huh)
I put that on Jesus (I do)
He want me send him the nudes (what?)
But I don't do teasers (haha)
Nah, you ain't foolin' me, shawty be poppin' that pussy for features (freaky)
It ain't a Chanel bag big enough for me to stay with a cheater (fuck)
(When you got your own)

I don't do the he say, she say (uh-huh)
Speakin' on me, bitch be safe (be safe)
Big cake like it's my B-day (ayy)
Runnin' up a bag like relay
I ain't been asleep in like three days
Bitch, it's my way or the freeway (skrr)
I ain't never met a nigga can't replace
Give a damn what he think, she think

Don't let this pretty shit fool you
I really'll do you
I'm rich as fuck but I still love me a booster
Yeah, I got the bag and went straight to the jeweler
I paid for my sister tuition and tutor
Choppa got titties like he work at Hooters
Cross a bitch like a motherfuckin' blooper
They heard I fuck with a rapper or hooper
Believe what you want, I ain't clearin' no rumors
I'm too young to be this rich (rich)
We can shoot it out or just beat a bitch (woo, woo)
They say I'm gettin' thick, "What you eatin' sis'?" (Thick)
I been on my bully like a mean bitch (ayy)
These bitches fraud, they cap a lot (cap a lot)
Reach for this chain, I'ma slap you out
First person throw some shit at me on stage
We beatin' they ass in the parkin' lot (woo, woo, woo)
I smell like money and Baccarat (ooh)
Fendi space boots, like an astronaut (ooh)
I swear if I said it, I meant it, I handlin' business
Ain't rappin' on shit that I'm not about
Don't ask 'bout a nigga I forgot about
Boss bitches only, you is not allowed, cut it out
Self-made bitch, hell you talking 'bout?
Yeah I got it out the mud, no handout (bitch)

I don't do the he say, she say (ayy)
Speakin' on me, bitch be safe (ayy)
Big cake like it's my B-day (big cake)
Runnin' up a bag like relay (runnin' up, runnin' up)
I ain't been asleep in like three days (Three days)
Bitch, it's my way or the freeway (skrr)
I ain't never met a nigga can't replace (ayy)
Give a damn what he think, she think (ayy)
I don't do the he say, she say (yeah)

Speakin' on me, bitch be safe (ayy)
Big cake like it's my B-day (big cake, ayy)
Runnin' up a bag like relay (runnin' up, runnin' up)
I ain't been asleep in like three days (three days)
Bitch, it's my way or the freeway (skrr)
I ain't never met a nigga can't replace (ayy)
Give a damn what he think, she think (ayy, ayy)

He say, she say
He say, she say
