		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
And how much can I be expected to tolerate? (uh)
So I started to think 'bout the plans I made
The debt unpaid
And you just can't call
A spade, a spade

I watch the moon
Let it run my mood
Can't stop thinking of you
I watch you (now I let it go)
(And I watch as things play out like)
So long, nice to know you I'll be
Moving on

We started off in such a nice place
We were talking the same language
I open and I'm closing
You can't stand the thought
Of a real beating heart
You'd be holding, having trouble
Oh-oh
Own it and admit that
I am hoping

I watch the moon
Let it run my mood
Can't stop thinking of you
I watch you (now I let it go)
(And I watch as things play out like)
So long, nice to know you I'll be
Moving on
Moving on

You
Yeah, I always know the truth
But I can't just say it to you
Yeah, I know the truth
I knew
Yeah, I always know the truth
But I can't just say it to you
Yeah, I know the truth

I never thought we'd see it through
I never could rely on you
And few times your face came
Into view
Into view
I'm not into you
Into you
