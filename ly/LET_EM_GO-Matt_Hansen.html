		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at the ceiling, tryna fight the feeling
Deep inside your heart, you know it isn't what it was
Anxiety is growing like fog over the ocean
Hoping we shouldn't pray and that it's gone when you get up

You could try to wrestle with the mirror
But the truth, it can't be any clearer than that
You've been fighting it off just like a fever
But there's no use holding it back

Sometimes you need the rain
To know you miss the sun
Sometimes you need the pain
To know it isn't love
Sometimes the one you hold
You gotta let 'em go, you gotta let 'em go

You gotta let 'em go
Go

This isn't what you wanted, knots inside your stomach
Do you have to hurt 'em, so you don't hurt anymore?

You could try to wrestle with the mirror
But the truth, it can't be any clearer than that
You've been fighting it off just like a fever
But there's no use holding it back

Sometimes you need the rain
To know you miss the sun
Sometimes you need the pain
To know it isn't love
Sometimes the one you hold
You gotta let 'em go, you gotta let 'em go

You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go

Ohh
When what hurts and what's right are the same
When it kills you to leave or to stay
When there's nothing to fix and nothing left to save, hmm

You gotta let 'em go, hm-mm
You gotta let 'em go, hm-mm
You gotta let 'em go, hm-mm
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go

You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go

(Ohh) oh
(Ohh) ohh
