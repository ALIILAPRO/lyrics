		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  RedOne, Konvict
GaGa, oh, eh

I've had a little bit too much, much (oh, oh, oh)
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone (oh, oh, oh)

What's goin' on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore (woo!)
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance, gonna be okay, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, spin that record, babe, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, gonna be okay, d-d-d-dance
Dance, dance, just, j-j-just dance

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (oh, oh, oh)
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (Inside out, right)
Control your poison, babe, roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight (oh, oh, oh)

What's goin' on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright (woo!)

Just dance, gonna be okay, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, spin that record, babe, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, gonna be okay, d-d-d-dance
Dance, dance, just, j-j-just

When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalog (hey)
Can't believe my eyes, so many women without a flaw (hey)
And I ain't gon' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like a call (hey)
I'ma hit it, I'ma beat it and flex and do it until tomorr' yeah

Shawty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you're twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And now there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay and let me watch you break it down

And dance, gonna be okay (oh) da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance (ooh yeah), spin that record babe, da da doo-doo-mmm

Just dance (ooh yeah), gonna be okay, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance (ooh yeah), spin that record babe, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance (oh), gonna be okay, d-d-d-dance (gonna be okay)
Dance, dance (yeah)
Just, j-j-just dance (oh)

(Incredible)
(Amazing)
(Music)
Woo! let's go!

Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint electronic

Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic
Got my blueprint electronic

Go!
Use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
I got it, just stay close enough to get it on
Don't slow!
Drive it, clean it, lights out, bleed it, spend the lasto
I got it
In your pocko
I got it

Just dance, gonna be okay, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, spin that record babe, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance (baby), gonna be okay, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, spin that record babe, da da doo-doo-mmm (baby, yeah)
Just dance, gonna be okay, d-d-d-dance (spin that record, baby, yeah)
Dance, dance, just, j-j-just dance
