		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sittin' here, eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight

(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Got to have love tonight

(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
Hot love
Lookin' for hot love

(Hot hot hot hot stuff)
(Hot hot hot)
(Hot hot hot hot stuff)
(Hot hot hot)

How's 'bout some hot stuff, baby this evenin'?
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
Gimme little hot stuff baby this evenin'
Hot stuff baby
Gonna need your love tonight

(Hot stuff)
I need hot love
Lookin' for hot love
Wanna have hot love

Sittin' here eating my heart out no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers lately
I'm bound to find somebody home

Gonna have some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby tonight
Looking for my hot stuff, baby this evenin'
Need some loving baby
Gonna need your love tonight

Hot stuff baby this evening
I need some hot stuff baby tonight, yeah yeah
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I want some hot stuff baby tonight, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Now, hot stuff, baby
I need your hot stuff baby tonight
I want your hot stuff baby this evenin'
Hot stuff baby
Gonna need your love tonight
