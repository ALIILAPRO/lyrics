		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go
Off the rails
Don't you know it's time to raise our sails?
It's freedom like you never knew
Don't need bags or a pass
Say the word, I'll be there in a flash
You could say my hat is off to you

Oh we can zoom all the way to the moon
From this great wide wacky world
Jump with me
Grab coins with me
Oh yeah!

It's time to jump up in the air
Jump up, don't be scared
Jump up and your cares will soar away
And if the dark clouds start to swirl
Don't fear, don't shed a tear 'cause
I'll be your 1-UP girl
So let's all jump up super high!
High up in the sky!
There's no power-up like dancing
You know that you're my Super Star
No one else can take me this far
I'm flipping the Switch
Get ready for this
Oh, let's do the Odyssey
Odyssey Yes, see! 
Odyssey, Odyssey!

Spin the wheel
Take a chance
Every journey starts a new romance
A new world's calling out to you
Take a turn
Off the path
Find a new addition to the cast
You know that any captain needs a crew

Take it in stride as you move, side to side
They're just different points of view
Jump with me
Grab coins with me
Oh yeah!

Come on and jump up in the air
Jump without a care
Jump up 'cause you know that I'll be there
And if you find you're short on joy
Don't fret, just don't forget that
You're still our 1-UP boy
So go on, straighten up your cap
Let your toes begin to tap
This rhythm is a power 'shroom
Don't forget you're the super star
No one else could make it this far
Put a comb through that 'stache
Now you've got panache
Oh, let's do the Odyssey!

It's time to jump up in the air
Jump up, don't be scared
Jump up and your cares will soar away
And if the dark clouds start to swirl
Don't fear, don't shed a tear 'cause
I'll be your 1-UP girl
Now listen, all you boys and girls
All around the world
Don't be afraid to get up and move
You know that we're all superstars
We're the ones who made it this far
Put a smile on that face
There's no time to waste, so
Let's do the Odyssey!
