		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think think of how it be if we would link (link up) 
Got Some kinda connection that I desire 
As you look back 
There some tension that we need to explore 
Before you go home 
Tell me what you want 
You're so beautiful 
Girl Here's where you belong 
Here with me 
Shorty I just wanna hear one thing from ya 
Say that you like me 
Get a chance to know me to is to love me baby 
Say that you like my attention on you baby drives you crazy 

Say that you like me (x2)

Say that u like, you say the right words even we could have forever 

Girl you know w grown 
we don't play by rules 
so I'mma take the risk and get you out this room 

Don't like the sex on the first night 
I ain lookin for no one night on u you
Matter of fact I'm thinking life time, baby you the right sign. 
Girl do you believe in love at first sight 

Before you go home 
Tell me what you want 
You're so beautiful 
Girl Here's where you belong 
Here with me 
Shorty I just wanna hear one thing from ya 
Say that you like me 
Get a chance to know me to is to love me baby 
Say that you like my attention on you baby drives you crazy (I pay attention )
Say that you like me (x2)

Say that u like, you say the right words we could have forever
