		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna burn in the fire below
I wanna dance with the devil you know
Take me to heaven and don't let me go
I am the king of a tragedy (ooh)

Waking up to hear the siren
You're the poison in my blood
I could do without the violence
God knows I'm not that tough
I keep loosing all my virtues
I'm a magnet to your pain
Walking up to hear the siren (siren)

I wanna burn in the fire below
I wanna dance with the devil you know
Take me to heaven and don't let me go
I am be the king of a tragedy, king of a tragedy

I wanna surrender and sacrifice
The fear that I feel when I look in your eyes
Please take me to heaven before I die
I am the king of a tragedy, king of a tragedy

Every word you say is fragile
It's like a walk on broken glass
I'm like a deer, so scared of your headlights
You got your right foot hard on the gas
Can we stay right here forever?
You make it hard to run away
Every word you say is fragile

I wanna burn in the fire below
I wanna dance with the devil you know
Take me to heaven and don't let me go
I am the king of a tragedy, king of a tragedy

I wanna surrender and sacrifice
The fear that I feel when I look in your eyes
Please take me to heaven before I die
I am the king of a tragedy, king of a tragedy

Ooh, I wanna see what it feels like
To run into your headlights
Ooh, you know me I'm craving the spotlight

I wanna burn in the fire below
I wanna dance with the devil you know
Take me to heaven and don't let me go
I'll be the king of a tragedy

I wanna burn in the fire below
I wanna dance with the devil you know
Take me to heaven and don't let me go
I am the king of a tragedy, king of a tragedy

I wanna surrender and sacrifice
The fear that I feel when I look in your eyes
Please take me to heaven before I die
I am the king of a tragedy, king of a tragedy
