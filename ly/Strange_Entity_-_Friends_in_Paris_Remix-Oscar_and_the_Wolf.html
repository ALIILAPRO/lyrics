		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So take good care of me
I follow all you need
And I'll take good care of you
But you're heartless, you're heartless
You turn it into your own
So tie me back to my bones
Collect your love and mend my heart
But you're fearless, you're fearless

But I'll take care of your mind
I lost you, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So don't you deny it
I lost you, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So come back
Ooh, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So come back, come back

So take good care of me
I follow all you need
And I'll take good care of you
But you're heartless, you're heartless
So rest your head and fear my eyes
For they won't come inside
Cry me rivers, spin me round
But you're harmless, you're harmless

But I'll take care of your mind
I lost you, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So don't you deny it
I lost you, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So come back
Ooh, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So come back, come back

I see transfixions of
I see transfixions of

But I'll take care of your mind
I lost you, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So don't you deny it
I lost you, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So come back
Ooh, I miss you, I wanna hold you
So come back, come back

So all I know, guess it's you and I
So all I know, guess it's you and I
So all I know, guess it's you and I
