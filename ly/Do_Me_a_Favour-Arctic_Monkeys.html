		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, the morning was complete
Where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

It's the beginning of the end 
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you
That it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart
Hold on to your heart

And do me a favor and break my nose
Or do me a favor and tell me to go away
Or do me a favor and stop asking questions

Well, she walked away while her shoes were untied 
When the eyes were all red
You could see that we'd cried 
And I watched, and I waited 'til she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye

Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

And do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
She said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
