		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a one-way ticket
I got a master plan
A letter in my pocket
Baby, some roses in my hand

I got a reputation
That I'm gonna kill
Ain't got a lot of money or sense, my love
But I got a lot of will

And I heard last night
From some mutual friends
You're laid up and too broke
To go through this again

And I know they're right
But this is now and that was then
I love you too much
To lose you again

Feel these little shivers
C-coming down my spine
And every word delivered
Sends these little rivers coming out my eyes

I got a reputation
But it's gonna get better
Sometimes you gotta tear apart
Two broken hearts to put 'em back together

And I heard last night
From some mutual friends
You're laid up and too broke
To go through this again

And I know they're right
But this is now and that was then
I love you too much
To lose you again

And I know that you're probably hurting
It's written on your face
You don't see the way I've been working
I guess I'll have to wait

Tonight, come back tomorrow
Try again
Your heart might be broken
But soon it will mend

So don't you cry
'Cause we're so far from the end
I love you too much
To lose you again
