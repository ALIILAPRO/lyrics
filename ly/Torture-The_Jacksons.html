		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watching
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walking
Told me I should not have come there

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts of fire
I am here to serve all masters

She said reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
And merciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

And I still can't find the meaning, no no no
Of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming?

Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel, strike a flame in me

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

(When you call my name)
It's torture
(It's heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

(When you call my name)
It's torture
(Heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey
