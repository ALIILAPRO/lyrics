		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up strange today
I felt good, I felt fine, I felt fake
Then I cried, I called your name
My person, gone away now I'm

I'm so sad, I'm upset, I hate God
I hate man that I found out like I did
(Yeah, so) i'll try hard, I'll try
Less, I'll breathe in, Get obsessed
And I'll give out what I can
But I won't cry, not again
No, I won't cry, not again

Bitch, I might (woah)
Lie here for a day, push my friends away
It's no shit, I'm shit at goodbye
Kind of liked it when we tried
I liked it more when I felt fine
When I felt fine when I felt fine
When I felt fine

"Free Earl" and paper planes
We grew up simple, safe
Built a world around your name
It felt good, it felt fine, it felt great
But now it's

It's all gone, there's none left
Your dick friends could care less
So go play dead and start again
Cuz you're so North Face
Upstate, all honest, And all paid
And I don't try, I never did

But I don't feel like a kid
No, it don't feel like it did

Bitch, I might
Lie here for a day, push my friends away
It's no sh i'm shit at goodbye
Kind of liked it when we tried
I liked it more when I felt fine
When I felt fine when I felt fine
When I felt fine
