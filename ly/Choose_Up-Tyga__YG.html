		<p>
		  (Goddamnit, Dupri)
Yeah
Believe in, in, in more than love, you, you, you
Yeah, well, well, well

I make a nigga' bitch choose (yes)
I take her shoppin', new shoes (well)
I put her in them Christian Loubs (yes, Loubs)
I get it wet, she don't need no lube (no lube)
I'm a gangster, so I tell her straight, like this
"Baby, you don't need makeup" (oh, well)
I'm a gangster, so I hit it from the back
Pullin' on her hair, got her face up
Yeah, she know I'm him, Himothy
She know I fucked her friend, she still feelin' me (I wanna believe, 'lieve)
Yeah, she still feelin' me (she still feelin', more than lo-love)
But now her and her friend enemies
The nigga she lovin' is a dub (is a dub)
She got a man, but look single in the club (in the club)
She sendin' me nakeds, layin' in a tub (in a tub)
She wanna get fucked by a fly ass Blood (well)

Y'all niggas be actin' too tough (yeah)
I come through designer, Cuban bust (bust)
Make a nigga' bitch choose up (yeah)
Do what? Make a nigga' bitch choose up (up)
Black Cadillac with the driver, I'm too drunk (well)
Tellin' her fly shit, feelin' on that monk' (that monk')
Make a nigga' bitch choose up (yeah)
Do what? Make a nigga' bitch choose up

Uh, how I make her choose up, put the deuce up (deuce)
Got the pussy warmed up and I'm suited up (well)
Slowed down in my cup and I'm screwed up (yeah)
Come try your new luck, don't screw it up
Pull up to your avenue, Maybach truck ('Bach truck)
I prefer you in the bed, no makeup (well)
Wait for me, I'll be late on my way up
Goin' hundred in the Porsche, I'ma speed it up (ching)
She know we take flight to Puerto Rico (ha)
Dance in the tropic, play funk in Rio (I wanna believe, 'lieve)
She get wet, juicy Tampico (more than lo-love)
All in a week, that's a stroke for your ego (ha)
Yeah, that's why she choosin' me
My presence present, try impressin' me (yeah)
She was geekin', freakin' me and me
She's my beauty freak of the week (well)

Y'all niggas be actin' too tough (yeah)
I come through designer, Cuban bust (bust)
Make a nigga' bitch choose up (yeah)
Do what? Make a nigga' bitch choose up (choose up)
Black Cadillac with the driver, I'm too drunk (well)
Tellin' her fly shit, feelin' on that monk' (that monk')
Make a nigga' bitch choose up (yeah)
Do what? Make a nigga' bitch choose up

Believe in, in, in more than love, you, you, you
Believe in, in, in more than love
