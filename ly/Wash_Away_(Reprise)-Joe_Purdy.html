		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got troubles Lord, but, not today
Cause they gonna wash away,
They're gonna wash away.

And I have sins Lord, but not today
Cause they gonna wash away,
They're gonna wash away.

And I have friends Lord, but not today
Cause they done washed away,
They done washed away.

Oh, I've been cryin'
And oh, I've been cryin'
And oh, no more cryin'
And oh, no more cryin' here.

We get along love but, not today
Cause we gonna wash away,
We gonna wash away.

And I got troubles Lord, but not today
Cause they gonna wash away,
This old river gonna take me away.
