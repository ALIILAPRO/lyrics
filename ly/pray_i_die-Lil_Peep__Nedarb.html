		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I'm smokin' marijuana, ayy
Smokin' marijuana, ayy
Nah, I don't wanna, I'm a stoner
And I get my weed
Straight from California, ayy
Now I got my money
And she wanna call me broke, ayy

Oh, I loved you, I did
But, it's time to forgive and forget
Plus, I got thirty bitches want me to fuck
I'm all up in her ribs
But it's time I admit my regrets
I did you dirty, did you dirty as fuck
Come and fuck with me, kid
I ain't tryin' to live, pray I die
But I keep comin' right up out of the mud
What you call a sin
I call a part of my day
Get the fuck out my way
Say she gon' fuck, but she gay

You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face
You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face
You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face
You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face

Oh, I loved you, I did
But, it's time to forgive and forget
Plus, I got thirty bitches want me to fuck
I'm all up in her ribs
But it's time I admit my regrets
I did you dirty, did you dirty as fuck
Come and fuck with me, kid
I ain't tryin' to live, pray I die
But I keep comin' right up out of the mud
What you call a sin
I call a part of my day
Get the fuck out my way
Say she gon' fuck, but she gay

You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face
You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face
You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face
You got lucky today, you have nothin' to say
Won't say shit to my face, can't say shit to my face
