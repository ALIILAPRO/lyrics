		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul
I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you
Who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through
Each and everyday
When I'm alone with you
You make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say

Hey baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need (you need)
I know it hasn't been your day, your week, your week, your week
So put it all on me (woo)
Oh my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge me 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me

All on me, on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
All on me, on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me

Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you
That can be takin' away
The shit that I go through
Each and everyday
Baby, I can't wait
In love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

Hey baby, we can dance slowly (hey)
My darlin', I'll be all you need (you need)
I know it hasn't been your day, your week, your week, your week
So put it all on me (woo)
Oh my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge me 'cause I feel the same thing (yeah)
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (babe)

All on me, on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (slow)
All on me, on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me (woo!)
All on me, on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need (need)
To put it all on me (woo!)

I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
