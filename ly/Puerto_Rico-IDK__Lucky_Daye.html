		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, you're just like Puerto Rico
Sunshine sometimes, Miami
When it rains it pours, like London
Ooh, your looks can be deceiving, thought I knew ya
Close that door, bed or floor?
I just want more, I can't get enough of you
What I got in store, it's all of yours
I just want more, I can't get enough of you

She wanna ride that thing to the top of the pole
Throw a couple dollars, make her get it and go
Front-to-front, front-to-back, front-to-side, do it face-to-face
Understand I'm a free agent but I'm yours today (uh-huh)
Single like dollar like radio play (uh-huh)
For the Radiohead, I promise I'll stay (uh-huh)
Gotta switch up the station like under the lake (uh-huh)
Single like uno, no dos y no tres

She's a five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip
Five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip

Girl, you're just like Puerto Rico
Sunshine sometimes, Miami
When it rains it pours, like London
Ooh, your looks can be deceiving, thought I knew ya
Close that door, bed or floor?
I just want more, I can't get enough of you
What I got in store, it's all of yours
I just want more, I can't get enough of you

(You know what? You know what?)
(You know, you know)
(We like to party)
(You know what? You know what?)
(You know what? You know what?)
(We like to party)
(We like to party)
(You know what?)

Only rolling with the slightest
I'ma pull up, we should roll up, get the lighter
Put it on me nice and slow
With some drinks over tequila, she a fighter
I light her fire
Anything goes
Two at a time, they find it, twins, they Geminis
And they keep switchin' sides, I'm not surprised (okay)
She already known the problems, always tellin' lies
We over-analyze, I see it in her eyes, I know

She's a five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip
Five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip

Girl, you're just like Puerto Rico
Sunshine sometimes, Miami
When it rains it pours, like London
Ooh, your looks can be deceiving, thought I knew ya
Close that door, bed or floor?
I just want more, I can't get enough of you
What I got in store, it's all of yours
I just want more, I can't get enough of you
