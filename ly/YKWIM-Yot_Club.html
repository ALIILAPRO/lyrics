		<p>
		  Hey
It's not like you've ever tried to stay
Sometimes it seems like I'm in your way
Well, that's how it seems
Hey
You know what I mean?

It seems like I care too much
When I'm all alone, oh no
I feel like I care too much
When no one's at home for me
Feel like I'm fallin' out
Well, that's how it seems
I think that I'm fallin' out
You know what I mean?

It seems like I care too much
When I'm all alone, oh no
She said that I care too much
When no one's at home for me, ah
