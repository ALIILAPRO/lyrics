		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't change the way you are
Don't change the way you were because I said so
Run away from your mistakes
And all you hate because you said so
So you will
That's a promise you need to keep
And if you break it, you'll never leave
Don't change the way you are
Don't change the way you were because I said so
Run away from your mistakes
And all you hate because you said so
So you will
That's a promise you need to keep
And if you break it, you'll never leave
