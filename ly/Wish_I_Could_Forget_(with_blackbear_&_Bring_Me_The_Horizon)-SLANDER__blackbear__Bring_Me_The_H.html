		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a problem and that problem is you
Left me no option, I don't know what to do
I broke your heart so you could know how it feels
Got matching scars to show you I was real
Knew from the start that this would never exist
But it is what it is

I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground
I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground

I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground

I still remember when it was you and me
Less like a memory, more like PTSD
I burned alive to stop you catchin' a chill
Barely survived when you went for the kill
Couldn't handle you part so you tried flippin' the script
But you shot and you missed

I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground
I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground

I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground
I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground

I wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
You took my world and flipped it upside down
Got me so high you left me on the ground
