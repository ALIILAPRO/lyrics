		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation
This is Pope Gravy
Please put your hands together for Pastor Baby

You need Jesus (Jesus), go back to church (bitch)
What if I don't wanna?
Smoking marijuana
Deliver her banana
Take a few hits then I'm reaching my nirvana
Where you at?
I ain't hittin' Sunday school
Amen
Get bread, sip wine at the stool
Bought a cat
Baptized the infinity pool
Three wise hoes, what would Jesus do?

Catch me on the block slamming big cock
Fifty on a watch, make a white bitch crip walk
Drain a couple threes, huh, first name Barrack
Call my mama, tell her got a star in the star walk (Skr, skr, skr ,skr)

Four days, like twenty condoms
Practice safe sex, no problem
She licky on my dicky, that's a cerebellum
Bro, chill out, honestly
You need Jesús, fake news
Prance around the club with the Quaaludes
Oh my God, Gravy just came through
Like what the heck did they pay you? (Skr, skr, skr, skr)
Maybe I just wanna
Turn up with the homies and the honeys in Bahamas
I be in Hawaii just to pull up on Moana
(Wait, how old is Moana? Not a milf)
Fuck that, I'll take her mama

You need Jesus (Jesus), go back to church (bitch)
What if I don't wanna?
Smoking marijuana
Deliver her banana
Take a few hits then I'm reaching my nirvana
Where you at?
I ain't hittin' Sunday school
Amen
Get bread, sip wine at the stool
Bought a cat
Baptized the infinity pool
Three wise hoes, what would Jesus do?

Yeah, first things first, I run an audible
Hair real nice, I'll sell my follicles
Break a sweat in her abdominals
Deep in her Marianna's Trench, nautical
Mother Nature tryna fuck, I'm doin' botany (plants)
Gravy bought a pool, man, this shit is watery (splash)
Baby cash, got cash, won the lottery
I'm a G with the D gettin' P, that's economy

¿Cómo se llama?
They call me Gravy, I'm hot like a sauna
Colite de rana
I'm in mi cama, just countin' up commas
Say adiós to your bitch 'til mañana
Y tu mama también
Hittin' hot yoga off an Ambien
Wake up in the morning with a Tampa 10
Oh shit, and a friend
Wait-wait-wait, hold up

You need Jesus (Jesus), go back to church (bitch)
What if I don't wanna?
Smoking marijuana
Deliver her banana
Take a few hits then I'm reaching my nirvana
Where you at?
I ain't hittin' Sunday school
Amen
Get bread, sip wine at the stool
Bought a cat
Baptized the infinity pool
Three wise hoes, what would Jesus do?
