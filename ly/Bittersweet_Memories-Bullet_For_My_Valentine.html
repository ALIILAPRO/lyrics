		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You turn me off at the push of a button
And you pretend that I don't mean nothing
I'm not a saint, that's easy to tell
But guess what honey? you ain't no angel
You like to scream use words as a weapon
Well go ahead take your best shot woman
I wanna leave you, it's easy to see
But guess what honey it's not that easy

We get so complicated (complicated)
This finger's for our memories

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down, and burn them all
Light the fire and walk away
There's nothing left to say, so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories

I wanna run and escape from your prison,
But when I leave I feel something is missing.
I'm not afraid that's easy to tell,
This can't be heaven,
It feels like I'm in hell.
You're like a drug that I can't stop taking,
I want more and I can't stop craving.
I still want you it's easy to see,
But guess what honey?
You're not that good for me.

We get so complicated (complicated),
This finger's for our memories.

So rip my pictures from your wall,
Tear them down, and burn them all.
Light the fire and walk away,
There's nothing left to say, so,
Take the ashes from the floor,
Bury them to just make sure,
That nothing more is left of me,
Just bittersweet memories.

Just bittersweet memories.

We get so complicated (complicated),
This finger's for our memories.

We get so complicated.

So rip my pictures from your wall,
Tear them down, and burn them all.
Light the fire and walk away,
There's nothing left to say, so,
Take the ashes from the floor,
Bury them to just make sure,
That nothing more is left of me,
Just bittersweet memories.

There's nothing left to say.
There's nothing left to say.
