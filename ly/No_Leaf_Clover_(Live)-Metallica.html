		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it feels right this time
On this crash course we're in the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy
Says it feels right this time
Turn around, found new high lights

Good day to be alive, sir
Good day to be alive, he said

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just the freight train coming your way

Don't it feel right like this
All the pieces fall to his wish
Suck up for that quick reward boy
Suck up for that quick reward they said

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just the freight train coming your way
It's coming your way
It's coming your way, here comes

Yeah, Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way, yeah

Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
