		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't sleep i keep thinking about this
What if, with everything that's going on
The world really is coming to an end?
Then what?

What if it isn't a lie? (What if?)
What if we make it to
Heaven and don't get inside? (What if?)
What if we get to the gates and
See God on the other side and
He looks us in our face and says
Our whole lives we've wasted time?
What if we can't go back? (What if?)
What if we can't redo this life
And get one second chance?
What if our future happiness is
Memories of our past (God)
While we burn forever haunted
By the devil's laughs? (Ha ha haha)
Why? Why do we push them away? (Why?)
And why do the ones we work
To keep never actually stay? (Why?)
Why do we focus on tomorrow
And forget about today (Why?)
And smile in everybody's face and try
And act like we're okay?
Why do we live this way? Why do we hate?
Why do we fight?
Why do we act like there's time
And got more than one life? Why? (Answer me)
Why? WHY!? Why? Why?

I'm older and looking for truth
I'm holding my faith in my hand but the pain
In this world has been shaking it loose
I used to have so much to gain
Now I have so much to lose
They say I'm crazy for looking for answers
I say they crazy for not giving proof
Vision is blurred, I'm over concerned
I'm looking at God to see if life
With him is something I've earned
The devil's been watching he's tryna recruit
He's been waiting at every turn
I'm driving this life on the highway
To hell but I won't burn, fuck!
We know the difference
We know what is wrong and
We know what is right
But Satan is strong, God
And most of your people are losing the fight
(We try) so what if we fail?
What if we can't escape his lies? (What if?)
What if we can't change
What if he still controls our minds?
Where do we run? Where do we go?
Who do we talk to?
We look around and everyone we
See is lost too (Fuck)
What if life was just some
Test that we all do? (What if?)
What if you were busy when we called you?

What if hell's on earth?
What if being born is dying
And dying's birth?
Would that mean life's not God's
Gift but the devil's curse?
And to live was to be
Evil 'cause it's words reversed?
What if the devil entered a pastor
And he led a church?
What if we looked for the truth
But didn't know where to search? (Where?)
What if the books they said to
Read had never been your words? (What if?)
What if we chose to follow you
But we still had that urge?
Will you forgive us for our sins
And let us in your world?
God we at the gates (What if?)
We couldn't see, hear, or touch you
But we had faith we know we messed up
We human and we make mistakes
So we just begging we get in
And that you'll have grace (Please)
God! What if we didn't mean it?
What if the place we grew
Up forgot to teach it?
What if we never even got the
Chance to go and seek it?
Then what, then what? (Then what?)

Dear Family we're in scary times
Nobody has the answers
Just make sure we spread love and believe
My name is Dax
