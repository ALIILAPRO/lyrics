		  (T-T-Tay Keith) Took it to ten (hey)

Ayy, it's a holiday
I got hoes on hoes and they out of control, yeah
Ayy, it's another way
All my niggas on go and I hope that you know it

I can't even close my eyes
And I don't know why, guess I don't like surprises
I can't even stay away from the game that I play
They gon' know us today, yeah
 
Ayy, can I pop shit?
I might bottom on the low, but I top shit
Switch the genre on you hoes, do a rock hit
I got the biggest damn song, fuck the charts
Sis, I don't need 'em

They wanna know if I be lastin'
Bitch, even if I started floppin', there'd be fashion
Poppin' up in movies, ain't no Nas-y, bitch, it's Ashton
Hee, hee, I'm bad as Michael Jackson
Dun, dun, dun

Ayy, it's a holiday
I got hoes on hoes and they out of control, yeah
Ayy, it's another way
All my niggas on go and I hope that you know it

I can't even close my eyes
And I don't know why, guess I don't like surprises
I can't even stay away from the game that I play
They gon' know us today, yeah

Man, I snuck into the game, came in on a horse
I pulled a gimmick, I admit it, I got no remorse
Nobody tried to let me in, nobody opened doors
I kicked the motherfuckers down, they didn't have a choice

Dun, dun, dun
They tried to next me, ayy, but I'm blessed, see
Ayy, no flex, but my checks givin' vet tease
Ayy, and I'm sexy, they wanna sex me
Pop star, but the rappers still respect me

They wanna know if I be lastin'
Bitch, even if I started floppin', there'd be fashion
Poppin' up in movies, ain't no Nas-y, bitch, it's Ashton
Hee, hee, I'm bad as Michael Jackson
Dun, dun, dun

Ayy, it's a holiday
I got hoes on hoes and they out of control, yeah
Ayy, it's another way
All my niggas on go and I hope that you know it

I can't even close my eyes
And I don't know why, guess I don't like surprises
I can't even stay away from the game that I play
They gon' know us today, yeah

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Daytrip took it to ten (hey)
