		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been going under
Like snowflakes that's being frozen to the ground
The world's been in a slumber
And there has been no signs of waking up

But today, come what may
I will wipe all my tears
For all of the ones that I love and hold near
I wish you a happy year

Oh, I wanna learn how to love again
To live and let go, oh
Ooh, I wanna cry and laugh with all my friends
Oh, this year
I wanna dance, I wanna take all my chances
Hold your hand tight when it gets dark
Ah-ooh, I wanna wish you with all my heart
Happy New Year

I see you way out up the tunnel
The sun's melting the ice right through my hands
So burn down all your sorrows
'Cause something always starts when something ends

But today, come what may
I will wipe all my tears
For all of the ones that I love and hold near
I wish you a happy year

Oh, I wanna learn how to love again
To live and let go, oh
Ooh, I wanna cry and laugh with all my friends
Oh, this year
I wanna dance, I wanna take all my chances
Hold your hand tight when it gets dark
Ah-ooh, I wanna wish you with all my heart
Happy New Year

I wanna learn how to love again (to love again), oh
I wanna learn how to love again
Oh, this year
I wanna dance, I wanna take all my chances
Hold your hand tight when it gets dark (when it gets dark)
Ah-ooh, I wanna wish you with all my heart
Happy New Year
