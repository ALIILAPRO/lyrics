		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind
I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind

To the ones that hold me down
I'm just grateful you're around
I'ma make 'em know this sound all for you
To the angels passed away
I'ma take this to the grave
And then meet me at the
Gates when I'm through

We always see lightning before
We hear thunder but why does the wintеr
Feel longer than summer and why is the timе
Getting faster and faster?
It's such a disaster
I know I won't last here

I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind

To the people of the world
To the boy without a girl
To the woman turned to widow in her room
To the doctors at the hospital
Who promise the impossible
Then rob you till you've got nothing to lose

We always see lightning before
We hear thunder but why does the winter
Feel longer than summer and why is the time
Getting faster and faster?
It's such a disaster
I know I won't last here

I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind
I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind
