Shit, what does Drizzy say?

Kiki, do you love me? 'Cause I love you
And I never, ever really wanna hurt you
I got questions, I need answers
And I really hope that you don't take it personal
I'm a big dog (yeah), I got big guns (yeah)
We put a shell up in his back like he a turtle
Audemars Piguet, might Birk' you (huh, huh)
I've been workin' so hard, I know I deserve you

Pour the lemonade and pattern up my purple (purple)
Fizzy little jammer, little Merkle (Merkle)
Switch it to the glizzy, I done patterned up my circle (circle)
Send you shoppin' with your friends, I won't disturb you
Baby, just hold it down, you gotta learn to close your mouth
Van Cleef on your soft skin, they gotta notice now
I know the rules, I take you out, I was full of hate, I grown to love
Remember, the grass is only greener where you water, love (yeah)
Every member, the drug squad, they know me by my work name
You know that you're in deep when fiends call you by your first name
First car was an '08 then the Merc' came
At least three or four fiends died when the dirt came
I peep game
This silly nigga tryna work game
On a big dog that works game
I'm five steps ahead, it won't work, mate
Retire my lady, I ain't worried 'bout no work mates (ha)
Twenty-nine, man trapped on my birthday (uh)

Kiki, do you love me? (Yeah) 'Cause I love you (yeah)
And I never, ever really wanna hurt you (yeah)
I got questions (yeah), I need answers (yeah)
And I really hope that you don't take it personal (yeah)
I'm a big dog (yeah), I got big guns (yeah)
We put a shell up in his back like he a turtle (huh)
Audemars Piguet (yeah), might Birk' you (huh)
I've been workin' so hard, I know I deserve you (ha)

Said she wants the Goyard, the one that's got the wooden handle (let's get it)
Anniversaries in my fleet, I wear my watches annual (let's get it)
I made Hermes stitch my seats inside the Lambo' (yeah)
We can check in every week, it's for the bankroll (yeah, yeah)
They killed the crocodile, in Hermes for purses (for purses)
I found motion then I really found my purpose (I found my purpose)
Court dates, told my lawyers, just adjourn this (yeah)
Niggas gorillas and we ain't runnin' through the circus (no)
Look me in my eyes, I know you can't 'cause you done me bad
Kiki's out here causin' niggas hell 'cause she want Beez back (ha)
A Jewelers on the other phone 'cause I've been tryna freeze that (freeze that)
Lookin' backstage where my Gs at

Kiki, do you love me? (Yeah) 'Cause I love you (yeah)
And I never, ever really wanna hurt you (yeah)
I got questions (yeah), I need answers (yeah)
And I really hope that you don't take it personal (yeah)
I'm a big dog (yeah), I got big guns (yeah)
We put a shell up in his back like he a turtle (huh)
Audemars Piguet (yeah), might Birk' you
I've been workin' so hard, I know I deserve you
