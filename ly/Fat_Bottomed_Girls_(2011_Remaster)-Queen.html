		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, okay!
This is called, uh
Fat Bottomed Girls!

(One, two, three, four!)
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go 'round

Hey!
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

Hey! H-h-h-hey! Ah, yeah
C'mon, yeah alright
Fat bottomed girls
Do-do-do-do, hey
Yeah

I've been singing with my band
Across the wire, across the land
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time

C'mon!
Are you gonna take me home tonight? Hey!
Oh, down beside your red firelight
Oh, when you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go 'round
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go 'round

Now I got mortgages and homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality, I tell you
Oh, but I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Big woman, you done made a big man of me

Now, hear this!
Oh, (I know) you gonna take me home tonight? Hey!
Oh, down beside your red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go 'round, yeah
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go 'round

Get on your bikes and ride!
Like a cowboy, oh, come on, hey, go, aw yeah
That's the way I like it, yeah
Yes, yes! Them fat bottomed girls
You ride 'em, you ride 'em, hey hey! Alright
Ooh! Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Alright

Oh yes, fat bottomed girls
One more time girls, yeah, yeah
Alright, yeah
More, more
