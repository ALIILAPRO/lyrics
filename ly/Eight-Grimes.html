		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this

It's always something
It's always something
I know you're running and we know, hey
I feel my heartbeat
You tell me nothing
You tell me nothing in this town, no

Go where you want to go
When you get there you'll be wishing you were by the phone
Oh, go where you want to go
Because the sky is lifting
And I can't stop drifting along

I'm singing with a lifeline
You want a lifeline oh oh
I, I, I am singing for you softly
And when you got me
I am gone you know

Go where you want to go
When you get there you'll be wishing you were by the phone
Oh, go where you want to go
Because the sky is lifting
And I can't stop drifting along
