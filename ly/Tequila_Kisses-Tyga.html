		<p>
		  Yeah, that Gucci shit don't matter
That Versace shit don't matter
I get it 'cause I got it
I got it 'cause you had to have it
That Fendi shit don't matter
That Chanel shit don't matter
You can take off all that designer
You'd still be the baddest
It's that Lamborghini love
Tequila kisses
And I love when you take it off
When you take it off, take it off
'Cause that McQueen shit don't matter
That Dior shit don't matter
You can take off all that designer
You'd still be the baddest

That Gucci shit don't matter
That Ferragamo I know, I know
I can spot a real bitch through a blindfold, yeah
Aw yeah
I don't need no side hos, yeah
Aw yeah
Let your ho side out behind my door
Aw yeah
When the lights stop flashing, you still shine
And you look so good, even when you're not okay (when you're not okay, yeah)
You still so fine (even when you're not okay, yeah)
You still so fine
I cannot deny it
You got somethin' special
They cannot buy it
I got all this money
I can't find nobody to do me like your body
I just wanna party with you

That Gucci shit don't matter
That Versace shit don't matter
I get it 'cause I got it
I got it 'cause you had to have it
That Fendi shit don't matter
That Chanel shit don't matter
You can take off all that designer
You'd still be the baddest (skrrt skrrt)
It's that Lamborghini love
Tequila kisses
And I love when you take it off
When you take it off, take it off
'Cause that McQueen shit don't matter (no no no no)
That Dior shit don't matter (no no no no no)
You can take off all that designer 
You'd still be the baddest, yeah yeah

It's that Lamborghini love
Tequila kisses
This what dreams made of
I know what this is
Run them numbers up
Just don't run from this
Just don't run from this bae

Dolce and Gabana, Balenciaga, all over you
Dulce de leche
So hot I sweat babe
So ha ha ha ha
Still look hot in sweats babe
Ha ha ha ha ha
Skrr
You drive me crazy

That Gucci shit don't matter no
That Versace shit don't matter no
I get it 'cause I got it
I got it 'cause you had to have it, oh
That Fendi shit don't matter
That Chanel shit don't matter
You can take off all that designer
You'd still be the baddest (skrrt skrrt)
It's that Lamborghini love
Tequila kisses
And I love when you take it off
When you take it off, take it off
'Cause that McQueen shit don't matter (no no no no)
That Dior shit don't matter (no no no no no)
You can take off all that designer
You'd still be the baddest, yeah yeah

It's that Lamborghini love
Tequila kisses
This what dreams made of
I know what this is
Run them numbers up
Just don't run from this
Just don't run from this bae
