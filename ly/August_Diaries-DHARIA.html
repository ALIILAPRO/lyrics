		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried to keep a diary
To let it out away from me
Maybe
I should've burned your memory
Instead I let it ruin me
You see

Watching the moon I feel its pain
Idyllic but cold inside
Eating my soul your shattering 'I love you, bye'
You were my sin so hard to hide
But promise that from now on
You're gone

It's been a while since you and me
Have shared a real memory
You see
I feel the need quietly
To have you here close to me
Maybe

Watching the moon I feel its pain
Idyllic but cold inside
Eating my soul your shattering 'I love you, bye'
You were my sin so hard to hide
But promise that from now on
You're gone

All I remember
Cold like December
She cries on the sofa
Still waiting for him to call her
But she should've noticed
It was only August
The cold that she felt was not from the weather
Was from his poison
