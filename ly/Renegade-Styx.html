		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh Mama, I'm in fear for my life
From the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my running
And I'm so far from my home
Oh, Mama, I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long (yeah)

The jig is up, the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
This will be the end today of the wanted man

Oh, Mama, I've been years on the lam
And had a high price on my head
Lawman said, "Get him dead or alive"
Now it's for sure he'll see me dead

Dear Mama, I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long

The jig is up, the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
The judge will have revenge today
On the wanted man

Oh, Mama, I'm in fear for my life
From the long arm of the law
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long

The jig is up, the news is out
They've finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
This will be the end today of the wanted man
The wanted man

And I don't wanna go, no-no

Mama, don't let 'em take me!
Hey, hey
No, no, no, I can't go
