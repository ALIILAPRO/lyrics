		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm Proud to be a Canadian. We drink beer and eat poutine 
Going out for a rip and sending it is our everyday routine 
I'm proud to be a Canadian from the true north strong and free
If you're down to be a Canadian listen up and follow me 

Grab a beer out the cooler let me show you how we do it whole
Country iced out and we ain't even need a jeweller bought my
Multicoloured moo law. Where's it at again? Who know's?
Don't even want a Grammy but this here might win a Juno

Slide on a ting Gretzky. Hit Shuswap Lake with the Jet ski
Crack a cold one with my Besties Just another day another Way that it Bless me
Syrup on maple Full Sends that's a staple whole Squad going buck 
When it's Warming up in April said we Popping no soda
North of Minnesota Scream it like you mean BC to Nova Scotia

I'm Proud to be a Canadian. We drink beer and eat poutine 
Going out for a rip and sending it is our everyday routine 
I'm proud to be a Canadian from the true north strong and free
If you're down to be a Canadian listen up and follow me 

Say Hell Ya
Say Let's Go

For my country boys and my city girls, for my
Hoser gang at home and around the world
We might not be perfect but we're pretty close 
Got drip like my country God damn man it's pretty cold

Ooh God Damn ya we really froze
But we still the most Lit it ain't even close

We're supposed to be Nice ya I know I know
But Even geographically you a bit below
And not to say I hate you If you ain't Canadian
We're just proud of where we Come from

Finish that beer then Open up another one
And sing along with us while you raise it up!

I'm Proud to be a Canadian. We drink beer and eat poutine 
Going out for a rip and sending it is our everyday routine 
I'm proud to be a Canadian from the true north strong and free
If you're down to be a Canadian listen up and follow me
