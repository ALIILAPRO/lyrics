		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got my own moral compass to steer by
A guiding star beats a spirit in the sky
And all the preaching voices
Empty vessels of dreams so loud
As they move among the crowd
Fools and thieves are well disguised
In the temple and marketplace, ayy
In the temple and marketplace

Like a stone in the river
Against the floods of spring
I will quietly resist
I will quietly resist

Like the willows in the wind
Or the cliffs along the ocean
I will quietly resist
I will quietly resist

I don't have faith in faith
I don't believe in belief
You can call me faithless
You can call me faithless

And I still cling to hope
And I believe in love
And that's faith enough for me
And that's faith enough for me

I've got my own spirit level for balance
To tell if my choice is leaning up or down
And all the shouting voices
Try to throw me off my course
Some by sermon, some by force
Fools and thieves are dangerous
In the temple and marketplace, ayy
In the temple and marketplace

Like a forest bows to winter
Beneath the deep white silence
I will quietly resist

I don't have faith in faith
I don't believe in belief
You can call me faithless
You can call me faithless

But I still cling to hope
And I believe in love
And that's faith enough for me
And that's faith enough for me

Like a flower in the desert
That only blooms at night
I will quietly resist

I don't have faith in faith
I don't believe in belief
You can call me faithless
You can call me faithless
I still cling to hope
And I believe in love
And that's faith enough for me
And that's faith enough for me

And that's faith enough for me
