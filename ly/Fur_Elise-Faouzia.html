		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll dance, I'll dance like a puppet on your string
I'll sing when you order me to sing
I'll ring like a desperate violin
Mm-mm, mm-mm

You're so musical, an artist
You make a lie sound like it's true
You're unusual, creative
Oh, what I'd do to be your muse

So play me like my name is Fur Elise
Lie to me and say you'll never leave
Drown me in your twisted melodies
I'll pretend you wrote 'em all for me

I'll jump, I'll jump, if you ask, I'll say, "How high?"
I'll run like a shiver down your spine
For you, I would give you my own life
Mm-mm, mm-mm

You're so musical, an artist
You make a lie sound like it's true
You're unusual, creative
Oh, what I'd do to be your muse

So play me like my name is Fur Elise
Lie to me and say you'll never leave
Drown me in your twisted melodies
I'll pretend you wrote 'em all for me

You're so musical, an artist
Won't you play me like, won't you play me like
Play me like my name is Fur Elise
