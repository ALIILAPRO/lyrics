		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Mhm)
(Oh oh)

Live another day
Climb a little higher
Find another reason to stay
Ashes in your hands
Mercy in your eyes
If you're searching for a silent sky

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So die another day

The coldness of his words
The message in his silence
Face the candle to the wind
This distance in my voice
Isn't leaving you a choice
So if you're looking for a time to run away

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

They took pictures of our dreams
Ran to hide behind the stairs
And said, "Maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall"

But if they don't come down
Resist the need to pull them in
And throw them away
Better to save the mystery
Than surrender to the secret
Whoa oh

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day
