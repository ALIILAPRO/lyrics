		  (I-I-ISM)

Shit tryna take me, nigga (nigga)
Blame it on the pills, my nigga (nigga)
Bitches bitchin' at me, go slow (slow)
But you ain't gon' see tomorrow ('row)
Percocet, pills, my nigga (nigga)
Can't stop fuckin' 'round with 'em
Pop a Xan, gon' sip a Tech with it
Codeine got me in my feelings

Go 'head, sip it, bet I'll keep on sippin'
Drinkin' bottles after bottles, feelin' all exquisite
Fuckin' models after models, all these hoes junkies
Can't see me, tinted inside my Bentley
Fiends in the club and they swear that they litty
Lines in the bathroom, big drug dealin'
Codeine got me in my feelings
Codeine got me in my feelings

I'm high now
Gotta go, gotta roll by the projects
Drop the pack, feed the hood, livin' lawless
Tax free, I'm that nigga livin' lawless
Hit Diego, NASCAR, get my ki's up
That's the plug, my amigo got the re-up
Switchin' twenties for the fifties, hundred K more
Switchin' fifties for the hundreds, that's the K.O.

Can't seem to find my face (find my face)
They don't seem to know their place (yeah, wassup?)
May he take my enemy (Freebandz gang)
Let it sing Amazing Grace (we outta here)
(Super)

Came up out my city, glowed up
Pussy want some, roll up
Fuckin' on your bitch, throw it up
Drinkin' on the dirty soda
Promise I'ma never go sober
Nigga ain't nothin' but some vultures
Percocets, Molly, damn baby
Crushin' X on your punani
I done made love to an Ethiopian (I did)
Had her pull in, in a full torpedo
I done pulled up, wanna pop me too (whoa)
Fucked around, had to pour up one more (drank)
Check my threads, I done went Herm√®s (check me out)
I done went new baguettes, I done went VVS (yeah, yeah)
Dirt in my cup and I'm cleanin' up fresh (yeah, yeah)
Fuck her the best and she love me to death (Pluto)
But I love myself

Shit tryna take me, nigga (nigga)
Blame it on the pills, my nigga (Pluto)
Bitches bitchin' at me, go slow (slow)
But you ain't gon' see tomorrow ('row)
Percocet, pills, my nigga (nigga)
Can't stop fuckin' 'round with 'em
Pop a Xan, gon' sip a Tech with it
Codeine got me in my feelings

(Baby)
What's your choice of drug?
I be sippin' syrup, I think that I'm in love, whoa
From apartments to the top charts
Now it's sold-out shows
She say she play with her nose
I told her that's not in my goals
I know when to go
I know when to fold, that's never
They throwin' dirt with no shovel
It ain't no shame in my game
It ain't no flaw in my name
Only lay up in the rain
I made a promise, I bought her a Range
You can do that but I'm go 'gainst the grain
Rolls wit' an umbrella (whoa)
Top white thing lookin' like Cinderella
I be fuckin' with the mob, I know good fellas
Ain't fuckin' with the Percs, bu my man get 'em
And he got jiggas

Shit tryna take me, nigga (nigga)
Blame it on the pills, my nigga (nigga)
Bitches bitchin' at me, go slow (slow)
But you ain't gon' see tomorrow ('row)
Percocet, pills, my nigga (nigga)
Can't stop fuckin' 'round with 'em
Pop a Xan, gon' sip a Tech with it
Codeine got me in my feelings
