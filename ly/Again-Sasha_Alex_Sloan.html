		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby blue jeans, had your hand on my knee
I'd get shivers down my spine each time you touched me
Salt in your kiss from that 2AM swim
I wish I could put my arm around a memory

You can't control it, you can't help it when you fall in love
I'll give you everything, and now I've got to give you up
And I know it's over
But if it's any closure

Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again (still do it again)
Still do it again (still do it again)

All of those nights, still tattooed on my mind
No matter where I go you'll be a part of me forever

You can't control it, you can't help it when you fall in love
I'll give you everything, and now I've got to give you up
And I know it's over
But if it's any closure

Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again (still do it again)
Still do it again (still do it again)
Even if I knew it would end (even if I knew it would end)
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again (still do it again)
Still do it again, still do it again

Sometimes I wanna call
'Cause even though it wasn't right (even though it wasn't right)
I still hope you're alright (I still hope you're alright)
Sometimes I wanna call
'Cause even though it wasn't right (Even though it wasn't right)
I still hope you're alright

'Cause even if I knew it would end (even if I knew it would end)
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again (still do it again)
Still do it again (still do it again)
'Cause even if I knew it would end (even if I knew it would end)
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again (still do it again)
Still do it again, and again, and again

(Even if I knew it would end)
(Even if I knew it would end)
(Even if I knew it would end)
(Even if I knew it would end)
(Even if I knew it would end)
(Even if I knew it would end)
