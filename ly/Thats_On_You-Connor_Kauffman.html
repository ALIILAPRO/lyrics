		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve had my ups and my downs
But you were always around for the bottom
I had to make my way out
When I was blinded, in doubt of the outcome

Now look at all the things you’re making me do
Baby you know I ain’t got a lot to lose
Cuz I had built up our house, and then you
Burned it all down, and then some

That’s on you
That’s on you
I don’t wanna know about the shit that you do
You played me
Like a fool
Always coming up with somethin’ bearing bad news
I cant take another day of this
I crossed your name right off my list
Cuz that’s on you
That’s on you
I don’t wanna know about the shit that you do
Cuz that’s on you

You’ve got me against a wall
But you know that’s how I like it
I know you’re waiting to call, you’re on the floor of the stall
But lucky you I can’t fight this

If you think that this is all my fault right now
I don’t see the point in keeping you around
Somewhere down the line we lost ourselves
And were never found

That’s on you
That’s on you
I don’t wanna know about the shit that you do
You played me
Like a fool
Always coming up with somethin’ bearing bad news
I cant take another day of this
I crossed your name right off my list
Cuz that’s on you
That’s on you
I don’t wanna know about the shit that you do
Cuz that’s on you

You, you, you
That’s on you, that’s on you
I don’t wanna know about the shit that you do
