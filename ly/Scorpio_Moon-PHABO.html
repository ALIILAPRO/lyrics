		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said you'd never let a fuck nigga hit it
Then you went and gave a fuck nigga children
Die for you, I'd give my heart and both my kidneys
Lie for you and do the time

Do you think of us when you self medicate? (Do you, you, I, I, I)
The high that you get doesn't answer the pain (oh, yeah)
If happiness is what you're seeking
Why won't you come back home?

When's the last time that you made love?
Honestly, 'cause you've been fiendin'
Jodeci, she cry for me
Remind me what it's made of
Cotton candy you're so sweet
Then sour, it can be deceiving
Girl, come here let me taste you
Spell your name in cursive for me
Hurry that up got work in the morning, earn it
Remind me what it's made of
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

My Scorpio moon made me hit you
To meet up late night like this
Scorpio moon told me to text you
Have your granny watch your jits, huh
I'm checking the temperature like I'm a nurse tech (ayy)
I'll take all the bullshit with a little discipline
I'm more than just militant for that pussy
I was standing on the edge, and you pushed
I was at JJ's Fish and Chicken, you was at the varsity with yo' nigga
I had to let the bird soar, mane
Not my prerogative how you use your wings

Do you think of us when you self medicate? (Do you, you, I, I, I)
The high that you get doesn't answer the pain (oh, yeah)
If happiness is what you're seeking
Why won't you come back home?

When's the last time that you made love?
Honestly, 'cause you've been fiendin'
Jodeci, she cry for me
Remind me what it's made of
Cotton candy you're so sweet
Then sour, it can be deceiving
Girl, come here let me taste you (ayy)
Spell your name in cursive for me
Hurry that up got work in the morning, earn it
Remind me what it's made of
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Scorpio
Scorpio moon
Scorpio
Scorpio moon
