		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leaves turnin' brown, it's down to 54
Cold is movin' into Texas and it's movin' out the warm
These bitter winds, comin' soon again
Chapped lips askin' for tips, tryna find more love to lend, oh
Mm-hmm

And family ties are movin' closer in
Find the time to hear the chimes of a wedding once again
I need it bad, more than I did before
To feel the warmth of a fire and a woman that I adore, oh

Can this all please slow down?
Another year is burnin' out
The sun don't wait for someone like me
Who's got more wants than needs
So I'll sit still as seasons move on
Though I hate to watch 'em leave
I hate to watch 'em leave

I see your breath while I'm holdin' mine
Your face lit up by the moon, my face lit up by your eyes
I'm singin' songs, the family sings along
With my feet buried in the gravel, my heart buried in my wrongs, yeah

Can this all just please slow down?
Another year is burnin' out
The sun don't wait for someone like me
Who's got more wants than needs
So I'll sit still as seasons move on
Though I hate to watch 'em leave
I hate to watch 'em leave

And I know, oh-oh
And I know, oh-oh

It won't be long, today will carry on
'Til tomorrow is the past, the future is long gone, and

Can this all please slow down?
Another year is burnin' out
The sun don't wait for someone like me
Who's got more wants than needs
So I'll sit still as seasons move on
Though I hate to watch 'em leave
Hate to watch 'em leave
