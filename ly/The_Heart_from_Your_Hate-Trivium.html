		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate 

It's easy to be right when everything repeats
It's easier to cut us down and point at our defeat
It's easy to be right when everything repeats
Dig below the surface find your insecurities
Tell me
Maybe you were right, maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right, maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take 
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate (hate)
To rip the heart from your hate (hate)
To rip the heart from your hate

You always walk away
Soon you'll have to face it
Your distance from reality won't bury or erase it
I tried to do the same
Living so complacent
But the problems wouldn't go away so I turned around to face them, tell me

Maybe you were right, maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right, maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take to rip the heart from your hate
What will it take, what will it take
To rip the heart from your hate (hate)

Maybe you were right, maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take 
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate

What will it take 
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate (hate)

To rip the heart from your hate (hate)
To rip the heart from your hate (hate)
