		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess the future was a bad idea
Like it's 1999
It's easy to make people hurt 'round here
You go and call it a good time
So did you find that thing you're looking for?
Does it make you feel alive?
Wait, he said what? He'll start a war
Tear down the planet for the hype, oh, oh

You know it always ends the same
Honesty's a losing game
It died a long, long time ago
With your favorite god
He said what?

Oh no
We have lost control
Have you seen the video?
But for heaven's sake, don't ever let the, let the people know
Oh no

There ain't no prizes for the kindest heart
But I'll make you rich if you subscribe
Well, someone just blew up the bar
'Cause they were swallowing the lie, oh, oh

You know it always ends the same
Honesty's a losing game
It died a long, long time ago
With guitar music
He said what?

Oh no
We have lost control
Have you seen the video?
But for heaven's sake, don't ever let the, let the people know
Oh no, oh no

Every day, it gets harder (harder)
We'll throw it away
So tell me when it's over (over)
We'll do it again
He said what?

Dance to the rhythm, my algorithm
Enjoy the feeling, don't turn off
Dance to the rhythm, my algorithm
Keepin' ya spinnin' 'til you drop
Dance to the rhythm, my algorithm
We'll make a killin', never stop
He said what?

Oh no
We have lost control
Have you seen the video?
But for heaven's sake, don't ever let the, let the people know
Oh no, oh no

Every day, it gets harder (harder)
We'll throw it away
So tell me when it's over (over)
We'll do it again
He said what?
