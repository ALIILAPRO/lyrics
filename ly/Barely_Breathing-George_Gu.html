		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patiently waitin' it's been a long day
Finally see you don't know what to say
Findin' the patience we've come a long way
All of our moments I wanna replay
What I'm feelin' yeah
We've hit a ceiling yeah
I'm barely breathing yeah
My heart is bleeding yeah
Thought it would be easy but it's so damn hard to move on
Wanna call you up and talk to you what you on
Holdin' out my feelings but it's been so long
Takin' drugs and drinkin' Henny yeah I'm so gone
Thinkin' back there really was a time
You were all that I had wanted on my mind yeah
Now we're so far but we're living life yeah
Yeah, oh oh
Patiently waitin' it's been a long day
Finally see you don't know what to say
Findin' the patience we've come a long way
All of our moments I wanna replay
What I'm feelin' yeah (what I'm feelin')
We've hit a ceiling yeah (we've hit a ceiling)
I'm barely breathing yeah (I'm barely breathing)
My heart is bleeding yeah
What I'm feelin' yeah (what I'm feelin')
We've hit a ceiling yeah (we've hit a ceiling)
I'm barely breathing yeah (I'm barely breathing barely breathing)
My heart is bleeding yeah
I'm barely breathing yeah
My heart is bleeding yeah
My heart is bleeding yeah
