		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, together
We can take it higher

I can hear the thunder
Comin' from your mouth and I know my number's up
Give me some Stevie Wonder
Quick, put it on before we go under
I can see the lightning
Coming from your ears, yeah, I see you're frightened
I can see The Lion Sleeps Tonight in the tears you're crying

Ooh
Can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too

Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher

I can see the rainbow
Coming from your heart and it's all okay so
Come now, see you're my angel
Say "Bye" to the past, "Hello" to tomorrow

Ooh
Can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too

Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher

I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it
I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it
I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it
I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it

Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher

Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
