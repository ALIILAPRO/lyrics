		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna let you down
But I don't really wanna let me down
Why am I walking on egg shells tonight?
When no one asked me to do it

I don't wanna feel tied down
And I don't really wanna pull me down
I wanna turn off all the ugly lights
I wish to have perfect freedom

Look in your sorrow which you're sinking
And walk in this sorrow without any thinking
Why don't you truly give up?
Your obsession and live in your light?
Where there is inner peace?

And look in your hollow, nothing exists
And walk in this hollow, everything is nothing
Face it, the more you have, the more emptiness
What is the meaning of life?
I'm just gonna flow like a river

Carefree life dreamer
Sounds like a winner
I wanna be in a place 
Where my ego is free

I don't wanna let you down
But I don't really wanna let me down
Why am I walking on egg shells tonight?
When no one asked me to do it

I don't wanna feel tied down
And I don't really wanna pull me down
I wanna turn off all the ugly lights
I wish to have perfect freedom

Oh, that flying butterfly is beautiful!
Anyone who is lying on the top? Let me know!
Who is on cloud nine? Butterflies or you?
Oh, maybe you're gonna lie!
Nothing I'm longing for!

(I don't wanna let you down
But I don't really wanna let me down)
Why am I walking on egg shells tonight?
When no one asked me to do it

I don't wanna let you down
But I don't really wanna let me down
I don't wanna feel tied down
I wish to have perfect freedom
