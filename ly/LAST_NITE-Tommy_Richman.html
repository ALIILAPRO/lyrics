		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, we don't talk about what happened last night
You kept your secret safe with me, now that's right
Now just forget it, uh
I'm not a better man, a better man

Better than yourself, my phone on silent
I don't really wanna go talk, oh man, let's talk in private
Talk about the things that you did to me, that's real
Oh nah, that's real, that's really real
That's really real

'Cause you know your time is up
I've had enough, talking 'bout the places you wanna go
Talking 'bout your goals, now just forget it, just forget it
What is your name? Do I know you from somewhere?
I don't recall, pussy getting snitches on
Talking 'bout like I ain't on, do you know where I came from?
I came from a dark place, dark place
I'm tracing back to yard estates
In my home, where I didn't know where to go
Oh, I just didn't know where to go

No, we don't talk about what happened last night
You kept your secret safe with me, now that's right
Now just forget it, uh (last night)
I'm not a better man, a better man

Didn't know where to go

No, we don't talk about what happened last night
You kept your secret safe with me, now that's right
Now just forget it, uh (last night)
I'm not a better man, a better man (last night)
