		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought we were taking space
Held my heart in a suspended place
Never said that I missed your face
Can love regenerate?

How do you see it?
How?
How do you see it?
How?

Broke your heart into a million men
You're falling back, I'm running way ahead
Do you really want to make your bed?
I don't really want to wake up yet

I don't really want to make up yet
Could you be the one to make amends?
I don't really want to make a bet
I know you're hurting, but I swear it's for the
It's for the best

How do you see it?
How?
How do you see it?
How?

How do you see it?
How do you see it?
How?

I thought we were taking space
Get your love to regenerate
I thought we were taking space
Get your heart to repopulate

How do you see it? (I thought we were taking space)
How do you see it? (I thought we were taking space)
How?
