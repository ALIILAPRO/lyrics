		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My body was sacred (me)
My words were sacred
My time was sacred
(Together we stand)
The property I owned was sacred
And these inviolable sanctity were preserved in those words

We don't sleep, always good to go
Where we stand
You shall know, what you reap
Never let it go, hold my hand
Help me, so buried deep
We're about to grow, underground
We stay low
I can feel, we're about to blow
Tomorrow, tomorrow

A million grains of sand
Together we stand
A million grains of sand
Looking for a land

You are afraid, years ago
All I saw, and it's glow
All our fate, our will to grow
To keep our souls, write our song
The nights we shared, there's something true
Almost lost, so stay on low
But here's to fate, without you

You shall know, you shall know
You shall know, you shall know
You shall know, you shall know
You shall know, you shall know
You shall know, you shall know

My body was sacred
My words were sacred
My time was sacred
(Together we stand)
The property I owned was sacred
And these inviolable sanctity were preserved in those words
