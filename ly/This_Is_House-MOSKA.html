		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They know what is house
But, they don't know what is house
Everybody shout
This is house

They know what is house
But, they don't know what is house
Everybody shout
This is house

They know what is house
But, they don't know what is house
Everybody shout
This is house

They know what is house
But, they don't know what is house
Everybody shout
This is 
This is 
This is 

They know what they
They know what they
They know what they
They know what they
They know what they
They know what they
They know what they

They know
They know what they
They know what they
They know what they
They know 
They know 
They know what is
This is house

They know what they
They know what they
They know what is
They know what they
They know what they
This is house
They know what they
This is
This is

They know

They know what they know

This is
This is
This is
This is

They know what is
Know what is
Know what is
Know what is
They know what is
Know what is
Know what is
Know what is

They know what is house
But, they don't know what is house
Everybody shout
This is
This is
This is

They know
They know
They know
They know
This is
This is

They know what is
This is house
They know what is
This is house
This is
This is
