		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We built a house made of sand
It didn't stay the way we planned
We planted seeds in the ground
But never saw the coming drought

We fought, we fought, we fought, we fought against it
But something in the core of us could sense it
We tried to tame the changes, tried to mend it
But nothing in our power could prevent it

Let it go, let it go
No amount of control
Can change what we don't know
Let it go

We fell apart to grow again
We can't replace the things we miss
But we can build from where we stand
Don't you know, it's out of your hands

Let it go, let it go
No amount of control
Can change what we don't know

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go
