		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
I promise you, like, a million tomorrows
Here's the deal, what I can promise
Is I'll lie down like a bed of wildflowers
And I'll always make the sheets
Smell like gardenias wild at your feet
And I nourish you hazily
Baby, I, I, I

I've been runnin' on stardust
Alone for so long
I wouldn't know what hot fire was
Hot fire, hot weather
Hot coffee, I'm better with you
It's strange, but it's true, darling

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that burns
Baby, I'll be like a wildflower
I live on sheer will power
I'll do my best never to turn
Into something that burns, burns, burns
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
You say there's gaps to fill in, so here
Here's the deal
My father never stepped in when his wife would rage at me
So I ended up awkward but sweet
Later then hospitals, and still on my feet
Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry
And baby, I

I've been running on star drip
IV's for so long
I wouldn't know how cruel the world was
Hot fire, hot weather
Hot coffee, I'm better
So I turn, but I learn
It from you, babe

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that hurts
Baby, I run like a wildflower
I live on sheer will power
I promise that nothing will burn you
Nothing will burn, burn, burn
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns
Burn, burn, burn (like the others, baby, like the others, baby, like the others, baby)
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn
It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn
