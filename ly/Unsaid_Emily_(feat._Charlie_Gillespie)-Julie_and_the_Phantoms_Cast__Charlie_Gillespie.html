		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First things first
We start the scene in reverse
All of the lines rehearsed
Disappeared from my mind
When things got loud
One of us running out
I should've turned around
But I had too much pride

No time for goodbyes
Didn't get to apologize
Pieces of a clock that lies broken

If I could take us back, if I could just do that
And write in every empty space the words "I love you" in replace
Then maybe time would not erase me
If you could only know I never let you go
And the words I most regret
Are the ones I never meant to leave
Unsaid Emily

Silent days, mysteries and mistakes
Who'd be the first to break?
I guess we're alike that way
He said, she said conversations in my head
And that's just where they're gonna stay forever

If I could take us back, if I could just do that
And write in every empty space the words "I love you" in replace
Then maybe time would not erase me
If you could only know I never let you go
And the words I most regret
Are the ones I never meant to leave
Unsaid Emily

If I could take us back, if I could just do that
And write in every empty space the words "I love you" in replace
Then maybe time would not erase me
If you could only know I never let you go
And the words I most regret
Are the ones I never meant to leave
Unsaid Emily
