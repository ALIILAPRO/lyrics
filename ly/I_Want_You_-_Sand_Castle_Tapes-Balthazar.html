		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me and my baby are doing fine (do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do)
Me and my baby a real good time (do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do)
That motherfucker should leave 
That motherfucker should leave (do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
He doesn't get any action this time (do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

Everyone here thinks that they will make it
Everyone here thinks they'll see you naked
Can't they see I am the one for you
Why don't we? Baby, come on

Me and my baby we have a party (do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
And when she whispers she calls me Marty (do-do-do-do)
And I like that (do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
But she doesn't pick up her phone 
Why don't you pick up your phone? (do-do-do-do)
Oh, c'mon now (do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Me and my baby supposed to party (do-do-do-do)
How about that? (do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

Everyone here thinks that they will make it
Everyone here thinks they'll see you naked
Can't they see I am the one for you
Why don't we? Baby, come on

I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad

I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
I want you, I want you bad
