		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost
All is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost, all is not lost

Waiting for a sign washed up on the shoreline
I'll always carry the cross, but all is not lost
I just can't relate a crack in the floodgate
Life comes at a cost, but all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins?
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever

Taking back what's mine, but it's lost to the skyline
A bridge I cannot cross, but all is not lost
Now there's no escape; God, what a sorry state
Love comes at a cost, but all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins?
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever

Can you feel the empty space?
Can you feel the fire at the gates?
Can you live a life worth dying for?
Can you feel the empty space?
Can you feel the fire at the gates?
Can you live a life worth dying for?
Can you feel the empty space?
Can you feel the fire at the gates?
Can you live a life worth dying for?

Is this penance for my sins?
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy Ghost, nothing lasts forever
