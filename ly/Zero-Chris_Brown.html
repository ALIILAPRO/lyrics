		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran this off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that

Now you're missin' what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feelin' back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you, zero, zero
Gave a hunnid percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one (hey), then you turn and run (hey)
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give, ooh

Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good, better than you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood

Now you're missin' what we used to have
You've been creepin' 'round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you, zero, zero
Gave a hunnid percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one (hey), then you turn and run (hey)
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give

Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds
Zeros, zeros
Callin' me up 'cause your bad cheque bounced
My new chick one hunnid, and she got her own dinero
Zero
You think I'm thinkin' 'bout your ass?

Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you, zero, zero
Gave a hunnid percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one (hey), then you turn and run (oh-ooh)
Found somebody better, like I never met ya (you, yeah)
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give
