		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby when we are together
Doing things that we love
Every time your near I feel like I'm in heaven
Feeling high
I don't want to let go girl
I just need you to know girl

I don't wanna run away
Baby,your the one I need tonight
No promises
Baby, now I need to hold you tight
I just wanna die in your arms
Hear tonight

Hey baby when we are together
Doing things that we love
Every time your near I feel like I'm in heaven
Feeling high
I don't want to let go girl
I just need you to know girl

I don't wanna run away
Baby,your the one I need tonight
No promises
Baby,now I need to hold you tight
I just wanna die in your arms

I don't want to run away
Wanna stay forever,Eternity
No promises

I don't wanna run away
I don't wanna be alone
No promises
Baby,now I need to hold you tight
Now and forever my love
No promises

I don't wanna run away
Baby,your the one I need tonight
No promises
Baby,now I need to hold you tight
I just want to die in your arms,(here tonight)
I don't wanna run away
Baby, your the one I need tonight
No promises
Baby, now I need to hold you tight
I just wanna die in your arms
Here tonight
