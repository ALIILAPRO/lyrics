		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I give up the seat I've been saving
To some elderly lady or man
Am I being a good boy?
Am I your pride and joy?

Mother, please, if you're pleased, say I am
And if while in the course of my duty
I perform an unfortunate take
Would you punish me so, unbelievably so?
Never again will I make that mistake

This feeling inside me could never deny me
The right to be wrong if I choose
And this pleasure I get
From, say, winning a bet
Is to lose

When I'm drinking my Bonaparte Shandy
Eating more than enough apple pies
Will I glance at my screen and see real human beings
Starve to death
Right in front of my eyes?

Nothing old, nothing new
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Nothing still-born or lost
Nothing further than proof, nothing wilder than youth
Nothing older than time, nothing sweeter than wine
Nothing physically, recklessly, hopelessly blind
Nothing I couldn't say
Nothing; why? 'Cause today
Nothing rhymed
