		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know why I keep moving my body
I don't know if this is wrong or if it's right
I don't know if there's a beat, or something's taking over me
And I just know I'll feel so good tonight

I don't know what your name is but I like it
I've been thinking 'bout some things I wanna try
I don't know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you
And I just know I'll feel so good tonight

Oh, if we keep on dancing
Take our rhythm to new heights
Feel the heat of passion, baby
Light up the night

We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire

I just know I feel so good
Don't you know I feel so good
I just know I feel so good
Tonight

I don't care if this tuns into a riot
Lets get reckless, tear this place down to the floor
Turn the music way up loud
Can't nobody stop us now
I just know I feel so good tonight
I just know I feel so good tonight

We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire

I just know I feel so good
Don't you know I feel so good
Don't you know, don't you know?
Tonight
