		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain the way it feels
You say, "Live in the present"
I'm already dreaming of how it begins
And trying to savor the moment
But I know the feeling will come to an end

So I crave
Crave to do it again, all again
Crave, crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again, all again

I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry was being alive
Look up and see a reflection of someone
Who never gave way to the pain
What if I told 'em that now that I'm older
There isn't a moment that I'd wanna change

Now I crave
Crave to do it again, all again
Crave, crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again, all again

Any second feel the present
Future and the past connecting
(Past connecting, past connecting)

Any second feel the present
Future and the past connecting
(Past connecting, past connecting)

Crave, crave to do it again, all again (do it all again)
Crave, crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again, all again
