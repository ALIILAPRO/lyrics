		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must try to keep my focus
I know that there is much for me to do
Try to remember what it is I came for
Keep my hopefulness for a different view

I must try to keep my focus, and I know
I must try to keep my head together
I might not be there when you need me but
I must try to keep my head down

Chasing dreams can make you lose your way
Chasing love can make your soul fade
I don't want to push you all away
There is something I must do I know

I must try to keep my focus, and I know
I must try to keep my head together
I might not be there when you need me but
I must try to keep my head down

Chasing dreams can make you lose your way
Sit by me and just enjoy the day

I must try to keep my focus, and I know
I must try to keep my head together
I might not be there when you need me but
I must try to keep my head down
