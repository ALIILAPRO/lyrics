		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please, curtains in, start us off
You swing first, sorry
I don't know what I said
But you're crying now again
And that only makes it worse

Let me do my job
Let me do my job

Sylvia, get your head out of the oven
Go back to screaming and cursing
Remind me again how everyone betrayed you
Sylvia, get your head out of the covers
Let me take your temperature
You can throw the thermometer right back at me
If that's what you want to do, okay?

Please, please calm down
Steady out, I'm terrified
Sorry, I want us to ally
But you swing on little knives
They're only sharp on one side

Let me do my job
Let me do my job

Sylvia, get your head out of the oven
Go back to screaming and cursing
Remind me again how everyone betrayed you
Sylvia, get your head out of the covers
Let me take your temperature
You can throw the thermometer right back at me
If that's what you want to do, okay?

Sylvia, can't you see what you are doing?
Can't you see I'm scared to speak
And I hate my voice because it only makes you angry

Sylvia, I only talk when you are sleeping
That's when I tell you everything
And I imagine that somehow you're going to hear me
