		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my love, oh, yeah, yeah
I'm in love, yeah

I replayed this moment for months
Alone in my head waitin' for it to come
I wrote all your lines in the script in my mind
And I'd hoped that you'd follow it for once

I imagined myself in satin, the room was platinum and gold
I'd dance and catch your eye, you'd be mesmerized, oh
We'd find a corner there, your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so why
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night? No
Don't go yet

Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

Baby, don't go yet 'cause I wore this dress for a little drama
And I bet, I bet that you think that you know, but you don't, baby, come to mama
I get, I get what I want when I want, and I get it how I wanna-wanna
And I want you, baby, gotta get you, baby

We'd find a corner there, your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so why
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night, no
Don't go yet

Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

Dámelo
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (don't go yet)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (don't go yet)

(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet)
(No te vayas, quédate) dale
(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) ahora voy yo
(No te vayas, quédate)
(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) stay a little longer
(No te vayas, quédate) know you really wanna
(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) stay a little longer
(No te vayas, quédate) oh

Oh, yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet (oh)
Oh, yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet (oh, don't go yet)
Oh, yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet (oh)
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Yours, yours
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet
