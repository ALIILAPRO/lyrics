		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We aligned to traverse the worlds
That kept us apart
We became the eye of the storm
And held on like never before
I felt the tremors
The moment we got here
A riling nightmare
Sooner or later
The Nothing will take us
Then we remembered how to dream
And I whispered 'Now ride like the wind'
Then a star appeared up ahead
You turned to me and you said
'You and I belong to another world
A shelter from this desolation
Where we'll never wake up
Can you imagine us under golden skies
A place where we can make-believe in
Something more than fiction'
Don't open your eyes
All we need is a wish
To take us away from here
Not a moment too late
We began to flicker and fade
And left behind nothing but dust
Now I don't remember
The way that we got here
Left all our memories to die
Sooner or later
The void became greater
Then we remembered everything
And you promised me this wasn't the end
When the stars fell down from the sky
I held you close and I cried
'You and I belong to another world
A shelter from this desolation
Where we'll never wake up'
Then you remind me there's so much more to find
A place where we can make believe in
Something more than fiction
'You and I belong to another world
A shelter from this desolation
Where we'll never wake up
Can you imagine us under golden skies
A place where we can make-believe in
Something more than fiction'
