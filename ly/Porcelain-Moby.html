		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)
(Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)

In my dreams I'm dying all the time
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to lie
So this is goodbye?
This is goodbye

(Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)
(Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)

Tell the truth, you've never wanted me
Tell me

In my dreams I'm jealous all the time
When I wake, I'm going out of my mind
Going out of my mind

(Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)
(Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)
(Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)
(Hey, hey, hey, woman, it's alright)
