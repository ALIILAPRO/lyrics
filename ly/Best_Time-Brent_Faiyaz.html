		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been all over the world (you know)
Thought that you the finest one
I done seen the finest dimes
But all the pretty girls come from VA (that's right)
Then it's New York and M-I-A
Then, it's PG you're 'round my way
So I never had to stay away (should've never stayed away)
For long
Say you're goin' where?
Ain't nobody goin' if we ain't gon' be there
Keep her on your arm 'cause she gon' wanna stare
All the pretty girls wanna be gay (I'm sorry)
Fuck around and find out
She like one of mine, now she mine now
You just turn around and she gone now (should've never stayed away)
For long (for long)

Be the best time she's ever had (time)
Be the best time she's ever had (yeah)
Be the best time she's ever had (the best time, all the time)
The best time she's ever had
The best time she's ever had (yeah)
Be the best time she's ever had (all the time, you know)
