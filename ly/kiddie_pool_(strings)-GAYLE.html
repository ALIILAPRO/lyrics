		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my, "Leave you before you leave me"
Type of mentality
So for your every excuse
You know I got two more
I hate being needy, need you to need me
Want you to want me
Without me telling you to
But what can I do?

I'll throw it all away if you ask me to
All you gotta say is you'll do it too
Deep down, all I want is you

Don't want kiddie pools, I'm a fool, I want oceans
On my tippy-toes, hold your nose, fuck your floaties
Call it what you want
But I'ma call it love
Don't want kiddie pools, I'm a fool, I want oceans
On my tippy toes, hold your nose, fuck your floaties
Call it what you want
But I'ma call it love

Don't mean to be a hypocrite but you should make a choice quick
'Cause gettin' you to commit is like chasin' wind
I'm tired, out of breath
Good thing I'm persistent, oh

I'll throw it all away if you ask me to
All you gotta say is you'll do it too
Deep down, all I want is you

Don't want kiddie pools, I'm a fool, I want oceans
On my tippy-toes, hold your nose, fuck your floaties
Call it what you want
But I'ma call it love
Don't want kiddie pools, I'm a fool, I want oceans
On my tippy toes, hold your nose, fuck your floaties
Call it what you want
But I'ma call it love

Love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Love
