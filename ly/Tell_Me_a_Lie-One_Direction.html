		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried
Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired
As you break my heart again this time

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and
Tell me a lie

Well, you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time
And well there must have been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind
As you take what's left of you and I

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and
Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me your what you think and
Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie
