		<p>
		  It feels so good
It feels so good
And right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

I never was very good
I haven't been so good
But right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

And I don't need anything other than you.
