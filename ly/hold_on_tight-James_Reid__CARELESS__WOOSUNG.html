		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you kiss me
Baby I can't recognize 
My reflection in your eyes
Who are we kidding
You say you want this life
But you blame me every night

When this feeling takes me over
I feel it pulling me away from you
As long you're here
The mission is clear
We're almost there

Hold on tight
I know we can make it thru the night
I need you to bring me back to the light
If we make it to the other side
I'm yours 

Hold on tight
I know we can make it thru the night
I need you to bring me back to the light
If we make it to the other side
I'm yours 
You're mine

I see you
Won't give in I need you
I don't wanna lose this time
Love is always on our side
I'm phasing
I feel accelerated
Going into hyper light
Stay by my side

When this feeling takes me over
I feel it pulling me away from you
As long you're here
The mission is clear
We're almost there

Hold on tight
I know we can make it thru the night
I need you to bring me back to the light
If we make it to the other side
I'm yours 

Hold on tight
I know we can make it thru the night
I need you to bring me back to the light
If we make it to the other side
I'm yours 
You're mine
