		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mm

She told me that I'm not enough (yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it
No, you said it
No, you said it
We'd be together, oh

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try and brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin', yeah

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, uh, ayy, ayy
