		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My hands, your hands
Tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless
Waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?

My heart, your heart
Sit tight like book ends
Pages between us
Written with no end
So many words we're not sayin'
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?

Think of how much
Love that's been wasted
People always
Tryin' to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breakin'
But there's nothin' I'm runnin' from
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from fallin' apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
