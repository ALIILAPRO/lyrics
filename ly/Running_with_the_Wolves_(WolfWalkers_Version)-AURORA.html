		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go row the boat to safer grounds
But don't you know we're stronger now
My heart still beats and my skin still feels
My lungs still breathe, my mind still fears

But we're running out of time (time)
Oh, all the echoes in my mind cry
There's blood on your lies
The sky's open wide
There is nowhere for you to hide
The hunter's moon is shining

I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the

Trick or treat, what would it be?
I walk alone, I'm everything
My ears can hear and my mouth can speak
My spirit talks, I know my soul believes

But we're running out of time 
Oh, all the echoes in my mind cry
There's blood on your lies
The sky's open wide
There is nowhere for you to hide
The hunter's moon is shining

I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves

A gift, curse, they track and hurt
Say you can dream
In nightmares seems
A million voices, silent screams
Where hope is left so incomplete

I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the
I'm running with the
I'm running with the
I'm running with the wolves

I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves

I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
