		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who the hell said any of you get a taste stupid?
Do you ever wanna get up all in your face?
You better take it
And nothin' you can do could make me ever go away
Fake it
Poor baby I'm gonna make it all OK

[Chorus]
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causin' problems makes you famous
All the violence makes a statement
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causin' problems makes you famous
All this violence makes a statement

She better get with the club

Who the hell said any of you get a taste stupid?
Do you ever wanna get up all in your face?
You better take it
And nothin' you can do could make me ever go away
Fake it
Poor baby I'm gonna make it all OK

[Chorus]

All this violence makes a statement

Punch your lights out
That's what I call entertainment
Punch your lights out

[Chorus]

All this violence makes a statement
