		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church
Where the wedding has been lives in a dream
Wait's at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in
A jar by the door who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father Mackenziе
Writing the words of a sermon
That no one will hеar no one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night
When there's nobody there what does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

All the lonely people (All the lonely people)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people)

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was
Buried along with her name nobody came
Father Mackenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as
He walks from the grave no one was saved

All the lonely people all the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
