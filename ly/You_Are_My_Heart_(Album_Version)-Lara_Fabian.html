		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did I ever get to here
Why do I need you
Why do I have to cry these tears
Where do they lead to
I used to be so strong alone
When I was standing on my own
Now I don't know what to do

Was I too proud or just too blind
What does it matter
When love was in these hands of mine
I let it shatter
The pieces scattered to the wind
I'll never have them here again
But I'll remember how we were
The rest of time

You are my heart
How could I ever let you go
You are my soul
I had to lose my should to know
How much you mean
To me, you are my heart

I think I see you everywhere
Isn't that crazy
I still reach out to feel you there
Lying beside me
I've learned a lot since you've been gone
About what I am and what I want
I know I only want to be in love with you

You are my heart
How could I ever let you go
You are my soul
I had to lose my should to know
How much you mean
To me, you are my heart

There's the sun to light the day
My colors turned to gray
The day I saw you walk away
Now there's nothing left to say
But when I dream, I pray
That life could be like yesterday

You are my heart
How could I ever let you go
You are my soul
I had to lose my should to know
How much you mean
To me, you are my heart
