		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's bad for me, but it's what I crave
And I'm not proud of it, wish I could change

See, I keep falling in and out of the same mistakes
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
When you keep throwing me out and taking me back again
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

What do you do when love is not enough?
With every touch it hits you like a drug (hits you like a drug)
What do you do when love is not enough?
You hold on when you know you should give up (know you should give up)
'Cause I'm not strong enough to say goodbye tonight
So give me one more kiss even if this ain't right

(You're not good, no, you're not good)

You're not good for me, no, you're not safe
And that's what's tempting me, is in the chase

See, I keep falling in and out of the same mistakes
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
When you keep throwing me out and taking me back again
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

What do you do (what do you do?), when love is not enough? (Enough)
With every touch it hits you like a drug (hits you like a drug)
What do you do when love is not enough?
You hold on when you know you should give up (know you should give up)
'Cause I'm not strong enough to say goodbye tonight
So give (so give) me one more kiss even if this ain't right

And I've been fading
And my heart's been racing
And even though it feels like I'm okay
I know I need to find another way
So why do we?

What do you do (what do you do?), when love is not enough?
With every touch it hits you like a drug (hits you like a drug)
What do you do when love is not enough?
You hold on when you know you should give up (know you should give up)
'Cause I'm not strong enough to say goodbye tonight
So give me one more kiss (one more kiss)
Even if this ain't right
