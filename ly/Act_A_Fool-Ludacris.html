		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, man
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
Oh, I'm too fast for y'all, man

Ah, you just came home from doin' a bid
Tell me what you gon' do? Act a fool
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy what you gon' do? Act a fool
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me what you gon' do? Act a fool
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, what you gon' do? Act a fool

Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 911, please call the doctor
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody want a piece, we gon' split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You 'bout to catch a cold, stay the fuck from 'round me
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout "what kinda shits he on?"
You'll disappear like "poof, bitch be gone"
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain in the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?

Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me what you gon' do? Act a fool
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, what you gon' do? Act a fool
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me what you gon' do? Act a fool
If you 'bout to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, what you gon' do? Act a fool

Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With my pedal to the floor, radar in the grille
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so f what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And for the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun

You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man, what you gon' do? Act a fool
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say what you gon' do? Act a fool
Now them girls up the block still runnin' they mouth
Boy, what you gon' do? Act a fool
If anybody talk bad 'bout the dirty south
Tell what I'm gon' do? Act a fool

I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
On the off-ramp doin' 'bout a hunnid and fifty
Rollin' through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with a barbecue pit
And now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and v's that's fantastic
So girls hold your weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and tear the road apart
You'll be like lil' John Q and get a change of heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm 'bout to blow this whole shit up to smithereens

The pot holes in the street just bent ya rims
Tell me what you gon' do? Act a fool
Man, that ain't sticky, that's sticks and stems
Boy, what you gon' do? Act a fool
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, what you gon' do? Act a fool
If the bottles all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, what you gon' do? Act a fool

2 Fast (2 Fast)
2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast
Act a fool

2 Fast (2 Fast)
2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast
Act a fool (woo)

2 Fast (2 Fast)
2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast (2)
Act a fool

2 Fast (2 Fast)
2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast
Act a-
