		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will wait for you
'Til the sun turns into ashes
And bows down to the moon
I will wait for you

It's a long hard war
Ah, but I can grin and bear it
'Cause I know what the hell I'm fighting for
And I will wait for you

We were never made to run forever
We were just meant to go long enough
To find what we were chasing after
I believe I found it here in your love 

I will stand my ground
I'm a bad man looking for takers 
You're the finest thing around
So I will stand my ground 

'Cause it's cold out there
And you know some men search for ages
For the love that I have found 
So I will stand my ground 

We were never made to run forever
We were just meant to go long enough
To find what we were chasing after
I believe I found it here in your love 

Honey, I will wait for you
Honey, I will stand my ground

I will work for you
'Til my hands are tired and bleedin'
I know what it is from us I'm needin'
I will work for you

Like a team of mules
Pulling Hell off from its hinges
It's the love that I'll keep tendin' 
I will work for you

We were never made to run forever
We were just meant to go long enough
To find what we were chasing after
I believe I found it here in your love 

Honey, I will wait for you
Honey, I will stand my ground
I will work for you 
I will stand my ground
