		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to my problems
It's not an invitation
This is my dilemma
And it's my obsession

I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't want to be a dead man walking
I don't want to be a dead man walking

Welcome to my nightmare
Where dreams go to disappear
Sit around in rehab
Feeling like a lab rat
Strange days are here again
And it's getting weirder
Here's to all my problems
I just want to drink a poison

I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't want to be a dead man walking
I don't want to be a dead man walking
I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't want to be a dead man walking
I don't want to be a dead man walking

Whoa, I, when I fall asleep tonight
On the wing and prayer, oh why?
For despair and obsession on you?
Ooh-ooh, yeah

I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't want to be a dead man walking
I don't want to be a dead man walking
I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't want to be a dead man walking
I don't want to be a dead man walking
