		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were talking to her
But messing with me
It's finally clear
You're blurring the lines

Are you disturbed?
Oh, now you care
Why do you race
Through my red lights?

Can't understand
I'll slow it down for you

Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe
Baby, tell me how
How you love me now

Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe
I hate when you say
How you love me now

Save, save it for her
I'm not gonna hear
Your reasons and
Please, just take me backs

We never were right
Don't waste your breath
You crashed and you're
On your own tonight

Can't understand
I'll slow it down for you

Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe
Baby, tell me how
How you love me now

Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe
I hate when you say
How you love me now

Lights out, I found out
My falling star
Goodbye, the sun rises here
There's no more you and I

Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe
Baby, tell me how
How you love me now

Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe
I hate when you say
How you love me now
How you love me now
How you love me now
