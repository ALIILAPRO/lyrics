		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try to hide it through the silence while I played along
I'm welling up behind my eyelids when I'm holding on
To the reigns, so badly I hate it
And I wish that all of-
Nah, nah, nah, that doesn't feel right
Maybe, uh, speed it up
Yeah, that's nice

I really hate the way you think that you can get away
By blaming all your stupid problems on your mental state
I'm tired of burnt-out lies, oh
Ooh
You think you know me, but you hardly even know yourself
I'd bite my tongue and let you think I only wish you well
I don't, I know you know it
Ooh

And I'm tired of letting someone get the best of me, so go ahead and-

Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else, so I can sleep at night

Mmm, you're more narcissistic than anybody in Hollywood
You're not a misfit, don't keep sayin' you're misunderstood
I'm tired, oh, I'm so tired, oh
Ooh
And maybe you're the honest type
And it's been me the whole damn time
I should really try to calm my mind and see things from your side
Or, maybe you can

Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else, so I can sleep at night

Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone else's life
Cry, cry
And I'm tired of letting someone get the best of me, so go ahead and-

Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone else's-
