		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Mmm, ayy
Big stepper like Big Meech, mm-hmm
I was taught to go and get it straight up out the mud, lil' nigga
Murder, murder, murder, keep my slugs my nigga, ayy
I was told to never show no love, my nigga
Pop a Xanax, I ain't never had no feelings
What I got planned next? Gotta put the stars in the ceilings
Slidin' down Fairfax, nigga, I was plottin' on the million
I want a billion, nigga, so that's on God I ain't chillin'

Yeah, ha-ha, Perky, Perky, dirty soda
Ayy, only talk bags on the Motorola
Ayy, push the Hellcat like an old Corolla
Ayy, I'ma let these racks talk for me nigga
Bitch, and I ride with the shooters, ayy
Made my cousin a killer
And at fifteen, I was neighborhood drug dealer
I'm so cold hearted, I can't show no love, nigga
But I fuck that bitch to PARTYNEXTDOOR, "Persian Rugs", nigga, uh
Bought a brand new AP, it was fifty thousand total
It feel like the Flu Game, when I sold out the Novo
I had to finesse and get the bag, I had mad dough though
If he ain't tryna go get the safe, I get it crackin' solo

Mmm, ayy
Big stepper like Big Meech, mm-hmm
I was taught to go and get it straight up out the mud, lil' nigga
Murder, murder, murder, keep my slugs my nigga, ayy
I was told to never show no love, my nigga
Pop a Xanax, I ain't never had no feelings
What I got planned next? Gotta put the stars in the ceilings
Slidin' down Fairfax, nigga, I was plottin' on the million
I want a billion, nigga, so that's on God I ain't chillin'

Bird vision, Bandcamp
Had a bad bitch put a hundred thousand in her spandex
The hundred that made me a million, I got it laminated
Can't fuck with none of these broke niggas, they contaminated
Thank God for all of these blue faces, I barely done made it
Made forty thousand on New Year's, took a private to Vegas
I been on Promethazine so long, when I'm slidin' I'm faded
I been tryin' to get a crib so long, now I got it, it's gated
I been touchin' all of these millions, I know they gon' hate it
My chef cook up filet mignon, got sauced and then ate it
Nigga, I been ballin' every season like Kobe with eight, yeah
All these niggas gon' hate
I stayed down and got rich, now I'm fuckin' on his lil' bae

Mmm, ayy
Big stepper like Big Meech, mm-hmm
I was taught to go and get it straight up out the mud, lil' nigga
Murder, murder, murder, keep my slugs my nigga, ayy
I was told to never show no love, my nigga
Pop a Xanax, I ain't never had no feelings
What I got planned next? Gotta put the stars in the ceilings
Slidin' down Fairfax, nigga, I was plottin' on the million
I want a billion, nigga, so that's on God I ain't chillin'
