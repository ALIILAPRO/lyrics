		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a neverender on the rise
You're a chain that I will break in time
And as our silhouettes combine
I've seen how far yours grows from mine

'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)

I'm just a pretender for your kind
Patiently evading your designs
It's not that I am always right
But when we settle, I wonder why

Why you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)

Lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up

'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
'Cause you're always bringing me down (lift me up, lift me up)
