		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
I'm tryna catch me something
A little jux or something

Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money, make money, money, money
Nigga, if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money, money, money

You wan' spray at me? Go 'head, the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your mama in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new SIG and that old .38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching dreads serve skunk through the hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch, please
This the stash house, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek of marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah, nigga, yeah

Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money, make money, money, money
Nigga, if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money, money, money

Who's that peeping in my window, wow, the Feds on me now
They know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming, "Fuck Jake"
I'm tryna stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA, now that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two MACs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew, I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take, the more paper we see
Change my name in NY, they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low-key

Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money, make money, money, money
Nigga, if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money, money, money
