		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a ride fighting through life
Hard to come by some kindness
Trying to hide all that's inside
Making walls of your silence

And I know there's something going on
Though you don't ever let me in
I'd give you all my soul
Just for you to know

Your tears are mine
And it's a new world tonight
Say my name and I will fly
Over to you gunning for time
I promise you that it will be all right
Just please hold on

I'd like to love you true
With all of your scars
Wish I could care for a little
Piece of your heart

If you'd like to tell me
How your story began
I'm sitting right here waiting
And no you're not alone anymore

Your tears are mine
And it's a new world tonight
Say my name and I will fly
Over to you gunning for time
I promise you that it will be all right
Just please hold on

I'll be right here and there's nothing to hide
Everyone needs understanding sometimes
You're beautiful even when you feel broken

I'm right by you, we'll make it through
I'll stay with you till the dark fades

Your tears are mine
It's a new world tonight
Say my name and I will fly
Over to you gunning for time
I promise you that I'll be by your side
Through the fight
Everything's gonna be fine
Just please hold on tight
