		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three, one, two, three)

Castle on a hill
Let's build it out of steel
Girl, I know that this love it will last
Let's journey up the road
Ain't gotta take it slow
You know that I don't want no one else

I put my pride aside
I traded this whole life
Just for one night
Just for one night
Yeah

It's like Heaven (ooh-ooh, ooh)
Feels like Heaven
When I'm with you
It's like Heaven (ooh-ooh, ooh)
It feels like Heaven
When I'm with you

It's more than a thrill
I'm following what's real
And don't get mad when they don't understand
Love you like the time
Pull you close at night
And I won't let all these waves knock us down

I put my pride aside
I traded this whole life
Just for one night
Just for one night
Yeah

Yeah
It's like Heaven (ooh-ooh, ooh)
Feels like Heaven
When I'm with you
It's like Heaven (ooh-ooh, ooh)
It feels like Heaven
When I'm with you
