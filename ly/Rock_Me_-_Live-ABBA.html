		<p>
		  Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it, now
(Don't stop the rocking, don't stop the rocking
I said don't stop the rocking)

want to be want to be in my baby's arms
Gonna be gonna be
Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
Yours for ever, honey, that's what I
want to be want to be want to be, yeah

Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it, now
(Don't stop the rocking, don't stop the rocking
I said don't stop the rocking)

want to be want to be with the one that I love, love, love
Gonna be gonna be
With you baby every single night
I can teach you how to rock all right
Your sweet lover, honey, that's what I
want to be want to be want to be, yeah

Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it
Rock me (rock me), give me that kick now
Roll me (roll me), show me that trick now
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it
Rock me (rock me), give me that feeling
Roll me (roll me), rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it
