		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yes 
(Uh, this for you girl)

Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile, but
Deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (yes, I did baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (need to do) 
To do to be okay (for me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (would be true)
Me living without you (living without you, yeah) (yeah)
But now it's time for me to make that move ('cause life is crazy)

Uh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin (oh no)
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright (be alright yes)
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? (Oh no)
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at? Ya found light brown hairs on my hat, I'm so caught

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
