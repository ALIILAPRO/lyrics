		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There has been but one true love
In my baby's arms, in my baby's arms
And I got the hands to hold onto them

I get sick of just about everyone
And I hide in my baby's arms
Hide in my baby's arms
'Cause except for her, you know, as I've implied

I will never ever ever be alone
'Cause it's all in my baby's hands
Shiny, shiny secret stones
In my baby's hands
In my baby's hands

I get sick of just about everyone
And I hide in my baby's arms
Shrink myself just like a Tom Thumb
And I hide in my baby's hands
Hide in my baby's hands

'Cause except for her
There just ain't nothing to latch onto
Yeah, yeah, yeah

There has been but one true love
In my baby's arms
In my baby's arms
In my baby's arms
In my baby's arms
In my baby's arms
In my baby's arms
