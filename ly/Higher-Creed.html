		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

So let's go there
Yeah, let's go there
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine

Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
