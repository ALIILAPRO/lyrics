		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just wanna cut my hair, lose myself
Make you sweat
Go out and get messed up
Find myself in your bed
Just wanna cut my hair, little black dress
Can't forget
Just wanna show you
Whatever she do, I can do it better

I've been playing nice, little too long, yeah
Driving on the high road and hit a dead end
I'd tell you, but we just don't talk
I've been having selfish thoughts
I've been working hard while you're six-drinks in
Tossing in the dark, feel you under my skin
Once I start, I just can't stop
I've been having selfish thoughts

There's no right way to say it
Want you so bad, I hate it
Good girls, so overrated
So overrated

Just wanna cut my hair, lose myself
Make you sweat
Go out and get messed up
Find myself in your bed
Just wanna cut my hair, little black dress
Can't forget
Just wanna show you
Whatever she do, I can do it better

Couple years back so sensitive, yeah
Moving like that gets repetitive, yeah
Singing about the same old stupid-ass things
Sad girl bit got a little boring

No right way to say it
Want you so bad, I hate it
Good girls, so overrated
So overrated

Just wanna cut my hair, lose myself
Make you sweat
Go out and get messed up
Find myself in your bed
Just wanna cut my hair, little black dress
Can't forget
Just wanna show you
Whatever she do, I can do it better

Just wanna cut my hair
Just wanna cut my hair
Heard you got a new girl, that ain't fair
Show you how much I care
Just wanna cut my hair
