		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  why you getting distant?
i know that you miss me
the way that you keep switching up
really makes my head spin

i think you’re scared of the flame
but you’re a moth at the end of the day
i know that nobody makes you feel the same
how long you gonna play this game?

cause

you keep pulling me in
now you’re pushing away
we’re magnetic babe
yeah you’ll come again
you keep running away
but i do love the chase
so go away
but you’ll come again

why do you keep pretending
you don’t want a happy ending
the way that you keep switching up
really makes my head spin

don’t you know
one of these days i’ll go cold?
you play with me just like a kid plays with food
it’s so rude
oh i just hate how you

you keep pulling me in
now you’re pushing away
we’re magnetic babe
yeah you’ll come again
you keep running away
but i do love the chase
so go away
but you’ll come again

yeah you’ll come again
you’ll come again

why do you keep pretending
you don’t want a happy ending
the way that you keep switching up
really makes my head spin

you keep pulling me in

now you’re pushing away
we’re magnetic babe
yeah you’ll come again
you keep running away
but i do love the chase
so go away
but you’ll come again

yeah you’ll come again
yeah you’ll come again
yeah you’ll come again
(go, go, go but you’ll come again)
