		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How are you doing?
Where have you been?
I've been practicing this moment for like twenty-somethin' years in my head
It's nice to meet you
That's what I said
You said, "Baby, this is gonna be some movie shit we'll never forget"

Sometimes I re-run those sixteen seasons for the rush

These are the eras of us, a story of love
Stealing the air right from my lungs
Girl of my dreams, forever we're young
Remember it just the way it was
The eras of us

I'm New York City (I'm New York City)
You were L.A. (you were L.A.)
I would fly across the country just to kiss you and be back in a day (oh-oh-oh)
We crashed just as quick as we burned, now someone new get a turn
I don't know you and it hurts (mm-hmm)
I told every one of my friends, you won't get a lyric again
But goddamn, here I fuckin' am

Stuck in the eras of us, a story of love
Stealing the air right from my lungs
Girl of my dreams, forever we're young
Remember it just the way it was
The eras of us

I didn't mean it when I said I was numb
'Cause I'm feeling every feeling cuttin' straight to my guts
But the problem is that I'm just an adrenaline slut
Yeah, I said it, so what?
Lately, I've been swingin' fists and startin' a fight
I've been tryna kill the memory of you in my mind
It's a cross I'm gonna bear until the day that I die
Yeah, I said it

Oh, I miss the eras of us, a story of love
Stealing the air right from our lungs
Girl of my dreams, I fucked it up
We had it all and now it's just

How are you doing?
Where have you been?
I've been practicing this moment, but I never thought I'd see you again
