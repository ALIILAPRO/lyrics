		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long live the king

Alright, that's a hundred thousand voices
Hear 'em screamin' my name
Now they're counting down the seconds till I put you away
Nobody thought it could happen
Said it's psychosomatic
But I was gifted from the start
Now I'm full automatic
Come and see the master plan, watch it carried out (carried out)
Just focus on you while I tally the body count
I find it ironic I'm what you care about (care about)
I'm starting to think I've got you all figured out

So I tell myself to breathe in, breathe out
Let 'em talk shit, let 'em run their mouth
Because right here, right now
All of your sins equal my crown
So tell me can you feel it all around?
Let it sink in, you're never getting out
Because right here, right now
One day everybody will say
Long live the king

I found a tear in the fabric, call me sociopathic
Took the voices in my head, brought 'em straight to the masses
Compulsive more by the day, I'll see it straight to your face
Tried to keep me at a distance, now you can't stay away

You got nothing left to say, still you run your mouth (run your mouth)
I'm not the type to talk, I'm the type that'll cut you out
I find it ironic you just don't get it now (just don't get it now)
I'm starting to think I got you all figured out

So I tell myself to breathe in, breathe out
Let 'em talk shit, let 'em run their mouth
Because right here, right now
All of your sins equal my crown
So tell me can you feel it all around?
Let it sink in, you're never getting out
Because right here, right now
One day everybody will say
Long live the king

Long live the king

Yeah, you already know that everywhere I go
Got all these people saying "Hey look now you made it"
Well welcome to the show
So I tell myself to breathe in, breathe out
Let 'em talk shit, let 'em run their mouth
Long live the king, yeah
