		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm wide awake in a dream
You won't let me fall asleep
Cause I smell your skin on my pillow
I see your face in the dark
Falling like a shooting star
I wish for you out my window
I still feel you lying here with me
I still hear the sound of your heartbeat

Nothing left to say now
Every word is worn out
You and I are almost gone
Fading like a broken song
And if I really listen
I hear you in the distance
Baby all we got left of us
Are echoes of love

Picture perfect memories
On my walls, haunting me
I see your smile and I break down
Feel you far away, so close
I'm holding on, but you let go
You let go

Nothing left to say now
Every word is worn out
You and I are almost gone
Fading like a broken song
And if I really listen
I hear you in the distance
Baby all we got left of us
Are echoes of love
Echoes of love

They go on and on and on and on and on
They go on and on and on and on and on

Nothing left to say now
Every word is worn out
You and I are almost gone
Fading like a broken song
And if I really listen
I hear you in the distance
Baby all we got left of us
Are echoes of love
Echoes of love

Echoes of love
Echoes of love
