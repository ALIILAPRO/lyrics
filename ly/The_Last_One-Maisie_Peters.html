		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're bright and it's blinding
Just a small spark and you're flying
With your wax wings in a back room
Got my arms out, tryin' to catch you
As you're falling through the ceiling
Took a big leap, now you're bleeding
With a broke nose and a dumb smile
Pretty mugshot for your profile

Caught in a streetlight
A lost cause in Levi's
But I'll always see great heights in you

I'll be the last one
I'll be the last one in your corner when the count's done
I'll be the last one
Holding my hands up (hey)
Stood on the bleachers all alone after the crowd's gone
I'll be the last one

If you're the Syd Barrett of the band
I'm the girl on the train tracks holding your hand
Half way to the moon on a plane we couldn't land
But I'll believe you, stay your number one fan, baby
After the crowd's gone, I'll be the last one

You're a dreamer in a parka
Send a flare up in the dark and I'll come find ya
Somewhere downtown with your worst friends on the last round, oh, oh

Caught in a streetlight
A lost cause in Levi's
But I'll always see great heights in you

And I'll be the last one (hey)
I'll be the last one in your corner when the count's done
I'll be the last one
Holding my hands up (hey)
Stood on the bleachers all alone after the crowd's gone
I'll be the last one

If you're the Syd Barrett of the band
I'm the girl on the train tracks holding your hand
Half way to the moon on a plane we couldn't land
But I'll believe you, stay your number one fan, baby
After the crowd's gone, I'll be the last one

When all the flood lights go (oh)
And the sky is filled with smoke (oh)
You're still out there on your own (oh)
And I'm still the last to go

And I'll be the last one
I'll be the last one in your corner when the count's done
I'll be the last one (I'll be the last one)
Holding my hands up (holding my hands up, hey)
Stood on the bleachers all alone after the crowd's gone
I'll be the last one (I'll be the last one)

'Cause if you're the Syd Barrett of the band
I'm the girl on the train tracks holding your hand (holding your hand)
Half way to the moon on a plane we couldn't land (never gonna land)
You would see castles, they would see sand
They're never gonna get it, they'll never understand
But I believe in you, I'm your number one fan
So, after the crowd's gone (after the crowd's gone)
I'll be the last one (I'll be the last one)
