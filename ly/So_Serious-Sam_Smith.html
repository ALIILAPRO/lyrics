		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your hands in the air if you sometimes ever get sad like me
Put your fingers on your chest and your body and breathe, let it be
Don't find it hard to say so, I'll say it, I get lonely (sing it)
Put your hands in the air if you sometimes ever get sad like me

Sad like me
Wait patiently
And you're gonna be free
Wait patiently

I get so serious sometimes, my emotions sittin' on a wire
And I gotta be out my mind, 'cause the second that I'm happy and I'm fine
Suddenly there's violins and movie scenes and
Crying rivers in the streets and
God, I don't know why, I get so serious sometimes

(So serious)
So serious sometimes

I remember last summer in the city making plans and you felt like mine
Look at me and I felt so Hollywood, baby, then you changed your mind
I got so fuckin' close to feeling so good, so satisfied
I remember last summer in the city making plans and you felt like mine

Felt like mine
Then I froze in time
You changed your mind
And I'll never know why

I get so serious sometimes, my emotions sittin' on a wire
And I gotta be out my mind, 'cause the second that I'm happy and I'm fine
Suddenly there's violins and movie scenes and
Crying rivers in the streets and
God, I don't know why, I get so serious

I get so, oh, oh

Violins and movie scenes and
Crying rivers in the streets and
God, I don't know why I get so serious sometimes

(So serious)
(So serious) Sometimes
So serious sometimes
