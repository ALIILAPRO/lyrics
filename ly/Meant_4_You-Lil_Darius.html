		  Lil Darius - Meant 4 You (lyrics)


You got me thinking where you been and where you going and where you at and what you doing when i ain’t with you
You got me wondering who you fucking on who you screwing and who you doing when I ain’t near you
Am i the one you call boo
Am i meant for you
Know I’m wrong for what I do let me put myself in your shoes
Through the rights and through the wrongs i know i'm meant for you
I know i’m meant for you

You said i was fucking off
I was in the studio
Swearing i was with a hoe
Baby i was with the bros
Knowing that i fucked up with my lifestyle that’s just how it goes
Saying you dont give a fuck but your twitter posts it kinda shows
I try not to scare you away
Everytime that you try to leave i try to beg you to stay
Wonder who you running to when you say that you need you a break
From past situations girl that’s just the way that i think

Walking between the lines

You got me thinking where you been and where you going and where you at and what you doing when i ain’t with you
You got me wondering who you fucking on who you screwing and who you doing when I ain’t near you
Am i the one you call boo
Am i meant for you
Know I’m wrong for what I do let me put myself in your shoes
Through the rights and through the wrongs i know i'm meant for you
I know i’m meant for you

You know i’m sorry for the shit that i do
But it aint just me girl you know you fucked up too
That don’t make it right for the shit that i might do
I don't like them other hoes the way that i like you
When we on bad terms you got me wondering what you doing and where you be
Where you going and who you see 
Who beside you when you sleep
I‘m locked in with your momma momma
Girl this shit here do run deep
Block me I’m gon call your sister
Trip out if you try to leave
Money don’t mean nothing
You gon love who you want for free
Just stay solid all that sucker shit be for the weak
You gon tired of this we break up every other week
But i’m meant for you and I know you meant for me

You got me thinking where you been and where you going and where you at and what you doing when i ain’t with you
You got me wondering who you fucking on who you screwing and who you doing when I ain’t near you
Am i the one you call boo
Am i meant for you
Know I’m wrong for what I do let me put myself in your shoes
Through the rights and through the wrongs i know i'm meant for you
I know i’m meant for you
