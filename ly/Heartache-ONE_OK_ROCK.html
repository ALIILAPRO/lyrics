		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So they say that time
Takes away the pain
But I'm still the same, ah
And they say that I will find another you
That can't be true, ah

Why didn't I realize
Why did I tell lies
Yeah, I wish that I could do it again, oh
Turnin' back the time, back when you were mine (all mine)

So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What me meant, what we said that night 
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

So they say that I didn't know 
What I had in my life until it's gone
The truth is that I knew you were the live
We never knew it would end
Oh baby, watching you walk away 
Why didn't I make you stay?
Yeah, wish that I could do it again, oh
Turnin' back the time
Back when you were mine (all mine) yeah

So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What me meant, what we said that night 
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

It's so hard to forget
Getting worse as the pain goes by
Yeah, so hard to forget
What do I do in all of this life?
You and all the regret
I tried and hide the pain with nothing
I'll never be alive with no more you and I 
I can't forget the look in your eyes

So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What me meant, what we said that night 
Why did I let you go?
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
