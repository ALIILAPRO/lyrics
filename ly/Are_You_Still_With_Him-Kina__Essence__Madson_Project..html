		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm not the best, but I will change
I made many mistakes I regret
Trying to be the perfect one for you
But it seems that you aren't ready to

Can I still try? Or am I to give back?
Or I should try hard?

Throwing myself into this darkness
I've been so fucked up in my own head
Trying to face all my fears

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know

Throwing myself into this darkness
I've been so fucked up in my own head
Trying to face all my fears

I know I'm not the best, but I will change
I made many mistakes I regret
Trying to be the perfect one for you
But it seems that you aren't ready to

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know

Reach into my soul, come where you belong
Are you still with him? I don't wanna know
