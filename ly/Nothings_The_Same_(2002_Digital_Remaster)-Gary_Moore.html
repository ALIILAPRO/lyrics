		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another time, another place. 
The lonely streets where we embraced. 
Then you would go without a trace. 
Nothing's the same without you. 
Another day goes passing by. 
I sit alone and wonder why. 
Sometimes it's hard, but I will try 
to live my life without you. 
You're in my heart, you're in my dreams. 
You're everywhere or so it seems. 
So many times I've heard that song. 
Hold back the tears, pretend you're strong. 
Another day goes slowly by. 
I sit alone and wonder why. 
I think of you, I start to cry. 
Nothing's the same without you. 
Another time, another place. 
The sweetness of our last embrace. 
What would I give to see your face. 
Nothing's the same without you. 
Nothing's the same, 
nothing's the same, 
nothing's the same without you.
