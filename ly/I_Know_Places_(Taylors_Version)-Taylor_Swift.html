		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I, I

You stand with your hand on my waist line (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
I can hear them whisper as we pass by (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
It's a bad sign, bad sign (I, I)
Something happens when everybody finds out (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
See the vulture circling dark clouds (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
It could burn out (I, I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, not this time (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I, I)
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I, I)
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places

(I) they take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
(I) and you know for me it's always you
I know places
(I) in the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
(I) and I know for you, it's always me
I know places

(I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
(I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I)
