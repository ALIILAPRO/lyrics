		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes my thinking gets away from me
Sometimes I look into the grain
I see you standing in the background or the corner
Sometimes I think we all want to be seen

These places used to be so familiar
Now I look for you in the dark
Every time I take a picture
Oh, you capture my heart

And it's a long dark hall, it's a mirror
It's a window, it's a lake
And if you ever wanna tell me anything in whispers
If it's what you need, then I will always look away

These places used to be so familiar
Now I look for you in the dark
Every time I take a picture
Oh, you capture my heart

Every time I take a picture
Oh, you capture my heart
Every time I take a picture
Oh, you capture my heart
