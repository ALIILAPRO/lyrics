		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The midnight darkness in her eyes (ohh)
A thousand voices shattered through the night
Seconds only pass you by
A thousand reasons for me to turn off your lights

You're violet crazy (hey, hey)
It's what I'm meant to be
There was no silence, baby
Between you and me, oh
And it drives me crazy (hey, hey)
Is this meant to be?
I've been so tired lately
Will you set me free? Yeah

Oh, we'll dance until we say goodbye (hey, hey)
A thousand miles between, there are only blue, blue skies
Tell me where we are in a fallen star (hey, hey)
And as your eyes light up, catch me in a fairytale

You're violet crazy (hey, hey)
It's what I'm meant to be
There was no silence, baby
Between you and me, oh
And it drives me crazy (hey, hey)
Is this meant to be?
I've been so tired lately
Between you and me (yeah)
