		  (9lives exclusive)

Ain't nobody takin' you away from me, baby (I promise)
Ain't nobody in here that can say that I did you wrong
No-Nobody gonna put up with your shit the way I done
Nobody is comin' here to save ya, I did enough

Y-Y-Y-Y-You, it's you
No one look good with me but you
Y-Y-Y-Y-You, it's you
No one look good with me but you

Girl, you got me smilin'
When I'm lookin' at ya
I don't wanna fall in
Girl, you got me, smilin'
When I'm lookin' at ya
I don't wanna fall in

Ain't nobody takin' you away from me, baby (I promise)
Ain't nobody in here that can say that I did you wrong
No-Nobody gonna put up with your shit the way I done
Nobody is comin' here to save ya, I did enough

Y-Y-Y-Y-You, it's you
No one look good with me but you
Y-Y-Y-Y-You, it's you
No one look good with me but you

Girl, you got me smilin'
When I'm lookin' at ya
I don't wanna fall in
Girl, you got me smilin'
When I'm lookin' at ya
I don't wanna fall in (9lives exclusive)
