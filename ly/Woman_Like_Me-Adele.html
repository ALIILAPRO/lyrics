		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're driving me away
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you
But not in this way

I don't think you quite understand
Who you have on your hands
How can you not see
Just how good for you I am?

I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in
'Cause I only want to be the cure

If you don't choose to grow
We ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

All you do is complain
About decisions you make
How can I help lift you
If you refuse to activate
The life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place
But you will never give it up

It's where they make you feel powerful
That's why you think I make you feel small
But that's your projection
It's not my rejection

I put my heart on the line
For the very first time
Because you asked me to
And now you've gone and changed your mind

But loving you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get
The love I have for you
'Cause you don't care, hmm

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

A woman like me
One more time

Complacency is the worst trait to have (woman like me, woman like me)
Are you crazy? (Woman like me)
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me (woman like me)
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy (woman like me)
Consistency is the gift to give for free (woman like me)
And it is key
