		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I wake up happy?
And what if I wake up sad?
Sorry if I said something
Something that made you mad
Wishing that I could call ya
Sorry my service bad
My bad

When I wake up you're not next to me
Guess I'm missing all your energy
That's all I want (That's all I want)
Promise I am not your enemy
I just need another memory
That's all I want

'Cause all I want is you, is you
It takes two
'Cause all I want is you, is you
It takes two
All I want is

Tell me
Does a flower in the shade ever feel a little jealousy?
Does it ever go away?
All I want is you to answer me right now
Just dance with me right now (right now)
Just dance with me right now

When I wake up you're not next to me
Guess I'm missing all your energy
That's all I want (That's all I want)
Promise I am not your enemy
I just need another memory
That's all I want

'Cause all I want is you, is you
It takes two
'Cause all I want is you, is you
It takes two
All I want is you, is you
It takes two
'Cause all I want is you, is you
It takes two
(Is you, is you, oh, is you)
