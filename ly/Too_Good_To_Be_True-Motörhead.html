		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw some sad times I said
I'd had enough of heartbreak
I told myself that I could never fall again
Then sure as fate she came, I,
Just had to get to her and,
She gave me all her numbers, gave me all her names
Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through,
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long,
Too good to let it go, too good to be true

We left and we went home,
Unbelievable,
I looked into her eyes, thunder in my heart,
And we were joined forever
Our bodies slick together,
I told her everything, confessions in the dark

Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through,
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long,
Too good to let it go, too good to be true

She painted inspiration
Onto my fractured soul, I
Was never sure she knew how much she meant to me
She never trusted me, I know she didn't see
The night she left she killed the heart inside of me

Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through,
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long,
Too good to let it go, too good to be true

Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through,
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long,
Too good to let it go, too good to be true
