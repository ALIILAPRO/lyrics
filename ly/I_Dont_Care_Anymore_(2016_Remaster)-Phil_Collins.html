		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace 
Drag my name all over the place 
I don't care anymore
You can tell everybody 'bout the state I'm in 
You won't catch me crying 'cause I just can't win
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore 

I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play 

'Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends 
And it seems to me there's a means to and end
They don't care anymore
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time 
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind 
I don't care anymore, I don't care no more 

I don't care what you say 
We never played by the same rules anyway

I won't be there anymore 
Get out of my way 
Let me by 
I got better things to do with my time 
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore 
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore 

Well, I don't care now what you say 
'Cause every day I'm feeling fine with myself 
And I don't care now what you say 
Hey, I'll do alright by myself 
'Cause I know

'Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard 
And you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
I don't care anymore
 
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me 
'Cause all I want of you is just a let me be
I don't care anymore, d'you hear? I don't care no more 

I don't care what you say 
I never did believe you much anyway

I won't be there no more 
So get out of my way
Let me by 
I got better things to do with my time 
I don't care anymore 
D'you hear? I don't care anymore 
I don't care no more 
You listening? I don't care no more 
No more! 

You know I don't care anymore!
Don't care no more! No more, no more, no more
Don't care, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
