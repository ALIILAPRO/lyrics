		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

I got four red bottoms up in flames at my place now
I burned three Chanel dresses, three words we don't say now
And it's hard not to drink when it's the one thing I think about
It's a lot of spiders in the attic, I don't mean to be dramatic
But I think it's kinda tragic who we magically became now

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost

Yeah
Tell me what I'm supposed to do with all these pictures on my iPhone
Even all them videos, only you and I know
You never cared about me, you just care about the likes though
Every time you pop up, you should see my fuckin' eye roll
I can't even kick it with the homies that we both know
I can't even fuck with any places that we used to go
Now all I got is just the memories of us, though
Burn it all down to the ground with your ghost

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost

I wish I could take back summer nights
Erase all the vibes
Leave the memories out to dry
Delete forever, no archive
Take the words you said to me
Hold on to them intentionally
I know that eventually
I'ma set fire to the one thing I loved the most
Burn it all to the ground with your ghost

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But, I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost

Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
