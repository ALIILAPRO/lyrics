		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

He came to town like a midwinter storm
He rode through the fields, so handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left only men 'cause of Cotton-Eyed Joe

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?
