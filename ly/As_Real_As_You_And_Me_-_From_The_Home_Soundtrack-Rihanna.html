		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me

We could all fall down
Before our Saviour could return
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling comfort me, please

The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me

The ocean crush the shore
And take us down forevermore
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling comfort me, please

I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
