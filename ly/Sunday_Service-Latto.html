		  (Go Grizz)
(Pooh, you a fool for this one)
(B-B-Bankroll Got It)

I don't sing R&B but, bitch, I'm really her, fuck wrong with niggas?
How you let him cheat and take him back? Must be your only nigga (the fuck?)
I get loud just like my weed, I don't watch my tone with niggas
I hang up the phone on niggas (click)
You ain't my daddy, bitch, I'm big mama (bitch)
Every time y'all book me with them hoes, it's gon' be big drama (grrah)
Twenty black Suburbans, we pull up like Sunday Service (skrrt)
I just want a one on one, don't know why she so nervous (boop)
Fuck what these hoes sayin' 'cause my nigga say I'm perfect (tuh)

Anyway, body count so low, I might say I'm a virgin (ooh)
Any day, I could switch my car just like I switch my purses (skrrt)
Andale, quick to cut him off if he don't serve no purpose
You a clown and I'm allergic, niggas straight up out the circus (haha)
It's the nerve for me, these niggas burnt, they third degree
He callin' tryin' to work it out, I'd rather make him work for me (the fuck?)
He can't tell if it's authentic or it's surgery, please 
Lil Nas X the only nigga curvin' me

I don't sing R&B but, bitch, I'm really her, fuck wrong with niggas?
How you let him cheat and take him back? Must be your only nigga (the fuck?)
I get loud just like my weed, I don't watch my tone with niggas
I hang up the phone on niggas (click)
You ain't my daddy, bitch, I'm big mama (bitch)
Every time y'all book me with them hoes, it's gon' be big drama (grrah)
Twenty black Suburbans, we pull up like Sunday Service (skrrt)
I just want a one on one, don't know why she so nervous (boop, ha)
Fuck what these hoes sayin' 'cause my nigga say I'm perfect (tuh)

Tell the truth, oh, I'm not that cute? Bet you won't ask your boo
He get money, I get money too, like, who gon' trick on who? (Who?)
These bitches corny, soon as monkey see, then you know monkey do
Do you rap or do you tweet? 'Cause I can't tell, get in the booth, bitch (bitch)
Stop all that motherfuckin' yellin', ho (yellin', ho, why?)
'Cause I ain't buyin' what you're sellin', ho (sellin', ho)
Think I'm the shit? Bitch, I know it, ho
Jesus walked on water, I got ice boilin' though (aha)
Miss me with that sucker shit, I'm not your baby mama
Blocked his ass on everything, he in my DM's writin' albums (brr)
Better hold your nigga tight, 'fore I make you come up off him
Say two wrongs don't make a right, but I'm the type get one up on 'em

I don't sing R&B but, bitch, I'm really her, fuck wrong with niggas?
How you let him cheat and take him back? Must be your only nigga (the fuck?)
I get loud just like my weed, I don't watch my tone with niggas
I hang up the phone on niggas (click)
You ain't my daddy, bitch, I'm big mama (bitch)
Every time y'all book me with them hoes, it's gon' be big drama (grrah)
Twenty black Suburbans, we pull up like Sunday Service (skrrt)
I just want a one on one, don't know why she so nervous (boop)
Fuck what these hoes sayin' 'cause my nigga say I'm perfect (tuh)

Tuh
Twenty black Suburbans, we pull up like Sunday Service
Anyway (anyway)
Come on
Fuck what these hoes sayin' 'cause my nigga say I'm perfect
Tuh
