		  White light, white light goin' messin' up my mind
White light, and don't you know its gonna make me go blind
White heat, aww white heat it tickle me down to my toes
White light, ooo have mercy white light have it goodness knows

White light, white light goin' messin' up my brain
White light, aww white light its gonna drive me insane
White heat, aww white heat it tickle me down to my toes
White light, aww white light I said now goodness knows, do it

Hmm hmm, white light
Aww I surely do love to watch that stuff tip itself in
Hmm hmm, white light
Watch that side, watch that side don't you know it gonna be dead in the drive
Hmm hmm, white heat
Hey foxy mama watchin' her walk down the street
Hmm hmm, white light
Come up side your head gonna make a deadend on your street

White light, white light moved in me through my brain
White light, white light goin' makin' you go insane
White heat, aww white heat it tickle me down to my toes
White light, aww white light I said now goodness knows

White light, aww white light it lighten up my eyes
White light, don't you know it fills me up with surprise
White light, aww white heat tickle me down to my toes
White light, aww white light I tell you now goodness knows, now work it

Hmm hmm, white light
Aww she surely do moves me
Hmm hmm, white light
Watch that speed freak, watch that speed freak everybody gonna go and make it every week
Hmm hmm, white heat
Aww sputter mutter everybody gonna go kill their mother
Hmm hmm, white light
Here she comes, here she comes, everybody get 'n gone make me run to her
