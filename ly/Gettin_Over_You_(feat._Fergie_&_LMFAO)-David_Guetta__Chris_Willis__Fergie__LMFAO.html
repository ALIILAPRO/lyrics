		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no

(Bring it back)
Hey, hey, I can't forget you, baby
I think about you everyday
I tried to masquerade the pain
That's why I'm next to the booth
D-d-d-dancin' to the groove
But, but there is no, there is no
(There's no gettin' over you)
Baby, it feels so (right)
To dance to the beat of the (night)
That heat between you and I
Freak, freak 'til the morning light
We like to live life (fast)
And pour them shots up in the (glass)
But there is no, there is no
(There's no gettin' over you)

I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party, and party, and
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and

All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party, and party, and
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party, and party, and
I'ma party, and party, and party

People in the place
If you've ever felt love
Then you know, yeah, you know
What I'm talkin' about
There's no gettin' over

I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party, and party, and
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party, and party, and
There's no gettin' over
