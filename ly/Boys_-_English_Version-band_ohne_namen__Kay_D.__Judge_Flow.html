		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey girls, have you ever thought about
About all of those little doubts
That keep comin' up in a boy's mind
When you just smile

'Cause baby, how should he know what you really feel
If that look was fake or real
Or if he's the 5th or 6th guy
To whom your smile

Baby, think about the way that you treat a boy
'Cause no one likes to be treated like a toy
If you'd really like him spend the night
Then baby, go and tell me right

Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
You don't know about

Boys
With your love we are happy
Boys
Oh, I like being one of them

Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
Oh, the hyped up and psyched up

Boys
Always thinking about lovely
Boys
And now I'm thinking that the time is right for a hot night

To make you hold me tight and make you feel right
And if there's something that you want that I got
You can have it all night, non-stop
I want to treat you right and take you higher and higher

I want to hold you tight and make you hot like fire
I want to stay all night, I want to quench your desire
Was something I forgot? I think not!
But girl now, hey, how should I know what you'd say

If I'd ask you to play for a night and a day
Would you say, hey baby, I'd like you to stay
Or would you say, no, no, no, no way
Girls, if you want us to stay, you gotta say so

And if you want us to leave, you gotta say no
Is it a friendship or the real deal?
Girls tell us what you want, what you need, what you feel!
Boys

'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
You don't know about
Boys

With your love we are happy
Boys
Oh, I like being one of them
Boys

'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
Oh, the hyped up and psyched up
Boys

Always thinking about lovely
Boys
Hey girls, if you like a boy, then you know
That's alright to make a show

You can play little hard to get
Just to make him sweat
But baby, if you keep him waiting too long
Then one day, he might be gone

So just tell him what is right
And what you like
Baby, think about the way that you treat a boy
'Cause no one likes to be treated like a toy

If you'd really like him to spend the night
Then baby, go and tell him right
Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about

Boys
You don't know about
Boys
With your love we are happy

Boys
Oh, I like being one of them
Boys
Now I'm talking about

Boys
Oh, the hyped up and psyched up
Boys
Always thinking about lovely

Boys
Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys

You don't know about
Boys
With your love we are happy
Boys

Oh, I like being one of them
Boys
