		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's something about cha girl
That just makes my head wanna twirl
You got me wanting to tell all them other girls
There's nothing else better on this world!
The moment I seen her I was in shock
So shocked you would've think that I've just been shot
Shot down right down in this spot
But too bad this doesn't happen a lot
Oh girl you got me visualizing me on top
On top of yo hot body while were sweating a lot
A lot of time on the clock before we would have to stop
Too bad shes not into that stuff a lot
Oh man shes just super hot
Hotter than the sun that's right on top
On top of our heads oh man there she goes so I had to stop
And ask her some questions that I had in stock

She said she wants to take it slow
I'm not that type of guy I'll let cha know
When I see that red light all I know is go
So baby girl lets do this on the floor

She said she wants to take it slow
I'm not that type of guy I'll let cha know
When I see that red light all I know is go
So baby girl lets do this on the floor

Yeah lets get up on the floor
Show me your moves that makes you such a pro
A pro at being the one that I want to know
Ew yeah girl I'mma let you know
Your the one that I'm really into boo
There's a million and one places I could be but I rather be with you
Me and you can invent something that's new
That we only know that's between us two
Oh girl you drove me out my mind
Since you did that I'm digging deep in your spine
Did you ever get the hint that I'm claiming your mine?
Yeah that's whats going on this time
I would put my life on the line
The line just to be the one to call you mine
Now I'm picking up the phone just to call your line
Because baby girl your on my mind

She said she wants to take it slow
I'm not that type of guy I'll let cha know
When I see that red light all I know is go
So baby girl lets do this on the floor

She said she wants to take it slow
I'm not that type of guy I'll let cha know
When I see that red light all I know is go
So baby girl lets do this on the floor

She said she wants to take it slow
I'm not that type of guy I'll let cha know
When I see that red light all I know is go
So baby girl lets do this on the floor

She said she wants to take it slow
I'm not that type of guy I'll let cha know
When I see that red light all I know is go
So baby girl lets do this on the floor
