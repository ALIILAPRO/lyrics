		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  LexNour what would you do if you had
A second chance at life
Would you take advantage of it or let it
Slip through your fingers
You know they say the biggest pain
In life is regret today we change that

Thought those were my last words
This time yeah it's gon be different
No more hatred self inflicted
No more wasting time on women, yeah
No more building others visions
This time ya it's gon' be different
No more dying only living, yeah oh, my
Thought those were my last words, my, my
Thought those were my last words

I'm taking my fucking life back
No more regretting the shit that I've done
And I cannot control from the past
Fuck if I fail I don't care if you judge me
I swear that I'm taking a chance
You only live once and I swear on my
Momma that I'm gonna fuck up a bag
No fear naw I ain't holding back
Done with the lies
Swear that I've heard all multiple times
You cannot win without multiple tries
Niggas be fake I see it in there eyes, yeah
Go chase your dreams son
Go live your dreams son
Go chase your dreams son
I'm done with the fear, yeah
I'm done being lazy
I'm done with the indecision
I ain't letting opinions from
People deter me or
Paint me a picture I don't envision
If I say I'ma do it
I'ma do it regardless of how I'm feeling
I'ma do it regardless how they feeling
I'ma do it regardless of what you expect
End of the day
I'm the one holding this feeling and
Weight and this pain of regret
Get out my face, if you're not talking
'bout positive change that's
Involving success, fuck the fake
I'm thanking God I'm seeing different
I was busy dying, now I'm busy living

Thought those were my last words
This time yeah it's gon be different
No more hatred self inflicted
No more wasting time on women, yeah
No more building others visions
This time ya it's gon be different
No more dying only living, yeah oh, my
Thought those were my last words, my, my
Thought those were my last words

2020 is the year and the vision because
All my goals are in sight
I'm failing repeatedly fuck if they hate
You must fail before you get it right
Don't give a fuck what they say
I'm climbing new heights fuck a hater
They can watch while I live my life
Yeah they watching everywhere we go
'cause they know yeah
Yeah they watching everywhere we go
'cause they know yeah
Yeah huh, know that I'm coming up next
Know that I'm coming for necks
Know that I'm fucking up bags
Making a difference and letting
This positive energy stretch life is test
And I'm thanking God I'm seeing different
I was busy dying, now I'm busy living

Thought those were my last words
This time yeah it's gon be different
No more hatred self inflicted
No more wasting time on women, yeah
No more building others visions
This time ya it's gon be different
No more dying only living, yeah oh, my
Thought those were my last words, my, my
Thought those were my last words
