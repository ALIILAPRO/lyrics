		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home, mmm

May be surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?

I would send them but I know
That it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far
From where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like
I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right

And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day
Has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I'm coming home
Let me go home
It'll all be all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home
