		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to this
Spy on me baby, use satellite
Infrared to see me move through the night
Aim, gonna fire shoot me right
I'm gonna like the way you fight
And I love the way you fight

Now you found the secret code I use 
To wash away my lonely blues
(Well) so I can't deny or lie 
'Cause you're the only one to make me fly

Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're a sex bomb uh, huh
You can give it to me when I need to come along (give it to me)
Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're my sex bomb
And baby you can turn me on (baby you can turn me on)
(You know what you're doing to me don't you, I know you do)

No, don't get me wrong ain't gonna do you no harm, no
This bomb's made for lovin' and you can shoot it far
I'm your main target come and help me ignite
Love struck holding you tight (hold me tight darlin')

Make me explode although you know 
The route to go to sex me slow (slow baby)
And yes, I must react to claims of those 
Who say that you are not all that

Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're my sex bomb uh, huh
You can give it to me when I need to come along 
Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're my sex bomb
And baby you can turn me on (turn me on)
Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're my sex bomb (sex bomb)
You can give it to me when I need to come along 
Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're my sex bomb
And baby you can turn me on

You can give me more and more counting up the score, yeah
You can turn me upside down inside out
You can make me feel the real deal
I can give it to you any time because you're mine

Sex bomb

Oh, baby, sex bomb sex bomb you're my sex bomb
And you can give it to me when I need to be turned on (no, no)

Sex bomb sex bomb you're my sex bomb
And baby you can turn me on (turn me on)
And baby you can turn me on (turn me on)
Baby you can turn me on (turn me on)
Ooh baby, you can turn me on (turn me on)
Baby you can turn me on, ooh (turn me on)
Baby you can turn me on, ooh
Baby you can turn me on
Well, baby you can turn me on
