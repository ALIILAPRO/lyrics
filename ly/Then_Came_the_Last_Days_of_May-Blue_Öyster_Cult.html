		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Parched land no desert sand, sun is just a dot
And a little bit of water goes a long way, 'cause it's hot
Three good buddies were laughin' and smoking
In the back of a rented Ford
They couldn't know they weren't going far

Each one with the money in his pocket
Could go out and buy himself a brand new car
But they all held the money they had
Money they hoped would take them very far

Sky's bright, the traffic light, now and then a truck
And they hadn't seen a cop around all day (what luck)
They brought everything they needed
Bags and scales to weigh the stuff
The driver said the border's just over the bluff

It wasn't until the car suddenly stopped
In the middle of a cold and barren place
And the other guy turned and spilled
Three boys blood, did they know a trap had been laid?

They're okay the last days of May, but I'll be breathin' dry air
I'm leaving soon, the others are already there (all there)
You wouldn't be interested in coming along, instead of staying here?
It's said the West is nice this time of year, that's what they say
