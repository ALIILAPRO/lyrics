		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Am I, I, yeah yeah, yeah
She's a heartbreaker

She's a heartbreaker disguised as
A pretty little face, yeah
She makes my heart ache when she lies
And says she loves me anyway, yeah
When you're not around I can't keep cool
So won't you stay now?
It's safe and sound when I'm with you
Don't run away now

'Cause baby, you and me
Why do we equal disaster?
You're like my kryptonite and
I'm your cancer
Every touch slowly kills a little faster
That's alright
We can dance with death together
You and me, why do we equal disaster?
You're like my kryptonite and
I'm your cancer
Every touch slowly kills a little faster
That's alright
We can dance with death together

Ooh (Yeah! Yeah) ooh (Yeah! Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah, yeah, uh) ooh (Yeah! Yeah)

So won't you take my hand and
Watch as the rain falls?
Down your skin lathered with your makeup
Dark hair, two-faced girl of my dreams
Stuck in my nightmare, can't seem to wake up

You and me, why do we equal disaster?
You're like my kryptonite and
I'm your cancer
Every touch slowly kills a little faster
That's alright
We can dance with death together
You and me, why do we equal disaster?
You're like my kryptonite and
I'm your cancer
Every touch slowly kills a little faster
That's alright
We can dance with death together
