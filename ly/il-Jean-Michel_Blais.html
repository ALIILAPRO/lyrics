		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ah
(Freakey)
Ooh, yeah

Bad bitch lean on me (me), like Sailor Moon (Moon)
Srt hit the street (vroom), it's made for two (skrrt, yeah)
She wanna drink all of my lean, get chopped and screwed (yeah, yeah)
She thinks my life so cool, she gon' do whatever we do (ever we do)
When I'm gone, stay inside, lil' bitch (inside, lil' bitch)
We was off and on, got no time for shit (no, no, no)
No hold on, wipe your eyes real quick (no, no, no, no, no)
Let's get lost and forget and get high for this (high)

Bad with an attitude, she so damn moody (huh, what?!)
Vvs bust down face, I'm sabertoothin' (huh, woo)
She speakin' to me in tongues and I might be fluent (no)
I'm suited and booted, my head in the clouds, and my mind where the moon is (no)
I gave my all and it's all I know
When you at the top, you gon' fall, we won't
Fuck all of my opps, I hope they die slow (fuck 'em)
Icy, I'ma frost and my heart so cold (brr, ayy)

Bad bitch lean on me (me), like Sailor Moon (Moon)
Srt hit the streets (vroom), it's made for two (skrrt, yeah)
She wanna drink all of my lean, get chopped and screwed (yeah, yeah)
She thinks my life so cool, she gon' do whatever we do (ever we do)
When I'm gone, stay inside, lil' bitch (inside, lil' bitch)
We was off and on, got no time for shit (no, no, no)
No, hold on, wipe your eyes real quick (no, no, no, no, no)
Let's get lost and forget and get high for this (high)

(Freakey! Freakey!)
(Freakey!)
