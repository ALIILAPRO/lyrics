		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Surely there is
No substitute
For company
My mom's ripping
Off her hands
One flake at a time
All her children left the house
And left her all alone
But just like she'd tell me
Things get better
Just wait
And you'll see

take one day at a time
Everything else you can leave behind
Only one thing at a time
Anything more really hurts your mind
I don't want for us to
Take pills
Anymore
Not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills
Because we're stronger
And we don't need them
