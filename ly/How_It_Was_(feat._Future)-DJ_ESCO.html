		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is an experience
If you haven't been a part of nothin' this great
We went through, the motherfuckin' unbelievable
(This beat is so, so Metro)

Ayy, hit the block and sell drugs (woo, woo)
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine (and mix it)
And I pour me up a cup
Get a molly, drink of muddy, smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was (zoovie)
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was 
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it (work)
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it
I was self motivated, I was self driven (Future)
I got my determination, now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes (skrrt)
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lennox
When it come to stackin' cash up, it ain't no limit (woah, woah)
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talkin' tennis
It's some girls that's gone wild, I like to see 'em kissin' (come here)
There's some niggas playin' foul and they sneak dissin'
I won't let her hold me back from completin' my mission (naw)
It ain't easy when you tryna make it out the trenches (ball)
 
Hit the block and sell drugs (woo, woo)
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine (and mix it)
And I pour me up a cup
Get a molly, drink of muddy, smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was (zoovie)
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was 
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

I'm the dope man, dope man, yes I am (yes, I am)
Turned your baby mama house into a drug lab
I was usin' all the forks, usin' all the pans (all the pans)
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands (them bands)
Saw me microwavin' the dope, like some leftovers (like some leftovers)
Plugged in with the green grower, lawn mower
I'm a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer (let's go)
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a Rockstar 
I was trapped in the trap, dodgin' cop cars (woo, woo)
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter (where else?), and Mars (space)
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads (I like all broads)
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve

Hit the block and sell drugs (woo, woo)
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine (and mix it)
And I pour me up a cup
Get a molly, drink of muddy, smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was (zoovie)
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was 
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

Serve it to you cleaner than a house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper (woo)
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter (let's drink)
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm workin', nigga (and I'm workin', nigga)
Got a dogfood connect, DMX, nigga
Got a Styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up (turn up)
Ain't no pressure on my money, 'cause I'm certified (certified)
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got 'em mesmerized (mesmerized)
All these drugs inside my system got me super high (super high)
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

Hit the block and sell drugs (woo, woo)
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine (and mix it)
And I pour me up a cup
Get a molly, drink of muddy, smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was (zoovie)
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was 
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was
