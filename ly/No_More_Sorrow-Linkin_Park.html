		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you lost
In your lies?
Do you tell yourself "I don't realize"?

Your crusade's a disguise
Replace freedom with fear
You trade money for lives

I'm aware of what you've done

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

I see pain
I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed
I had hope
I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

You will pay for what you've done

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased
