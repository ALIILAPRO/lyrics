		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Thank you, thank you, thank you
You're far too kind
Ready? Let's go

Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar (yeah)
Now what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

Get 'em Jay

Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearing me rap is like hearing G. Rap in his prime
I'm young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the Blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
God damn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you goin' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you goin' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at a all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearing the 4-5
It ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more? (More, more, more)

I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar (one last time I need y'all to roar)
