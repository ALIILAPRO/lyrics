		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy

Use the music as therapy to exorcise how I feel
Tell me, is it fake love or is it real?
She tell me every time I talk, I give her chills
Bought my dad a 911, three hundred thousand on his body

Gotta watch out for these snitches, gotta watch out for these bitches
Gotta whisper to you niggas 'cause all the hatin' niggas might just hear me
Especially if you came from the trenches, you can't fall in love with no bitches
Gotta stay on your ten toes and keep your senses, ooh
I know sometimes she wanna trip, I know sometimes I had to dip
I ain't got no pride, I pour up a fifth, all of the times I pull up in VIP
Walk in the room and I know they watchin' me
She wanna fuck just 'cause they got my songs on repeat, ayy
Took some time off and now they think they got me beat
But the whole damn time, you niggas been heatin' up my seats
The tour life got me in light so I can see
Nigga, I ain't ever choose this shit, it came to me

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy

Use the music as therapy to exorcise how I feel
Tell me, is it fake love or is it real?
She tell me every time I talk, I give her chills
Bought my dad a 911, three hundred thousand on his body

Let you niggas know it's my city, I had to go crash the party
Took a Puerto Rican freak out Delilah, she call me papi
I can't pick none of your hoes 'cause they talk too much
That's just how I feel, that's just how I feel

I was walkin' through Compton one night at like
Like two a.M. In the morning
I just left my girl house, I found out she was on some bullshit
You know what I'm sayin', and
I walked past the 91, I was walkin' all the way down Central
Past the graveyard and shit
I had made a l-, a right on Alondra, um
Walked up by the side of the airport
And I passed the hood, you know what I'm sayin', and
And I went all the way to The Cedars
I had pulled up on my DJ at the time and
He was just tellin' me keep my head up and shit like that
Shit was crazy, you know?
I felt like I wanted to die, I felt like I ain't even wanna be no more 'cause
I just, I ain't have shit at the time, you know what I'm sayin'? And
Music was all I really had, so
You know just from goin' to jail and
Fucking around in the streets, I knew it wasn't shit
So I had to just, keep my head up, keep goin', get focused
Grind that shit out, you know what I'm sayin'?
