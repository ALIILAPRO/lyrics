(It's a smash)

Okay, yeah, hol' up, pull up
Yeah, hol' up, pull up
Yeah, yeah, pull up
Yeah, pull up
I just pulled up in that Cat
I'm pullin' up in scat, I'm pullin' that
I'm pullin' up on rats
I'm pullin' up with gats and pushing back
I pull up with my bitch
I'm turnin' up the switch
Come pull up, pull up
Pull up with the list
I pull up with the blitz
I pull up

Yeah, I just poured up on the wok, I could not give a fuck, yeah
I just pulled up with the mop, I'ma sweep 'em in blood, yeah
I just pulled up with the Lamb', I'm at it again, yeah
I just pulled up with the blam, pulled up with the
Really don't give a fuck what they be sayin'
Boy, I been way too hot, yeah, I been Saiyan
All that I know is that they gotta pay
I'm up with the gang and I'm mobbin' LA
Jump out the TRX, hop in the Benz
Jump out my bitch and I hop in her twin
Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
All of this money that I gotta
All of this money that I gotta spend
All of this cash I could never blow
Hot boy, I'm up in the motherfuckin' North
Hop in the hood where they cannot go
Pull up with fire, I pull up with gats
Don't need my dog, I bought him a Lac
Loony my brother, I bought him a Rolls
Shit is a blessing to bless all my bros, yeah

I'm off that handle like Harley (Harley)
I'm off the pills like Hardy (Hardy)
Might buy my bitch a new 'Rari ('Rari)
I'ma die lit like I'm Carti, yeah (Carti)
Jump out the crib with the view
Even if I'm up in the stu (turn up)
I'm finna work from the beach, yeah
You finna work from the tool, yeah
I keep that motherfuckin' Glock
that motherfuckin' chop, that motherfuckin' cannon gon' go
I brought my bitch on the road 
to show her she trippin' 'bout nothin' to worry 'bout hoes
Swervin' in motherfuckin' roads
swervin' in motherfuckin' cat, I'm goin' insane
Swervin' in motherfuckin' lanes 
still got that motherfuckin' aim, red dot to his face
Might have to pull up in the wraith
had to go take out my money and take it out Chase
Need me a big fucking bank
Need me a big fuckin' bank to bake up this cake
I get my go to space, talking with aliens only time that I connect
Die for my motherfuckin' set
Pussy gon' try if you wanna die for that shit (let's go)

Pulled up in that Cat
I'm pullin' up in scat
I just pulled up in that Cat
I'm pullin' up in scat
I'm pushin', pushin', pushin' with my bitch
I'm turnin' up the switch
Come pull up, pull up
Pull up with the list
I pull up with the blitz, I pull up

Okay, yeah, hol' up, pull up
Yeah, hol' up, pull up
Yeah, yeah, pull up
Yeah, pull up
I just pulled up in that Cat
I'm pullin' up in scat, I'm pullin' that
I'm pullin' up on rats
I'm pullin' up with gats and pushing back
I pull up with my bitch
I'm turnin' up the switch
Come pull up, pull up
Pull up with the list
