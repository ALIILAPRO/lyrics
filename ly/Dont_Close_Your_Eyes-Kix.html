		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's you're doing out in the night time
Why'd you call me on the phone
Your mama can't solve your problem
When's daddy ever get home

So you did your little move
In the middle of the suicide

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

No one there to hold you
No one hears you screams
You live life up and down now
Your nightmares are your dreams

Another lonely way of hanging round
Don't you take it falling down no no

Hold on hold on tight
I'll make everything all right
Wake up don't go asleep
I'll pray the lord
Your soul to keep

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby
