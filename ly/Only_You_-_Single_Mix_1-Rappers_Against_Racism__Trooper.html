		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ah, yeah, aha, yeah, what, only you baby, only you

I reminisce, and think of how it used to be, a park, roses
We were kissing, you were holding me, walking down the streets of our hometown
Getting down, wasting money, just fooling around, we felt free
Like birds in the sky, I want you all to get everything
If I should die high on hopes on our own dreams
And scenes gotta ticket for a ride to reach the bright side baby
There's a better life, no tears, no fears, no hate, no strife, no pain
Yo, I'm the golden first
You'll write me a letter that will ease my thirst
And then, sweetheart after you follow me to the city of love
Where we'll both gonna be with a shine goodbye
We made our own choice as I sat on the train and I heard your sweet voice

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you
(You and me)

I found a good job and a place to stay
But luck's been missing since you left my way
But I hold you on the phone, you spoke so sweet
Of love, devotion, faith and now you miss me
But in the instance I begin to feel that my mind's
Been played like a game on the wheel
Stealing my heart, I see a man by your side, giving you the love I tried
But I couldn't provide
Please, dreams we shared are just souvenirs
Yours, for glad laugh, said tears
Last night we talked
And you didn't say much, I told you that I love you
You said "We'll keep in touch"
I sit back and remember how it used to be back than
You and me together again those dreams and wishes are where they belong, son
In my heart and in the rest of this song

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

Padadada, padadada, padadada, padadada
Padadada, padadada, padadada, padadada

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you
