		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun breakin'
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling
Holding the world inside
Once I believed in ev'ryone
Everyone and anyone can see

Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again

Once I could laugh with ev'ryone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively coloring
Holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see you gotta believe it

Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again
