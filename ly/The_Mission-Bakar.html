		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don C, told mem "Keep shinin'"
In the streets and we're still wilin'
Only peace, only violence
No violence, in the sun where I'm highest
Melanin, bias, Jesus Christ I'm Island made
Darkest shade while she cleans my braids
Skin don't fade, and I'm still not phased by your magazine praise
We just wanna be great in these African genes

All I want's my kids to have some nepotism
All I want's my wealth to have some repetition
Call my unborn son and tell him that's the mission
Tell him that's the vision, yeah
Tell him that's the mission, yeah

Tell him that's the vision, yeah
Tell him that's the mission, yeah
Tell him that's the vision, yeah
Tell him that's the mission, yeah, yeah

9 A.M., Troye Sivan playing
Just a little man in your Mercedes-Benz
So amazing how you're raised this bad
Kid to a man in a whole different land
Girl, you made it
I don't wanna keep you waiting, no
I just thank you for your patience
As-salamu alaykum, we can make this go again
Again and again
We can make this go again
Again and again
We can make this go

All I want's my kids to have some nepotism
All I want's my wealth to have some repetition
Call my unborn son and tell him that's the mission
Tell him that's the vision, yeah
Tell him that's the mission, yeah

Tell him that's the vision, yeah
Tell him that's the mission, yeah
Tell him that's the vision, yeah
Tell him that's the mission, yeah, yeah

Yeah, son of an immigrant
Tell my unborn son
Tell my unborn daughter
Tell her that's the mission, yeah
Are you crazy?
All I ever hear is people talking about how bad nepotism is
D'you know how badly I want some nepotism in my life?
