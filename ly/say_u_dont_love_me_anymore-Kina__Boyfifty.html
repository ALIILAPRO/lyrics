		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Maybe our time's up)
('Cause you're not giving enough love)
(That light in your eyes has gone)

It ran out from so much pain and doubt
Oh, it ran out from so much pain and doubt
Oh, it ran out from so much pain and doubt
Oh, it ran out from so much pain and doubt

Maybe our time's up
'Cause you're not giving enough love
That light in your eyes has gone
