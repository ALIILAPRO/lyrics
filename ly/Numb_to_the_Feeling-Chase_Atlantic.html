		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard you got a heart, let me see
Heard you got a heart, let me see
I need you to split that thing with me
Yeah, I need you to split that thing with me, girl
Heard you skipping meals, losing sleep
Well, I've been doing the same honestly
Well, I look like a fucking walking corpse, girl
Say the words, R.I.P. 'Cause

My tolerance is going up
And I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
And I've been abusing drugs
I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
I need you to show me love
'Cause I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
I need you to ride me harder when we fuck
'Cause I'm getting numb to the feeling, whoa
I'm getting numb to the feeling
I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
I'm getting numb to the feeling
Yeah, I'm getting numb to the feeling, whoa
I need you to show me love
'Cause I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
My tolerance is going up
And I'm getting numb to the feeling

Yeah, I heard you get drunk every weekend, no
I heard you and your friends have been geekin' out, yeah
Don't freak them out, the weed is loud, yeah
The weed is loud, yeah
Don't you get 'em in the brains, girl
Dropped from heaven, now you're in the plains, girl
I'd up in your jeans, like a, like I mean it, yeah, oh

My tolerance is going up
And I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
And I've been abusing drugs
I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
I need you to show me love
'Cause I'm getting numb to the feeling
I need you to ride me harder when we fuck
'Cause I'm getting numb to the feeling, whoa
I'm getting numb to the feeling
Yeah, I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
I'm getting numb to the feeling
I'm getting numb to the feeling
My tolerance is going up
And I'm getting numb to the feeling, whoa, shit
I need you to see me, love
I'm getting numb to the feeling
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting numb, baby
Look what you done, baby
You were the one
You were the one, baby

Mamacita's on the rebound
She been weepin', sleeping
She been sleeping
Popping Xanies every weekend, it's the deep end
Find me on the deep end
Man, I need friends
I'll be swimmin', swimmin'
I got steep ends
I don't really care about your life if you ain't talking money get the fuck away, yeah

'Cause I'm getting numb to the feeling
I need you to show me love
I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
My tolerance is going up
'Cause I'm getting numb to the feeling, yeah
Yeah, I need you to ride me harder when we fuck
'Cause I'm gettin' numb, babe, yeah
I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting numb to the feeling
I'm getting numb to the feeling
I'm getting, I'm getting numb to the feeling
I'm getting numb to the feeling
I'm getting, I'm getting numb to the feeling
What is you feeling?
See what you did there?
I'm getting numb to the feeling, whoa
Yeah, yeah
I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting numb, oh
I'm getting numb, babe
