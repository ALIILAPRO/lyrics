		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to hide under the covers
Serenade each other
With careless melodies
Something buried deep inside us
The major and the minor
We're like piano keys

You played for me
You played for me, oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be

You played for me
(You played for me)
(You played for me)

We couldn't stop the world from turning
It was like a whirlwind
Scattered us like leaves
But I'm stuck inside a feeling
A song that never leaves
We were like a symphony

You played for me
You played for me, oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be

You played for me
(You played for me)
(You played for me)

You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You played for me

I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
You played for me
