		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby came home today
Told me to stay away
She told me her man was afraid
Told me I better behave
Baby just came back around
Told me she's leaving this town
Said she needs time to explore
She said I can't love her no more

Thinking about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know

So baby packed up all she had
Promised to never come back
She left me alone and without
Skin I can study about
Tiles get colder to touch
Wood splinters, metal will rust
But baby, she had all my trust
And I guess that was never enough

Thinking about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know she's mine

Whoa, oh oh
You know that she's mine, oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby came home today
Told me to stay away
Told me her man was afraid
Told me I better behave

(Oh, no no, I'm)

Thinkin' about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know
She's mine, she's mine
That girl is mine, she's mine, whoa
