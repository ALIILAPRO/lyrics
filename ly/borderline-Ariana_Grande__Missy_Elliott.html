		<p>
		  Let's go
Baby, I just want you to be mine (woo!)
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline (It's loose) (woo!)

You play hard-to-get, but I know you want me, too (woo!)
Ain't out here looking for other dudes
So I'ma keep it tight for you, mmm

You know I'm the wifey type, babe (woo!)
You know I be one of a kind, oh whoa
Once you tastin' my ice cream, I bet you won't ever leave
I know it's hard to believe
Boy, you got me all on my knees
(Light it up, though, light it up, though)
It ain't too hard for me
(Light it up, though, light it up, though)
Stop playing, too hard for me (let's go)

Baby, I just want you to be mine (woo!)
Won't you give me a bit of your time, oh woah
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline (woo!)

Seems like I'm coming on strong
But I don't want this time to pass (woo!)
I know you got a lot of chicks hollin' at you
But I bet they cannot last

You know I'm the wifey type, babe (woo!)
You know I be one of a kind, oh whoa (let's go)
Once you tastin' my ice cream, I bet you won't ever leave
I know it's hard to believe
Boy, you got me all on my knees
(Light it up, though, light it up, though)
It ain't too hard for me
(Light it up, though, light it up, though)
Stop playing, too hard for me

Baby, I just want you to be mine (woo!)
Won't you give me a bit of your time, oh woah
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline

Uh, I'm like, you got me so on a chase
Got me feeling so out of place
Think 'bout you all of my days
Wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes
Not tryna cuff you or crowd your space
I'm tryna find you words just to say
"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline, beside me, you lay (woo!)

Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time, oh woah
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline
