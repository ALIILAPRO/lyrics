		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's like all this time
I've been waitin' for you with my open eyes
Scannin' the room for a peace of mind
You look so good in this light
It's like suddenly all that's important is in front of me
Already know what we're gonna be
You look so good in this light

I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love, I love to love

I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love, I just want to stay
And get carried away, I get carried away
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love (I love to love)
I love to love, love, love, love

I'm an open book
Typically I feel misunderstood
No one could know me the way you could
No, I don't keep nothin' inside
I believe in love like it's a fire, it's a feelin'
It's a touch, it's a reason
It's a light, it's a healin'

I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love, I just wanna stay
And get carried away, I get carried away
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love (I love to love)
I love to love, love, love, love

You look so good in this light
I love to love
I love to love

I love to love, I love all the ways
I feel so much, I get carried away
I love to love, I just wanna stay
And get carried away, I get carried away
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love (I love to love)
I love to love, love, love, love
