		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes

I can't seem to drown you out long enough
I fell victim to the sound of your love
You're like a song that I ain't ready to stop
I got nothing but you on my mind

I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
'Til I found salvation in the form of your

Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away

On the verge of almost bleeding you out
Are we too wounded now to ever come down?
Oh, how I long for us to find common ground
I got nothing but you on my mind

I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
'Til I found salvation in the form of your

Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it, take it

Way too close to colour your comfort
All dressed up but kept undercover
Way too close to colour your comfort
All dressed up but kept undercover

Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away

I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
'Til I found salvation in the form of your

Your grace (your grace)
Your grace (your grace)
Your grace (your grace)
Don't take it away
Your grace (your grace)
Your grace (your grace)
Your grace 
Don't take it away
