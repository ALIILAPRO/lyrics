		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If a fiddler played you a song, my love
And if I gave you a wheel
Would you spin for my heart and loneliness
Would you spin for my love 

If I gave up all of my pride for you
And only loved you for now
Would you hide my fears and never say
"Tomorrow I must go" 

Everywhere there's rain my love
Everywhere there's fear 

If you tell me a lie I'll cry for you
Tell me of sin and I'll laugh
If you tell me of all the pain you've had
I'll never smile again 

Everywhere there's rain my love
Everywhere there's fear 

I can plainly see that our parts have changed
Our sands are shifting around
Need I beg to you for one more day
To find our lonely love 

Everywhere there's rain my love
Everywhere there's fear
