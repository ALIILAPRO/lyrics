		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a step outside yourself 
And turn around 
Take a look at who you are 
It's pretty scary 
So silly 
Revolting 
You're not much 
You can't do anything 
Take a step outside the city 
And turn around 
Take a look at what you are 
It is revolting 
You're really nowhere 
So wasteful 
So foolish 
Poppycock 
Who said don't look back? 
Don't believe 'em 
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant 
'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you 
Don't you let them do it 
You know what I'm talking about? 
You hear me talking? 
You hear me talking? 
It's pretty scary it's so revolting 
Take a step outside the country 
And turn around 
Take a look at what you are 
It is amazing 
Take a good look 
You're no big deal 
You're so petty 
It's lots 
Take a step outside the planet 
Turn around and around 
Take a look at where you are 
It's pretty scary
