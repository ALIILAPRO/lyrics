		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got the wind at my back and my foot to the floor
I ain't comin' back to you no more
I'm sick of your crap and your moaning whine
I'm leaving you for good come rain or shine
You can cry me a river, cry me a river of tears
Yeah you can cry all you like but it won't change my mind
I gotta get away get you outta my life

You got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free
You got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free

Gonna drive all day gonna drive all night
Whatever it takes to get to the light
I'm running on rage I'm outta control
My anger for you is like hot burning coal
So you can cry me a river, cry me a river of tears
Yeah you can cry all you like but it won't change my mind
I gotta get away get you outta my life

You got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free
You got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free

You got me runnin' wild, wild and free
The open road is all I need
Runnin' wild runnin' free
It's never gonna be like it used to be

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

No I wont turn around I won't turn back
I've made up my mind and that's a fact
It's over baby I'm hangin' up this phone
But before you I go there's just one thing you should know
You drown in your river drown in your river of tears
Yeah you can cry all you like but it won't change my mind
I gotta get away get you outta my life

You got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free
You got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free
Yeah you got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free
You got me runnin' wild and free
Runnin' wild and free

You got me runnin' wild, wild and free
The open road is all I need
You got me runnin' wild runnin' free
It's never gonna be like it used to be

Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey
