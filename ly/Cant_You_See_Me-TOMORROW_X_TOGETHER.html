		  (See me? See me?)
(Can't you see me? Can't you see me?)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm yours, you were mine 세계의 비밀
마법 같던 영원의 그 약속
별빛 아래 꽃피운 둘만의 scintilla
Now see them burn in fire
폐허가 된 여기 재가 된 memories

Together, together, ooh whoa
We forever forever, you know
약속했던 둘만의 something, something
불꽃 속에서 넌 등을 돌리지

무너진 모래성 who's a liar?
세계의 끝에서 춤추는 fire
안 들리니? 널 찾는 내 목소리
또 홀로 남겨지는 나
"구해줘"

Can't you see me?
마법의 그날처럼 say "Believe me"
불타버린 내 맘을 come and feel me, feel me
Oh, can't you see me?
My friends don't understand me, no

Can't you see me?
Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
Friends don't understand me anymore, more
Can't you see me?
Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
Friends don't understand me anymore, more

원망해, 널 참 많이
'Cause you don't understand me
원망이 멈추게 please
내 손을 잡아줘, 다시

Together, together, ooh whoa
We forever forever, you know
꿈속에서 사라진 something, something
남겨진 섬, 잊혀진 그 멜로디

무너진 모래성 who's a liar?
세계의 끝에서 춤추는 fire
안 들리니? 널 찾는 내 목소리
또 홀로 남겨지는 나
"구해줘"

Can't you see me?
마법의 그날처럼 say "Believe me"
불타버린 내 맘을 come and feel me, feel me
Oh, can't you see me?
My friends don't understand me, no

Can't you see me?
Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
Friends don't understand me anymore, more
Can't you see me?
Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
Friends don't understand me anymore, more

Bad, bad 그저 아픈 꿈이길 바래
Sad, sad 돌려놔줘 나를 네 옆에

Can't you see me?
마법의 그날처럼 say "Believe me"
불타버린 내 맘을 come and feel me, feel me
Oh, can't you see me?
My friends don't understand me, no

Can't you see me?
Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
Friends don't understand me any (shh!) more
Can't you see me?
Friends don't understand me, understand me anymore
Friends don't understand me anymore, more, more (more)
