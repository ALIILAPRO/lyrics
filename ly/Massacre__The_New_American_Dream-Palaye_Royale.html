		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Come on) all you killers on your killing sprees
(Come on) a massacre's the new American dream
(Come on) and all the kids on the murder scene
A massacre, the new American dream

A massacre, the new American dream

Fed lies since the day I was conceived
A bastard son, a rebel, now look at me
Went from homeless to your TV screen
How's this for the American dream?
Feed pills to society
Give you a gun, and now there's a killing spree
I've given up on America's racist agenda
I'm fucked up from prescriptions and antidepressants

Massacre
Generation Y 
Generation why are we
Why are we so casual 'bout these casualties?

(Come on) all you killers on your killing sprees
(Come on) a massacre's the new American dream
(Come on) and all the kids on the murder scene
A massacre, the new American dream

In every church, school, and synagogue
Virginia to Littleton, when will it stop?
Turn on the TV, a nightmare or dream?
On every station massacres all I see

Massacre
Generation Y 
Generation why are we
Why are we so casual 'bout these casualties?

(Come on) all you killers on your killing sprees
(Come on) a massacre's the new American dream
(Come on) and all the kids on the murder scene
A massacre, the new American dream

I've had enough of prescriptions and antidepressants
I've had enough of you giving your people some weapons
I've had enough of prescriptions and antidepressants
I've had enough of you giving your people some weapons

(Massacre)
Giving your people some weapons
(Massacre)
Giving your people some weapons

(I've had enough) of prescriptions and antidepressants
(I've had enough) of you giving your people some weapons
(I've had enough) of prescriptions and antidepressants
(I've had enough) of you giving your people some weapons

All you killers on your killing sprees
A massacre's the new American dream

(Come on) all you killers on your killing sprees
(Come on) a massacre's the new American dream
(Come on) and all the kids on the murder scene
A massacre, the new American dream
A massacre, the new American dream, dream
A massacre, the new American dream
