		  (Ayy, Royce, you did it right here)

Hands on my knees, they ain't never seen moves like these (mmm)
Nice and clean, A1 body but I talk real mean (so mean)

Said, "Lord, please forgive me," oh
Said, "I don't like beggin' but I'm on my knees"
(Na-na-na, na-na-na) Don't be a tease
(Na-na-na, na-na-na) Grab them keys
Afterparty in between the sheets
Top floor shawty in a penthouse suite
(Na-na-na, na-na-na) Make ya say, "Please"
(Na-na-na, na-na-na) "Please"

Hands on my knees, they ain't never seen moves like these (mmm)
Nice and clean, A1 body but the talk real mean (so mean)
He's simpin'
Said, "Lord, please forgive me," oh
Said, "I don't like beggin' but I'm on my knees"

(Na-na-na, na-na-na)
(Na-na-na, na-na-na) Oh-oh
I'm just human, we all got needs
