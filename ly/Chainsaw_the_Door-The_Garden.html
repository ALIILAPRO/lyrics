		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it

That doesn't mean it's goin down that fast
Even though it's quicker than using an axe
The only question now is what's on the other side
On the other side, on the other side

A family that you don't like
A fuckin slug on a motor bike
A dark old memory
That's got you trapped for a century
A puddle that's deeper than you thought
Your foot sinks down way underground
Maybe that door wasn't what it's supposed to be

When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it

An old lady with a handbag
An old horse with a saddle bag
A cold empty living room
An ego that is fully fuckin nude

Dirt hole, hard not to fall in
When the vertigo hits, I'ma start ballin'
Not the kind that you may be thinkin' of
But the kind that'll turn a blue bird into black dove
The kind that'll turn a blue bird into black dove

When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
When I see that closed door, I'm gonna chainsaw through it
The only question now is what's on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
