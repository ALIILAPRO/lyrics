		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The bass
The rock
The mic
The treble

I like my coffee black
Just like my metal
With the bass
The rock

The mic
The treble
I like my coffee black
Just like my metal

I can't wait for you to fuck me up
In a minute, minute
In a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to fuck me up

In a minute, minute
In a second

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

The bass
The rock
The mic
The treble

I like my coffee black
Just like my metal
With the bass
The rock

The mic
The treble
I like my coffee black
Just like my metal

I can't wait for you to fuck me up
In a minute, minute
In a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to fuck me up

In a minute, minute
In a second

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I don't buy your body right now, right now
I'm almost over my body right now, now
I'm on my way to the party right now, right now
I don't buy your body right now, right now

I'm almost over my body right now, now
I'm on my way to the party right now, right now
Because the (bass? break?), the (bass? the break?)

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
