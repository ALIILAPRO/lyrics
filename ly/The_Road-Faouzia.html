		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

This ain't goodbye for real now
This ain't goodbye for real
Don't want to see you cry now
Don't want to see your tears
Do you remember all the, all of the things we did?
All of the crazy memories when we were only kids
 
Oh, let me soar
Oh, I want more
 
Time to hit the road now
Time to hit the road
Time to let it go now
Time to let it go
I'ma hit the road
I'ma hit the road
 
Taking all the chances
Taking all the falls
I'll keep all the memories
I'll break down the walls
Time to hit the road
Time to hit the road
 
Thinking of all the journeys
Thinking of what comes next
Thinking of brighter days that lie ahead
 
Oh, let me soar
Oh, I want more
 
Time to hit the road now
Time to hit the road
Time to let it go now
Time to let it go
I'ma hit the road
I'ma hit the road
 
Taking all the chances
Taking all the falls
I'll keep all the memories
I'll break down the walls
Time to hit the road
Time to hit the road
 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
 
Time to hit the road now
Time to hit the road
Time to let it go now
Time to let it go
I'ma hit the road
I'ma hit the road
 
Taking all the chances
Taking all the falls
I'll keep all the memories
I'll break down the walls
Time to hit the road
Time to hit the road
