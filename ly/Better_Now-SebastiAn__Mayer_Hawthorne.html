		  Koreen
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave before you show me?
Before we find that thing that we found before?

Koreen
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave before you show me?
Before we find that thing that we found before?

Koreen
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave before you show me?
Before we find that thing that we found before?

Koreen
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave before you show me?
Before we find that thing that we found before?

I feel better now
Something original
Lightweight say hello
Gentle winds are gonna blow

I feel better now
Something original
Lightweight say hello
Gentle winds are gonna blow
Talking, spit it out
Are you gonna feel me now?

I feel better now
Something original
I feel better now
Something original
Lightweight say hello
Gentle winds are gonna blow
Talking, spit it out
Are you gonna feel me now?
I feel better now
Something original

Koreen
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave before you show me?
Before we find that thing that we found before?

Koreen
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave before you show me?
Before we find that thing that we found before?

Koreen
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna leave before you show me?
Before we find that thing that we found before?
