		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sebz Beats, baby
She want a G-U-N, M-A-N
G-U-N, M-A-N
(Shotta)

She want a G-U-N, M-A-N
One man bang, bang, stretch with my right hand (shotta)
That was a Eiffel, I need a rifle (woo)
Ridin' my bike, ride like a cycle
T-Take little trips, ain't got a title (uh-huh)
Bad one, smooth criminal, Michael Jackson
Got a big, I'm with raw action (crud)
I'm really tryna catch one 
She want a G-U-N, M-A-N
One man bang, bang, stretch with my right hand (shotta)
That was a Eiffel, I need a rifle (woo)
Ridin' my bike, ride like a cycle
T-Take little trips, ain't got a title (uh-huh)
Bad one, smooth criminal, Michael Jackson
Got a big, I'm with raw action (crud)
I'm really tryna catch one 

Shakes, lowkey bringin' the case
Dates, can't do that, I'm too bait (woo)
Fake, the boy done made a big mistake
soon get bun in a face (baow)
Babes, GMD mash up the place
Everyone got at least one on their blade
Taste, bust my nut in her face (uh-huh)
Put pipe in then the secret's safe

She want a G-U-N, M-A-N
One man bang, bang, stretch with my right hand (shotta)
That was a Eiffel, I need a rifle (bullet)
Ridin' my bike, ride like a cycle
T-Take little trips, ain't got a title (bullet, feet)
Bad one, smooth criminal, Michael Jackson (uh-huh)
Got a big, I'm with raw action (crud)
I'm really tryna catch one
She want a G-U-N, M-A-N 
One man bang, bang, stretch with my right hand (shotta)
That was a Eiffel, I need a rifle (bullet)
Ridin' my bike, ride like a cycle
T-Take little trips, ain't got a title (bullet, feet)
Bad one, smooth criminal, Michael Jackson (uh-huh)
Got a big, I'm with raw action (crud)
I'm really tryna catch one

If I was you, I would hate me too
Fuck enough mans gyal, now my face di yute
She thinks I'm a cheap, but she ain't got proof
Shawty, it look hot like the first of June
PR same size as a baby shoe
You know man's live in the party too
SVR ease up when I'm passin' through
When my head gets hot I'm like, "What she wanna do?"

She want a G-U-N, M-A-N
One man bang, bang, stretch with my right hand (shotta)
That was a Eiffel, I need a rifle (woo)
Ridin' my bike, ride like a cycle
T-Take little trips, ain't got a title (uh-huh)
Bad one, smooth criminal, Michael Jackson
Got a big, I'm with raw action (crud)
I'm really tryna catch one 
She want a G-U-N, M-A-N
One man bang, bang, stretch with my right hand (shotta)
That was a Eiffel, I need a rifle (woo)
Ridin' my bike, ride like a cycle (bullet)
T-Take little trips, ain't got a title (uh-huh)
Bad one, smooth criminal, Michael Jackson
Got a big, I'm with raw action (crud)
I'm really tryna catch one
