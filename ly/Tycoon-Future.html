		  (DY Krazy)
Starin' at the candle
Feel the pain on me, nigga, it don't matter
Got my currency exchanged, got my bands up

I'm a ty-tycoon, that's why they hate me (Wheezy outta here)
'Til they throw the sheets on me I'm goin' crazy
Got Balencis on my feet, they can't take me
I know I ain't gon' be deceased 'til I'm like eighty
I been gettin' so damn geeked, I been prayin'
I been chinchilla sheet wherever I'm stayin'
Took that Draco on a PJ, ain't playin'
I ain't goin', no, no, street's dangerous

Ain't got Actavis, so fuck it, I had to red it
I sent hitters from everywhere, they had to dead it
You know my niggas, they bangin' the same color spaghetti
I got my transport up and I got my Getty
I'm gettin' her passport stamped, we goin' steady
They try to cut a nigga throat off with a machete
I know my lil' bro gon' kick a door and let that lead hit
I'm not a imposer so I'm tryna find a exit
They know it's a thousand cutters hittin' off if they come for me
Uno gang, twenty-seven, they gon' gun for me
ABK gon' broad day you and get it done for me
I'ma big dog, they a lil' son to me

I'm a ty-tycoon, that's why they hate me
'Til they throw the sheets on me I'm goin' crazy
Got Balencis on my feet, they can't take me
I know I ain't gon' be deceased 'til I'm like eighty
I been gettin' so damn geeked, I been prayin'
I been chinchilla sheet wherever I'm stayin'
Took that Draco on a PJ, ain't playin'
I ain't goin', no, no, street's dangerous

Fully auto on the seat, ain't let you take it
I ain't goin' no, no, I'ma spray it
Let my dogs off the leash, you gon' hate it
Twin choppers on me, they my favorite, yeah, yeah
Catch me rollin' in the Ghost, Patrick Swayze
Travelin' all across the coast for this gravy
Buyin' gold by the pound, I upgraded
I came from lil' Mexico, a nigga made it
Posted up outside the store, I'm the greatest
If you can make it out the bricks, that's amazin'
I got my gang from out the 6, ain't no tradin'
You know the side was two guns blazin'

I'm a ty-tycoon, that's why they hate me (I'm a ty-tycoon)
'Til they throw the sheets on me I'm goin' crazy ('til they throw the sheets on me)
Got Balencis on my feet, they can't take me (got Balencis on me)
I know I ain't gon' be deceased 'til I'm like eighty (yeah, ain't gon' be deceased, no)
I been gettin' so damn geeked, I been prayin' (yeah, I'm geeked, man, I'm geeked up)
I been chinchilla sheet wherever I'm stayin' (yeah, I'm chinchilla sheets up)
Took that Draco on a PJ, ain't playin' (took the Draco on a P, what up)
I ain't goin', no, no, street's dangerous (ain't goin' no, no, street's dangerous)

Yeah, I ain't goin' no, no
I ain't goin', no, no, street's dangerous
Trap
I ain't goin', no, no
Yeah, what you do?

I chinchilla all of my sheets wherever I'm stayin' (I chinchilla all of my sh-)
I been gettin' so fuckin' geeked, I been prayin' (I been gettin' so fuckin' geeked)
Got that Draco on a PJ, ain't playin' (took the Draco on a PJ)
I ain't goin', no, no, street's dangerous (I ain't goin', I ain't goin')

Starin' at the candle
Feel the pain on me, nigga, it don't matter
Get my currency exchange, got my bands up
