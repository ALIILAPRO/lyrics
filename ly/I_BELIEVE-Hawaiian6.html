		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will not say good-bye
So it's not sad
We'll meet again somewhere
Yes I believe I can
We are living
Human beings, animals and green
Even the earth is living
Hand in hand with each other
There're so many peoples
And so many sadness
There're so many stories
in each other
And so many life
But there're so many
good-bye too
May be I won't see you any more
But we'll meet again some day
I believe we can
Don't stop believing
Don't give up
Don't stop to dream
It doesn't matter
Even if they laugh at you
Even if you don't look so good
If you cannot stop your tears
Look up in the sky,
then you'll find
No matter where you are
The countless stars
are always on your side

The earth, the time,
the fate and the soul
We are all
in the same circle of life
Even the star shoots away,
there's another star
shines on you
We'll meet again if you believe
And so I believe
Don't stop believing
Don't give up
Don't stop to dream
It doesn't matter
Even if they laugh at you
Even if you don't look so good
If you cannot stop your tears
Look up in the sky,
then you'll find
No matter where you are
The countless stars
are always on your side
I won't say
I will not say good-bye
I'll see you in the next life
My friend I'll see you again
I won't say
I will not say good-bye
I'll see you in the next life
My friend I'll see you again
I won't say
I will not say good-bye
I'll see you in the next life
My friend I'll see you again
I won't say
I will not say good-bye
I believe we'll meet again
Some where, some day
I believe
