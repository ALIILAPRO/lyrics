		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost the fight
And I’m out of words
Not the type
To Slam the door
Heated now, regret the words
Same of song, dance to the verse
Know me now, you’re all I need
Let me help with your anxiety
Dry your eyes
And sober up
Stay the night, cos I love you so
They say
We’re still young
Stubborn set in our ways
I won’t budge
I wanna go the distance
In my heart
I don’t care what they say
They say
They say
We’re still young
Stubborn set in our ways
I won’t budge
I wanna go the distance
In my heart
I don’t care what they say
They say
Stepping stones
Towards your fears that we all call unknown
Designer dress to you that’s basic
Yeah
Vvs to make a statement
I’m gonna drink some
Till I can’t feel none
I don’t care bout who’s my friend
You gonna try some
Just to feel something
Ironic how you don’t want this to end
You're lost in space tonight
Pills they help break away
But I'm your ghost tonight
Take of what feels pain
You’re safe with me
Stay
I need you you
Drugs i'm getting used to
Cast a new view
Tonight you're mine for life
Lie through your teeth
And smile for the pictures
Dancing your life away
You’ll go distance
To feel your existence
So she been playing with the reaper in the
Moonlight
Hoping she don’t ever have to take her own
Life
Or they say
They say
We’re still young
Stubborn set in our ways
I won’t budge
I wanna go the distance
In my heart
I don’t care what they say
They say
They say
We’re still young
Stubborn set in our ways
I won’t budge
I wanna go the distance
In my heart
I don’t care what they say
They say
I’ve been going through it
And I’m still young
Mixing up these chemicals
To feel Numb
Shadows cast of what’s given
You exist but are you living
