		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Risk my life with certain wants that lead to my decay
Twist my arm and suffocate all the fame away
I know (I know, I know, I know), I've got a lot to learn

Complicated and a mess, slightly OCD
Take for granted many things that mean a lot to me
I know (I know, I know, I know), I've got a lot to learn

I was raised as a scorpion being pulled by the moon in a high tide
That's why I'm broken

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Am I a villain or a saint? Let me lead the way
Resting bitch face on the move, fuck you have to say
I know (I know, I know, I know), I am tough as a stone

I've lived a lot of life that not a lot will understand
The type of life that gives you scars before you take command
I know (I know, I know, I know), I am tough as a stone

I was raised as a scorpion being pulled by the moon in a high tide
That's why I'm broken

I know this hurts a lot
It's not my fault it never was
And I know I'm tough like stone
But right now, please hug me
I feel alone

And I know this hurts a lot
It's not my fault it never was
And I know I'm tough like stone
But right now, please hug me
I feel alone
I feel alone

Villain
Villain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Villain
Villain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
