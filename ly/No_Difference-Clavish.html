Uh

What's a quarter ticket? Boy, I'm tryna make a million (million)
You've been on like a hundred glides and never done no drillings (drillin')
Finessed a few, so if I want that, gotta pay for dinners (dinners)
They never pay and that's one reason why I hate opinions
Free my niggas jammed, still get money, that don't make no difference
Difference is, when them niggas locked, they don't make no figures
Bitch, I got so much hoes, losin' you don't make no difference
I got beef with so much niggas, beefin' you don't make no difference

Good food and be on time, that's how you keep it ringin'
Can't tell my nigga, "Chill," just gotta watch and keep on chingin'
Heard he's in jail for punchin' up and kickin' down his Mrs
Dick inside her somethin', that's the only time I'm beatin' women
When I die, my guys are liars if they don't say, "He the realest"
Go Dubai, put two racks aside, that's just for speedin' tickets
I can't lie, when my nigga died, that had me grievin' different
Stick my rambo in and out his chest and now he's breathin' different
Burn my nigga's bridge if he got nicked and turned to LMA
Keep it close, why? 'Cause on my block, we don't do MMA
Let me tell you one thing 'bout my hood
You can put in work today, but by tomorrow, nobody don't care 'cause that was yesterday
Feds on my B-A-C-K, don't wanna see me elevate
Bump into my paigons, tell me one time that I hesitated
Got love for Loops, why? For me, he done extra days
Got cousins that can't get a hear, I got more love for Destiny

What's a quarter ticket? Boy, I'm tryna make a million (million)
You've been on like a hundred glides and never done no drillings (drillin')
Finessed a few, so if I want that, gotta pay for dinners (dinners)
They never pay and that's one reason why I hate opinions
Free my niggas jammed, still get money, that don't make no difference
Difference is, when them niggas locked, they don't make no figures
Bitch, I got so much hoes, losin' you don't make no difference
I got beef with so much niggas, beefin' you don't make no difference

I've never seen your gun, you're always talkin' 'bout a scram
He never went on holiday, somehow, he's got a tan
I wasted credit on this girl when I was in the can
Had couple plans, came home just to find out that she's got a man
Damn, put my feelings to the side so I can work it better
Fifteen inch up in my pumper, so I can work the presser
I should be gone clear by the time they're freein' Terra
She gave me so much brain, I'm on the verge of bein' clever
B-Beat it better, I'll give it to S, loose, tap it, squeeze it better
I was locked up, from her, I didn't see a letter
I know I rap, but if I get a job, I'm on whatever
She can get her make-up on my Calvin Klein, but not my sweater
Remember I was trappin', used to flex with my boss' cheddar?
Money over bitches, you chase women, I chase mozzarella
But I got women that eat me and they wanna arch forever
They don't know that when I ride with mine, I hit the target hella

What's a quarter ticket? Boy, I'm tryna make a million (million)
You've been on like a hundred glides and never done no drillings (drillin')
Finessed a few, so if I want that, gotta pay for dinners (dinners)
They never pay and that's one reason why I hate opinions
Free my niggas jammed, still get money, that don't make no difference
Difference is, when them niggas locked, they don't make no figures
Bitch, I got so much hoes, losin' you don't make no difference
I got beef with so much niggas, beefin' you don't make no difference
