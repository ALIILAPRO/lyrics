		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I did my best
But I guess my best wasn't good enough
Cause here we are
Back where we were before
Seems nothin' ever changes
We're back to being strangers
Wondering if we ought to stay
Or head on out the door

Just once

Can't we figure out what we keep doin' wrong
Why we never last for very long
What are we doin' wrong

Just once

Can't we find a way to finally make it right
To make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it
I know we could break through it
(Hmm hmm)

I gave my all
But I think my all may have been too much
Cause Lord knows we're not gettin' anywhere
Seems we're always blowin'
Whatever we've got goin'
And it seems at times with all we've got
We haven't got a prayer

Just once

Can't we figure out what we keep doin' wrong
Why the good times never last for long
Where are we goin' wrong

Just once

Can't we find a way to finally make it right
To make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it
If we could just get to it

Just once
I want to understand
Why it always comes back to goodbye
Why
Can't we get ourselves in hand
And admit to one another
We're no good without each other
Take the best and make it better
Find a way to stay together

Just once

Can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it
If we could just get to it

Just once

Whoa oh, we can get to it

Just once
