		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doesn't seem to matter what I do
I'm always number two
No one knows how hard I tried, oh-oh, I
I have feelings that I can't explain
They're drivin' me insane
All my life been so polite
But I'll sleep alone tonight

'Cause I'm just Ken
Anywhere else, I'd be a ten
Is it my destiny to live and die
A life of blond fragility?
I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend
What will it take for her to see
The man behind the tan and fight for me?

I wanna know what's it's like to love
To be the real thing
Is it a crime? Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings?
And is my moment finally here or am I dreaming?
I'm no dreamer

(Can you feel Kenergy?)
(Feels so real, my Kenergy)
(Can you feel Kenergy?)
(Feels so real, my Kenergy)

I'm just Ken
Anywhere else, I'd be a ten
Is it my destiny to live and die
A life of blond fragility?
I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend
What will it take for her to see
The man behind the tan and fight for me?

I'm just Ken (and I'm enough)
And I'm great at doing stuff
So, hey, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken
My name's Ken (and so am I)
Put that manly hand in mine
So, hey world, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken
Baby, I'm just Ken
