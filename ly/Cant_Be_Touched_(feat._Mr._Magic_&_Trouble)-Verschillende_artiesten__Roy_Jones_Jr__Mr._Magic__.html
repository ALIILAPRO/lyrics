		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm right here, boss man
I got this here

Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunk, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get it right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?

I mean what I speak, I do as I say
I hustle, I grind, don't get in my way
I'm pimping my hoes, I'm jacking my foes
I spit at police and duck my POs
I ain't going to court, you can call the judge
Tell him kiss my ass, 'cause I ain't gonna budge
And I ain't going back to lock up
You try and the Glock'll pop up
I ain't going back to broke
And I'm never gonna stop the puffing, not for nothing
The block, they need me, the streets they need me
The club scene, nigga, is mine, believe me
You don't believe me?

Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunk, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get it right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?

Open your hearts for me, look what I got for you
You in the presence of greatness, I'll make it hot for you
Pass the rock to me, block and I'll run with it
Here for the game and all the pussy that come with it
So full of focus, I'm insistent on keeping it going
The franchise, I exist in a league of my own
Expect attention unfamiliar with being ignored
The truth back, came in, locking and closing the door
Brick wall in the road, I won't move
The king, I'm like Roy in the ring, I can't lose
Show the face of what compares to mine, you want a war?
Motherfucker, I ain't hard to find, now holla back, nigga

Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunk, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get it right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?

I move when my heart say move (move, nigga)
Fierce like a lion, got nothing to prove
Stubborn as a hot damn mule, God in my corner
Nigga can't lose, trying to take me out my hot damn shoes
See how quick I jump up and give you bitches the blues
They gonna see you on the hot damn news
And that ain't even nothing, linking me to the crime
Not a print, not a hot damn clue
Beating these niggas down is what I came to do
And I ain't playing 'bout a hot damn rule
Shaking you niggas down if you ain't paying your dues
We passing up your block and ooh
My screws are loose, don't call my hands
'Cause you gonna make me act a hot damn fool
Dead discussion, you will not win
'Cause I will not lose

Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunk, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get it right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?
