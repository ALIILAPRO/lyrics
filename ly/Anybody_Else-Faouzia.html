		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say you love me
Are you lying?
Break me just to fix me
Keep me holding on
When you're lonely, I come running
But anytime I need you
Then you're gone, gone, gone
Yeah, you're gone, gone, gone

I wouldn't wish this love
Wish this love on anybody else
Wish that you were anybody else
Then I'd be on my way
How could I be so dumb?
I'd say run to anybody else
Easy when it's anybody else
So tell me why I stay?

Can we go back to a time when
You were just a stranger, and my heart was strong
It's a cruel love, never ending
Looking here for something
But it's gone, gone, gone
Yeah, it's gone, gone, gone

I wouldn't wish this love
Wish this love on anybody else
Wish that you were anybody else
Then I'd be on my way
How could I be so dumb?
I'd say run to anybody else
Easy when it's anybody else
So tell me why I stay?

With you
With you
With you
I stay
With you
With you
With you
I stay

I wouldn't wish this love
Wish this love on anybody else
Wish that you were anybody else
Then I'd be on my way
How could I be so dumb?
I'd say run to anybody else
Easy when it's anybody else
But I stay

With you
With you
With you, oh
I stay
