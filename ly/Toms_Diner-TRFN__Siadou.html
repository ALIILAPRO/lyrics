		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in
"It is always nice to see you"
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them
And instead I pour the milk

Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo

I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo

"It is always nice to see you"
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them
And instead I pour the milk
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo

I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in
