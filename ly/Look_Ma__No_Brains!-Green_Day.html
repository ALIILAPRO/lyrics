		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know much about history
'Cause I never learned how to read
Drop out I'm a knucklehead
Sick boy and I shit the bed

Maybe I'm in love with a deviant
Maybe I got terminal vertigo

Slam danced on my face again
Nonsense is my heroin
Rude boy going comatose
Drop out and I'm adios

Maybe I'm in love with a deviant
Maybe I got terminal vertigo
I defy the science of the missing link
Oh God, I think I'm gonna lose my skull

I said look ma, I ain't got no brains
I'm a goner and I don't feel no pain
I'm with stupid and I'm all by myself
'Cause I'm special and I don't need your help

Well I'm gone, gone, gone and I'm far away
(Don't panic, don't panic)
Well I lost my head and I'm here to say
(Don't go, don't go)
Oh, mama, mama, mama, ma, I'm all grown up
(Don't panic, don't panic)
Well it's too late now for my suicide

I said look ma, I ain't got no brains
I'm a goner and I don't feel no pain
I'm with stupid and I'm all by myself
'Cause I'm special and I don't need your help
