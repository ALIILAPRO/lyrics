		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't hold your breath
I don't think we got much time left
We tried our best
Maybe now we lay this to rest

The hope we had
Has fallen through our hands like sand
Do you ever think we had a chance?
Now I see it when I'm looking back

We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it's tragic
We were hopeless romantics
But I can't imagine
Falling in love with anybody else, anybody else

One last time
I wanna feel your skin touching mine
When we say goodbye
I don't wanna see you cry or put up a fight
All I ask
Is you remember all the times we had
Hope the memories they make you laugh
And you see it when you're looking back

We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it's tragic
We were hopeless romantics
But I can't imagine
Falling in love with anybody else, anybody else

We put our all in
But now we're falling
We didn't know when to call it
Now we're touching down
Put out all in
But now we've fallen
It makes sense to me now

We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it's tragic
We were hopeless romantics
And I can't imagine
You falling in love with anybody else

We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it's tragic
We were hopeless romantics
And I can't imagine
Falling in love with anybody else

Don't hold your breath
I don't think we got much time left
