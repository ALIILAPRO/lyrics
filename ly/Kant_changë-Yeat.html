		  Oh, ah
(Swiz need to pipe down)

I can't change what I said, what I did (uh, uh)
I feel like I'm runnin' circles 'round this bitch
Yeah, when I wake up, opps be callin' my phone just like one of my bitches (yeah)
One eye open when I sleep alone, can't trust nobody, that's it (yeah)
Ho, that's it (that's it), I can't trust nobody, that's it (yeah)
Ho, that's it, I can't trust nobody, that's it (yeah)
I bought a hotel, can't have this bitch know where the hell I sleep
I don't lose, bitch, I always win, I can't take defeat (go, go)

I've been on drugs for awhile (go)
I can't seem to figure it out
Got my money up, yeah, so it's fuck 'em (yeah)
I get deep up in that bitch, pull up, yeah, truck 'em (yeah)
Huh, I done hit the side on this bitch (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I can't choose (can't choose), I can't decide with these bitches
I got blues and clues about ya, can't be silent with a snitch (shh)
I just stayed down until I got so fuckin' rich, yeah (rich, rich)
They ain't seeing me, I had to relocate
No, this not CDG, this the Homme Plus way (whoa)
Huh, this ain't CMG, this a GLE
You ain't tell me what you did, tell me what you see
I done switched the inside of the coupe with peanut butter seats
I done got my money up and that bring jealousy
How you were rockin' with me, now you're hatin' on me, now you envy me?
That top tier fuck shit, I don't rock with, keep it away from me

I can't change what I said, what I did (uh, uh)
I feel like I'm runnin' circles 'round this bitch
Yeah, when I wake up, opps be callin' my phone just like one of my bitches (yeah)
One eye open when I sleep alone, can't trust nobody, that's it (yeah)
Ho, that's it (that's it), I can't trust nobody, that's it (yeah)
Ho, that's it, I can't trust nobody, that's it (yeah)
I bought a hotel, can't have this bitch know where the hell I sleep
I don't lose, bitch, I always win, I can't take defeat (go, go)

Woo, ah (go, go, go, go)
Woo, ah (go, go, go, go)
