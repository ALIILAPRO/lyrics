		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been saving my tears
I've been praying for days
That you'll see this through another round

Been staying up till it's late
Thinking 'bout my mistakes
Can you say something, just anything now

Oh, we've been stuck here in a rut now
For so long
Yeah, I know

Hoping for a little luck now
Please hold on
Oh, come on

'Cause baby I,
Will follow you anywhere

And when I look into your eyes
I know we'll make it there

Even after all the speed bumps, lies and the sorrow
I know it'll still be us by tomorrow

'Cause I,
Will follow you anywhere

Memories that we shared
They can never compare
You were laying here right next to me

That one poem you wrote
That you put in my coat
So I was to read it when we didn't agree

Oh, we've been stuck here in a rut now
For so long
Yeah, I know

Hoping for a little luck now
Please hold on
Oh, come on

'Cause baby I,
Will follow you anywhere

And when I look into your eyes
I know we'll make it there

Even after all the speed bumps, lies and the sorrow
I know it'll still be us by tomorrow

'Cause I,
Will follow you anywhere

I'm falling, I'm falling, how can I get up?
God knows I've given it all

Darling, you know that I can't get enough
Can't get enough of you now

'Cause baby I,
Will follow you anywhere

And when I look into your eyes
I know we'll make it there

Even after all the speed bumps, lies and the sorrow
I know it'll still be us by tomorrow

'Cause I,
Will follow you anywhere

(Follow you anywhere)
