		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Running from an opp, then I shoot at opp
And I'm on the block, and I'm on the block
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Hide it in my sock, selling that re-rock

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Used to sell re-rock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps
Yo, Pierre you wanna come out here?
Shooting at the opps, 'cause I run they block
Gimme top (top), in my drop top
All these hoes gon' flock (flock flock), when I drop (drop)
All these hoes gon' flock (flock flock), when I drop (drop)
All these hoes gon' flock (flock flock), when I drop

Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
All these hoes want cash, all these hoes want bags
Fucking on yo' bitch, uh I'm her dad
All these niggas sound like cash sound like cash
I'm a soldier, damn I thought I told you
Shootin' like a soldier like I'm from Magnolia
All these, niggas, always, fold
Big bank, never fold
Sippin, Act', feel that shit slowly
Bitches, on me, say she like my clothing
I'm in London, Young Carti global
Designer is on me, call it dirty laundry
All these bitches want Young Carti, Young Carti (yeah)
Young Carti, Young Carti (what)
Young Carti, Young Carti (yeah)
All of your bitches they loose, all of your bitches they loose
All of my bitches they rich, and they stay rockin' that Rick huh
Rich rich, Cash Carti bitch, rich bitch
Got a rich clique, I'm suckin' on the clit
She suckin' on the dick
Give that hoe a tip, told her buy some kicks
Then I brush my teeth, hop up in a whip
Glocky in the whip, glocky in the whip
And I'm cocky, fuckin' on a thotty
She just wanna plot me, bitch can't stop me
I'm riding in a Masi', this ain't even my Masi'
Hope that's not yo thotty, yo' bitch look like a Aunty
Walked in with Ashanti
Damn that look like Shanti, Damn that look like Carti
I think dat be Young Carti
Heard he spent a hunnid on a fucking watch piece
That's filthy

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Running from an opp, then I shoot at opp
And I'm on the block, and I'm on the block
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Hide in my sock, selling that re-rock
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Use to sell re-rock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps
Yo, Pierre you wanna come out here?
Bitch ass nigga, fuck that nigga, man!
