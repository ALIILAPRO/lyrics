		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid
Afraid to die

My fading voice sings of love
But she cries to the clicking of time
Oh, time

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Fire

And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh, drink a bit of wine, we both might go tomorrow
Oh, my love

And the rain is falling 
And I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave
Leave behind

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Fire

(It reminds me of the pain) I might leave
Leave behind

And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go
But it goes so slow, ooh-oh

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Oh-oh-oh!
(Wait in the fire, wait in the fire) yeah, yeah, ooh
(Wait in the fire, wait in the fire)
(Wait in the fire, wait in the fire)
