		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time is different
It's not like the times before
I crossed my heart, that I won't kill no more
Jesus watch over me, keep my anger at home
You better bless these wicked hands, cause they got a mind of their own

Don't go downtown

Devil whispers in my ear, "It's time your your curtain call."
So I dress myself on up with alcohol 
Step aside, step aside, oh let the whistler through
There really ain't no help at all for folks like me and you

Don't go downtown
Don't go downtown

Get your god damn hands up, don't you look at me
No one's dyin' here alone
Well I came to get it on
Let's get it on

This time is different
It's not like the times before
I crossed my heart, that I won't kill no more
