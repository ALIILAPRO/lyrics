		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is what the drugs are for
Turn the lights off on the come down
I still get emotional
When I think about your old house

Hopefully the high
Works to change my mind

Now I feel you in my room
Haven't seen you in a lifetime
What am I supposed to do
When you used to be my lifeline?

I've counted all the days
Since you walked away

Look, now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you
When all I ever do is think about you

In the middle of the night
I got caught inside a fever
Almost called a hundred times
Just to ask if you might leave her

She appears in dreams
Chasing after me

Look, now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you

Look how I just lost a friend
I'm burying your things inside my bedroom
All distractions in the end
Don't work, I'm left to sit and think about you
Like all I ever do is think about you

I'm still waiting by the phone
You painted my life indigo
A kind of blue I hate to know
Where everything turns kind of cold

Look, now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you

Look how I just lost a friend
I'm burying your things inside my bedroom
All distractions in the end
Don't work, I'm left to sit and think about you
Like all I ever do is think about you
