		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey OG, could you tell me how to find some good weed
I need it, homie, oh so bad
That last bag was the best weed I ever had
Bass so deep, I can't even seem to feel my feet
Girls so fine, I can't help it, got to make this one mine
I hit 'em with my gangsta lean
They can't separate my music from me

Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music, my music and me

Time does change, but the music it remains the same
I hit 'em with the music from the slaves
Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave
I don't want you to think I don't know
They taught me how to reach deep down and touch the soul
Without my music, where would I be?
You taught me how to cry and still remain a G
You keep a lot of soldiers at ease
And together, the next level we'll see

My music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
My music and me

Music and me
Go together, perfect harmony
Soft and mellow
Or so hard it'll make your speakers explode
Stay with me
And together we will live out this dream
My music and me

Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
My music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
Music and me
My music and me
