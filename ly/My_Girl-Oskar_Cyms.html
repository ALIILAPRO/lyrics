		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you a story
These couple things about us
We're on the way to the brand-new morning
Where you and I

You lift me up, I'm stronger now
You make me better but I question myself

Am I a fool that I love you?
I just hope I'll make it up
Could you promise me that you'll
Never break my heart?
Am I a fool that I miss you
When I'm dancin' in the dark?
But I always knew that you gonna be my girl

You've turned the night into a daylight
The whispers in my head died away
I closed thе door to the past that hurts us
Will never comе back again

You lift me up, I'm stronger now
You make me better but I question myself

Am I a fool that I love you?
I just hope I'll make it up
Could you promise me that you'll
Never break my heart?
Am I a fool that I miss you
When I'm dancin' in the dark?
But I always knew that you gonna be my girl

Ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Could you promise me that you'll
Never break my heart?
But I always knew that you gonna be my girl
My girl
