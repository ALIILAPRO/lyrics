		  Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Old Miss Lucy's dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Old Miss Lucy's dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Old Miss Lucy's dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Green Sally up and green Sally down
Last one squat, gotta tear the ground

Old Miss Lucy's dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan
