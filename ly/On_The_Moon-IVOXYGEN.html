		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had a good thing going now you're gone
I still feel your body on mine
Yea I got out every other night
Just tryna have a good time
I thought I was trying to have a good Time
But I was just tryna get you off my mind
Drinking to forget about the night
Maybe I could keep the liquor down this time (Down)
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liquor down this time (Down)
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liquor down this time
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liqour down this time (Down)
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liqour down this time
You brightened up my skies
Now Im sleeping alone at night
Why is it that every single time that I asked you why
You be entertaining all them other guys
I Guess I was rolling with a fake
Pretty face, slim waist, no trace
Of a heart
She was down only for her from the start
I Guess I was rolling with a fake
Pretty face, slim waist, no trace
Of a heart
She was down only for her from the start
We had a good thing going now you're gone
I still feel your body on mine
Yea I got out every other night
Just tryna have a good time
I thought I was trying to have a good Time
But I was tryna get you off my mind
Drinking to forget about the night
Maybe I could keep the liquor down this time (Down)
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liquor down this time (Down)
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liquor down this time
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liquor down this time (Down)
Down this time (Down)
Down this time yeah
Maybe i could keep the liqour down this time
You were my escape
Now from you I'm tryna run away
The way you did me I was feeling like I had to get away
But you weren't up for the chase
I Guess I was rolling with a fake
Pretty face, slim waist, no trace
Of a heart
She was down only for her from the start
I Guess I was rolling with a fake
Pretty face, slim waist, no trace
Of a heart
She was down only for her from the start
