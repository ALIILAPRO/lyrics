		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think about love, think about hate
Think about gain fame, why I'm always late?
Think about tonight, what I'm gonna do
But I just can't concentrate cause I'm thinking about you

Think about money, think what I own
Spent it on a car with a cool, cool stereo
And I'm sitting in traffic, wishing it would move
Should be thinking about a chopper, I'm thinking about you

Thinking about you
Thinking about you now
Think about your touch, think about your kiss
Feeling like a kid again, total utter bliss

Thinking about you
Thinking about you now
Think about your touch, think about your kiss
Feeling like a kid again, total utter bliss

Think about my holidays, think of the raves
Think about dancing and sailing in the waves
Now think about the time and the place where we met
Swimming in the sea and your hair was all wet

Think about colors, think about sex
Think about your body, how it moves in that dress
Think about your touch, think about your kiss
Feeling like a kid again, total utter bliss
Total utter bliss
Total utter bliss
Total utter bliss
Total utter bliss

Thinking about you
Thinking about you now
Thinking about you
Thinking about you now
Thinking about you
Thinking about you now
Think about your touch, think about your kiss
Feeling like a kid again, total utter bliss

Thinking about you
Thinking about you now
Think about your touch, think about your kiss
Feeling like a kid again, total utter bliss
