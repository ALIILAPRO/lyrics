		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, baby
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

Ooh, baby
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

Ooh, baby
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

Ooh, baby
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

Ooh, baby
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

Ooh, baby
I feel right, the music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
