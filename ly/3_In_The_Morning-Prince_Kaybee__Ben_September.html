		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three in the morning, Hear you calling
Late night talking I keep falling

You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know

Three in the morning, Hear you calling
Late night talking I keep falling

You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know

You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know

Three, The morning, Feel the love
Nights get cold, Sleep no more
Got to go, Hit the road
Hit the mall, Late night show

You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know

You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know

You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know

Three in the morning, Hear you calling
Late night talking, I keep falling

You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
You know, You know
