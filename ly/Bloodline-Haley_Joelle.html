		<p>
		  You're getting older now[00:15.09]I see the lines around your smile[00:18.17]I see what's coming 'round the corner[00:21.27]And that's a lot for an only child[00:24.36]Cuz I don't know yet[00:27.30]If I want kids of my own[00:30.32]But I know that if I don't[00:33.01]It ends with me[00:35.19]If I had a sister or a brother[00:41.83]We could share the burden with each other[00:48.13]Cuz one day you'll be gone[00:51.34]Then I'll be gone too[00:53.96]Don't know if I'll carry it on[00:57.51]Oh but someday if I do[01:00.33]Then our family name[01:03.36]It won't just be mine[01:06.34]And I'll see your face[01:09.50]When I'm looking in their eyes[01:12.36]But that's only[01:14.07]If I carry on your bloodline[01:18.21]I'm only 23[01:21.11]I've got my whole life left to live[01:24.16]I know I shouldn't think like this[01:27.00]But I can't help it[01:30.47]You were 43[01:32.24]When you had me[01:33.75]You took your time[01:35.23]But that took mine[01:36.76]And soon you'll leave[01:38.32]Then it's just me[01:39.93]Left on the family tree[01:42.30]One day you'll be gone[01:45.32]Then I'll be gone too[01:47.94]Don't know if I'll carry it on[01:51.46]Oh but someday if I do[01:54.30]Then our family name[01:57.32]It won't just be mine[02:00.31]And I'll see your face[02:03.45]When I'm looking in their eyes[02:06.29]But that's only[02:08.05]If I carry on your bloodline[02:13.78]Oooo[02:17.62]Ahhh[02:20.61]Ahhh[02:24.31]One day you'll be gone[02:27.08]And then I'll be gone too[02:30.15]If I don't carry it on[02:33.43]They'll be nothing left of you[02:36.17]And it's a heavy weight[02:39.15]That I feel all the time[02:42.30]Not having a way[02:45.62]To remember you by[02:49.38]If I don't carry on your bloodline
