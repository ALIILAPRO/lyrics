		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Finally, I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly, that will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment (ah)
My modern manifesto (ah)
I'm doing it for all of us (ah)
Who never got the chance
For a handful
And all my birds of paradise
Who never got to fly at night
'Cause they were caught up in the dens

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off but I keep riding the ride
I never really notice that I had to decide
To play someone's game or to live my own life and now I do
I want to move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into to the blue (into the blue)

Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the crawling way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discerning
And knew as we found out
We're not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows (ah)
And hoping for an end to them (ah)
Their arches are illusions (ah)
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them
There's nothing to hold on to
The colors used to lure you in
And put you in a trance
(Yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off but I keep riding the ride
I never really notice that I had to decide
To play someone's game or to live my own life and now I do
I want to move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
