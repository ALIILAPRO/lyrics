		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this is to end in fire may we slow burn together
My soul cries out when you cry and that’s been forever
You’ve been clearly gone for some time I’m just realizing that
Cause once you say this is the end it’s the end and there’s no coming back
That’s just a fact
So it gone take all of me to show you what lies underneath
Its gone take all of me
To bridge all the cracks we can’t see
You say what's wrong sometimes we fight
But girl in the end we fucking through the night
So it's gone take all of me
To show you you're all that I bleed no
You said you been to the sky
But see girl you can’t fly
You just got way to much pride
It’ll be our demise
When we let the fears of our peers dictate things
Is when we where destined to lose all we gained
So I’ll take the blame let’s just leave it at that
I’ll jump into hell for you that just a fact
So it gone take all of me to show you what lies underneath
It gone take all of me
To bridge all the cracks we can’t see
You say what's wrong sometimes we fight
But girl in the end we fucking through the night
So it's gone take all of me
To show you you're all that I bleed no
Girl I pray we find the time
To address the tears and lies
Cause your always on my mind
No
Cause I haven’t ate in weeks
And the devil trying to feed
On this lonely soul tonight
Ohh
