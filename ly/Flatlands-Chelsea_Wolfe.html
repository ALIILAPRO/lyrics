		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want flatlands
I never cared about
Money and all its friends
I want flatlands

I want flatlands
I don't want precious stones
I never cared about
Anything you've ever owned
I want flatlands
I want simplicity
I need your arms
Wrapped hard around me

I want open plains
And scattered trees
I want flower fields
I want salty seas
I want flatlands
Soft and steady breeze
Bringing scents of
Lined-up orchard trees
Dripping heavy
With pears and dancing leaves
I want flatlands
Will you go there with me?

When it's said in the dark
And you know it's always there
When it's there in your heart
But your mind is unafraid
When it's said in the dark
And you know it's never coming back
When it's there in your heart
In your mind, you set it free
