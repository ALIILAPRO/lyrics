		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put it down now, let me see the cash
Put your ass out, let me see the crash
Watch the world spin, I'ma smoke the stash
I'm a bad bitch, you're a bitch that's bad
I'm a habit, you're a random girl
In the bathroom snorting on the windowsill
You work in fashion, you got time to kill
It's the weekend, but you feel weaker still
Watch them clapping, it's another show
Watch them glisten like their underwater gills are leaking
You in the mosh pit swirl and you geekin'
It's another world

If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman, a woman is a God

If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman, a woman is a God

Pick it up now, it's time to move
You look sluggish, you gotta make a bruise
They know your name now, you try to keep your cool
But the moment's passed, your momentum stills
In the back of the line at the club on your block
With no friends, just your phone at your ear
Try to make it seem like someone cares about you still
And that someone's really real
You're in the club now, dark room, perfume
You're in love now with being you
Well, you move so gracefully like glass
Yeah, your feet can really dance

If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman, a woman is a God

If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman, a woman is a God

Oh, you wanna dance? Ooh, ooh, ooh
This track is a smash, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm taking off my skin, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm speaking from within, ooh, ooh, ooh (ha)

Oh, you wanna dance? Ooh, ooh, ooh
This track is a smash, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm taking off my skin, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm speaking from within, ooh, ooh, ooh

If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman, a woman is a God

If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman, a woman is a God
