		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm

I'm over the top, so what
I'm just tryna give 'em all the what they want (ah)
No, I ain't hard to love
They know a thing like me is once in a lifetime

Spotlight on me even when we laying in the dark
I don't even mind 'em seeing all my battle scars
Couple twists and turns they took me straight to where we are
Outta the ashes, I'm coming alive

I think that's why they eyein' me
Watchin' me
My legacy
I took it to the top
From the start
Never stop

I ain't going nowhere, I'm an icon
When all them other nobodies are long gone
I don't even need to turn the mic on
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya 

Damn, I got it
I'm iconic

Chasing the footsteps
You're tryna act too blessed
Tryin' too hard na, na, ooh, ooh
But you best better stay calm
Stop trying be too on

Damn, I got it
I'm iconic

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Damn, I got it
I'm iconic

Don't gotta tell me twice (mm)
I'm just tryna give 'em all the what they like (like)
Got me so up, I'm fly
Up in a lifted state of mind

Imagine you living the high life
Every second of your life
Everything better I'm loving the view from the high rise
Even when it's high tide
I know that you wanna
Get into the middle of my ocean
You gotta

Gimme all my props 'cause
Baby, I'm a hustla
When they talk about me, they all saying "Oh, I love her!"
I ain't seeing no lies
Look here, I'm the highlight
If you had my love
You'd love me for your whole life

I think that's why they eyein' me
Watchin' me
My legacy
I took it to the top
From the start
Never stop

I ain't going nowhere, I'm an icon
When all them other nobodies are long gone
I don't even need to turn the mic on
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya 

Damn, I got it
I'm iconic

Chasing the footsteps
You're tryna act too blessed
Tryin' too hard na, na, ooh, ooh
But you best better stay calm
Stop trying be too on

Damn, I got it
I'm iconic (oh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Damn, I got it
I'm iconic
