		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want no, want no knockoff
Want that real shit, real authentic
I don't want no, want no fake love
Want that real shit, real authentic

What is it boy? (Qu'est-ce que c'est?)
Trailer park or (real estate)
I can't take no (more mistakes)
Polyester (hurts my skin)
Tell me what you'd (wrap me in)
Synthetic or (genuine)

I want that real thing
Baby, you look to me like you're the 
Real thing (I wanna know)
Am I dreaming?
How are you gonna prove to me that you're the 
Real thing? (I wanna know)

I don't want no (don't want no)
Want no knockoff (no knockoff)
Want that real shit (that real shit)
Real authentic
I don't want no 
Want no fake love 
Want that real shit 
Real authentic

What is it boy? (Qu'est-ce que c'est?)
Trailer park or (real estate)
I can't take no (more mistakes)
Polyester (hurts my skin)
Tell me what you'd (wrap me in)
Synthetic or (genuine)

I want that real thing
Baby, you look to me like you're the 
Real thing (I wanna know)
Am I dreaming?
How are you gonna prove to me that you're the 
Real thing? (I wanna know)

I don't want no (don't want no)
Want no knockoff (no knockoff)
Want that real shit (that real shit)
Real authentic (authentic)
I don't want no (don't want no)
Want no fake love (no fake love)
Want that real shit (that real shit)
Real authentic (authentic)

Used to be scared of something real
I'm ready now, I'm ready
I'm laying bare for you to steal
I'm ready now, I'm ready

I want that real thing
Baby, you look to me like you're the 
Real thing (I wanna know)
Am I dreaming?
How are you gonna prove to me that you're the 
Real thing? (I wanna know)

I don't w- (don't want no)
Want no k- (no knockoff)
Want that real- (that real shit)
Real auth- (authentic)
I don't want- (don't want no)
Want no f- (no fake love)
Want that real- (that real shit)
Real authentic (authentic)
