		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I don't wanna know)
(Oh baby, I don't wanna know)

I think about it when I hold you
Is there someone else you'd rather see?
I don't need to know the truth
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe

Did he touch you better than me?
Did he watch you fall asleep?
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way
Baby, more than I can say
Just wanna do your thing

'Cause baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe

Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things that you used to do me?
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby, more than I can say (more than I can say)
Just wanna do your thing

'Cause baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
