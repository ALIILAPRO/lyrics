		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went to Paris (Texas)
With a suitcase in my hand
I had to leave
Knew they wouldn't understand

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
Then the more you know
It's time to go

I took a trip to Spain
Just a notebook in my hand
Then I went to see some friends of mine
Down in Florence, Alabama

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
That it's time to leave
Like the summer breeze

When everyones' star's bright
Brighter than you are
It's time to go
And you're the only one left
Dancing while they're on the floor
Time to go

I flew back home
It seemed everything the same (Venice, California)
Except that you weren't home
"Hello," I call to no one, but

When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
You're home, when you're alone
When you're right, you're right
When you're right, you're right
Even when you're wrong
