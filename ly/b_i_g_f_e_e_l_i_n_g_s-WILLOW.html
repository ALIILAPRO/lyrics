		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have such big feelings
Can't shut 'em down without a sound
I have such big feelings
Can't shut 'em down or let 'em out

I know I'm not fine
But, yes, I say I'm fine
I know I'm not fine
But, yes, I say-

I have such big feelings
Can't shut 'em down or let 'em out
I have such big feelings
Can't shut 'em down without a sound

Acceptance is the key
Acceptance gives me wings
Acceptance is the key
Acceptance gives me wings

Even with such big feelings
I have such big feelings
Can't shut 'em down or let 'em out

I know I have, I know you have problems
I know I have, I know you have problems
I know I have, I know you have problems
You know I have, I have big, big problems

I know I have, I know you have problems
I know I have, I know you have problems, problems
Yes, I have problems, problems
Yes, I have

You know I'm not fine
But, yes, I say I'm fine
You know I'm not fine
But, yes, I say I'm fine

I got such big feelings
Can't shut 'em down without a sound
I got such big feelings
Can't shut 'em down or let 'em out

Acceptance is the key
Acceptance gives me wings
Acceptance is the key
Acceptance is what I need

'Cause I know you got, I know I got problems
I know I got, I know you got problems
I know I got, I know you got problems
I know I got, I know you got problems, problems
Yes, I have so many problems, problems, problems
Yes, I have so many problems
