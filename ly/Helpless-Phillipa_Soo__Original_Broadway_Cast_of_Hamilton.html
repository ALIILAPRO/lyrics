		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I do, I do (hey, hey, hey) 
I do, I do (hey, hey, hey)
Hey (hey, hey, hey)
Ooh, I do, I do (hey, hey, hey)
I do, I do (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Boy, you got me helpless
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went boom
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
Grab my sister, and whisper
Yo, this one's mine

(Ooh) my sister made her way across the room to you 
And I got nervous, thinking, what's she gonna do? (Ooh)
She grabs you by the arm, I'm thinkin', I'm through (ooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm helpless

Oh, look at those eyes, oh (look into your eyes and the sky's the limit)
I'm helpless, I know
(Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em)
(Helpless) I'm so into you 
(Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit) I am so into you
I'm helpless
I know I'm down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

Where are you taking me?
I'm about to change your life
Then by all means, lead the way

Elizabeth Schuyler
It's a pleasure to meet you
Schuyler?
My sister
Thank you for all your service
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it
I'll leave you to it

One week later
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem

I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him (ha!)

Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
'Cause there's nothing that your mind can't do

My father makes his way across the room to you (ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking we're through (ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says, "Be true" (ooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm (helpless)

Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless (helpless)
Down for the count (woo) and I'm drownin' in 'em 
(Helpless) that boy is mine, that boy is mine
(Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit)
(I'm helpless) I'm so helpless
Down for the count (yuh) and I'm drownin' in 'em 

Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God you'll never feel so

(Helpless) I do, I do, I do, I do
Eliza
I do, I do, I do, I do
I never felt so (hey)
(Yeah, yeah) I'm down for the count
Said I'm down for the count, I'm
Yo, my life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it (helpless)
I look into your eyes and the sky's the limit, I'm (helpless)
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
Helpless
