		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep lookin' for somethin' I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feelin' like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
