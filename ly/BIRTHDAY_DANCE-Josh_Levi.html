		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sittin' here on your birthday
Didn't even know your first name
See your cups goin' empty
Can I fill you up tonight?
Sittin' here on your birthday (birthday)
But it seems like the worst day
Let me make you feel okay (okay)
Can I take you home tonight?

I don't know your plans
I don't know where you're goin'
All that I know is
I like the way you

Dance, dance, dance
And do your little dance, dance, dance
You know it, dance, dance, dance
I love it when you dance, dance, dance
Come show me, dance, dance, dance
And do your little dance, dance, dance
You know it, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I like it when you dance, dance, dance

The minute I saw you
You know why I locked right into your eyes (eyes)
I'm mesmerized, can you tell me why?
All by yourself
In the corner without a ride (ride)
Let me take you there, I'll be your prayer

I don't know your plans
I don't know where you're goin'
All that I know is
I like the way you

Dance, dance, dance
And do your little dance, dance, dance
You know it, dance, dance, dance
I love it when you dance, dance, dance
Come show me, dance, dance, dance
And do your little dance, dance, dance
You know it, dance, dance, dance
I like it when you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
And do your little dance, dance, dance (oh)
You know it, dance, dance, dance
I love it when you dance, dance, dance
Come show me, dance, dance, dance (oh)
And do your little dance, dance, dance
You know it, dance, dance, dance (yeah, yeah)
I like it when you dance, dance, dance
Do your dance
