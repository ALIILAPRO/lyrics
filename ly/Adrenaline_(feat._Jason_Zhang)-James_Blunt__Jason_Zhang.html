		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was so unprepared
Forgive me if I stop and stare
Like my first lung of air
I was here, and you were there

You're hitting me harder than a million goodbyes
And this isn't a heart attack, but I feel it inside

Like a shot straight to my heart
Adrenaline, adrenaline
Like a flashbang in the dark
Adrenaline, adrenaline
I take just one look at you
And I think I'm bulletproof
When you hold me in your arms
Adrenaline, adrenaline

It's all a blur, in colored lights
Two bodies moving, but just one mind
You cut me open from inside out
You lift me up and knock me down

You're hitting me harder than (hitting me harder) a million goodbyes
And this isn't a heart attack, but I feel it inside

Like a shot straight to my heart
Adrenaline, adrenaline
Like a flashbang in the dark
Adrenaline, adrenaline
And take just one look in you
And I think I'm bulletproof
When you hold me in your arms
Adrenaline, adrenaline

And I don't care if I overdose
'Til I'm comatose
I don't care, I don't care
Let me stare 'til I overload
There's no antidote
I don't care, I don't care

Like a shot straight through my heart
Adrenaline, adrenaline
Like a flashbang in the dark
Adrenaline, adrenaline
I take just one look in you
And I think I'm bulletproof
When you hold me in your arms
Adrenaline, adrenaline

Like a shot straight to my heart
Adrenaline, adrenaline
Like a flashbang in the dark
Adrenaline, adrenaline
I take just one look at you
And I think I'm bulletproof
When you hold me in your arms
Adrenaline, adrenaline
