		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrote a letter
Did you read it alone?
Does it matter
If we speak on the phone?

Lie to me, lie to me
Tell me anything, just lie to me
'Cause all I need, all I need
Anything you give is everything

For all of those times, the ones we can't win
Well it's about time we got a bloodrush in
And I really don't mind whatever you did
'Cause it's about time we got a bloodrush in

Try to settle
Here with you over there
In the middle
And we're struggling for air, for air

Lie to me, lie to me
Tell me anything, just lie to me
All I need, all I need
Anything you give is everything

For all of those times, the ones we can't win
Well it's about time we got a bloodrush in
And I really don't mind whatever you did
'Cause it's about time we got a bloodrush in

Holding on is all we've known
I've got a feeling I can't waste
Try to fight, all along
Free your shoulders from the weight

For all of those times, the ones we can't win
Well it's about time we got a bloodrush in
And I really don't mind whatever you did
'Cause it's about time we got a bloodrush in

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
'Cause it's about time we got a bloodrush in
