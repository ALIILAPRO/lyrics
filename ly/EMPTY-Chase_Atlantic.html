		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red pill, help me get my words out
Blue pill, won't you help me calm down?
The green pill doesn't really do shit
It barely gets me higher than this music
New pills colour of my Off-White
You still think about those old times
I've been sober 48 hours
I don't feel euphoria, no, I feel empty

New house, new car
I feel empty
You win, gold star
I feel empty
No lungs, no heart
I feel empty

Uh, tell me why the fuck I feel so empty?
This might be the reason that she left me
Mama, what's the reason I feel empty?
I might pop another, please don't tempt me
Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty

I feel empty
I feel empty
I feel empty

Old friends turning into strangers
Newer friends, they're becoming dangerous
Her friends never really liked me
They'll do anything they can to spite me
Five friends, count 'em on my left
Knife end, walking like a dead man
I've been sober 48 hours
I don't feel euphoria now

I feel empty
New house, new car
I feel empty
You win, gold star
I feel empty
No love, no heart
I feel empty

Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty
This might be the reason that she left me
Mama, what's the reason I feel empty?
I might pop another, please don't tempt me
Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty

I feel empty
I feel empty
I feel empty

Empty
I feel empty
Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty
This might be the reason that she left me
Mama, what's the reason I feel empty?
I might pop another, please don't tempt me

Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty
This might be the reason that she left me
Mama, what's the reason I feel empty?
I might pop another, please don't tempt me
Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty

I feel empty
I feel empty
I feel empty 

Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty
This might be the reason that she left me
Mama, what's the reason I feel empty?
I might pop another, please don't tempt me
Tell me why the fuck I feel so empty
I feel empty
I feel empty
I feel empty
