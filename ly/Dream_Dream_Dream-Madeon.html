		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hardly explain
All of this love
You're keeping me sane
My love
I'm finally recovered

'Cause I got you to adore
Nothing is true
Anymore
What I've been through isn't much
Your heart can heal the pain

'Cause I've got you to adore
Nothing is true
Anymore
What you've been through let it go
Your heart can heal the pain

I feel the weight of my dreams
I feel the weight of my dreams
I feel the weight of my dreams
I feel the weight of my dreams
I feel the weight of my dreams
I feel the weight of my dreams
I feel the weight of my dreams

'Cause I got you to adore
Nothing is true
Anymore
What I've been through isn't much
Your heart can heal the pain
