		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out that house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, out of control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies, it's on
And poppin' tonight 'cause it's meant to be ours

We keep a fade-away shot
'Cause we ballin' it's Platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl, you the drink with all that goodie power, 'cause

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Hey, shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like their number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Franklins

A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand

She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me
Like, "Damn it, I know you"
You wanna shoot like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Yeah, I'm spendin' my money (ah), I'm out of control (ah)
Somebody help me, she takin' my bank roll
But I'm king of the club (ah) and I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down

You spin my head right round, right round 
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down (ah)

You spin my head right round, right round (ah)
When you go down, when you go down down (ah)
You spin my head right round, right round (ah)
When you go down, when you go down down
