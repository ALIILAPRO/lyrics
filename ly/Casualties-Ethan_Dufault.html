		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby
I'm not running from the casualties
'Cause it might hurt, but it's not bad for me
'Cause we're living in a masterpiece
Lately
When life is moving way too fast for me
I've been taking off my mask to see
That we're living in a masterpiece
We built houses on top of all the hills and mountains
But I'm not scared to fall from here
When I have your hand in mine
Maybe we'll look back and
See our dreams from far away
That we had all that we could need to be happy
If we could do this different
We would choose it all the same
Cause we have all that we could need to be happy
We could need to be happy
We could need
Baby
When our world was falling painfully
And there was nothing left to make-believe
I stayed with you, you stayed with me
Changing
All the ways I thought it had to be
'Cause I don't have to live so tactfully
Oh, we're living in a masterpiece
We built houses on top of all the hills and mountains
But I'm not scared to fall from here
When I have your hand in mine
Maybe we'll look back and
See our dreams from far away
That we had all that we could need to be happy
If we could do this different
We would choose it all the same
Cause we have all that we could need to be happy
Oh
Oh, I'm happy when I have your hand in mine
Maybe we'll look back and
See our dreams from far away
That we had all that we could need to be happy
If we could do this different
We would choose it all the same
'Cause we have all that we could need to be happy
