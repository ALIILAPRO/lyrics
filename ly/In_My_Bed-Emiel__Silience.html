		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up beside you
No idea what we did last night
But I know I liked it
When did we decide to
Do this for the hundredth time
When we'll deny it
Never had no intention
I wanted just a connection
I'm pulling your body close to mine

Started off with objection
Now we got no discretion
Only meant to be one night
So why you still in my bed?
Why you still in my bed?

Never had no intention
I wanted just a connection
I'm pulling your body close to mine
Started off with objection
Now we got no discretion
Only meant to be one night
So why you still in my bed?
Why you still in my bed?

Can't deny it
Can't help that I like it
You got me all night yeah
No more hiding
Don't wanna be private
I'm done with the lying

Never had no intention
I wanted just a connection
I'm pulling your body close to mine
Started off with objection
Now we got no discretion
Only meant to be one night
So why you still in my bed?

Never had no intention
I wanted just a connection
I'm pulling your body close to mine
Started off with objection
Now we got no discretion
Only meant to be one night
So why you still in my bed?
