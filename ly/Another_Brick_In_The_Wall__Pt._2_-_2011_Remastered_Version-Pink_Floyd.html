		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

Wrong, do it again
Wrong, do it again
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
You, yes
You, behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy
