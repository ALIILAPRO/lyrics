		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I step into the club, drop it like it's hot
DJ, turn it up from the bottom to the top
You've got to move with it, step with it, no limit

When I step into the club, drop it like it's hot
DJ, turn it up from the bottom to the top
When you see me in the club, the party on lock
DJ, turn it up, rock your body, don't stop
When I step into the club, drop it like it's hot
DJ, turn it up from the bottom to the top
You've got to move with it, step with it, no limit

When I step into the club, drop it like it's hot
DJ, turn it up from the bottom to the top
When you see me in the club, the party on lock
DJ, turn it up, rock your body, don't stop
When I step into the club, drop it like it's hot
DJ, turn it up from the bottom to the top
You've got to move with it, step with it, no limit

When I step into the club, drop it like it's hot
DJ, turn it up from the bottom to the top
When you see me in the club, the party on lock
DJ, turn it up, rock your body, don't stop
When I step into the club, drop it like it's hot

You've got to move with it, step with it, no limit
