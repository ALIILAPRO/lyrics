		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He let me in so easily
Said eat the apple from the tree
It was a game I couldn’t see no no
Let my desire hold me
The price to pay was lonely
Oh why oh why it gotta be so so

Killed the cat, just like that
Curiosity done
Guarantee, tit for tat
Took a bite I know that
Locked me up, tossed the key
Can’t escape or break free
Here he comes oh comin for me
About to run in two, three
Killed the cat, just like that
Curiosity done
Guarantee, tit for tat
Don’t you think I know that
Locked me up, tossed the key
Can’t escape or break free

When I walk down the street I see
Somebody staring at me
What I have done they cannot see no no
Facing oh my reality
While he’s there coming to get me
My sins oh why they gotta be so so
Reality, I couldn’t see
Bound and chained up by my 
Insanity, insecurity
Left no judge or jury
Locked me up, tossed the key
Can’t escape or break free

Killed the cat, just like that
Curiosity done
Guarantee, tit for tat
Took a bite I know that
Locked me up, tossed the key
Can’t escape or break free
Here he comes oh comin for me
About to run in two, three
Killed the cat, just like that
Curiosity done
Guarantee, tit for tat
Don’t you think I know that
Locked me up, tossed the key
Can’t escape or break free

Killed the cat, just like that
Curiosity done
Guarantee, tit for tat
Took a bite I know that
Locked me up, tossed the key
Can’t escape or break free
Here he comes oh comin for me
About to run in two, three
