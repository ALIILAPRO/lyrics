		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm coming round to open the blinds
You can't hide here any longer
My god you need to rinse those puffy eyes
You can't lie still any longer
And yes they'll ask where you've been
And you'll have to tell them, again and again

And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day
But I promise you you'll see the sun again
And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness
And I promise you you'll see the sun again

Come on take my hand
We're going for a walk, I know you can
You can wear anything, as long as it's not black
Please don't mourn forever, she's not coming back
And yes they'll ask where you've been
And you'll have to tell them again and again

And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day
But I promise you you'll see the sun again
Abd you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness
And I promise you you'll see the sun again
And I promise you you'll see the sun again

Do you remember telling me you'd found the sweetest thing of all
You said that one day of this was worth dying for
So be thankful you kew her at all
But it's no more

And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day
But I promise you  you'll see the sun again
And you're asking me why pains the only way to happiness
And I promise you you'll see the sun again
And I promise you you'll see the sun again
