		  Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-ooh-oh-ooh
Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-ooh-oh-ooh

Life just sucks when all you know is the bottom
It's not your choice, there's no escaping it
Get up and run as far as you can
Head to higher ground while there's a chance to live

Don't run away, run away, run away
Don't run away, run away (run)

Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself, I know
Can't hear what you're shouting, I'm deaf to your show
It's easy to lose your self control
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
Life can be such overdose
Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself, I know, in the in between

Life's so dark when every day is a struggle
Why go out and see the world on fire?
Don't let your mindset become what controls you
Speak right now and make the choice to grow

Don't run away, run away, run away
Don't run away, run away (run)

Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself, I know
Can't hear what you're shouting, I'm deaf to your show
It's easy to lose your self control
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
Life can be such overdose
Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself, I know, in the in between, oh
In the in between

I won't let pain get in my way
I can't have silence claiming me
We have strength in numbers, strength in numbers
To get us through the day
No compromises to be made
This is a war we're gonna win
We have strength in numbers, strength in numbers
To get us through the day

Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself, I know
Can't hear what you're shouting, I'm deaf to your show
It's easy to lose your self control
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
Life can be such overdose
Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself, I know, in the in between

Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-ooh-oh-ooh
In the in between
Whoa-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Whoa-ooh-oh-ooh
In the in between
