		  Ur perfect I hate it
V1
You know i didn’t expect this to be something
Hoped one day I’d wake up and you would be nothing to me
But this Sunday it’ll be 10 months and
I’d be lying if I said that didn’t scare the shit outta me
Pre
But I’m tongue tied
Cause you love me and my litto dark mind
Didn’t run away when you saw inside
I tried to keep you away but I gotta
face it
I like what we have don’t want to stain it
Fuck I think I’m gonna have to stay in this
I gotta face it
You’re perfect I hate it
V2
Figured that I’d self sabotage by now
I get so scared of problems that I haven’t even found yet
I’m sick of looking for an easy way out
Cause the truth is if this blows up it’ll still be worth it to me
Pre
Yeah I’m tongue tied
Cause you love me and my little dark mind
You didn’t run away when you saw inside
I tried, to push you away
But I gotta face it
I like what we have don’t want to stain it
Fuck I think I’m gonna have to stay in this
I gotta face it
You’re perfect, I hate it
