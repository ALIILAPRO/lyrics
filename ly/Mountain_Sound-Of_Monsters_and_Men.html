		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I had caused with my two hands
Alone we traveled on with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away

Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran (deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran

Some hid scars and some hid scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran (deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran

Whoa
We sleep until the sun goes down
Whoa
We sleep until the sun goes down

Whoa
We sleep until the sun goes down

Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran (deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran

Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran (deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now (we sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran

La la la, whoa, la la la
We sleep until the sun goes down
La la la, whoa whoa, la la la
We sleep until the sun goes
