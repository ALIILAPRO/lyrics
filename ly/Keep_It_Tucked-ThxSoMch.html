		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This drum gon' beat, but not for long 
I held my breath, you held your tongue 
Flowers and wreaths when it's all done 
Never knowing where I'm going, bitch, I keep it tucked

This drum gon' beat, but not for long 
I held my breath, you held your tongue 
Flowers and wreaths when it's all done 
Never knowing where I'm going, bitch, I keep it tucked

Fuck a sentimental bitch 
Where's my motherfuckin' gun
You gave my cheques, I gave you none 
Turn me on, yeah
I faked a smile just like you wanted 
And if I'm never sober give a fuck bout what I do? 
And if she got a problem tell that hoe to come and kill me 
I'm dead (dead)

Out here 
Oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah (oh, yeah)

This drum gon' beat, but not for long 
I held my breath, you held your tongue 
Flowers and wreaths when it's all done 
Never knowing where I'm going, bitch, I keep it tucked

This drum gon' beat, but not for long 
I held my breath, you held your tongue 
Flowers and wreaths when it's all done 
Never knowing where I'm going, bitch, I keep it tucked

Bitch, I keep it tucked 
Bitch, I keep it right here 
Liable to trip 
That's just my anxiety, whatever happens, happens
Babe, just know I did psychiatry 
So if I OD while I fuck you, that was my assignment 
She call me lovely 
I call it my money 
I wanna scream and burn it up until I fucking bleed
And if I'm never sober give a fuck bout what I do? 
And if she got a problem tell that hoe to come and kill me 
I'm dead

Out here 
Oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah (oh, yeah)

This drum gon' beat, but not for long 
I held my breath, you held your tongue 
Flowers and wreaths when it's all done 
Never knowing where I'm going, bitch, I keep it tucked

This drum gon' beat, but not for long 
I held my breath, you held your tongue 
Flowers and wreaths when it's all done 
Never knowing where I'm going, b-b-bitch, bitch, I
