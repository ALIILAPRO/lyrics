		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed, oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling, I don't know where else I can go, over and over
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
You see the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me
Sad veiled bride please be happy, handsome groom give her room
Loud loutish lover treat her kindly though she needs you
More than she loves you
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go, over, over

I know it's over and it never really began but in my heart it was so real
And she even spoke to me and said
If you're so funny, then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so very entertaining why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so very good looking, why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know, 'cause tonight is just like any other night, that's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms, while they're in each other's arms
It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes strength to be gentle
And kind, over, over, over

It's so easy to laugh it's so easy to hate it takes guts to be gentle
And kind, over and over
Love is natural and real, but not for you my love not tonight my love
Love is natural and real, but not for such as you and I my love, oh mother

I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head, oh yes
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel
