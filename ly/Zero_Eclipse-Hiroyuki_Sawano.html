		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had wandered the walls forever
But came upon a way for my return
Heard your name in a conversation
Your kindness I'd yet to learn
Life has been like an endless nightmare
And now your light it leads me home again
Is it fate to be smashed to pieces?
If you go, we go together

Now you are a part of me
I will defend and honor thee
Jealousy will get me into trouble
Since I met you kid my blades are double!

Sad am I to never hear you sigh
Of ecstasy and fingertips
You're trembling, we share a kiss
Our worlds eclipse

You're bigger, bigger!
Why do you hide?
I will shiver, shiver!
It's suicide!
But if there's no desire
To get back out alive
You're a zero!

You're bigger, bigger!
Why do you ride?
I will shiver shiver!
Into the fire!
You just get out alive!
We'll let our worlds collide
We are bigger!

Close my eyes and I see the fallen
They threw the stones to make us go away
It was only the face of anger and kindness
It lit my way
Ain't no picnic to be abandoned
It led us here, we had to share the pain
Is it fate to be smashed to pieces?
If you go, we go together

Now you are a part of me
I will defend and honor thee
Did you think that you could die a hero?
Our awakening means less than zero!

Sad am I to never hear you sigh
Of ecstasy and fingertips
You're trembling, we share a kiss
Our worlds eclipse

Black sugar
Keep it
Up 'till the dawn
You're the trigger
Killer
Eye of the storm
But if there's no desire
To get back out alive
You're a hero?

You're bigger, bigger!
Why do you ride?
I will shiver shiver!
Into the fire!
You just get out alive!
We'll let our worlds collide
We are bigger!

Make a promise that I cannot regret
As long as I can see you but in secret
I'll never, I'll never forget my feeling, no!
I'll never, I'll never learn how to let you go

Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh, wow-oh-oh, wow-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh, wow-oh-oh, wow-oh-oh-oh-oh

You're bigger, bigger!
Why do you hide?
I will shiver, shiver!
Into the fire!
But if there's no desire
To get back out alive
You're a zero

Make a promise that I cannot regret
As long as I can see you but in secret
I'll never, I'll never forget my feeling, no!
I'll never, I'll never learn how to let you go
