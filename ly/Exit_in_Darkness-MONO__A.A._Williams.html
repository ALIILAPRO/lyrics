		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long have I been underneath
The weight of all I'm carrying
For all my life, I've been the one
who abandoned everyone

But I need you to know
You make me whole
and I can't let you be alone

How long have you been hiding there
In all the shade and all the empty air
I could have sworn in you I saw myself
and all the questions that I ever asked

But I need you to know
You make me whole
and I can't let you be alone

I know love
I know love
