		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thunder clouds when you walked in
But I never feel the drip when you're talkin'
Only meet me in the drought when you're fallin' (You never ask me)
How I like my eggs in the mornin' (You never ask me)
Takin' comfort in my shadow (Shadow)
But you seem to stay afloat 'cause you're shallow
You can never make a promise for tomorrow
'Cause all the time you choose to take has been borrowed

I just pull up, then skrrt
You just pull up when it hurts
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why?
I just pull up, then skrrt
You just pull up when it hurts
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why?

Daylight wants to creep in through my window
Now I've got you back in my home
Now I'm moving from the shadows
Daylight wants to creep in through my window
Now I've got you back in my home
Now I'm moving from the shadows

Thunder clouds, so I'm walkin'
I don't need to take a hit from your talkin'
When the hurricane comes, I'm on back roads (I'm on back roads)
When the hurricane comes, you do not know (You do not know)
Oh, feel the clouds of change
When I'm ridin' in my spaceship
Callin' out your rain
'Cause it's no one's time to soak it
You left me hopeless, swimmin' in your ocean
Got me thinkin' twice what I'm involved in

I just pull up, then skrrt
You just pull up when it hurts
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why?
I just pull up, then skrrt
You just pull up when it hurts
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why?

Daylight wants to creep in through my window
Now I've got you back in my home
Now I'm moving from the shadows
Daylight wants to creep in through my window
Now I've got you back in my home
Now I'm moving from the shadows

So I just pull up, then skrrt
You just pull up when it hurts
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why?
Pull up, then skrrt
Pull up, pull up when it hurts
Pull up, pull up, then skrrt
Pull up, pull up when it hurts
Pull up, pull up, then skrrt
Pull up, pull up when it hurts
Pull up, pull up, then skrrt
Pull up, pull up when it hurts
