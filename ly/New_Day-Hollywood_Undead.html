		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So anybody froze in the alley of scars
Mama, what you think he wasn't swimming with sharks
You think I'm evil now keep them kids in the dark
I got a gallon of gasoline and a chestful of hearts

So you hide behind them paper and them records that made me
Immunization, on papers I'm eighteen 
Selling some rights for this Johnny come lately
Like fate in some bars, you think it fucking gon' change me?

From the bottom of bottles and it's right back to the top
It's a space in between where I keep getting caught
Yeah, I listen to these demons way more often than not
So I'll just keep on singing 'cause I don't wanna talk

'Cause I know I know I'm not right
But I've got my whole life
And that's alright with me

It's a new day A new day
You have loved yourself and no one else
In a new day A new day
It's a broken life what's left inside?
It's a new day A new day
You have loved yourself and no one else
It's a new day How do we change?
With a broken life what's left inside?

Today is my dream but tomorrow I choose
To stay awake and unseen, or sleep in oceans of blue
It's true the devil in me it's like speech you the freak
They say my tongue turns black every time I breathe

Pretend I'm just a thief, I'm not allowed to preach
But you can hear my words as they bleed through the streets
To underachieve has never been a disease
You know we can burn the earth with kerosene and a dream

The lynch of the mob and the powers that beat
They see me as a threat to the sheep, I'm looking for meat
I can see that light and feel the beat of the drums
I ain't finished yet I wanna cry when they come

'Cause I know I know I'm not right
But I've got my whole life
And that's alright with me

It's a new day A new day
You have loved yourself and no one else
In a new day A new day
It's a broken life what's left inside?
It's a new day A new day
You have loved yourself and no one else
It's a new day How do we change?
With a broken life what's left inside?

So where do we go when there's nowhere left to crawl?
And what do we do when we thought we knew it all?
Now we're surrounded by a world of lonely people
Am I the last one here, or the last one left to fall?

It's a new day a new day
You have loved yourself and no one else
In a new day a new day
It's a broken life what's left inside?
It's a new day a new day
You have loved yourself and no one else
It's a new day how do we change?
With a broken life what's left inside?
