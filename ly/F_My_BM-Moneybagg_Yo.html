		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see, I see, I see, I see
I see, I see, I see, I see
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Go

I see all them shots them niggas throwin', they indirect though (@ me)
Fuck my baby mama, she still mad about my ex ho' (petty)
Soon as I pop this XO, I'ma be lookin' for my next ho'
Like eenie, meenie, minie, mo, damn, she got the best throat (flamingo)
Rappers think soon as we meet, they get a verse for free (no, sir)
Hate when business get personal, pay the standard fee (right now)
Bitches think soon as we fuck, they get a purse from me (fried)
She like, "I know you seen me call, why you bein' weird to me?" (I'm not)

I put that shit on, can't be fucked with when it come to fashion (drip)
This one here hit different, one of eighteen watc from Prestine (bling)
A&W soda cream, I mix mine with codeine (lean)
That's my favorite drink (pour up), take a sip with me (let's go)

Big Five said break that shit out, no point in penny pinchin' (splurge)
Hundred P's, a shot off Gumbo, touch down in the trenches (served)
Sometimes it be true when she textin' my phone 'bout bitches (sometimes)
Who told you I did that shit? She say, "My intuition" (psychic)
Damn, she right, gettin' head right now, thank God these windows tinted (uh)
Pop out, paint the city, nothin' but members in attendance (mem's)
'Bout this pendant, bro gon' shoot somethin' like he Cole Bennett
Brrat, bratt, walk 'em down, ball, now you trendin', famous

I see all them shots them niggas throwin', they indirect though (@ me)
Fuck my baby mama, she still mad about my ex ho' (petty)
Soon as I pop this XO, I'ma be lookin' for my next ho'
Like eenie, meenie, minie, mo, damn, she got the best throat (flamingo)
Rappers think soon as we meet, they get a verse for free (no, sir)
Hate when business get personal, pay the standard fee (right now)
Bitches think soon as we fuck, they get a purse from me (fried)
She like, "I know you seen me call, why you bein' weird to me?"

Racks identical, come get you some, it's plentiful (lot)
When I say quickie, let's hurry up, that mean I'm in a rush
Real street nigga, spit on that, uh, 'fore we finna fuck (facts)
Treat that pussy like Plain Jane, you know that I'm finna bust you down, baby (shine)
White and rose AP, look like cream cheese (food)
Your advice on what I spent is what I didn't need
Dinner with a bad bitch, reservations at Tao
That was weeks ago, let's speak on some shit that I'm doin' now
I go SF for the Brabus, bulletproof, three-hundred thou'
A new Ferrari, it's electric, crank it up, don't make a sound
What it take for you to smush him when you catch 'em out of bounds
Fuck an amount (go)

I see all them shots them niggas throwin', they indirect though (@ me)
Fuck my baby mama, she still mad about my ex ho' (petty)
Soon as I pop this XO, I'ma be lookin' for my next ho'
Like eenie, meenie, minie, mo, damn, she got the best throat (flamingo)
Rappers think soon as we meet, they get a verse for free (no, sir)
Hate when business get personal, pay the standard fee (right now)
Bitches think soon as we fuck, they get a purse from me (fried)
She like, "I know you've seen me call, why you bein' weird to me?" (I'm not)
