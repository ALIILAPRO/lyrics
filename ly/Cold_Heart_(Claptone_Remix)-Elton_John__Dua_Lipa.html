		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (no, no, no, no, no)

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid (no, no, no, no, no)

(Oh)

Cold, cold heart
(No, no, no, no, no)

Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby (oh)
Just passin' through (no, no, no, no, no)

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (no, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid (no, no, no, no, no)

Cold, cold heart (oh)

Shoorah
Shoorah (oh)
Shoorah
(No, no, no, no, no)
Cold, cold heart (oh)
Shoorah
Shoorah (oh)
Shoorah
(No, no, no, no, no)
