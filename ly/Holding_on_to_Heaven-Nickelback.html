		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on, hold on

I keep listening to my chest for a beat, but there's nothing left
It's been a week since I've seen you, and I still can't believe it
'Cause I'm dying inside alone

And in every dream we gotta be apart
I'm like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I see you
You will know how much I need you
'Cause I'll never be letting you go

(Now you know why)
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You're the one that I can't go without
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever

I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you
Never been together long enough
'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on, hold on

And if I can write symphony, baby, you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river, slowing going on forever
Like a feather that's blowing away
Like everyone that needs a fairytale
Like every mother's love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
Every sinner needs a savior
I'm the villain that your willing to save

(Now you know why)
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You're the one that I can't go without
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever

I've for you now and I'm not letting go of you
Never been together long enough
'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven
(Heaven, heaven)

And I'm willing to wait, just to see you another day
What I'm waiting for will wash this pain away
And it's never too late

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on, hold on

(Now you know why)
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You're the one that I can't go without
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever

I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you
Never been together long enough
'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I

'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I

'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven
