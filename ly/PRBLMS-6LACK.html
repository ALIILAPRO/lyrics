		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said, "You a goddamn lie"
I ain't mean to say that shit girl, I was goddamn high
So we left the crib, now we in the goddamn ride
She lookin' goddamn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to Earth
But she want the goddamn sky, uh
List of my problems
Got this one on my line that won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that?
Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me, "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you"
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thing
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I never been the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels, I'ma sip on this drank
It's easing my brain

I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank

Now I'm like
It's a goddamn shame
We done crashed, we done burned
But baby, you the goddamn blame
See I wanted love but you wanted goddamn fame
Every goddamn thang
I wanted a bitch who was on the move
But you wanna goddamn lay, uh
List of my problems
Got this one in my bed and she just want to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets
She only wake up to eat
Do this shit every week
Like why you do that?
Crying you wanna be great, but sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that?
Don't got that much in the bank, we go out she order the steak
Why you do, why you do that?
She can't explain it but just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck, but really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I won't be the one, to try to explain
While you catch them feels, I'ma sip on this drank
It's easing the pain

I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
