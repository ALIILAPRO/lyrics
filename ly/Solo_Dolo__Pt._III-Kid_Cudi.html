		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, every bottle
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoa, whoa, ah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I take it they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it I don't need nobody
Deep in the hell, in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived now
Yeah, I take it they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream
Somethin' twisted in me

Say, I'm waitin' to die, I cry
Many nights I spent gettin' fucked up, livin' a lie
Figured I'm just fed up, this tequila in me
Don't tell me to be cool, this is how cool I can be, whoa
You could try readin' my mind
Been pushing it for days, I'm on the mission to climb, whoa
Losin' reality, been sayin' I'm fine, try my hardest to sleep
Too many issues bubblin', say I work through it all
Think they knowin' what the problems are
Had me goin' crazed through the city while I burn it down
This is just my way, keep on prayin' for me
Lonely on my ride as I fly 
I'm just open wide, don't wanna leave without sayin' bye
Had a rough night, finna sip some
Don't even worry 'bout it, waiting 'til the devil comes

Yeah, I take it they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it I don't need nobody
Deep in the hell, in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived now
Yeah, I take it they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream (ah)

He's callin' me, so much gone while I blow off steam
And the shit's the same, oh, look at that, only you to blame
Ah, it's like I'm swimmin' towards another bona fide life
Just like the fairytale one more
But inside I'm vexed, used to question, why?
Lord, He show me that I'm tested and I'm gonna fly
I ain't slippin', no, that's not for me
Be who you are, don't be nothin' less, please
Hear me Lord, don't ever leave, see
I'm a man in the night in these dark streets
Somethin' else, how it felt
Take a drink, I live in excess, nothin' left
Every minute slippin' away, this is hell
They we warning him, figured he'd be cool, who's the fool?

Yeah, I take it they don't know 'bout it (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I take it I don't need nobody (yeah, yeah)
Deep in the hell, in dark corners (yeah)
Deep in my dreams perceived now (mmm)
Yeah, I take it they don't know 'bout it (yeah)
Yeah, I take it I don't need nobody (yeah)
Can't hear me scream (scream)
Somethin' twisted in me
