		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you for life
Love you for life
Love you for life

I took the long road across the ocean
I'll burn some bridges on the way
Feels like forever, here in the moment
Just hope forever it's here to stay

Don't wanna say to much, speak to soon
And scare your heart away
Just wanna feel your light
The fire inside
For the rest of all my days

Lately, I just feel like
I can't get you out of my mind
I feel love for the first time
And I know that it's true
Me and you, I could love you for life

I could love you for life
Love you for life
Love you for life (I could love you for life)
I could love you for life
Love you for life
And I know that it's true
Me and you, I could love you for life

I could love you for life
And I know that it's true
Me and you, I could love you for life

You came and found me
When I was hopeless (I was hopeless)
Right on the edge of giving up, hmm
You understood me, it gave me focus
You're all that I could ever want

Don't wanna say to much, speak to soon
In case I scare your heart away (scare your heart away)
Just wanna feel your light (oh)
The fire inside
For the rest of all my days

Oh, oh, lately, I just feel like
I can't get you out of my mind
I feel love for the first time
And I know that it's true
Me and you, I could love you for life

I could love you for life
Love you for life
Love you for life (love you for life)
I could love you for life
Love you for life
And I know that it's true
Me and you, I could love you for life

I could love you for life
Oh, I could love you for life

And I know that it's true
Me and you, I could love you for life
