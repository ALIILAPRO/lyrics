		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I'm standing on the sea shore
She is gone, now she's gone
All the angels praying for me
As I fall, As I fall

While I'm melting in the rain, deep in pain, she is so far
Will we ever meet again as friends, after so long?

To me nightmare with the devil
I'll go strong, I'll go strong
All my friends now try to save me
What a joke, what a joke

While I'm melting in the rain, deep in pain, she is so far
Will we ever meet again as friends, after so long?

While I'm melting in the rain, deep in pain, she is so far
Will we ever meet again as friends, after so long?
