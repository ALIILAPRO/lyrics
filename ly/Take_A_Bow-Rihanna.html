		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah
Standin' ovation
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house

Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please
Just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
Really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow, oh

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talkin' 'bout, "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please
What else is on? Oh, oh

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar 
Goes to you (goes to you)
For makin' me believe
That you could be
Faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, ohh

How 'bout a round of applause?
A standin' ovation

But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
