		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got chills, they're multiplyin', and I'm losin' control
'Cause the power you're supplyin', it's electrifyin'

You better shape up, 'cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you
You better shape up, you better understand, to my heart I must be true

Nothing left, nothing left for me to do

You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed)

If you're filled with affection, 'n you're too shy to convey
Meditate my direction, feel your way

I better shape up, 'cause you need a man
I need a man, who can keep me satisfied
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove
You better prove, that my fate is justified
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside

You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed)

You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed)

You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed)

You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
