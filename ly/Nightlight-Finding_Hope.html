		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For you I'd fight
Have fun doing things you like
I don't know if you'd be mine
But I know I can treat you right
Show me your mind
Stay up cause you stay on mine
Count sheep just to pass the time
But you ain't getting sleep tonight
We're alone but we're living
Day to day i'm missing you
And if you feel it too
Call me your nightlight
And call me up when you like
Sorry you've been losing sleep
For far too many nights
Call me your nightlight
I pray that you're doing fine
She said what's the motive
I just wanna get to know you
And if it's love you're looking
For then I can show you
For you I'd fight
Have fun doing things you like
I don't know if you'd be mine
But I know I can treat you right
Show me your mind
Stay up cause you stay on mine
Count sheep just to pass the time
But you ain't getting sleep tonight
We're alone but we're living
Day to day i'm missing you
And if you feel it too
Call me your nightlight
And call me up when you like
Sorry you've been losing sleep
For far too many nights
Call me your nightlight
I pray that you're doing fine
She said what's the motive
I just wanna get to know you
And if it's love you're looking
For then I can show you
