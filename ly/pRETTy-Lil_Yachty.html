		<p>
		  Come bust this pussy open

I am so pretty
I feel so pretty
I'm so damn pretty
(So pretty, so pretty, so pretty) 
I feel so pretty

Hmm, hmm, hmm 
Let's go to sunset city, go to sun city
Woke up on the right side, I feel so pretty
Kiss my girl on her thighs, grab on her titties
I know that they despise, I feel so sexy
If someone say I'm not, must have not met me
Warm you up when it's cold, you call me bestie
Don't test me, I'm too sexy

I am so pretty
I feel so pretty
I'm so damn pretty
(So pretty, so pretty, so pretty) 
I feel so pretty

So pretty, yeah, he like my curly hair
Wrinkled off the crease, I keep a pleated piece (yeah)
She's a keeper, so I threw out the receipt
Jeepers Creepers, swear these niggas so spooky
Said, "I'd die for this pussy," R.I.P.
Didn't lie, that dick put me right to sleep (put me right to sleep)
Skin so smooth, moisturized (that's that cocoa cream)
Fuck, yeah, you pretty, what am I? (Yeah)

You know
You've always been my favorite
You've always told me to enjoy my seconds on Earth with tea
The most important moments in life 
Aren't when you're born and when you die
But when you met me, when we became us
