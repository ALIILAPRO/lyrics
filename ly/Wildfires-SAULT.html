		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thief in the night
Tell the truth
White lives
Spreading lies
You should be ashamed
The bloodshed on your hands
Another man

Take off your badge
We all know it was murder
Murder, murder
Murder

We are dying, it's the reason we are crying
We are crying

But we will never show fear
Even in my eyes
I will always rise
In wildfires
I ain't never been scared
Even through my tears
I will always care
In wildfires

But we will never show fear
Even in my eyes
I will always rise
In wildfires
I ain't never been scared
Even through my tears
I will always care
In wildfires
