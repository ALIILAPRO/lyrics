		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I'm going down and down
I have dreamed a better place
As the world turns round and round 
Sun is always in my fate.

Sometimes you go away
A million miles away
Sometimes you don't know where
Don't worry I'll be there.

Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise 
Can you bring the sun in my way
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise 
Can you bring the sun in my life.

Now I close my eyes again
And I'm thinking to myself
Will I ever love again
Hope you'll be a better man

Sometimes you go away
A million miles away
Sometimes you don't know where
Don't worry I'll be there

Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise 
Can you bring the sun in my way
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise 
Can you bring the sun in my life

Sometimes you go away
A million miles away
Sometimes you don't know where
Don't worry I'll be there

Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise 
Can you bring the sun in my way
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise 
Can you bring the sun in my life.
