		<p>
		  Oxytocin makin' it all okay
When I come back down, it doesn't feel the same
Now I'm sittin' 'round, waitin' for the world to end all day
'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried

You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still

Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven Nation Army, fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical
No, I can't let go, it's chemical

Every time I'm ready to make a change
You turn around and fuck out all my brains (woo)
I ain't tryna fight fate, it's too late to save face
I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes (maybe there's no mistakes)

You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still

Standing outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven Nation Army, fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical (chemical)
No, I can't let go, it's chemical (chemical)
No, I can't let go, it's chemical

I can't let go, it's chemical

Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
No, I can't let go, it's chemical
