		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa
I am who I ams
Love it or leave it, baby

While you reminisce, I've been gone
Two years and a fortnight
I'm friends with the low-lifes
I'm drunk tryna get high
Still waiting to exhale
Come out of the shadows
Five feet, barely three quarters
In your Stilettos
Like pineapple Mentos
Your favorite confection
I'm sweet like your perfume
Strong like your mind is
Your skin dripping richness, tend to your flowers without a mention
You won your wars, you laid down your sword then gave me the weapon

You say keep my promises but I don't
I should probably listen more, yeah, mother, I know
I just wanna be dancing again
I know
I'm to blame, I gotta heal these scars on my own
I should learn to listen more, yeah, mother, I know
I just wanna be dancing again
I know

Don't it feel good?
Don't it feel right?
When you come home to
Home to mama's eyes
Don't you feel good?
Full up with pride
Seeing yourself in
Self in mama's eyes

I am who I ams

You are every woman
Whitney and Chaka
No one can ever
Be put above you (yeah)
I always believe in you, open my eyes if you say it's alright
Now I'm here at Heathrow, sunken and see through, tryna catch my flight
Hush now, she's speaking
Preaching her sermon (yeah)
The golden rule is to never lose yourself for a person
Bebe and Cece play in our kitchen
Say mama, you in daddy's hoodie swinging your hips while you do the dishes

You say keep my promises but I don't
I should probably listen more, yeah, mother, I know
I just wanna be dancing again
I know

Don't it feel good?
Don't it feel right?
When you come home to
Home to mama's eyes
Don't you feel good?
Full up with pride
Seeing yourself in
Self in mama's eyes

Love it or leave it, baby
