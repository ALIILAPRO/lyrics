		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today is in the air
Again today another incident that just went off
No way this time I will not take the blame
It's pretty obvious who need to shut up
Ashtrays filled with the fruits of our transgression
Here and there sarcasm overflows
To stay I'll need this sitcom to be re-run till I get the gist of just how it goes

So what would you have me do?

Give me a reason c'mon now make my day'cause I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel.

Somehow I've been blindsided by my own kindhearted notion of just who we are
No doubt we'd have collided anyway with the indicted and you raising alarm
First round I'll take my bows into my corner take my vows regroup and run back again
Bloodhound and off no better pedigree than what you see so you could not offend
Did I act like a fool 'cause I didn't know what to do when you gave me just a little bit more than I bargained for a little too much in my hands when my hands are tied

It's the ultimate fling to go frolicking licking the muck from the soles of the boots of your pride every time you lied

Give me a reason c'mon now make my day'cause I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel

Gime me a reason c'mon now make my day
Spoken my pleas now someone's gotta pay ask yourself just how lucky do you feel

can you give me a reason movin into grey something I can hold on to at the end of the day
'cause I can't move on till I now what's the deal
