		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Choices always were a problem for you
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to use you
Like me, like me
Like me, like me

If you want to get your soul to heaven
Trust in me now, don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do

Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you

My god's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you

Jesus Christ
Why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now

If you want to get your soul to heaven
Trust in me now, don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do

Jesus Christ
Why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ
Why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your lies now

Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you

My god's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you
