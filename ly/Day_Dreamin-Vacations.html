		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moving in a daze wondering what to do today
Remind yourself it's time to get over it
Oh, and by the way

Maybe you're daydreamin'
Trying to make something happen it's all you
It's all you

Wondering if this was the right move
Well, I don't know
It takes some time before you start to
You start to grow

Maybe you're daydreamin'
Trying to make something happen it's all you
It's all you
