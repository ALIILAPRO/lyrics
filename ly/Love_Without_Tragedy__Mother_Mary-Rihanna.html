		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red lip stick, rose petals, heart break
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low, Dean on the low

I ask you what's the matter
You say, oh it's nothing at all
Heart's racing, outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive
Injured us fatally
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I pray that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy? (Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies, way above me
For you I've cried, tears sea-deep
Oh glory, the prayers carry me

I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever
I swear by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies, way above me
For you I've cried, tears sea-deep
Oh glory, the prayers carry me

I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment

'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
