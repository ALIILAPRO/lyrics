		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swallowing a feeling
Counting cracks across the ceiling
Never reached the depths of them before
Finding flaws in every format
I know but haven't shown that
I could pick myself up off the floor

I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine

From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine

Redefine rock bottom with these empty orange bottles
Never felt so paralyzed before (never felt this paralyzed)
We're all looking for some answers
With the hangman's broken lantern
Growing ever closer to the floor

I'll fill my glass to take the edge off
The choice is mine

From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine

Why do I, why do I, feel so damn cold?
Why am I, why am I, still so low?
Why should I, why should I, get up or get out?
Why should I?

From the outside
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
I seem fine
I seem fine
On the inside I'm still sick
The pill's a temporary fix
From the outside
