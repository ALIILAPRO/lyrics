		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Workin' on the weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist going nuts
Niggas caught me slipping once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say somethin'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh?
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is
Said what I had to and did what I did
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doing front flips
Giving you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit

Workin' on the weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist going nuts
Niggas caught me slipping once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

It's cool, man, got red bottoms on
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like

Uh, hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring
On a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain
And Audemars'd the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring
Call it Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap serving cocaine
I ain't been the same since, woo

Granny, she was standing right there
While I catch a play on a brick, woo
I make them lil' niggas go haywire
Taliban in this bitch, woo
I done been down bad in them trenches
Had to ride with that stick, woo
Who gave you pills? Who gave you that dust?
Pluto sent you on a lick, woo
Too many convicts
They enrolled me to play in this shit, woo
I'm tryna avoid nonsense
Get Osama sprayed in this bitch, woo
They had the candlelight, lighting it up
Nigga, anybody could get it, woo
I'm on a PJ lighting it up
Backwood full of sticky, woo
I'm tryna tote that Draco in London
And it's an extended, woo
They gotta stretch a nigga out
We gon' die for this shit, woo
Yeah, I ride for my niggas
I lie to my bitch, woo
We some poor, high-class niggas
Made it, we rich, yeah
I was at the bando
Got a penthouse for a closet, woo
It's like a chandelier
On my neck, my wrist, woo
I got pink toes
They talk different languages, woo
Got Promethazine in my blood and Percocet

Yeah, hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring
On a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain
And Audemars'd the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring
Call it Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap serving cocaine
I ain't been the same since

Racks by the ton I call up Serena
I go tremendo for new fettuccini
All fact though, clarity pinky
All fact though, we order up the Fiji
I'm in the loop with the voo
I'm in the loop with the woo
Which one of you working?
I put your face on the news
I put the pussy on the shirt
After I murk, then make 'em go shoot up the hearse
Cost me a quarter bird
Nigga it's worth it, and you a maniac
A fucking alien, how you splurgin'?
Got that kitty cat, I'm having fun with that
Goin' Birkin

Yeah, hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring
On a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain
And Audemars'd the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring
Call it Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap serving cocaine
I ain't been the same since

(Hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch)
(Hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, yeah)
(Hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, uh)
(Hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch)
