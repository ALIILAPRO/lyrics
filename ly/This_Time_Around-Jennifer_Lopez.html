		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my cards laid out
I'm going all in right now
No more playing around
Time to do what we talkin' 'bout
No bluffs, no act
What they know 'bout a love like that?
We got it bad, that's a fact, that's a fact

All that fake shit you can't sell me
Nothing you can tell me
I've been waitin' so long, finally found it
Ain't no way, baby, we could live without it
All that bullshit just don't phase us
All the hate couldn't break us
'Cause when you know better, you do better
We get to have a do-over forever

This time around, we gon' do it right
We gon' do this shit for the rest of our life
This time around, we gon' make it real
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, do it how we like
We gon' have the best time of our lives
This time around, we gon' seal the deal
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around

Baby, if you can
Can you take the time?
To put me first?
To ease my mind?
To cherish this?
Cherish it for life?
Never take for granted (take for granted)
That I'm your wife

All that fake shit you can't sell me
Nothing you can tell me
I've been waitin' so long, finally found it
Ain't no way, baby, we could live without it
All that bullshit just don't phase us (don't phase us)
All the hate couldn't break us (we're stronger)
'Cause when you know better, you do better
We get to have a do-over forever

This time around, we gon' do it right
We gon' do this shit for the rest of our life
This time around, we gon' make it real
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, do it how we like (oh)
We gon' have the best time of our lives
This time around, we gon' seal the deal
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel (you know this time around)
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around (we can do it all)

We gon' put the house in bo-both our names
Throw a crazy party, goin' through the champagne
Still keep a gutter with the match and chains
Now we made it out, ain't nothin' gon' change us
Always on frost
Matchin' tattoos, kissin' with our eyes closed
Everything his or hers, monogram rose
Chopper from Paris to the boat in Monaco

This time 'round gon' be a lil' different
I ain't feel love in a minute
I ain't feel, I ain't feel love in a minute
I ain't feel, I ain't feel love in a minute, uh
This time 'round gon' be a lil' different
I ain't feel love in a minute
I ain't feel, I ain't feel this vibe in a minute
This time around gon' be a lil' different

This time around, we gon' do it right
We gon' do this shit for the rest of our life
This time around, we gon' make it real
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, do it how we like (they say about us)
We gon' have the best time of our lives
This time around, we gon' seal the deal
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, this time around (this time around)
This time around, this time around (this time is gonna be different, baby)
This time around, this time around 
This time around, this time around (we got a family)
This time around, this time around 
This time around, this time around (love came back to me, oh)
