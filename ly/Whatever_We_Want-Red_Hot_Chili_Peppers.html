		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stole your haircut
And your boring personality
The perfect pallette for a painting
Of morality
And now I come across without a loss
Of what to be
Add up the two of us and then
Subtract the one of me

Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain

I turn you into one
And then I turn you out for fun
Of earth and days and age
In fact you never were that dumb
Descended from a line
Of endless opportunities
I feel the mountain where you bring it from
Is gonna please

Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super-tanker
Oh won't it be great yeah, yeah

We can all do whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
We can all do...what... ever we want to
We can all do...what... ever we want to

I'm dreamin' up the thing that no one
Ever knew was love
I get you higher than the hawks
Of Hollywood above
It's up for grab
The ragged stream of possibilities
To walk away from this could leave me
Feeling ill at ease

Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super-tanker
Oh won't it be great yeah, yeah

We can all do whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
We can all do...what... ever we want to
We can all do...what... ever we want to

Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super-tanker
Oh won't it be great yeah, yeah

We can all do whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
We can all do whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
We can all do...what... ever we want to
We can all do...what... ever we want to
