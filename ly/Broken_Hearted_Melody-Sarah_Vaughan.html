		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broken-hearted meelody
Once you were our song of love
Now you just keep taunting me
With the memory of (ba da da)
His tender love, oh
Broken-hearted melody
Must you keep reminding me
Of the lips I long to kiss
And the love I miss since he went away
Night and day they play
That broken-hearted melody
That he used to sing to me
When our love was young and bright
As he held me tight
Suddenly I found
I was out of bound

Broken-hearted melody
Once you were a song of love
Now you just keep taunting me
With the memory of (ba da da)
His tender love, oh
Broken-hearted melody
Won't you bring him back to me
Sing to him until he hears
For when he returns no more will he be
A broken-hearted melody
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oo-oo, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
