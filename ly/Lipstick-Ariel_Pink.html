		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is up your doomsday clock sealed
Carry the cross, boy, and make your bed
In a place where all is unknown
Face behind the mask of the sky
Halfway spinning to a better place
In the body of a man mind of a girl
What's the view like from your bed?
Where a handful of love goes down where you got fed
And now it's time for pain, that's right
Now it's time for pain, that's right
Penetration time tonight

Penetration... when we power plant bodies
Yeah we power plant bodies
And we power plant bodies (on the body farm)
Are we power plant bodies? (on the body farm)

Providence of angels and fairymen
Here after all's well and said is done
What's the view like from your bed?
Where a handful of love goes down where you got fed
Now it's time for pain, that's right
Penetration time tonight

Not enough violence
(you're fertilizer, fertilizer! (on the body farm))

Carnage, violence, carnage, violence
Not enough violence(you're fertilizer, fertilizer! (on the body farm)
Are we power plant bodies? (on the body farm)
Not enough violence
Halfway spinning to a better place
Body of a man
Power plant bodies
Are we power plant bodies
(on the body farm)

Mind of a girl
