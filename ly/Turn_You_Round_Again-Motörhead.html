		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody promised you it would be easy, not even fair,
But a lot of people said 'Lean on me', and they weren't there
If it's any consolation, they're all the same,
And if you lose your head, you lose the game,
And it's all, an uphill run, you know it ain't much fun,
You know we're all the same, turn you round again.
Everyone said, 'Come over here and be like me',
I didn't want to know, ain't no place to be,
If it's any consolation, you're all the same,
But it's a different face, with a different name,
But it's all, an uphill run, you know it ain't much fun,
You know we're all the same, turn you round again.
I'm gonna tell you something, you must believe,
I've got a hat full of jokes, waiting up my sleeve,
Forget cancellations, I know the game,
It's a different face, but the name's the same,
And it's all, an uphill run, you know it ain't much fun,
And I'll turn you round again, again.
