		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey
Hey, hey (hey, hey)
Ooh-oh
I'm the kinda girl who doesn't say a word
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I'm about to break out, about to break out
I'm like a crook tonight
I caught you starin' at me and I was thinkin' clearly
And now I'm like a bee and I'm huntin' for the honey
And I'm kinda shy but you're super fly yeah, I could be your kryptonite

Like, ooh, ooh, ooh
Light my heart up baby like a match stick
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd the music's loud, but I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it la la la la la la and I'll find you
Ready or not (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ready or not (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Hello, my name is (Bridgit)
Nice to meet you
I think you're famous, where have I seen you?
You'll be my William, I'll be your Kate
Livin' like a fairy tale
We could have a palace right next to Oprah
Thirty-seven cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away wherever you say
Yeah, we could be setting sail

Like, ooh, ooh, ooh
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd the music's loud (uh oh), but I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la-la la-la la-la la-la and I'll find you
Ready or not (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ready or not (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come, boy, it's on

Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come, boy, it's on

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young, yeah
In the crowd the music's loud, but I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it la-la la-la la-la la-la and I'll find you

Ready or not (ready or not)
(You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs)
Ready or not (here I come, ooh)
Ready or not (ready or not)
Ready or not (ready or not, ready or not)
Boombada boombada boombada
Ready or not
