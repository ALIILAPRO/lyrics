		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We haven't met
But I've known you
I've known you for a while
Your life begins
My breath is short
But it is like I can run another thousand miles
I remember, when my mother said
It's a holy tie only nature can create
My everlasting hunger
Came to a close
I was walking fearlessly but now I fly
I hear your voice, deep in the water
With you, everything is worth a try
I feel your love, who wanna shelter
You're the whole, you're the reason why

Your life begins
My breath is short
But is like I can run another thousand miles
My ever lasting hunger
Came to a close
I was walking fearlessly but now I fly
I hear your voice, deep in the water
With you, everything is worth a try
I feel your love, who wanna shelter
You're the whole, my reason why
I hear your voice, deep in the water
With you, everything is worth a try
I feel your love, who wanna shelter
You're the whole, you're my reason why
