		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spill the blood of the innocent

I have dreamt about what it's like to die
And I saw myself becoming shadows again
Just like I did when I was a kid
I saw my bones crack open and all the
Things I've been hiding from you spill out
All the secrets that I never
Thought I'd tell anyone about
I am warm and I am bored and
I am drifting through this place
It's no better or worse than anything
Else that's ever happened to me
But I wish that I'd never met a
Lot of the people that I've met
Not because I don't like them but
Because I only let them down
And when you disappoint everyone
All the time, it's hard not to want to die
Constantly, I feel this weird
And shameful feeling
Like I'm being watched by
A thousand glowing, vengeful eyes
Behind one-way mirrors in public bathrooms
And in metro cars
And everywhere I go, I know I'm not welcome
