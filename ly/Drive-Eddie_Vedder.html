		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smack, crack, bushwhacked
Tie another one to the racks, baby
Hey, kids, rock and roll
Nobody tells you where to go, baby

What if I ride? What if you walk?
What if you rock around the clock?
Tick, tock, tick, tock
What if you did? What if you walk?
What if you drive to get off, baby?

Hey, kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby
Hey, kids, shake a leg
May be all crazy in the head, baby

Maybe you did, maybe you walked
Maybe you rocked around the clock
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Maybe I ride, maybe you walk
Maybe I drive to get off, baby

Hey, kids, shake a leg
Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby
All the, all the, all the, all the, all the
All the income, oh, baby
Hey, kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby

Smack, crack, shack-a-lack
Tie another to your backs, baby
Hey, kids, rock and roll
Nobody tells you where to go, baby

Maybe you did, maybe you walk
Maybe you rock around the clock
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Maybe I ride, maybe you walk
Maybe I drive to get off, baby

Hey, kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby
Hey, kids, rock and roll
Nobody tells you where to go, baby
Baby
