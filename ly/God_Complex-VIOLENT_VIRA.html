		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be the true savior
The one with a terrible demise
I wanna be the Messiah, pariah
The one who never dies
I wanna be your true love
Yes and the only one
You could cry to all the time
I could just be who you need
Darling won't you just plead
Or should I begin to bleed?
God I could try
To be the one
To be the one
I'll tear down the sky
What do you want
I'll do it all
For life
My love
My alibi
Tonight
Tonight I'll try to do it for you
I wanna be a white angel
The one with two billion of eyes
I wanna be like a fly on the wall
To watch you until you die
I'm gonna be where you are
Doesn't matter how far
Because we are meant to be
I could just be who you need
Darling please worship me
Unless you prefer to bleed
God I could try
To be the one
To be the one
I'll tear down the sky
What do you want
I'll do it all
For life
My love
My alibi
Tonight
Tonight I'll try to do it for you
