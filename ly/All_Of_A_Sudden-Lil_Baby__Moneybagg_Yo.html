		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ugh ugh ugh
Fed shit
Ayy, gangster shit only nigga
Lil Baby what's poppin'?
DMac got me too bangin'
All four of my pockets full now

I can't be totin' no handguns (Glock)
Unless that bitch come with a thirty (with a thirty)
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy (with a friend)
I can't be drivin' no regular cars (skrt)
That bitch gotta come with a button (a button)
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget (send me that)
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber (slip in that)
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy
I just came home with nothin' (woo)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (hey)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (hey)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (hey, hey)

Moneybagg, Moneybagg (fuck with it)
I'm in the booth with a money bag
Here go the bricks, where the money at?
Give me a load, I ain't comin' back
I make 'em shoot where your stomach at
We gon' pull up where your mama at
Runnin' through hoes like a running back
We can fuck but you can't call this number back
If you knew better, baby you'd do better
I got plenty hoes, call me Hugh Hefner
I'm with MoneyBagg, we went four federal
Four Pockets, Bread Gang, who better?

I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy

If I said fuck you I meant that
I'm whippin' this coupe, I ain't rent that
The shit that you savin', I spent that
And if you want smoke you can get that
I just want proof of the backend
Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
She like hold up baby, keep my tracts in
I can't hit that bitch raw, got a glove on me
I'm in the trap with the drugs one me
I just went bonkers all up, exclusive gang
Fly as fuck like a dove on me
Diamonds wet like a tub on me
Hurricane Harvey, flood on me
Left the spot with a dub on me
Walk in the spot, bitches tug on me

I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my kush be muddy
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of the sudden
Hey, now I'm up all of the sudden, hey
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of the sudden
Hey, now I'm up all of the sudden, hey
Now I'm up all of the sudden
