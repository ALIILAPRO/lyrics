		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stand up straight now (ooh)
Can't break down (ooh)
Graduate now (ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
It's a taste test (ooh)
Of what I hate less (ooh)
Can you die of anxiousness? (Ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
What's about to happen? What's about to happen?

I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearing
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!"

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here

Can't feel my legs (ooh)
I might suffocate (ooh)
There's a pressure in my chest (ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
What's about to happen? What's about to happen?

I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearin'
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!"

(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa)
(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa, oh)
Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester

I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearin'
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!"

(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa) And then he slowed down
(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa, Oh) And rolled down his window
And he said
"Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester"

It's a taste test
Of what I hate less
I don't wanna be here
Start fresh with the new year
(Oh, ah, oh, oh-whoa)
(Oh, ah, oh, oh-whoa)
Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester
