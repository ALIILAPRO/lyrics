		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (me) 
Oh, what a shame I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (me)
Oh, what a shame I'm not there

What is it you want?
You can lie but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care 
All you wanna do is kiss me (me)
Oh, what a shame I'm not there

Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches' broken hearts

You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (me)
Oh, what a shame I'm not there

Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess bein' lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "Stay"
