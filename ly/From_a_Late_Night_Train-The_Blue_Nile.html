		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From a late night train
Reflected in the water
When all the rainy pavement
Lead to you
It's over now
I know it's over
But I can't let go
The cigarettes, the magazines
All stacked up in the rain
There doesn't seem to be a funny side
It's over now
I know it's over
But I can't let go
From a late night train
The little towns go rolling by
And people in the station
Going home
It's over now
I know it's over
But I love you so
