		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl I'm afraid that I'm not strong enough for both of us
Am I still perfect for you when I'm wrong?
Self deprecate when I call you
I'm nauseous
I'm not what you wanted

1 on 1 
I'm fighting my walls today
Shoot the fade with me, baby
I'm losing
Since my brother died I lost touch
Same old jeans on me
I sleep in them, say I'm good cause

Girl I'm afraid that I'm not strong enough for both of us
Am I still perfect for you when I'm wrong?
Self deprecate when I call you
I'm nauseous
I'm not what you wanted

2 o' clock
Boy, you should get out that bed
Be a distraction, baby
This phone's dead
My room says you can't leave
Oh I'll watch you self-destruct right next to me

Girl, I'm not as strong as you need me to be
I'll fake it for sure
For now I'm falling to pieces
You'll get what you want if I stand next to you
You said you'd pray for me
No changes please
Don't make me move
Girl, I'm not as strong as you need me to be
I'll fake it for sure
For now I'm falling to pieces
You'll get what you want if I stand next to you
These same old jeans on me
No new routines
Can't leave this room

Girl I'm afraid that I'm not strong enough for both of us
Am I still perfect for you when I'm wrong?
Self deprecate when I call you
I'm nauseous
I'm not what you wanted
