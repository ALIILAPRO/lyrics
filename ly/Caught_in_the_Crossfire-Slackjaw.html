		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All around you the bodies burn
Don't look back there's no return
Your time is up cold steel, an early grave
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Programmed to kill or die
Execute their greed filled lies
Crossed out a corpse left to rot
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
Caught in the Crossfire
