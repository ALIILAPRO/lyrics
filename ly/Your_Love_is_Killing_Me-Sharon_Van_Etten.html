		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's understood, you'll be a man
By the time I'll see you
We've been through better days
And you've tasted all my pain

Break my legs so I won't walk to you
Cut my tongue so I can't talk to you
Burn my skin so I can't feel you
Stab my eyes so I can't see

You like it when I let you walk over me
You tell me that you like it
Your love is killing me

Try to tell you this when I'm sober
How I feel about loving you
Try to remember all the turn of events
Being led by our own fantasies, fantasies

Break my legs so I won't walk to you
Cut my tongue so I can't talk to you
Burn my skin so I can't feel you
Stab my eyes so I can't see

You like it when I let you walk over me
You tell me that you like it
When our minds become diseased

There, he let it go, his temper, standing there
See her with his gun and he, steals love so he can feel alive
Everyone's knees knockin' at the fear of love, taste blood
Everybody needs to feel

Break my legs so I won't run to you
Steal my soul so I am one with you
From a distance I am onto you
But I'll stab my eyes out so I can't see

You like it
When I let you walk over me
You tell me that you like it
You love me as you torture me
You tell me that you like it
But I won't let you see
All that I can do's what I can
With this pain you've given me
With this pain you've given me
Your love is killing me
Yes, all your pain is killing me
