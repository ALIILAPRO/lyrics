		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you wanted to feel alive
So we went to the beach
You were born in July, '95
In a deadly heat
You say you're a winter bitch
But summer's in your blood
You can't help but become the sun

When you moved to Chicago
You were spinning out
When you don't know who you are
You fuck around and find out
When you called me from the train
Water freezing in your eyes
You were happy and I wasn't surprised

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself

Now you're moving in
Breaking a sweat on your upper lip
And getting pissed about humidity
And the leaky faucet
You already hurt my feelings three times
In the way only you could

But it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue, ooh

You've never done me wrong
Except for that one time
That we don't talk about
Because it doesn't matter anymore
Who won the fight?
I don't know
We're not keeping score

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue
