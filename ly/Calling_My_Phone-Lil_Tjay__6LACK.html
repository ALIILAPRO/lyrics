		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Steady callin' my phone
I done told you before that it's over, leave me 'lone
Know it's hurtin' you to see me gone
Dark clouds, you gon' see me storm
I won't go back
But trust me, you're gon' hold that
Hold that (mmh, mmh)

Get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now (mmh, mmh)
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now (mmh, mmh)

I ain't tryna play these game no more
I don't wanna be textin' your name no more
I ain't tryna feel this pain no more
And I'm sorry but my feelings ain't the same no more (no)
Used to be my homie, you ain't gang no more (no)
I am not a nigga you could claim you no more (no)
Traumatized, hoping it don't rain no more
You done put me through some things that done changed my aura
Now all around the world, I explore, no Dora
New bitch, I might drip out and Dior her
Ass fat, shawty straight heat, no Florida
Bad and she know it, for herself, I applaud her
No needs, yeah, I'm talkin' my boo
So please, leave 'lone, I'm through
And it's all 'cause of what you started
I been told you I won't lose (mmh)

Steady callin' my phone (brrt)
I done told you before that it's over, leave me 'lone
Know it's hurtin' you to see me gone
Dark clouds, you gon' see me storm
I won't go back (go back)
But trust me, you're gon' hold that
Hold that (mmh, mmh)

Get you off my mind now (ooh, wow)
I can't get you off my mind now (yeah, yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now (my mind)
I can't get you off my mind now (mmh, mmh, alright)
I can't get you off my mind now (whoa)
I can't get you off my mind now (whoa)
I can't get you off my mind now (yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now (mmh, mmh)

I ain't tryna play no games, my love
I'm one of a kind, couldn't fake, my love
Earthquake, make somethin' shake, my love
Most of 'em can't even relate, my love
Used to be gang, oh, now you're not gang
Used to have fun, no, now you got shame
Used to catch flights but now I'm not playin'
Play on words, she love it when a nigga sing
I ain't tryna play your game no more
No, you can't wear my chain no more
We are not a thing, can't take no more
Waitin' on your king, you could wait some more
'Cause yeah, I remember days when I used to adore her
Funny how this shit just flipped like a quarter
Get a new thing, I'ma Fendi and Dior her
Get a mood swing, I'll be gone by tomorrow

Steady callin' my phone (brrt)
I done told you before that it's over, leave me 'lone
Know it's hurtin' you to see me gone
Dark clouds, you gon' see me storm
I won't go back (I won't go back, no)
But trust me, you're gon' hold that (hold that)
Hold that (mmh, mmh)

Get you off my mind now (mind)
I can't get you off my mind now (mind)
I can't get you off my mind now (mind)
I can't get you off my mind now (mmh, mmh, mind)
I can't get you off my mind now (mind)
I can't get you off my mind now (mind)
I can't get you off my mind now (yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now( mmh, mmh)
I can't
