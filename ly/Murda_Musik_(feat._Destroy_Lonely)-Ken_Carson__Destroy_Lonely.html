		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah) this that Murda music
I let that chopper sang and they listen to it
My bitch she like to get high, yeah, we getting booted
I pop a perk and sip my drank, yeah, now I'm zooted
I'm a superstar, yeah, I live my life like a movie
I drive foreign cars and fuck bad bitches, yeah, I get to it
I bought bitch a brand new bag, yeah, when I get bored
And that little bitch keep callin' me dad cause he can't afford it
I swear I could've been a dad but I made that bitch abort it
Down bad, when I was down bad now a young nigga worth a fortune
Hell nah, you can't be my BM, that's just like extortion
Hell nah, little bitch can't put me on no child support
Make a bitch take a plan B before I let a bitch take me to court

Yeah, we getting too much cash, lil' bitch, but you know a young nigga want more
Damn, this freak ho water wet, I think I need a new surfboard
Yeah, I keep it a hundred thousand, young nigga, I ain't telling stories
Yeah, I spend a couple thousand every time time I walk up in that store
Yeah, I might blow a couple thousand on that bitch 'cause she a pretty whore
Yeah, this ain't the regular Lamb lil' bitch, yeah, this a Aventador
Yeah, and we havin' sticks for ham niggas 'cause we don't fuck with pork
Yeah, I might smoke an opp nigga shawty but I don't fuck with Porche

Yeah, I spotted an opp in the party, told lil' bro lock the door
I up my MAC and I tell the pussy-nigga, "Get on the floor
Give me yo' last, give me give that watch, bitch, it ain't yours no more"
I got this bitch with OnlyFans, yeah, she's a super whore
She'll do whatever for them bands that's why she mi amor
Hell, yeah, she mine for sure, yeah

This that Murda music
I let that chopper sang and they listen to it
My bitch she like to get high, yeah, we getting booted
I pop a perk and sip my drank, yeah, now I'm zooted
I'm a superstar, yeah, I live my life like a movie
I drive foreign cars and fuck bad bitches, yeah, I get to it
I bought bitch a brand new bag, yeah, when I get bored
And that little bitch keep callin' me dad cause he can't afford it
I swear I could've been a dad but I made that bitch abort it
Down bad, when I was down bad now a young nigga worth a fortune
Hell nah, you can't be my BM, that's just like extortion
Hell nah, little bitch can't put me on no child support
Make a bitch take a plan B before I let a bitch take me to court

(Wrap up the trash, yeah)
