		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never knew love could be a silence in the heart
A moment when the time is still
And all I've been looking for is right here in my arms
Just waiting for the chance to begin

I never knew love could be the sunlight in your eyes
On a day that you may not have seen
And all I've been searching for, well words could never say
When a touch is more than anything

Maybe you will never know how much I love you
But of this, be sure
Here is your paradise, here is your book of life
Where you and I will be forevermore
Here is your paradise, here is your book of life
Where you and I will be forevermore

And in the dark night, you'll follow the bright light
And go where the love must go
And you will wake in the morning to a brand new day
Take all your worries away

Maybe you will never know how much I love you
But of this, be sure
Here is your paradise, here is your book of life
Where you and I will be forevermore
Here is your paradise, here is your book of life
Where you and I will be forevermore
