		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so unjust
That we must
Feel inadequasy
Where is your empathy
I feel a misfit
Wearing this kit
Sterotype me
That is my fee

Free
To manipulate
When I stipulate
That's my prerogative
I tell you
Free
To manipulate
When i stipulate
It's going round round
Tell you what i've found

Sex sells
Every night and day
It will be this way
Sex sells
So what you gotta prove
When it's all your life to choose

You play the game
Make me tame
I have a personality
Don't care if it's a fallacy
Oh what's the harm
Use that charm
You gotta show some skin
Make sure your be thin
Free
To manipulate
When i stipulate
That's my prerogative
I tell you
Free
To manipulate
When i stipulate
It's going round round
Tell you what i've found
