		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm buying acres in the sky
And building stairs with every lie
With every step I make her cry
Until I die, until I die

I'm swinging hard for all my life
Reaching across this great divide
Until I see the other side
Until I die, until I die

And the night grows darker still
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows dark, darker still

I'm swimming deep into her eyes
I'm swimming strong but won't survive
The dark, the blue, I cannot fight
Until I die, until I die

I'm wishing hard upon the night
With every wish, a new star dies
But bright the light behind her eyes
Until I die, until I die

And the night grows darker still
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows dark
Darker still

Until I die, until I die
And the night grows darker still
Until I die, until I die
And the night grows darker still
Until I die, until I die
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows dark

And the night grows darker still
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows dark
