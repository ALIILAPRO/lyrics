		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah nigga, it's whatever
Yeah bitch, it's whatever
Yeah, I am

I'll never let my niggas down
Nah, I'll never put them choppas down (never)
Hit your bitch when I come in town
She ain't never let a nigga down (yeah)
I just went up the sco', I got ten different hoes
They swear they go with a nigga (swear that they)
I'm a superstar, we duck off on the low
She know not to take no pictures (yeah)
Blogs put a nigga business out
Knock 'em down then switch 'em out (yeah)
I got opps I don't know about (I don't know about)
Stand on business, we don't talk about it (shh)
10 got ten bad bitches in the mansion 
dancin', look like the soul train
I'm on the airplane
Pourin' up purple, it look like the Soul Plane
We do real numbers, real chef, Benihana's (yeah)
I'll take a nigga under
Watch three-hundred, these the new Yeezy's
'Fore they drop (yeah), call 'em Dondas
Jay said I got the thunder (woo)
Pray to God for the runners
Whole pandemic, all I seen was snow
it's like I missed a summer
Put it on my mama
Yo Gotti, he a hall of famer drug dealer (legend)
Yo Gotti he be runnin' 'round with real killers (steppin')
Hush gang, he ain't frontin' no fuck niggas (shh)
Big stepper, we'll stomp one of you lil' niggas (be quiet)
Niggas say they slidin', nobody dyin' though 
(Niggas say they slidin', nobody dyin') oh
Your net worth in the Forbes, but what was they lyin' 'fore?
(You in the Forbes but why is they lyin'?) yeah
Go dollar for dollar, shotta for shotta
We can go thottie for thottie
I'm scholarship Gotti, you gave a bitch a Birkin
I just gave her some knowledge
I'm on some rocker shit
She was basic, I made her a model bitch
Lenny Kravitz, I pull up, start rockin' shit
She athletic, she built like a soccer bitch
.45 but that 9 got a softer kick
Don't slip 'cause I drip when I'm walkin', bitch
I be rollin' that jay with some bosses, shit
Rondo, got 9 on my hip
Like Steph put thirty in the clip, I'm equip
Lay a nigga flat on the floor like a quilt
I just ran off on the plug like a bill
I'm at the top like I'm king of the hill
She freaky, she poppin' that pussy like pill
I'm tryna fuck, I'm just keepin' it real
That pussy be bald and wet like a seal
Since Corona that young nigga ill
Get turned to a donor, you play with my bills
I'm knockin' all my opps out the field
I'm knockin' all my opps out the field
Young niggas sick, young nigga ill
All of my niggas united
Just bought into DC United
I gave him the pack and he tanked it (tanked it)
Twenty-five pints and he dranked it (uh)
Just showed her my account and she fainted (on God)
Showed him the plug and he thanked me (you welcome)
"Ayy, Gotti you low, you janky"
Lil' bitch just posted me, brainless (dumbass)
Rolls Royce stainless (steel)
Made my neighborhood famous (for real)
Rich cribs for tourists (for tourists)
Ayy, why yo' jewelry blurry?
All my jewelry flawless, all my niggas stallers
None of my niggas sanctified, they be throwin' crosses
All my Forgi's offset
All my diamonds factory set
That my lil' savage, I stamped that
My bitch like the sunset, yeah

Yeah, yeah
I see the same niggas doin' the same shit every day (same shit every day)
Different nigga, yeah, I had to go and make a way (yeah, I hadgo and make a way)
Any day, it's another million-dollar play
It's like seventy mil' now, 'nother hundred on the way
