		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Natasha brings me kisses in the moonlight,
She kneels above me, silk upon my skin,
I reach for her, and I can feel her heartbeat,
Beneath her breast so heavy in my hand;

The rain is running rivers on my window,
And shimmers on the streetlights down below,
She's happy when I hold her in the shadows,
And whispers of a life I've never known;

And will you dance, Natasha dance for me,
Because I want to feel the passion in your soul,
And when you dance, will you tell me in a story,
The joy and pain of living in your world;

And with the light, I wake up in the morning,
And she has gone, it must have been a dream,
And then I see the roses on my pillow,
And now I know that she will come again;

And she will dance, Natasha dance for me,
Again I want to feel the passion in your soul,
And when you move, will you show me in a story,
The joy and pain of living in your world;

Natasha dance for me
