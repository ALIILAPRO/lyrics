		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Builds within my body, alright go
Four I just said (four) 
You faggot piece of shit on the ground (four?) Four?
Oh, hey, what are you talking about, Ross?
Hey, toms on the
Hey, are you saying so there's no clicks?
Hey, we're recording now, start
Just fucking do it, dammit
I get "Twist," I wish we could put "Twist" on the fucking tape
Want to hear it? (Stupid)
Fuck you, fuck you
Okay, you piece of shit

Anger inside 
Builds within my body
Why'd you hit me?
What have I done? You tried to hit me

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man

I don't run around
Trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes
I am free, you're just a wannabe

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man
To come out

Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown
Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now
Hit me, clown

Clown you ain't shit, turn around, get your face split
Clown you ain't shit, turn around, get your face split
Clown you ain't shit, turn around, get your face split
Clown you ain't shit, turn around, get your face split

Turn if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man

I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
I'm just a fucking little
