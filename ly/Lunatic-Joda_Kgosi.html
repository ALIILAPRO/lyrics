		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I'm crazy
I'm not just crazy
You're such a liar
That drives me crazy
You got me shook
Like you just tazed me
If you could be faithful
I would be brazey

You're not as bad as my ex
You're ten times worse
You did not come with blessings
You're a curse
I gave you too many chances
Problems immersed
I thought one day I'd hurt you
I fought off the urge

I opened my arms up to you
Right after you cheated one me
Look I do not care what you do
I want you permanently
And if I take you back then you will never leave

Right... Sych

Got me acting like a lunatic
Like I'm psychotic
Like a clock I tick
I ain't got time for this
And like a bomb I tick
I might blow up again
I might blow up again
I might blow up again

Got me acting like a lunatic ..crazy chick
Like I'm psychotic ..crazy chick
Like a clock I tick ..crazy chick
I ain't got time for this..crazy chick
And like a bomb I tick..crazy chick
I might blow up again..crazy chick
I might blow up again..crazy chick
I might blow again..
