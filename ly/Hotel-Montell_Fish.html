		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a slave to her, slave to her love
I'm a slave to her, slave to her love
I'm a slave to her, slave to her love
I'm a slave to your love, it's who you are that I-

When I met you in that hotel room
I could tell that you were so bad news
But I keep messin' with ya, messin' with ya
And now you're messin' with me, messin' with me

I keep goin' back to this hotel room
I just don't know what the hell to just tell you
But I love messin' with ya, messin' with you
Girl, are you messin' with me, messin' with me?

This hotel room
You put me in, my love
Ohh, I, I love you
You know me, girl
Better than I know myself, my love
Hotel hell
Ooh, you

When I met you in that hotel room
I could tell that you were so bad news
But I keep messin' with ya, messin' with ya
And now you're messin' with me, messin' with me

I keep goin' back to this hotel room
I just don't know what the hell to just tell you
But I love messin' with ya, messin' with you
Girl, are you messin' with me, messin' with me?
