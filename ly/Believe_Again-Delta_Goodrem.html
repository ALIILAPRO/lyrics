		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever stared into the rain
Thought the clouds would never disappear
Have you ever screamed out into the dark
Thinking no one else could hear

I was leaving footprints tainted by my past
On this winding road to you

[Chorus]
I'd lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
Now I feel whole again
You bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
and I believe
I believe again

Have you ever spun out of control
Like you never saw the road ahead
Have you ever just kept looking back
Ever closer to the edge

I was praying for the light I see in your eyes
I had all but given up

[Chorus]

[Repeats in background]
I believe the impossible is possible to overcome
I believe in miracles
Born from love in everyone

[Chorus]

I believe the impossible is possible to overcome
I believe in miracles
Born from love in everyone
