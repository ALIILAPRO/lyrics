		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'm a dreamer
Maybe I'm a fool for you
But I think I'm a believer
I believe in something new
Maybe I'm a liar
But maybe I will tell the truth
I think we gotta hold on
And I hope it's not too late for us to change

Will I see your face
Somewhere in a better place?

Maybe I'm a dreamer
Maybe I'm a fool for you
But I think I'm a believer
I believe in something new
Maybe I'm a liar
But maybe I will tell the truth
I think we gotta hold on
And I hope it's not too late for us to change

Will I see your face
Somewhere in a better place?
