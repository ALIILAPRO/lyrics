		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came down your stairs with that sundress and those Chuck Taylors on
And your pops said, "Don't keep me up all night long"
We pulled out your drive about the time the sky went pink
I said, "Baby, what ya think?"

And you said, "Take it slow, I know a backroad, we can find a spot to be alone
We can sway back and forth to what's on the radio"
'Cause you said that you were all mine, innocent look in your eye
Nothing but time, kiss me all night and let's just take it slow

You said, "We got nowhere to be, nowhere to go so lets just take it slow"

I parked that Chevrolet in that field where those daises grow
Put one in your hair, I said, "Don't you dare ever let me go"
And I just wanna hold you 'til that sun comes back
And I just wanna know you like nobody ever has

And you said, "Take it slow, I know a backroad, we can find a spot to be alone
We can sway back and forth to what's on the radio"
'Cause you said that you were all mine, innocent look in your eye
Nothing but time, kiss me all night and let's just take it slow
Slow

Nowhere to be, nowhere to go
Don't wanna leave, can't take you home

Let's just take it slow, I know a backroad, we can find a spot to be alone
We can sway back and forth to what's on the radio
'Cause you said that you were all mine, innocent look in your eye
Nothing but time, kiss me all night and let's just take it slow

You said, "We got nowhere to be, nowhere to go, so lets just take it slow"
Yeah, let's just take it slow
