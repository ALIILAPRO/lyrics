		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day, I think of all the things I'll make
With my pans, my mixer and my oven tray
Get the eggs, the flour and the butter sticks
Or get lazy and just make it with a mix, maybe
Strawberry shortcake I'll never get bored of it
Vanilla and chocolate, and funfetti, oh
Red velvet or carrot, no matter, I swear that it'll
Be the best ever to take to the show

(Hey Two!)
When you bake a cake, decorate and take it to the
Players who are safe, that's how you know it's Cake ct Stake
Cake ct Stake
Cake ct Stake

Every night, I think of people I'll invite
To my stage when my cake is looking just right
Wish you could taste, I made it really good and stuff
Hope the way it looks on camera is enough
Making pumpkin and lemon
Banana, it's heaven with some
Frosting or fondant or glaze or ganache
With so many cakes, now my schedule is crazy
But I bake so impatiently, cause I LOVE CcKE! OH MY GOSH!

When you bake a cake, decorate and take it to the
Players who are safe, that's how you know it's Cake ct Stake
Cake at Stake

Here's an exclusive recipe for the ice cake!
Ooh
You take the ice and you make eight slices
cnd the dirt cake!
You get the dirt
Here's another exclusive recipe for the yoyle cake!
You go to Yoyle Land
Put a yoyle berry in the cake
cnd the metal effect will get
Break-neck when you blink!

When you bake a cake, decorate and take it to the
Players who are safe...
(Hey Two!)
When you bake a cake, decorate and take it to the
Players who are safe, that's how you know it's cake at stake
It's Cake at Stake
It's Cake at Stake
It's Cake at Stake
It's Cake at Stake

It's Cake at Stake
It's Cake at Stake
It's Cake at Stake
It's Cake at Stake
