		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (La-la, la-da, da-da, da-da)
(La-la, la-da, da-da, da-da)

Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moon rise, tide change right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each others vice

Our feelings go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days, or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough I'm only for your consumption

Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to, be stable
Earth keeps spinning around, we're breathing
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (habitual, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, yeah
Never ungrateful for it
That's how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional (call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual, yeah (habitual, yeah)

(La-la, la-da, da-da, da-da)
(La-la, la-da, da-da, da-da)

Just to think that we've been out here, this whole time
Working through the seasons
Never cross paths, 'til we had a reason
Now let's fast forward, look up a whole new perspective for life

Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinning around
We're breathing
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (so habitual)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, yeah (no)
Never ungrateful for it (never ungrateful)
That's how we both want it
Habitual (ooh)
Can't nobody (oh) keep me like you (keep me like you)
Call it unconventional (call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual, yeah (our love is habitual)

(La-la, la-da, da-da, da-da)
(La-la, la-da, da-da, da-da)
