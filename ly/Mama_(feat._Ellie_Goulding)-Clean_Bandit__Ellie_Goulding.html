		  Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, I do, I do now

I see my body in a different light, I-I-I
As if I woke up in a different life, I-I-I
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water
'Cause I'm burning

'Cause a little bit sooner turned into a lot
There's no way I'd be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought that I was not
Tell me, tell me, I-I-I

Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, what do I do now?

I've never felt so good, I feel so soft, na-na-na
And now I know it's heaven on my spots, na-na-na
I didn't know that I could have these thoughts, yeah-yeah
Somebody pass me the water
'Cause I'm burning
(Take a lot)

'Cause a little bit sooner turned into a lot
There's no way I'd be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought that I was not
Tell me, tell me, I-I-I

Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, what do I do now?

Everything I thought I knew about me's upside down
Everything is changing but I think I love it now, I-I-I

Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, what do I do now?

All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh what do I do now?
