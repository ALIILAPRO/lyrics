		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish to give, to take, to make, to shake
I wanna see it happen
I want to see, to be, the one that plays the game
Without no fears and regrets
I want to know you better than I know myself
I want to feel the end and to enjoy the consequence

I am playing the game
I am playing the game
To wash who I am

I am playing the game
The one that will take me to my end
I am waiting for the rain
To wash, who I am

I want to move, to lose, to take the grooves
And to give it all back
I want to give the time, rewind
And to kick it right from the start
To be unknown and all alone, lose the kind that are behind
To start a new play by myself and to give the best I have

I am playing the game
I am playing the game
To wash who I am

I am playing the game
The one that will take me to my end
I am waiting for the rain
To wash who I am
