		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When death and all his angels find you
Will you call out will you call out

When death and all his angels catch you
Will you cry out will you cry out

At the end of the line there's no more time
And you go it alone you can never come home
At the end of the line
From dust and ashes I have called you
And dust you shall become in the end

From dust and ashes I have called you
And dust you shall become in the end

Oh death oh death
Where is your sting

At the end of the line there's no more time
And you go it alone you can never come home
At the end of the line
