		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big, big sleep for me
I've been on the edges
I've seen all the endings now evergreen
Felled and into pieces, loud
And all at peace, it's sound

Can't get back to life now
Can't get anywhere fast
Won't let anything last can't get out

Say, say it to me in any other language
I'll understand it now
Build a deck of dreams
Float beyond the vantage
Low, but not vanishing now

Can't get back to life now
Can't get anywhere fast
Won't let anything last can't get out

Turning in circles, swimming in hell
Heaven eternal just for an hour just for now

Can't get back to life now
Can't get anywhere fast
Won't let anything last can't get out
