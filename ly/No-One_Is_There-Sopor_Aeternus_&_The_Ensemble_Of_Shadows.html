		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now and then I'm scared, when i seem to forget 
how sounds become words or even sentances... 
No, i don't speak anymore and what could i say, 
since no-one  is there and there is nothing to say... 

So, i prefer to lie in darkest silence  alone... 
listening to the lack of light, or sound, 
or someone to talk to, for  something to share... 
but there is no hope and no-one is there. 

No, no, no... not one living soul 
and there is nothing (left) to say, 
in darkness I lie all  alone by myself, 
sleeping most of the time to endure the pain.

I am not breathing a word, i haven't spoken for weeks 
and yet the mistress inside me is (secretly)  straining her ears.
But there is no-one, and it seems to me at times
that with every passing hour another word is leaving my mind... 

I am the mistress of loneliness,  
my court is deserted but i do not care. 
The presence of people is ugly and cold  
and something i can neither watch nor bear. 

So, i prefer to lie in darkest silence alone,
listening to the lack of light, or sound, 
or someone to talk to, for something to share...
but there is no hope and no-one is there. 

No, I don't speak anymore and what should i say, 
since no-one is there and there is nothing to say? 
All  is oppressive, alles ist schwer,
there is no-one and 
NO-ONE IS THERE...
