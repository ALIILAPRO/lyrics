		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, Ooh-oh, ooh, ta-ra

푸른 달은 이미 다 지고
눈을 가린 안개 더 짙어져
손끝에 집중해 더 깊이
We at each other through

나쁘게 말해 그래 그렇게 (yeah)
더 아프게 해봐 hurting me inside (yeah)
It's a shame baby, it's no wonder
We at each other through

One, two, three, four (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh)
You I live for (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ta-ra)
One, two, three, four (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh)
Watch me, burning, screaming (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ta-ra)
Boy, 'cause you

You got me layin' low 
You got me layin' low
My tears are running down
나쁜 버릇인 걸 boy

You got me layin' low 
You got me layin' low, oh, oh
유리 속에 널 부르짖는 내가 넌 보여

Barely high, layin' low 
Can I slide? let me know
Love or lust, back throat
Yeah, we both know this (we both know that)

Painted skies indigo
In the glass, Merlot (when it stopped)
Yeah, this all was meant to be
Suck the truth right outta me

Giving it back
Go ahead rest down your head now
You seem to be barely blinking
When you're mine, is it good? 
Is it good?, Issa mood
Love on top, you know, eh
Let me get a taste, yeah

One, two, three, four (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh)
You I live for (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ta-ra)
One (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)
Watch me, burning, screaming (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh)
Boy, 'cause you

You got me layin' low
You got me layin' low
My tears are running down
나쁜 버릇인 걸 boy

You got me layin' low 
You got me layin' low, oh, oh
유리 속에 널 부르짖는 내가 넌 보여

I don't give a shit
알아 나쁜 놈인 거 (ya)
거기까지만 생각했던 불장난

First you be calling me
Then you're all over me
Tired, I gotta leave
What are we gonna be
It's over now (just right now, ooh)

You got me layin' low 
You got me layin' low (ooh)
My tears are running down
나쁜 버릇인 걸 boy (boy)

You got me layin' low
You got me layin' low, oh, oh
유리 속에 널 부르짖는 내가 넌 보여

One, two, three, four (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh)
You I live for (ooh, ooh-oh, ooh, ta-ra)

You got me layin' low 
You got me layin' low, oh, oh
유리 속에 널 부르짖는 내가 넌 보여

I'm gonna be layin' low
Gonna layin' low, I'll be layin' low
