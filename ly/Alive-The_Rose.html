		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nights
Where I just wanna get floated
Sometimes, I kinda feel like I'm broken
Lost my color
Or maybe somebody stole it
Gets so dark inside
I love these heavy emotions

Lately
My whole world feels like it's shaking
Everything is faded, changing
I don't care they call me crazy

Baby, I'm alive
And I've been driving through the night
Turning off the lights
And now I'm following the lines
Walking through the smoke and
Not even chokin'
Don't know where I'm going
I'm not even scared
Baby, I'm alive
And now I'm falling from the sky

I'm free
When I'm rolling in silence
I can't breathe
I hear the echoes and sirens
Lost my color
Or maybe somebody stole it
Get so dark inside
I love these heavy emotions

Lately
My whole world feels like it's shaking
Everything is faded, changing
I don't care they call me crazy

Baby, I'm alive
And I've been driving through the night
Turning off the lights
And now I'm following the lines
Walking through the smoke and
Not even choking
Don't know where I'm going
I'm not even scared
Baby, I'm alive
And now I'm falling from the sky

(Baby, I'm alive) baby, I feel so alive
(Baby, I'm alive) baby, I feel so alive

Walking through the smoke and
Not even choking
Don't know where I'm going
I'm not even scared
Baby, I'm alive
And now I'm falling from the sky
Baby, I'm alive
And I've been driving through the night
Turning off the lights
