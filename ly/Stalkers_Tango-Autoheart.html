		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know, I know, I know
This situation's strange
It takes a little getting
A little getting used to

Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me more
Than you possibly can

It's not that complicated
No matter what they say
You'll never meet another me
It's not that difficult
To get your head around
You'll never meet another me
You'll never, never, ever, never
Ever meet another me

I know, I know, I know
I'm always in your place
But don't you see, my dear?
I am your doppelganger, I have your face so

Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me more
Than you possibly can

It's not that complicated
No matter what they say
You'll never meet another me
It's not that difficult
To get your head around
You'll never meet another me
You'll never, never, never, ever
Ever meet another me

Ay, ay, ah ba da-bum bum bum
Bum bum ba ba da-bum bum bum ba ba ba-bum
Bum bum bum ba ba ba-bum bum bum
Ba ba ba-bum bum bum bum ba ba ba-bum

It's not that complicated
No matter what they say
I'll never meet another you
It's not that difficult
To get my head around
I'll never meet another you
