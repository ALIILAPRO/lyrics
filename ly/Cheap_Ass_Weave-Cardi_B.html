		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The nerve of you bitches
Like, oh my God, I got no words for you bitches
Like, who's really serving you bitches?
I need some answers, I'm worried for bitches
Like, this really absurd
No wonder these niggas stay curving you bitches
Don't even take no more selfies
That weave don't even deserve any pictures
Like, where did you buy that shit?
Who really acknowledged it?
What made you feel that you would be lit if you went and copped that shit?
They told you it look good?
Wasn't you iffy?
Oh, I know, they told you that "you get two bundles for fifty"
Girl, you ain't low
I know how this go
Cheap shoes is okay, cheap dress is okay, but cheap weave is a "no"
Don'tcha do it to yourself that's bad for your health
Don't fuck up your flow
Talk shit about me with your dusty ass weave?
Now you outta control
I'm Cardi B, I come through and I kill everything, everything and that's a fact
Got me on my hitman shit like brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap
I'm fully reloaded, full clip
I cut to the chase, snip-snip
That weave gotta go, pink slip
Looking washed up, drip-drip

I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave

So check yourself before you come at me
Cardi B killing shit, I'm causing casualties
I am a masterpiece, you are a tragedy
Finish you like Mortal Kombat, fatality
I got shit jumping like 'What a Time'
Like 'Jumpman, Jumpman'
That weave you got should be a crime
You got no luck, man
And how you niggas even let them in the crib with that?
You know that weave stink, that shit need a Tic Tac
Now you tell me you pulling hair off your pillows, hair off the sheets, and even hair out your asscrack
So cheap weave is okay? I think I missed that
I see a track showing, you need to fix that
You got a braid loose, you need to twist that
You got it fucked up, I would never pick that
Lady Leshurr done told y'all to go brush your teeth
But after you done, don't you leave your crib with that cheap ass weave
I'm begging Lord, oh God, oh God, oh please, oh please
Please just bless these thots, these thots with they cheap ass weave

I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave
