		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sirens are calling
The kingdom is falling
And I don't how I'm supposed to save it
The whiskey is warming
Yet the thought remains haunting
And I swear it won't ever leave my brain

She's got nothing to lose
I've got the world to gain
So please explain to me
Why she behaves this way

Just leave me to myself
So I can contemplate
On all her silent moves
On that devilish gaze

Now I'm lost and can't find you
I just wanted to remind you
That your angel face, it resonates within
And when its finally time to
I hope I'm right there beside you
Because I'm stuck in your orbit 
And I never want to leave

She's got nothing to lose
I've got the world to gain
So please explain to me
Why she behaves this way
				            		
Just leave me to myself
So I can contemplate
On all her silent moves
On that devilish gaze
