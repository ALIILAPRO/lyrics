		  Dancer in the dark
Dancer in the dark
Dancer in the dark
We're spinning around (around)
Dancer in the dark
Dancer in the dark
Dancer in the dark
We're spinning around (around)
Dancer in the dark

You take me back and nothing new, please don't be shy
I know that you feel like me too, don't be afraid
Give me your love, baby give me your hand now, yeah

I just wanna talk with you anywhere
I feel like your not awake
I wish you could take me away
But nothing will happen today
Give me love, give me all, give me all you can
I feel like down on a way
I wish you could take me away
But nothing will happen today
Baby, I just want you to listen

Dancer in the dark (baby hold up, hold up, hold up)
Dancer in the dark (baby hold up, hold up, hold up)
Dancer in the dark (baby hold up, hold up, hold up)
We're spinning around (baby hold up, hold up, hold up)

Dancer in the dark (baby hold up, hold up, hold up)

Give me your love, baby give me your hand now, yeah
Give me your love, baby give me your hand now, yeah
Give me your love, baby give me your hand now, yeah
Give me your love baby give me your hand now, yeah
