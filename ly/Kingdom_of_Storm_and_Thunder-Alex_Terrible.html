		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hell is right here
You've been forgotten
You were abandoned
Hell is right here
Kingdom of storm and thunder

I'll sharpen the blade, so it shines
Gonna prepare gunpowder tonight
Big bada boom, big bada boom, buh
Don't tell me that I'm just wasting life
Gonna prepare gunpowder tonight
Boom click, cluck motherfucker

So what place is this?
Was it really created by one
Who knows the love? No

Hell is right here
You've been forgotten
You were abandoned
Hell is right here
Kingdom of storm and thunder

I'll sharpen the blade, so it shines
Gonna prepare gunpowder tonight
Big bada boom, big bada boom, buh
Don't tell me that I'm just wasting life
Gonna prepare gunpowder tonight
Boom, click, cluck motherfucker

So what place is this?
Was it really created by one
Who knows the love? No

I smell it
I smell it

Oh, Holy Father
Have mercy on me
'Cause I'm a sinner
As soon as I stepped on this earth
I began to sin
And my sins are fills to the brim

Hell is right here
You've been forgotten
You were abandoned
Hell is right here
Kingdom of storm and thunder
Hell is right here
You've been forgotten
You were abandoned
Hell is right here
Kingdom of storm and thunder
