		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Oh

Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
And aim for my heart if you feel like it
Take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control so we waited
I put on a show now we're naked
You say I'm a kid, my ego is big
I don't give a shit 
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Uh, kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you 
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Uh, I don't need to try to control you
Uh, look into my eyes and I'll own you 
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Baby it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right, but when you're with me
I make you believe that I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car we can ride it
Wherever you want get inside it
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear
I'll take it from here 
Oh yeah yeah, and it goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Uh, kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you 
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (ooh)

Uh, I don't need to try to control you (oh yeah)
Uh, look into my eyes and I'll own you 
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (yeah)
I've got the moves like Jagger (yeah, yeah)

Uh, you want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret 
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this, ah

So watch and learn 
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right, yeah
But if I share my secret 
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this, eh, yeah yeah yeah

And it goes like this
Uh, kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you (take me by the tongue)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you (eh, yeah)
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (ah, yeah)

Uh, I don't need to try to control you (yeah, ooh)
Uh, look into my eyes and I'll own you (oh-oh)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
