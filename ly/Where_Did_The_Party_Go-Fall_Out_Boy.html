		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na

I'm here to collect your hearts,
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say,
But I can't stop listening

This is the story of how they met,
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes,
And when she touched him he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget
Never forget

And all the boys are smoking Menthol's,
Girls are getting back rubs,
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough

My old aches become new again
My old friends become ex's again

Oh where did the party go?
We were ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Where, where did the party go?

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, yeah

I know I expect too much
And not enough all at once
You know I only wanted fun
And you got me all fucked up
Oh no

I looked for your name on the Ouija board
And you're making magic oh dear lord
You and me are the difference between real love
And the love on TV, love on TV

And all the boys are smoking Menthol's,
Girls are getting back rubs,
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough

My old aches become new again
My old friends become ex's again, yeah

Oh where did the party go?
We were ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Where, where did the party go?

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

All the kids who screamed (we weren't the same)
In sweaty rooms
Now we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs

Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema light
So let's fade away together one dream at a time

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Oh where did the party go?
We were ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Where, where did the party go?

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na
