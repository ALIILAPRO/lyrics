		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was staring at the ceiling
You're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
And we're stuck inside the silence
In a cold cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

I find refuge in a distance
Even when we're breaking down (down, down, down, down)
Can we pause it just for one kiss?
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
'Cause I never meant to hurt you
And I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut
