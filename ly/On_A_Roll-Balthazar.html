		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must've been on a roll
Kept on losing control
Ah, but the night is not meant to make sense
Out of it all
Oh, but it's taking its toll
Shakes the body and soul
And my two arms don't reach far enough to
Embrace it all

I must've gone through a phase
Must've been in a daze
Can't get away, cannot turn the page
I'm a rat in a cage
I must be under a spell
As far as I can tell
I'm in a trance, see I stand no chance
Oh, I know damn well

Oh, I know you've seen it coming
Telling me I should stop running
From it all, but how I keep on running
Running right to you
Oh, I know you've seen it coming
Telling me I should stop running
From it all, but how I keep on running

I'm slipping into my role
Letting go of control
Let it to the other to take the piss
Out of it all
I am confused to the bone
I am stuck in a zone
Oh, but the night is not meant to make you
Feel all alone

Oh, I know you've seen it coming
Telling me I should stop running
From it all, but how I keep on running
Running right to you
Oh, I know you've seen it coming
Telling me I should stop running
From it all, but how I keep on running

Ain't no control
Ain't no cooldown
Ain't no remedy
Ain't no sideway
Dress it up the way you want
Can't control it
Can't contain it
Can't direct it
Cannot get away
Can't reduce it
Look at it the way you want

Ain't no control
Ain't no cooldown
Ain't no remedy
Ain't no sideway
Dress it up the way you want
Can't control it
Can't contain it
Can't direct it
Cannot get away
Can't reduce it
Look at it the way you want

Ain't no control
Ain't no cooldown
Ain't no remedy
Ain't no sideway
Dress it up the way you want
Can't control it
Can't contain it
Can't direct it
Cannot get away
Can't reduce it
Look at it the way you want

Oh, I know you've seen it coming
Telling me I should stop running
From it all, but how I keep on running
Running right to you
Oh, I know you've seen it coming
Telling me I should stop running
From it all, but how I keep on running
