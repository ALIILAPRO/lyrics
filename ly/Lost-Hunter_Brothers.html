		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was way out in a motel town
Gasing up, not slowing down 
No service and no glove box Rand McNally 

She flashed a sweet tea coffee smile at me
An angel trapped in apron strings
So I stayed until that open sign stopped blinking 

I said "I wanna stay right here, right here, right here‚Äù
She said "if you're leaving why don't you take me "

Chorus
And I got lost in her eyes... 
I was losing my mind
Like the sun runs into summer, we were meant to find each other 
Only one way in and one way out of town
But you don't leave the kind of feeling that I found 
When I got lost, I got lost

The world out there's a passing train
This town don't but the season's change 
We're just front porch kissing like it's going out of style

Letu0027s stay right here, right here, right here
All the crazy places she takes me
 
Chorus

You don't leave the kind of feeling, you donu0027t leave the kind of feeling
You donu0027t leave the kind of feeling that Iu0027ve found
You don't leave the kind of feeling, you donu0027t leave the kind of feeling
You donu0027t leave the kind of feeling that Iu0027ve found

Chorus
