		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut out the tongue 
Communicate with divinity
Eyes roll back
Witness eternity

Covered faces
Speaking in tongues
Silent voices
Prostrate bodies, heads hung

A passage between
Has been created

Standing in silence
Awaiting its presence
A passage between
Has been created

Clawing at walls of flesh
Urge to pass through
It's all connected
This plane and the other

It's all connected

Silent voices
Uttering words beyond language
Knowing what only whispers convey
Standing in silence
Awaiting its presence
Blood earns their keep

Cut out the tongue 
Communicate with divinity
Our eyes roll back
Witness eternity

Witnessing eternity

Cut out the tongue 
Communicate with divinity
Eyes roll back
Witness eternity
