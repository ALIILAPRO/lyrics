Lil Tjay (Nagra)
Yeah

I think it's time to shine, I've been waiting so long
Broski serving time, he been gone for so long
And I promise I'ma do this shit for us, just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
In the telly sippin' Henny' and I got my robe on
And they know I'm throwin' bullets, told the opps' to go long
They weren't ready for that last year, told us "Hold on"
Bro gone, ain't no chill button, and we gon' go strong

Hopping out, I got a MAC, hit 'em, do the dash
Celebrate and laugh (gang, gang, gang)
I ain't want for all this to get physical
Don't get left when they gotta' come visit you
Gang, gang, call 'em out to extort you (skrrt, skrrt)
Little more than one-eighty, the Porsche do
Tjay shinning 'cause I can afford to
I'm a stain, so I gotta' move cordial
Happy I'm livin' the life I was given
Now we ain't shakin', don't think that I'm slippin (ah)
I pull up, I'm grippin', still makin' my chicken
You mad? My bad, Lil Tjay ain't trippin'
And they mad 'cause I'm stackin' my knots and fuckin' they thots
Yes, I'm still puttin' it on for the block, still on my way to the top
And I'm stealin' your food, 'cause my hunger ain't never gon' stop
Trauma fuck with my mind, ain't wastin' no time
I'm focused on betterin' mine
Brothers gonna' run up your spot
Throwin' shots from behind, Lil Tjay you one of a kind
It's the reason I gotta' go off
Take your moms out the hood, it don't matter the cost
Seventeen, life is short, but I'm rich and a boss (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
See, the haters is mad 'cause they hate how I floss

I think it's time to shine, I've been waiting so long
Broski serving time, he been gone for so long
And I promise I'ma do this shit for us, just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
In the telly sippin' Henny' and I got my robe on
And they know I'm throwin' bullets, told the opps' to go long
They weren't ready for that last year, told us "Hold on"
Bro gone, ain't no chill button, and we gon' go strong

Bro gone, bodies drop all the time and I'm still finna' kill some
Run up on me and that steel drummin'
All my life I've been hungry, that meal coming (ah)
Me and my niggas must gettin' no credit
We tryna see commas on debit
I tell my niggas, "We all gon' be fine, I promise, remember I said it"
Hop in the foreign, switch lanes (switch)
I took of the brain for all them nights we went through pain
Drippy, I'm making it rain
Lil Tjay my name, you see what it say on the chain
I've been doing my own thing
When it come to that money, I flip it like cocaine
She eat up and get protein
I just hit it and dump it, no cuffing her, no games (no games)
I be sittin' with no shame
And I've been that nigga before rapping with no chain
Where I come from, they tote thangs
Lil' niggas out buckin' and they shooting with no aim (no aim)
You ain't ever put in no pain
How the fuck you gon' tell on your homie? That's so lame (lame)
I don't ever say no names
So my goal is to get to the top with the whole gang (gang)

I think it's time to shine, I've been waiting so long
Broski serving time, he been gone for so long
And I promise I'ma do this shit for us, just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
In the telly sippin' Henny' and I got my robe on
And they know I'm throwin' bullets, told the opps' to go long
They weren't ready for that last year, told us "Hold on"
Bro gone, ain't no chill button, and we gon' go strong

Hold on, told us "Hold on"
Hold on, oh
