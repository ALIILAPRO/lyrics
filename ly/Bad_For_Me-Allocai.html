		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You put it all on the line again
Hurting me hurts yourself
Am I gonna see you smile again
Loving you don't make sense
You're twenty but you're ten years old
You just don't think, you just jump in and hope you float
That's because you always know
That I'll dive to throw the rope
Your toxic ways it makes me high
A guilty pleasure that I try to hide
I curse your name to make you cry
Fuck and then apologize
Cause you're bad for me and that's why I like you
Cause you ain't no good
Playing with the beat of my heart
Watching your's restart
Don't feel sad for me you can say what you want to
I can never not love you
Ignoring all the signs of our fate
It's toxic but it feels great
Without me you're defeated
Without you I don't feel like I'm needed
But when I'm with you what's the reason
If it ain't love what am I feeling
My people tell me to let go
You just won't change, you just won't be the hand to hold
I don't wanna be alone
It's just so strange that you're my home
It's insincere I know you lied
You disappear when my friends come by
I'm always here by your side
The Bonnie to my Clyde
Cause you're bad for me and that's why I like you
Cause you ain't no good
Playing with the beat of my heart
Watching your's restart
Don't feel sad for me you can say what you want to
I can never not love you
Ignoring all the signs of our fate
It's toxic but it feels great
Yeah it's toxic but it feels great
Cause you're bad for me
And that's why I like you
Cause you're bad for me
