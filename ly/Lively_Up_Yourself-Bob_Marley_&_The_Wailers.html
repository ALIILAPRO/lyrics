		  Woo
Oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

You're gonna lively up yourself and don't be no drag
You lively up yourself, oh, Reggae is another bag
You lively up yourself and don't say no
You gonna lively up yourself, 'cause I said so
Hear what you gon' do

You rock so, you rock so
Like you never did before, yeah
You dip so, you dip so
Dip through my door
You come so, you come so, oh, yeah
You skank so, you skank so
Be alive today

You gonna lively up yourself and don't say no
You lively up yourself, big daddy says so, oh
You lively up yourself and don't be no drag
You lively up yourself, 'cause Reggae is another bag

What you got, that I don't know
I'm-a trying to wonder, wonder
Wonder why you, wonder, wonder why you act so

Yeah
Hey, did you hear what the man say?

Lively up yourself
Your woman in the morning time y'all, ah
(Lively up yourself) keep on livelyin' up your woman 
When the evening come and take ya
Take ya, take ya, take ya
Come on, baby, 'cause I, I wanna be lively myself, ya

(Lively up yourself)
(Lively up yourself)
You gonna rock so, you rock so

(You rock so, you rock so)
(You dip so, you dip so)
(You skank so, you skank so)
And don't be no drag

(You come so, you come so)
Oh, Reggae is another bag
Guess what you got in your bag?
Now what you got in the other bag you got hanging there?
What you say you got?
I don't believe you
