		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me spinnin'

Think about you all the time
Day and night, you're on my mind
Always want you by my side (side, side, side, side)
Babe, come home, what's up tonight?
I could be your alibi
Always want you by my side

You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna stay right here
You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna stay right here
You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna-

You got me spinnin'
You got me spinnin'
You got me spinnin'
You got me spinnin'
You got me spinnin'
You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna stay right here
You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna-

Think about you all the time
Day and night, you're on my mind
Always want you by my side (side, side, side, side)
Tell me what you're thinking 'bout
Something you can't live without
Got my head stuck in a cloud (side, side, side, side)
Call me up, I'll come around
Gravity can't bring me down
Got my head stuck in a cloud

You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna stay right here
You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna stay right here
You got me spinnin' in your atmosphere
It feels so good, I wanna-
