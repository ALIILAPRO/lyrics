		  Hey Girl you comin' with me your comin' with me
Hey Girl you comin' with me your comin' with me
Hey Girl you comin' with me your comin' with me
Hey Girl you comin, ' come on

Talk to me girl, Let me tell you girl
Got you stuck on my elevator
Get it up
On my

Hey
My first flo step want a gold digging woman
Money cash flow all big faced honeys
Frontin' on the floor got them d-boys running
Shorty got both broke can't see what's comin'
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana and she get up on my money
Louie that shit, coogi, fendi and the money
See the carrots on her wrist now she pimps bugs bunny
Used to date Kanye now she want me
While I got my juice wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday with her name on a cake
If I ever play for grade A

Got you stuck on my
On my elevator
Get it up, on my elevator
Check it out!

First floor, stuck on the gold digger
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know cause
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my

She gotta nail kit, she gotta hair kit
She gotta a Gucci bag, her brand new outfit
Stuck on my elevator, she on the second floor
Now I want you to break it down, DJ turn it up some more
Hey, dime piece girl turned to Internet hottie
Little mama got that top model body
South Beach preach throwing back-a-that Bacardi
I'll bet you that brand new Ferrari

Got you stuck on my
On my elevator
Get it up, on my elevator
Check it out!

First floor, stuck on the gold digger
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know cause
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my

My third floor stuck on the hood rat charm
Cut, take boy Holly-hood act charm
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tight broach, bump the low ring tone
Then the ghetto booty gotta ghetto booty on her
Roll up cities don't smoke Arizona
One night stand one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off 10 grand
Project all the way gutter all day

Shorty don't fake she'll put it in your face
Three stories while them hood rats beg

Got you stuck on my
On my elevator
Get it up, on my elevator
Check it out!

First floor, stuck on the gold digger
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know cause
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my ella, e-ella-vator
She's stuck on my
