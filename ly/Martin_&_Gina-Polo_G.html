(I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw, hey, Lilkdubb)

I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home and fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gonna protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't' have a clue
And we Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub

I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hoping that you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear, you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hunnid, never change up
In that sun dress, damn your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub
