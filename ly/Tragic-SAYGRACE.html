		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  why would you swim in my tide just to muddy my waters
why would you learn me so deep just to play in my mind
stolen some years
cried every tear
climbed every mountain
why would I lay down my pride
let you win every fight
can’t say I didn’t try

I had to get up and run
did it for the both of us
you never had the guts
would have stayed stuck
had to sever the rope
before it killed us both
before we went up in smoke
it’s tragic
I had to get up and run
did it for the both of us
you were never the one
we never had it
and it's tragic

alone In a new city
we found home in each other
all the things that felt wrong bought us closer together
It gets cold in the winter
kissed you warm in the kitchen
shared that darkness with you
can’t give more than I gave you
I needed help if I’m being honest
so I got to work solving your problems
f*k all my priorities
save 'em for a rainy day

I had to get up and run
did it for the both of us
you never had the guts
would have stayed stuck
had to sever the rope
before it killed us both
before we went up in smoke
it’s tragic
I had to get up and run
did it for the both of us
you were never the one
we never had it
and it's tragic

if I could travel back in time I’d choose to never love you
at night I often fantasize
bout who i’d be if I never met you
if I had the chance
I’d go back where it all began
take your hand say not this man
stop it in its tracks
words of wisdom I could give ya
knowing me I wouldn’t listen
but when you kissed him I know you felt it
something wasn’t right
doesn’t matter why
you just had to try
had to play with fire
you never learn

take it from me
would you take it from me
you don’t have to learn this one the hard way
