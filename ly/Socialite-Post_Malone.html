		<p>
		  (Fuck)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

I'm always a drink away from a good day
Put on some Jodeci, gettin' loose, ayy
I pummel the coochie, I'm Bobby Boucher
Maybe that's why they put up with all my bullshit
And I bought a new Bentley without a roof, ayy
In LA they tell me my truck is stupid
Doin' cul-de-sac donuts, man, I'm a nuisance
I left my Prince with the Revolutions

Get hammered all alone
But don't feel bad for me
And my chauffeur drinks Patr√≥n 
So call a cab for me, and I'll leave

Fuck me up, it's only a body (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If God exists, it shouldn't be a problem (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Socialite

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

I'm feelin' naughty up on a Sunday
Fuck in the backseat of a Hyundai
I'm callin' her Shrek 'cause she got a donkey
It's crazy how well we get along
My new best friend I just met
Now it's, "Fuck everybody else"
You love someone for six weekends
And never talk to them again

Call it what you want
It's such a tragedy (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I pulled the shortest straw
Another casualty, guess I'll leave (ooh-ooh)

Fuck me up, it's only a body (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If God exists, it shouldn't be a problem (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck me up, it's my birthday party (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So tell me something we got in common (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Socialite
Socialite

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
