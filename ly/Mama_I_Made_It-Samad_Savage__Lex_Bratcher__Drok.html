		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama told me to be a Doctor
I ain’t never have enough patience
Mama told me to be a scholar
Got no class and I’m dangerous
Mama told me to be a lawyer
Raising every bar that they came with
Mama told me to be employed, but
I put in work just to say this; Mama I made it! 
Woah!
Mama I made it
Mama I made it!
Woah!
Mama I made it. Yeah

Ay! Did it like I told you
we not from magnolia, but you really made a soldier
Ay! Lay somebody for you and
I wish a nigga would like your drink gon’ need a coaster
Hey! Like a locomotive
You would train me on the daily just to get me where I’m going
Lady with a drive that’s crazy, so I had to get my toe into
The door and now I’m rolling in the door, patio
Can you not see that I be that
Nigga that’s sticking around like feedback so relax
Picture me giving the crown to these whack emcees that
Whimper when I’m around because he snap and reac
I snicker and clown about them
They sicker? I highly doubt it
A killer. A body found in the river? I probably drowned it
An infinite body count and I’m ignorant, I be shouting
My image is Ali routing the quickest hit, I be wildin
I’m finna make Mommy proud because

Mama told me to be a Doctor
I ain’t never have enough patience
Mama told me to be a scholar
Got no class and I’m dangerous
Mama told me to be a lawyer
Raising every bar that they came with
Mama told me to be employed, but
I put in work just to say this; Mama I made it! 
Woah!
Mama I made it
Mama I made it!
Woah!
Mama I made it


Look
My momma said I would make it, said “Lex just have faith”
So I had faith and halfway , got mad great
I don’t shoot for nothing, cause I ain’t getting no bad case
My shooter keep that thang tucked like he up in a drag race
Ummm , no hyping none of my libs
Problem with shit? No problem driving by where you live
These rappers my seeds, they Act hyper?  They getting hit
But I ain’t Kat Williams, I am fighting none of you kids
My mic will save crowds, might could fade clowns
We homeward bound me and my Michael J hounds
I Have that block spinning like
…
It’s a microwave now and I got mad figures, uh huh
And I made this money from my decisions, uh huh
So when all these haters wanna be bating me
Waiting the top has vacancy and gratefully 
That’s where I will be sitting uh huh because my

Mama told me to be a Doctor
I ain’t never have enough patience
Mama told me to be a scholar
Got no class and I’m dangerous
Mama told me to be a lawyer
Raising every bar that they came with
Mama told me to be employed, but
I put in work just to say this; Mama I made it! 
Woah!
Mama I made it
Mama I made it!
Woah!
Mama I made it
