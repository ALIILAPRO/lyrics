		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I

I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us

'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I, you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We can make it if we try
You and I
Oh, you and I
You and I
