		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don’t wanna live in this world
It’s like my senses got blurred
I hear a whisper in my head
It takes away all the dread

So why why why can’t we just stay
Is it really really really just a hunger game
I just pray
We’ll see a new day

Can’t forget what mama said
Never to forget who I am
Never to regret what I’ve done
Just to be me with everyone
Oh, can’t forget what mama said
Never to forget who I am
Never to regret what I’ve done
Just to be me with everyone

Leave me alone in my dream
Where love and peace live
I wanna build a new world
Baby give me your help

So why why why can’t we just stay
Is it really really really just a hunger game
I just pray
We’ll see a new day

Can’t forget what mama said
Never to forget who I am
Never to regret what I’ve done
Just to be me with everyone
Oh, can’t forget what mama said
Never to forget who I am
Never to regret what I’ve done
Just to be me with everyone

Can’t forget what mama said
Never to forget who I am
Never to regret what I’ve done
Just to be me with everyone
Oh, can’t forget what mama said
Never to forget who I am
Never to regret what I’ve done
Just to be me with everyone
