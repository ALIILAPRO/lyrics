		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
"Be-Bop-A-Lula," "Baby What I Say"
Here comes Johnny singing, "I Gotta Woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Woohoo

Here comes Johnny, gonna tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here comes Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues

He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

The song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
Then he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Woohoo-hoo

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
"Be-Bop-A-Lula," "Baby What I Say"
Here comes Johnny singing, "I Gotta Woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Hmm, they do the walk of life

Woohoo

Woohoo-hoo

Woohoo-hoo

Woohoo

Woohoo-hoo

(Yeah, you do the walk of life)
