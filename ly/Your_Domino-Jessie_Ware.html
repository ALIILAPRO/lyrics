		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I say?
What can I do?
If it's alright I'd like to fall in front of you
And if there's a fate, tell me it's you
It's back and white I don't know why I'm so confused

Left to my imagination
It's a long way down

You give me your touch, I'm falling like a domino
I find it impossible to take it slow
Blow me a kiss, give me a look so powerful
Do you know I, oh, I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino

I'm counting the roses all in a row
All your apologies wrapped up in fancy bows
But tell me again what I already know
I can't stand it when we're dancing on tiptoes

Left to my imagination
It's a long way down

You give me your touch, I'm falling like a domino
I find it impossible to take it slow
Blow me a kiss, give me a look so powerful
Do you know I, oh, I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino (don't break away)
I wanna be your domino (don't break away)

Away, don't break away
Don't break away
Don't break away
Away, don't break away
Don't break away
I want to be your domino

Give me your touch, I'm falling like a domino (away)
I find it impossible to take it slow (away)
Blow me a kiss, give me a look so powerful (away)
Do you know I, oh, I wanna be your domino 
I wanna be your domino (away)
I wanna be your domino (away)
I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino
I wanna be your domino
