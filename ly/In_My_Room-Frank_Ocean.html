		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress (sleep)
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera flashin', flashin'
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick
That kinda coffin don't need lean, rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say, "Thank you"
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill, it's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket f-

Quit being violent with me (yeah, why, why)
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Make me violent

My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air
