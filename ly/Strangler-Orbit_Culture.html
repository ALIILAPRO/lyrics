		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A resonance in the dark
At the edge of the world
We'll meet once we are free under earth	
One big isle, incoherence of one other
The completion, mind astray

I've lived my life through you and I know your emo-, your emotions
I've lived my life through you and I know you're so lone-, so lonely

Get out, get out, get out, get out, go go

Get out, get out, get out

For the you and me

Get out, get out, get out

For the dying me

Get out, get out, get out

You keep on saving me

Get out, get out, get out

For the day is now here

A text in red in the dark
Now the hedge stops my world
I can't see it, cannot see what you wrote
Now it's locked, a disturbance in my heaven
The deletion, the betrayal

I've lived my life through you and I know your emo-, your emotions

Your emotions now

I've lived my life through you and I know you're so lone-, so lonely

Get out, get out, get out

Get out, get out, get out

Go!

Get out, get out, get out

For the you and me

Get out, get out, get out

For the dying me

Get out, get out, get out

You keep on saving me

Get out, get out, get out

For the day is now here

I am your death

I see you through these screens
Sharing life and so naive
I'll protect you from all these things
Now even from death

Even from death

I'll see you walk through your life
And don't bother shadows, I'll be minding my own

Get out, get out, get out

Get out, get out, get out

Get out, get out, get out

Get out, get out, get out

Get out, get out, get out

For the you and me

Get out, get out, get out

For the dying me

Get out, get out, get out

You keep on saving me

Get out, get out, get out

For the day is now here
