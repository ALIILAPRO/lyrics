		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is no tomorrow
The future is today
Run and tell my father
The man without a name
And he asked me

Do you love somebody
Love somebody tonight
Tonight

Do you love somebody
Love somebody tonight
Tonight

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

You got diamonds on the inside
Shining like the stars
You’re just a stranger in a strange land
A man without a name
And you asked me

Do you love somebody
Love somebody tonight
Tonight

Do you love somebody
Love somebody tonight
Tonight

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Your luck is amazing
Your luck is amazing

And as you sit by yourself
Angel, you’re far from hell
But does it even mean a thing
When I’m under your spell

Oh can't stand losing you
And I can't stand losing you
And I don't know what to do
Cause I can't stand losing—
