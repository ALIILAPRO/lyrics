		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No more wondering why
He ain't calling you back
Lately, you don't get along
You're sick and tired of it all
You can't take it no more

No need to say you feel some kind of way
Just do what you need to do
Do what you need to do
He ain't gonna change
If you take him back, it's gon' be the same
Just do what you need to do
Do what you need to do

Just do it, do it, do it
Do it, yeah, yeah
Do what you need to do
Do what you need to do

And even God don't understand why
You forgave him so many times
He got you back and forth
And 'round and 'round
And up and down again
No, you'll never win
You gotta stop pretending

No need to say you feel some kind of way
Just do what you need to do
Do what you need to do
He ain't gonna change
If you take him back, it's gon' be the same
Just do what you need to do
Do what you need to do

I know it's gonna hurt
And I know it's gonna sting
And you really don't wanna leave
Just get it over with

There's no need to say you feel some kind of way
Just do what you need to do
Do what you need to do
He ain't gonna change
Take him back, it's gon' be the same
Just do what you need to do
Do what you need to do

Just do it, do it, do it
Do it, yeah, yeah
Do what you need to do
Do what you need to do
Just do it, do it, do it
Do it, yeah, yeah
Do what you need to do
Do what you need to do
