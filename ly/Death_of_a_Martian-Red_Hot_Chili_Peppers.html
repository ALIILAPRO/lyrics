		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bear paws and rascal power 
Watching us in your garage 
Big girl you ate the neighbor 
The nova is over 
Wake up and play 
Balleradio 
Make room for Clara's bare feet 
The love of a Martian 

Tick tock and waiting for the meteor 
This clock is opening another door 

Lots of love just keep it comin' 
Making something out of nothin' 
These are the best that I 
I don't know how to say 
Losin' what I love today 
These are the best that I 
Lots of love just keep it comin' 
Making something out of nothin' 
These are the best that I 
I don't know what to say 
Look at what I lost today 
And these are the things that I 

Blood flowers in the kitchen 
Signing off and winding down 
This Martian ends her mission 
The nova is over 
She caught the ball 
By the mission bell 
Chase lizards bark at donkeys 
The love of a martian 

Let's bow our heads 
And let the trumpets blow 
Our girl is gone 
God bless her little soul 

Lots of love just keep it comin' 
Making something out of nothin' 
These are the best that I 
I don't know how to say 
Losin' what I love today 
These are the best that I 
Lots of love just keep it comin' 
Making something out of nothin' 
These are the best that I 
I don't know what to say 
Look at what I lost today 
And these are the things that I 

She's got sword in case 
Though this is not her lord in case 
The one who can't afford to face 
Her image is restored to grace

Disappeared
No trace 
Musky tears 
Suitcase

The down turn brave 
Little burncub bearcareless turnip snare 
Rampages pitch color pages
Down and out but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages
No loft

Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude 
For the sniffing black noses that snort and allude 
To the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink it's
It's for you

Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck 
Muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the new morning milk blanket 
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny who's bouquet set a course for bloom without decay 
Get you broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles, away
