		  Duke, uh, can you turn that beat up a little bit?
Yeah, just like that, perfect
There's two instructions, I need you to follow
When I say red light, I need you to stop
When I say green light, I need you to go

Red light, green light

Now when the strobe light hits, I want you to move like this
Now when the strobe light hits, I want you to move like this
Hit the strobe, hit the strobe
Hit the strobe, hit the strobe
Hit the strobe, hit the strobe

Now, now, now, now, now
We know we've all been through kindergarten, people
So we know what a red light and a green light is
So when I say red light, stop

Red light, green light
Now when the strobe light hits, I want you to move like this
Now when the strobe light hits, I want you to move like this
Hit the strobe, hit the strobe
Hit the strobe, hit the strobe
Hit the strobe, hit the strobe
Green light

Yeah, just like that, prefect
I'm just floating, I'm filling in for the groove
Keep it loopin'
Red light
