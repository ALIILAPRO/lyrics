		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dying sun burns in the night
I watch it glow, and it's so hard for me
Speaking darkness out of spite
Coercion and then caving in, wrap me in my bitterness
Give it up, I'm complacent
Just enough to escape it
Heretics wouldn't faze me
Lucid trust, I don't want it
Palms are rough when you promise
Fire lies when you're honest

It's hard to lose and wonder why

You pressure in increments
Like a slow-moving coup
Memories dissident
When I am holding you

If my sun won't set tonight
I'll look around but it's so hard for me
Like a shadow passing by
Crashing into shapes and then fading with my innocence
Give it up, I'm complacent
Just enough to escape it
Heretics wouldn't faze me
Lucid trust, I don't want it
Palms are rough when you promise
Fire lies when you're honest

It's hard to lose and wonder why
I have been waiting my whole life

For pressure in increments
Like a slow-moving coup
Memories dissident
When I am holding you
