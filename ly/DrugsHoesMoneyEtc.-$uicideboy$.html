		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Counting sheep until I'm sound asleep
I'm lounging deep in a grave I
Found without a sound or peep
I lay in the ground, six feet
Slick as sleet, sneakin' a beat
Let the breath leak out my mouth
Bitch, I want your skull
Fuck what's under your skirt
You broke my heart, and now I'ma
I'ma make you hurt stomp you on the curb
And then I'll throw you in the dirt
Give you back to the Earth
Girl, you were something special, yeah
You were my fucking first you wanna cuddle?
We can cuddle in the back
Of the fucking hearse
(We can cuddle in the back
Of the fucking hearse)

I don't need your sympathy
Make them bitches sing for me
Caught up in reality, smokin' on some fantasy
Put the gun against my
Head, pull the trigger, now I'm dead
Bitches wanna count my bread
Only let them give me head
Sleeping in a tulip bed
Smokin' green and seeing red
Loading up the clip with lead
Trigger finger soft as thread
No jewels and no chains, I like it that way
Don't know what I'm up to until
That Glock in your face
I pop that bitch, and I spray
Got these hoes on delay
All it take is one word
They do whatever I say
(All it take is one word
They do whatever I say)
