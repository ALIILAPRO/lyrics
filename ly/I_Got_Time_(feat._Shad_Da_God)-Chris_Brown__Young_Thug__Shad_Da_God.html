		  (Xayy, why you do it to 'em?)

Say love, I wanna make love, with you
See me, and all of this paper (ooh)
Bad ting, got the million shape up (huh, oh yeah)
Say love, don't be a stranger (oh)
'Cause I got time
I got time today, yeah, I got time (yeah, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time (yeah, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time (oh, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time, for you

Wake up, you don't cover your face up (oh, ooh)
Make-up, you don't need no make-up, you perfect (yeah)
Say love, I wanna link up, me and you
Say less, don't gotta speak on what we gon' do
I love, love when you send me a text sayin', "Boo, come through"
You love, love letters wrote to you (yeah)
What if I only dream about you?
Don't wake up, don't want to, here without you (you)

Say love, I wanna make love, with you (yeah)
See me, and all of this paper (all this paper, yeah, ooh)
Bad ting, got the million shape up (huh, oh yeah)
Say love, don't be a stranger (don't be)
'Cause I got time
I got time today, yeah, I got time (yeah, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time (yeah, yeah, baby, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time (oh, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time, for you

I had to pay her tuition, the way this lil' baby was suckin' my nuts (I had to pay her tuition)
I gotta keep this shit pimpin', man, I'm never fallin' in love with a slut (no)
I gotta tell you it was written the way that a young nigga came up, yeah (I gotta tell you)
Look at the opps behind us (whoa)
Look at this foreign shit around us (woo)
I gotta slime, yeah, yeah
I gotta slime (yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah
Drinkin' on green, yeah, yeah (drinkin' on green)
Feel like it's time, yeah, yeah the bitch ain't mine, yeah, yeah
Her card is declined, yeah, yeah
Triple my cups, triple my doses, I'm triplin' up (triple, cuh)

I got some time to go gamble, I'm hittin' my point in the book (hit 'em up, hit 'em up)
Fuck it we choosin' girl with girl, well, that shit addin' up (that shit addin')
Hop in the trap with a P, we gon' step with an AK inside of this shit
How you know it's less?
I say Lord how the shit blessed (blessed, blessed)
'Cause you bust it one time in that two-tone
I'm tryna stand in the shit like a shoeline
Time of the essence, the AP worth ten dimes
Tell me you choosin', and you tryna get whopped down
You can punch my number like the lunch line
You gon' see how the wood sound (you gon' see how the wood sound)
They gon' be pullin' up (gah)
I might just hop, that stick in the tuck

Say love, I wanna make love, with you
See me, and all of this paper (ooh, ooh)
Bad ting, got the million shape up (huh, oh yeah)
Say love, don't be a stranger (oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause I got time
I got time today, yeah, I got time (yeah, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time (yeah, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time (oh, I got time)
I got time today, yeah, I got time, for you
