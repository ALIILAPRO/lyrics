		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the fortress old
The dwarves on the gates are crying for war
And coming with the night the blood will flow
Before their home
There's no turning back anymore

From the fortress old
They're holding the lines and ready to die
They stack on the walls
The swarm has arrived
At the gates of their home
There's no turning back anymore

Here we are, at the gates of the mountain
Hold the line
We're alone but no one was left behind
We are outnumbered as defenders
Overrun, but there will be no surrender

Here we are, at the gates of the mountain
Hold the line, feel the breath of the horde
That's charging us
We are outnumbered as defenders
Overrun, we will answer to their fire with fire!

Fire! Fire!
Fire and Stone
We came from the forge together
And we'll answer to the call

With Fire! fire!
We'll kill them all
As long as we are together
At the gates we'll not fall

Dark is night, not a star in the sky
Will shine on us, we're alone but no one
Was left behind, with desperation in our eyes
We wait to die in the forthcoming attack

ORCS AHEAD! At the gates of the mountain
Hold the line
Feel the breath of the horde that's charging us
We are outnumbered as defenders
Overrun, we will answer to their fire with fire!

Fire! fire!
Fire and Stone
We came from the forge together
And we'll answer to the call

With Fire! fire!
We'll kill them all
As long as we stay together
We will answer to their fire with fire!

Fire! Fire! Fire!
Fire with fire

Fight the fire with fire
We will answer all, there's no choice anymore
Dwarves of Ekrund reunite together
In front of the gates of the fort
No step back for us
We stand firm like a wall made of stone
Dwarves of Ekrund reunite together
Defending the gates of our home
