So sweet
Mmm

I ain't goin', I ain't, yeah, I got a show tonight
But I ain't been feelin' right, all I see is blurry lines
Baby, would you tell 'em for me, I can hear them yellin' for me
Tell 'em I'm inhalin' funny (yeah, I'm inhalin' funny)
Baby, now you gotta do it, keep drinkin' a lot of fluid
I'll be here to guide you through it (I'll be here to guide you through it)
And maybe I ain't got it in me, maybe it's just time to end it
I'm sorry, may God forgive me (God, forgive me)

So, so, so sad
So, so, so sad
A bunch of memories (memories)
A bunch of memories, baby (baby)
A bunch of memories (memories)
It's just the memories

Memories don't live like people do 
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You

I 'member when I was the girl that everybody doubted
When every label turned me down and then they laughed about it
I 'member goin' home and writin' fifty more raps
Just 'cause I knew you really wanted me to fall back
I 'member one of my first crushes in the fifth grade
He got killed, stabbed in the neck with a switchblade 
I 'member when this girl in the hood thought she caught me slippin'
I got arrested, I assaulted with a deadly weapon
They say they hate Nicki, mad 'cause they ain't Nicki
All of the colors in the world, you couldn't paint Nicki 
I never tried for that, these bitches die for that
I swear that, that's on my life, I'd never lie for that

Memories don't live like people do
They'll always 'member you
They do, they do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Memories don't live like people do
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You (memories)

I told Drake that he don't owe me nothin', never did
I pray that Wayne always remembered that I never slid
Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me and I never dipped
Greatest female rapper that ever lived and that's on my kid (memories)
I could've overdosed, could've been comatose
Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes
I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one
If they ask about me, tell 'em I was one of one

Memories don't live like people do (they don't live like people do)
They'll always 'member you (they'll always remember you)
There's never been another you (there's never been another you)
Tell 'em I was one of one (you)

(So, so, so sad)
Memories don't live like people do
(So, so, so sad)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(So, so, so sad)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(So, so, so sad)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Hey
So
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Memories
