		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been running in place for such a long time 
Stuck in a race in the wrong line 
When it all came down on me. 
And I haven't had faith for such a long time 
Am I outta place or out of my mind 
Should it all fall down on me 

Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to sing so just scream 

You'll never know 
If you don't let it out 
You've had enough 
They'll call your bluff 
You cant back down lost in a crowd 
You've won the right to scream and shout 
They'll talk about you lost your cool 
There is no point who makes the rules 
So lets get to it 
Now you'll prove it 
Break out 

Scream and shout 
Scream and shout 
Scream and shout 
Scream and shout 

Been running in place for such a long time 
Stuck in a race in the wrong line 
When it all came down on me. 
And I haven't had faith for such a long time 
Am I outta place or out of my mind 
Should it all fall down on me 

Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to sing so just scream 

Sound the alarm 
Raise your arms 
Your on your own 
Your not alone 
Big city got you on the ground 
Afraid to fight don't make a sound 
So lets get to it 
Now you'll prove it 
Push back 

Scream and shout 
Scream and shout 
Scream and shout 
Scream and shout 

Been running in place for such a long time 
Stuck in a race in the wrong line 
When it all came down on me. 
And I haven't had faith for such a long time 
Am I outta place or out of my mind 
Should it all fall down on me 

Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to live so just dream 
Its not enough to sing so just scream
