		  Huh, woo
Huh (thanks for the gift, E)
What? (Yeah) what?

If you pull up, yeah, you get embarrassed (uh)
.40 on me, no fashion (uh)
Babygirl like my pants
Say, "Where you from?", she say, "From Paris"
"Bonjour, yeah, come here, I'm tryna get nasty right in the Caddy"
Yeah, say she like my fashion (fashion)
All-black Givenchy matchin' (Givenchy)
Diamonds on me, shit glass (shit glass)
Meet me at the dead end with my folks, you know we settle that gas (uh)
This shit really dope, good crack (what?)
We sippin' that shit and we get out the way (what? Huh?)
We sit on that Thrax (Homxide)
We sippin' that shit and we get out the way (what? Huh?)
We sit on that Thrax (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Balenci' my boots (swag), I'm divin' inside of my bag (swag)
I'm reachin' for nothin' but cash (swag)
She said she like dressin' all black
I tell that girl, "Throw that ass back" (huh)
Ayy, come on and put it on me
Real trapper, I sip on the lean
Got two or three phones, thank me
I'm in the trap with the bag (swaggy)
Slimin' this shit, paper tags (swaggy)
Skrrtin' off, stompin' my gas (swaggy)
I got some shit in my head (snazzy)
Slime a nigga out with no mask (snazzy)
Play with my twin, we gon' blast (yeah)
Get the face shot, nigga, close casket (yeah)
Yeah we be totin' these sticks, we be swaggin' (yeah, yeah, yeah, pull up)

If you pull up, yeah, you get embarrassed (uh)
.40 on me, no fashion (uh)
Babygirl like my pants
Say, "Where you from?", she say, "From Paris"
"Bonjour, yeah, come here, I'm tryna get nasty right in the Caddy"
Yeah, say she like my fashion (fashion)
All-black Givenchy matchin' (Givenchy)
Diamonds on me, shit glass (shit glass)
Meet me at the dead end with my folks, you know we settle that gas (uh)
This shit really dope, good crack (what?)
We sippin' that shit and we get out the way (what? Huh?)
We sit on that Thrax (Homxide)
We sippin' that shit and we get out the way (what? Huh?)
We sit on that Thrax (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Woo
Bonjour, yeah, come here, I'm tryna get nasty right in the Caddy (uh)
Bonjour, yeah, come here, I'm tryna get nasty right in the Caddy
