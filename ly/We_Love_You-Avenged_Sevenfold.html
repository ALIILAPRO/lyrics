		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There you are, you've come so far
Sunny days, the air tastes so sweet
Flowers greet, birds will sing 
You mean everything, you can be anything

More power, more pace
More money, more taste
More sex, more pills
More skin, more shills
Build tall, build higher
Build far, build wider
Build here, build down
Build up, build now

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
We love you
Unto the mud

More wants, more needs
More hits, morphine
More speed, more drive
More self, more time
Build out, build fast
Build strong, build vast
Build too, build more
Build all, build war

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Do unto the mud
Mud

Race to scale the body stack
Lay foot to face atop broken back
A failure here is a failure earned
So do unto the top
Do unto the end
Do unto the mud, do

More power, more pace
More money, more taste
More sex, more pills
More skin, more shills
More wants, more needs
More hits, morphine
More speed, more drive
More self, more time
Build tall, build higher
Build far, build wider
Build here, build down
Build up, build now
Build out, build fast
Build strong, build vast
Build, build, build, build
Build, build, build, build

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you

Look at the way that you choose
You know you'll never lose
And all that you are
It was all you deserved anyway
Sunny days

And we love you
We love you
And we love you
