		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I'll fear no evil because I'm blind to it all
And my mind and my gun, they comfort me
Because I know I'll kill my enemies when they come

Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell on this earth forevermore
Still I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul
But I can't walk on the path of the right because I'm wrong

Well, I came upon a man at the top of a hill
Called himself the savior of the human race
Said he come to save the world from destruction and pain
But I said how can you save the world from itself

'Cause I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I'll fear no evil 'cause I'm blind
Oh, and I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul
But I know when I die my soul is damned
