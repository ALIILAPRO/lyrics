		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel close
Well, maybe I'm not, heaven knows
It's a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
Why are these the things that I'm feeling?
There's so much time
For me to speak up, but I keep quiet
I'll complicate the most of the mantra
The power's out and I can't turn the fan on

So can I call you tonight?
I'm tryna make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real anymore?
'Cause I wouldn't know

Voice so low
Sneakin' around, so it goes
I always try my best to listen
Pickin' up things that I can fidget
Circle speed
Pacin' around, watchin' my feet
Batteries drain, I get the memo
I think that I might have to let you go

So can I call you tonight?
I'm tryna make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real anymore?
'Cause I wouldn't know

(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected)
(Or is no longer in service)
(If you feel you have reached this recording in error)
(Please check the number and try your call again)

Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go and leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go and leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go and leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, go

So can I call you tonight?
I'm tryna make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real anymore?
'Cause I wouldn't know
