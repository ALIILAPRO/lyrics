		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of touch, out of reach, yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in luck, I'm in deep, yeah
Hypnotized, I'm shakin' to my knees

I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fight

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
Oh, can you feel it? (Oh can you feel it?)
Do you believe it? (Do you believe it?)
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feelin' (when you get that feelin')
Better start believin' (better start believin')
'Cause it's a miracle, oh say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

Out of me, into you, yeah
You can hide it's just a one way street
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah
Open wide, that's right, dream me off my feet
Oh, believe in me

I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
Oh, can you feel it? (Oh can you feel it?)
Do you believe it? (Do you believe it?)
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feelin' (when you get that feelin')
Better start believin' (better start believin')
'Cause it's a miracle, oh say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

Come on

I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
Oh, can you feel it? (Oh, can you feel it?)
Do you believe it? (Do you believe it?)
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feelin' (when you get that feelin')
Better start believin' (better start believin')
'Cause it's a miracle, oh say you will, ooh babe (oh can you feel it? Ooh)

(Oh, I get hysterical) hysterical, (hysteria) hysteria
(When you get that feeling) you'd better believe it
(Better start believing) because it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, oh babe, say you will

Get closer to me, get closer, baby (oh)
Baby, closer, (closer) get closer (get closer), closer to me
