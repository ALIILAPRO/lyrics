		  I don't think it will ever end

Hey guys
Do you wanna, do you wanna hear something funny? (Yeah)
So uh, I find myself in these cycles like a figure of eight
And it goes like this
I get sad (he gets sad)
And uh, I hide myself away for a bit which is, which is fine
But then in hiding myself I feel silly (he feels silly)
And um, responsively I start forcing myself to go out and interact with people again
Then in doing so, uh, I feel sad (he feels sad)
Which is not a good feeling when you're supposedly in a 'good phase'
So as almost a self-sabotage, if you will, uh
I get silly (he gets silly)
And then uh, um, I don't know

I'll write something else
