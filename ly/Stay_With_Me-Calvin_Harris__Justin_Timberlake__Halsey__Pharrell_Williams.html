		  Hey, it's a mess out there
They can leave, but we don't care
We'll stay, I'm good right here
I've been waiting for you all year
Come play, make a mess right here
Do whatever, I like it weird
Okay, let 'em disappear
Say whatever you want to hear
Just stay

(Dance)
(Dance)
(Dance)
Looky here

They said, "Please, turn it down"
I said, "Just turn around"
They say it's dark, but what do they know?
So upliftin' how you bounce

And it feel like, damn (damn)
Look at those pants
Damn (damn)
It don't make sense
Damn (damn)
Yeah, I'm convinced
Blam (blam)
It's magic

This one's for tonight and beyond (come here, girl)
We toastin' and we cheers, all your girls are here
Something ain't right if you yawn (yeah, girl)
As crazy as it sound, wanna take you down
So you can feel the vibe 'til the dawn (yeah, girl)
The energy is flowing, it keeps us glowing
So we don't need no light, why's it on? (Yeah, girl)
I'm talking to you, girl, it's a new world

Hey, it's a mess out there
They can leave, but we don't care
We'll stay, I'm good right here
I've been waiting for you all year
Come play, make a mess right here
Do whatever, I like it weird
Okay, let 'em disappear
Say whatever you want to hear
Just stay

All night
Come on and stay with me
Let's take flight
Come on and stay, baby
We could fly away, girl
Come on and stay with me
All night
Come on and stay with me

I still see your body in the dark
It's easy, I just use my hands
And I don't even need to go inside
I know just by the way you dance

(Damn)
Look at those pants
Damn (damn)
It don't make sense
Damn (damn)
Yeah, I'm convinced
Blam (blam)
It's magic

This one's for tonight and beyond (come here, girl)
We toastin' and we cheers, all your girls are here
Something ain't right if you yawn (yeah, girl)
As crazy as it sound, wanna take you down
So you can feel the vibe 'til the dawn (yeah, girl)
The energy is flowing, it keeps us glowing
So we don't need no light, why's it on? (Yeah, girl)
I'm talking to you, girl, it's a new world

Hey, it's a mess out there
They can leave, but we don't care
We'll stay, I'm good right here
I've been waiting for you all year
Come play, make a mess right here
Do whatever, I like it weird
Okay, let 'em disappear
Say whatever you want to hear
Just stay

All night
Come on and stay with me
Let's take flight
Come on and stay, baby
We could fly away, girl
Come on and stay with me
All night
Come on and stay with me
