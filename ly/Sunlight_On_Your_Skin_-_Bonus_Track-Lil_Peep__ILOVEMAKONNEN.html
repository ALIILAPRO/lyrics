		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

Where I wanna be again and again
All on you and me, just skin and skin
Where I wanna be again and again
All on you and me, skin and skin

Why don't we talk the way we should?
If I'm always on your mind?
What do I have to prove to you?
To be your one and only gu-u-uy?

Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around (I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're outta town (you're out of town, feel the same)
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

Where I wanna be again and again
All on you and me, just skin and skin

I know you want me, you know I feel the same way
Don't wanna leave you, by your side together here I'll stay
Let's change the weather, you and I don't ever have to die
We'll be forever babe, our love is the real thing

Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (as it's falling, as it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around ('cause I'm not a-I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (as it's falling)
