		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This life girl I swear
Pull me now, pull away
From this life girl I swear
I thought I wasn't scared
Oh shit I was unaware
Pull me now pull away
Pull away
Oh girl
Pull away
Pull away
When you pull away
You don't take my pain away
Thought I spoke too much
But you still have nothing to say
Thought I was a player but
I'm the one that got played with
Regardless of your signals
I always tried to stay patient
See the moves you pull are savage
Treat me like a bandage
See my pain awakes
And it all started in may
Since the month of june
I've been popping off the juice
You been popping off the pills
Tryna get a bit of thrill
It's not enough baby
It's like 7 in the morning
I see the dawn baby
In your eyes I see you're falling out of love baby
Don't tell me that the past is catching up baby
Fuck that I'd rather just wake up
Pull me now pull away
From this life girl I swear
I thought I wasn't scared
Ah shit I was unaware
Pull me now pull away
Pull away
Oh girl
Pull away
Pull away
Fuck that I rather you just tell me
Tell me you don't want me
Don't know what you heard but I'm loyal
I'd serenade you like a royal
This is how we roll roll roll
Need to get out of my dreams before I fall
See my heart used be so warm
If I can't save myself I might just go go go
I don't think I'll be fine on my own
It's like 7 in the morning
I see the dawn baby
In your eyes I see you're falling out of love baby
Don't tell me that the past is catching up baby
Pull me now pull away
From this life girl I swear
I thought I wasn't scared
Ah shit I was unaware
Pull me now pull away
Pull away
Oh girl
Pull away
Pull away
Pull away
