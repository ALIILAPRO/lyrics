		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are riding for the battle field in force tonight
Fury of the darkest evil cry for war
Far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight
On the road to lands unknown forever more

Through the caverns far below our quest will lead us
Onwards through the ice and snow forever more
Standing fighting full of hate the time has come now
Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war

On wings of glory we will carry on
Far across the forgotten lands toward the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Through the force of power, it will soon reach the hour?
For victory we ride, fury of the storm!

We are/ Here wer are the chosen ones we cannot fail now
Spilling all the blood on the fires below
Smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury
Killing all the mortals down the winding road

Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong
On the path to victory towards the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Trough the forced of power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, fury of the storm!

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Trough the forced of power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, fury of the storm!
For victory we ride, fury of the storm!
