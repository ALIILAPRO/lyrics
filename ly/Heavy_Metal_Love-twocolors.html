		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cigarette boy, left my heart in your ashtray
Sound of your voice, a lullaby made of bad days
You fill that void, but what's the point?
'Cause you moving on to the next stage

My lip in your teeth, roses in my glasses
We break the AC when we make out to Black Sabbath
You fill that void, but what's the point?
Guess we're both a little bit damaged

I want your heavy metal love
I just can't, just can't get enough
So give me, give me all you got
I want your heavy metal love
I want your heavy metal love (love, love, love)
I just can't, just can't get enough (nah, nah, nah)
So give me, give me all you got (break my heart)
I want your heavy metal love (love, love, love)

Oh babe, I see you carry all of that baggage, shit you never unpack
I'm holding on to those habits, won't you hold me instead
So cynical but typical
How I'm trapped in all of that madness

When the smoke clears in the night
Like oh my God, like oh my, oh my God
It's so cold here, tell me why
Like oh my God, like oh my, oh my God

I want your heavy metal love
I just can't, just can't get enough
So give me, give me all you got
I want your heavy metal love
I want your heavy metal love (love, love, love)
I just can't, just can't get enough (nah, nah, nah)
So give me, give me all you got (break my heart)
I want your heavy metal love (love, love, love)
