		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need somebody
To pull me out of this grave I've filled
With hate and doubt
I need saved right now
Can you hear me calling out
Can you hear me

I have been a slave for years
A slave to my own doubt
There's life to live
But I'm dying now
How am to show you love
When I can't love myself
I'm crying out
But I can't find help
Can you help me

Don't patronize
The person I've become
It's a hellish lie
I'm ashamed of all I've done
Now I'm terrified
Of the price that is to pay
But I know it's mine
My bed's already made

I need somebody
To pull me out of this grave I've filled
With hate and doubt
I need saved right now
Can you hear me calling out
Can you hear me
I need somebody
To build me back up
Hold me steady
We're in for the long run
And when you're ready
We'll both jump
Yeah we'll both jump

I know that it's hopeless
But hoped they'd give notice
To my breaking heart
They look so close
But feel so far
I'll spend my days locked away
In this prison I've built for myself
I hold they keys
Still I can't break free

Don't patronize
The person I've become
It's a hellish lie
I'm ashamed of all I've done
Now I'm terrified
Of the price that is to pay
But I know it's mine
My bed's already made

I need somebody
To pull me out of this grave I've filled
With hate and doubt
I need saved right now
Can you hear me calling out
Can you hear me
I need somebody
To build me back up
Hold me steady
We're in for the long run
And when you're ready
We'll both jump
Yeah we'll both jump

I need somebody
To pull me out of this grave I've filled
With hate and doubt
I need saved right now
Can you hear me calling out
Can you hear me
