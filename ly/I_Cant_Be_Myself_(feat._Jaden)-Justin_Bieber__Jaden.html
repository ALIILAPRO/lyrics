		  (Be myself with you)
(Be myself with you)

I can't be myself when you're not there, oh-whoa-oh
La-la-la-la-la-la, I feel amazing
How are you? How are you?
La-la-la-la-la-la, ten thousand faces
Still your eyes are the view

What can I do?
When the chances are a billion stars 
They can't compare, to you
Nowhere to move
'Cause it's new to me, consuming me
I might be scared of ya, oh yeah

I could travel any place
But without you it's just running around
They could open Heaven's gates
But without I'm just stuck in the clouds

I can't be myself when you're not there
The sweetest dreams turn to nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there, oh-whoa-oh
La-la-la-la-la-la, I'm talking backwards
High on you, high on you
La-la-la-la-la-la, don't know what's after
But I know it's with you

What can I do?
When the chances are a billion stars 
They can't compare, to you
Nowhere to move
'Cause it's new to me, consuming me
I might be scared of ya, oh yeah

I could travel any place
But without you it's just running around
(Girl, I'm just running around)
They could open Heaven's gates
But without I'm just stuck in the clouds

I can't be myself when you're not there (oh)
The sweetest dreams turn to nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there (be myself) oh-whoa-oh
La-la-la-la-la-la, I feel amazing
How are you? How are you?

I can't be myself when you're not there (no, I can't)
The sweetest dreams turn to nightmares (oh-whoa-oh)
I can't be myself when you're not there, oh-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Be myself with you) whoa-oh-oh
(Be myself with you)
When you're not in my arms

I can't be myself when you're not there
I need you close, whoa-oh-oh
I can't be myself when you're not there
