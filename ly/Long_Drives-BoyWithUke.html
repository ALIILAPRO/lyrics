		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I can't do these long drives sitting in the back seat
Thinking 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar 

We just FaceTime, is this a sign?
I'm falling out of your life
I try my hardest not to think about what I just realized
You said I was your light
I think that's just a white lie
Feeling so rotten inside
Thought I died
I kinda want to go back
I'm missing the pain of a heartbreak
And life just don't hit the same
I'm having migraines
My friends all over the place with their life straight
I guess I'm afraid of growing out of my place

'Cause I can't do these long drives sitting in the back seat
Thinking 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar

And all I want is to take you by the sea
I'll show you sights from above and take you to my dismal dreams
I'll see that falling stars will set your world on fire, baby
These flames were meant for you and me
You're make believe
Why can't you see
I'll make these roses all turn green
The seven seas and all the ocean tides will fall into my dreams
I'm drowning, oh
I wish you weren't so far from me
I wish you weren't so far from me

'Cause I can't do these long drives sitting in the back seat
Thinking 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar

Yeah, I can't do these long drives sitting in the back seat
Thinking 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar

Hey I've been thinking 'bout you all damn day
And the sun is shining on your face
I think I fell for you
I hate the fact that this is the truth
But okay, I know I might come off as strange
Just swear I'm not, I'm just in pain
Please don't drive away from me
