		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I can't pretend
Like you didn't bring my tempo up again
(Tempo up again)
My head's in a spin
You send my body to a place it's never been

Baby, won't you let me
Keep you up all night, let the morning come closer
You send me so high now, the ceiling can't hold us
Listen to my heart, let the rhythm control ya
I'll be there when you need my love
Just follow the beat of my drum (drum, drum, drum, drum, drum)

It goes pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Just follow the beat of my drum

Ooh, I can't pretend
Like I didn't let your love go to my head, ah, oh
Ooh, I'm in a spin
You send my body to a place it's never been, oh

Whoa, oh no, thinkin' about you, makin' my body behave so
Crazy, ooh, you make me wanna sway slow
You push up on me, baby, you got me for days, oh, you do

Baby, won't you let me
Keep you up all night, let the morning come closer
You send me so high now, the ceiling can't hold us
Listen to my heart, let the rhythm control ya
I'll be there when you need my love
Just follow the beat of my drum (drum, drum, drum, drum, drum)

It goes pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum

Whoa, oh no, thinkin' about you, makin' my body behave so
Crazy, ooh, you make me wanna sway slow
You push up on me, baby, you got me for days, oh, you do

Just follow the beat of my drum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Pum-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum

It goes

Just follow the beat of my drum
