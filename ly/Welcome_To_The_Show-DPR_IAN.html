		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just stay
For the show
No candlelights
To take you home
You tried bringing out the sunny times
You're not really good at telling lies
So sick of keeping it all in

I just want you to
Close all the doors
Just leave me alone
I tried to hide it
I'm scared of what's next
I still don't know where to go
But welcome to the show

So, turn down the lights
They'll see you now
Go, your head is high
So don't look so down

I know you feel the same
I tell myself to let go of the pain
So sick of keeping it all in

I just want you to
Close all the doors
Just leave me alone
I tried to hide it
I'm scared of what's next
I still don't know where to go
You're welcome to the show

You're welcome to the show
So can you stay a little longer
'Cause I don't know who I want to be
So can you stay a little longer
Just until I know 
You see me standing here
Sometimes

I just want you to
Close all the doors
Just leave me alone
I tried to hide it
I'm scared of what's next
I still don't know where to go

So welcome to the show
So welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
I still don't know where to go
