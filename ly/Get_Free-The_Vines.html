		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
Ride into the sun

She never loved me
She never loved me
She never loved me
Why should anyone?

Come here, come here, come here
I'll take your photo for you
Come here, come here, come here
Drive you around the corner
Come here, come here, come here
You know you really oughta
Come here, come here, come here
Move outta California

Get (get)
Me (me)
Far (far)
When I've a lot to lose

Save (save)
Me (me)
From (from)
Here (here)

Come here, come here, come here
Come here, come here, come here
Come here, come here, come here
Come here, come here, come here

When it's breeding time
Look into your mind away

I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
Ride into the sun

She never loved me
She never loved me
She never loved me
Why should anyone?

Come here, come here, come here
I'll take your photo for you
Come here, come here, come here
Drive you around the corner
Come here, come here, come here
You know you really oughta
Come here, come here, come here
Move outta California
