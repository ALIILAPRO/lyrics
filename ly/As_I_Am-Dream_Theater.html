		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't
Tell me what's in
Tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win this
Fight.
Isn't your life
It isn't your right 
To take the only thing that's
Mine.
Proven over time
It's over your head
Don't try to read between
The Lines
Are clearly defined
Never lose sight of something
You believe in.

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feelin' like the underdog.
Watchin' through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog.

I've been trying 
To justify you.
In the end I will
Just defy you.

To those who understand,
I extend my hand.
To the doubtful I demand
Take me as I am.
Not under your command,
I know where I stand.
I won't change to fit your plan.
Take me as I am.

As I am.

Still 
Running uphill.
Swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so
Fucked.
Feels like I'm stuck,
Lost in a sea of mediocrity.
Slow down,
You're thinking too much,
Where is your soul
You cannot touch the way
I play,
Or tell me what to say.
You're in the way
Of all that I believe in.

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feelin' like the underdog.
Watchin' through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog.

I've been wasting my breath 
On you.
Open mind will descend
Upon You.

To those who understand,
I extend my hand.
To the doubtful I demand
Take me as I am.
Not under your command,
I know where I stand.
I won't change to fit your plan.
Take me as I am.

To those who understand,
I extend my hand.
To the doubtful I demand
Take me as I am.
Not under your command,
I know where I stand.
I won't change to fit your plan.
Take me as I am.

As I am.

Yeah!

As I am.
