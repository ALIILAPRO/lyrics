		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darker than the East river
Larger than the Empire State
Where the beasts to guard the barbed wire gate
Is on the job not my fate
Tired of the wait till the Villain bring deliverance from the dire straits
Fire at a higher rate
Why'd they make the liars, fliers scatter, buy a plate
Isolate the wires
Try the straight pliers if not the vice grips
A real price saver way to acquire nice whips
What a steal for real on wheels of steel
Stunner a funner summer number one meal deal bummer
A bizarre phenomenon is your armor on
Take your cash, Karma, or break your fast, Ramadan
Transaction drama, awww come on barney
Clack clack pardon me whack rap Kon Karne
He came to feed the children's like Sally Struthers
After that he's going back to Cali where's da

Love is

Wilder than the Nile
Hold power like the great pyramids of Giza
And stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza
Raw with the pen and on the mic off the heeza
Get shot off that wide eyed talk
If he had a pot he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street person
Lookin' for the perfect beat coercion into heat burstin'
They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that comes with a free hot plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3-D ring sittin' stationary like B.B. King
Can see how it really sting
It ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motocross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus me and Sub is like the brown Smothers Brothers

Vaster than the seven seas
Bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro
If they don't know fill them in tomorrow on the horror show
A mental note: return Bob's record
Swear to god before he gets a job he robs Eckerd
Blessed with a hot flow
Tested, it got dough
Invested in stress the best to finesse an opto
As I reminisce never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the Henny straight couldn't afford to cop the cherry coke
Or should I say broke with wealth?
To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke they self
Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it
Dog gone it
Do the statistics
How he bust lyrics was too futuristic for ballistics
And far too eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc the Hip Hop Hendrix
