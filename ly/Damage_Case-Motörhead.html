		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey babe, don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
I'm on the run from some institution
All I want's a little consolation
And I can tell by your face
I'm a total disgrace
Let me inside your place
Move over for a damage case

Hey babe, wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call the cop
I ain't looking to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you
And I can tell by your state
I'm all over the place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

Go!

Hey babe, don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, I'm gone today
I don't care what you think your game is
I don't care even what your name is
And I can tell by your face
You're all over this place
Let me inside your face
Move over for a damage case
