		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not good at goodbyes
I miss the sunshine in your eyes
Who said cowboys don't cry?
Come on, baby, let's take one last ride

We're riding 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're riding 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're riding 'round this carousel
Getting dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end

It's too much, I can't take anymore
Stuck feeling like we've been here before
But now the sun stopped shining here in the Wild West
My heart stopped beating, and it sunk into my chest

We're riding 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're riding 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're riding 'round this carousel
Getting dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end

Just an outlaw who only had one friend
I wonder if I'll ever see her face again
Dark clouds hanging over, they follow where I've been
My cowboy tears are still blowing in the wind

We're riding 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're riding 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're riding 'round this carousel
Getting dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end

I'm not good at goodbyes
I miss the sunshine in your eyes
Who said cowboys don't cry?
Come on, baby, let's take one last ride

We're riding 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're riding 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're riding 'round this carousel
Getting dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end
