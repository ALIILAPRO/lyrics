		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me the same 
That's why the blocks say 
And You can't fuck with the gang 
Brodie there's no way 
You know I feel all this pain 
It's what my heart say 
And I can't fuck with that bitch 
She let my heart break 
I'm just tryna count this paper 
I don't need no bitch 
Shout out Nino only Brodie got my back 
No itch 
I don't have no friends cuz I don't do that fake love 
I really needed someone but I had to face up 
I swear, when I make it I'm gonna cop that hellcat 
Don't hit my phone you not my bro please stay the hell back 
And all that shit I smoke so loud I know you smelt that 
And I got a problem with flexing 
Man I can't help that 

RIP lil bro 
I'm still doing what you told me 
I still miss lil bro 
Cuz my mother fucking soul bleed 
Ice all on my neck 
You'd think that shit done froze me 
She said she fucking love me 
But I got no love for hoes g 

Man I got no love 
So I take drugs 
But It don't feel the same no more 

And if you play with the gang 
Lil bro gone spray 
And you won't be around no more 

No more 
No more 
You won't be around no more 
No more
No more

I be in the black Benz
With my bitch
Man pull up in that Maybach
I get rich (Ay)
Baby know I got it now she wanna have my kids
Give a fuck about tomorrow, man im tryna get lit
I cant even oversee
All my diamonds over sea
And your bitch she stay a freak
She give up that shit for free
They ain't even notice me (Yeah) 
Stay ay
And I tell em they can stay
Crash the rari man I pull up in the range
Everyday I'm still getting paid
Everyday I still pull up waved
Quit talk when I pull up with the gauge
You don't want no smoke you a lame 
You a lame

Man I got no love 
So I take drugs 
But It don't feel the same no more 

And if you play with the gang 
Lil bro gone spray 
And you won't be around no more 

No more 
No more 
You won't be around no more 
No more
No more
