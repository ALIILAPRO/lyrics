		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna dive
Deep underneath your depths
But there's only so far that I get
Past the surfaces
Can't get past your surfaces

I wanna drive
Through the forest inside of your head
But there's only so far that I get
Been tryna make you more
More than just a pretty boy

Pretty boy
Pretty boy
More than just a pretty boy
Pretty boy

New words
Tell me something that I've never heard
And this time would be the first
That you'll be more
More than just a pretty boy

Pretty boy
Pretty boy
More than just a pretty boy
(Pretty boy)

Do you remember when you said
If I saw your trouble, I'd be scared?
Well, you're melting my heart
'Cause you won't show me your cards yet
Is that why
You build Potemkin villages to hide?
Oh, do you think I can't handle
What's going on inside?
(Pretty boy)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Pretty boy (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Pretty boy (ooh, ooh)
More than just a pretty boy (ooh, ooh)
Pretty boy
