		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Healed (healed), or are you still just reeling?
Are you fine (fine)? Have you found
A way to escape?
Are you here (here), just because I need you?
Can we hole up, a big freeze is heading our way?

We are on a hiding to nowhere
We still hope, but our dreams are not the same
And I, I lost before I started
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay

Fight, or will you show me mercy?
We've expelled, the goodness from our hearts
Are you here, just to prove you're winning?
Can we hole up, and ride out this electrical storm?

We destroyed something beautiful
We have faith, but our truths
Are not the same
Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
Stop the loneliest force becoming
King of the universe

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't you let the sun in your heat decay

Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
I won't let the sun in your heart decay
