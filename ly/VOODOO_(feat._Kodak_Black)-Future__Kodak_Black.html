		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I danced with the Devil so long, she pullin' me closer
Been sleepin' with demons, how they get there?
She invited him, over and he came in girl form
So pretty I fell for it, it felt like I known her
I pray to the angels, but the Devil is stronger
Wonderin' why I'm in Hell, still
Nobody's nice, nobody cares here
I tried to break free, she wouldn't let me
She say don't waste my time, thinkin' I'm goin' to Heaven
'Cause all my blessings she tellin' me, she the one who sent them
(808 Mafia)
(Ayy Southside, where you get all that drip?)

Made it out of they range, got to feel my rage, drug traffickin' made me
Ambition saved me, hold up on the pavement
Ain't goin' outside like Jose Canseco, I up my status
Had to 'crease me hunger to get me pesos
I was right with the Yayo, droppin' off a hundred elbows
With a fine bitch in stilettos, got stars in it, it's a shuttle
Gettin' nauseous, all the decimals, she give me sloppy on another level
Doin' CrossFit, I'm gettin' healthy, bitches moshpittin' at the devil
You live marvelous, you get a W
Keep a short stick and a duffle (short stick and a duffle)
Tryna flex, I show muscles, hi-definition, totin' cutters
I was presidential, more bullets, feel played 'bout it, get to trippin'
I'm with the Cartel every time I re-up
On the plane by the runway, that's how they greet us
Gettin' it grande from Sunday to Sunday
I knew I'd be the plug one day
This money like a drug, dope so pretty can't touch it without the gloves
Money machine clickin' give me a rush

I danced with the Devil so long, she pullin' me closer
Been sleepin' with demons, how they get there?
She invited him, over and he came in girl form
So pretty I fell for it, it felt like I known her
I pray to the angels, but the Devil is stronger
Wonderin' why I'm in Hell, still
Nobody's nice, nobody cares here
I tried to break free, she wouldn't let me
She say don't waste my time, thinkin' I'm goin' to Heaven
'Cause all my blessings she tellin' me, she the one who sent them

(Angel on my left, Devil on my right)
(It's hard for me to go, I've been fightin' for my life)
(Been put through a test, tryna do what's right)
(It's get harder and harder for me to find some peace at night)

I danced with the Devil so long (so long), she pullin' me closer (closer)
Been sleepin' with demons, how they get there?
She invited him over and he came in girl form
So pretty I fell for (fell for), it felt like I known her (known her)
I pray to the angels (angels), but the Devil is stronger
Wonderin' why I'm in Hell, still (Hell, still)
Nobody's nice, nobody cares here (cares here)
I tried to break free, she wouldn't let me
She say that I'm wastin' my time, thinkin' I'm goin' to Heaven
'Cause all my blessingsshe tellin' me, she the one who sent them (sinnin')
