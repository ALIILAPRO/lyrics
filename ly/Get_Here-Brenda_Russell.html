		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can reach me by railway,
You can reach me by trailway.
You can reach me on an airplane,
You can reach me with your mind.

You can reach me by caravan,
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here,
Just, get here if you can

You can reach me by sail boat,
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope.
Take a sled and slide down the slope,
Into these arms of mine.

You can jump on a speedy colt,
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here,
Just, get here if you can.

There are hills and mountains between us,
Always something to get over.
If I had my way, surely you would be closer.
I need you closer.

You can windsurf into my life,
Take me up on a carpet ride.
You can make it in a big balloon,
But you better make it soon.

You can reach me by caravan,
Cross the desert like an Arab man.
I don't care how you get here,
Just, get here if you can

I don't care, I don't care,
I want you to get here.
I need you right here, right now
I need you closer.

I can't wait another day,
I need you right here, right now.
Right here, right now

I need, I need
I want you to get here
I need you to get here
