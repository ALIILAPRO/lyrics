		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big body GLE-ski I went bought it (oh, na-na-na)
My diamonds real pissy, they potty (hey, hey)
I'm finna pull up in Benz, no Audi (oh, no-no-no)
No-no-no, we don't know nobody
Twenty bad bitches, they all in the lobby
Gettin' rich just like this, it's a hobby (ayy)
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body (ayy)
Big body, big body (hey, hey)
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body (ayy)
Big body, big body, big body, big body
If everybody could get lit just like this
Then they would and they wouldn't even tell none about it 

Say it again for the kids that just doubted
Rock that YSL, they love when I cop it
I was cleanin' up, yeah, I call that scrubbin'
I made her cut ties with her buddy
Go 'head chop 'em up like Paul Bunyan
Let it go, let it bang

I'm as high as a crane
I be chillin' with the demons (off the Perc)
I can't walk at all, paraplegic
Leanin' sideways off the drank, got me geekin'
They don't be high, don't be knowin' the minute (uh)
666, 777, drink it
I took a break from the Percs, it ain't lonesome (uh)
Tell this bitch I need the bread, need to loan some
I ain't never pull a goddamn loan out
The bitch turn me on and I'm pullin' my bone out
Walk inside that bitch, we don't do no scuffle
Makin' money off the Perc, I'ma shuffle (shuffle)
Dig it up then bury it back like a shovel
I don't know what's goin' on, in the bubble (ah)
I don't know what's goin' on in the world
Fucking hate the cops, we always in trouble (woo)
I don't pay attention to shit but my gang and my money
And I wanna know about it
I be geeked up, take a Tes' in the Tesla
I be geeked up, take a crank in the morning
You ain't geekin' boy, your life is a lie
How you know all this shit? You a spy
Heard you snitchin', you a bug, you a fly
I just woke up, got the Tonka and go ride
I been geekin' up a lot, I won't lie
I been startin' to think I'm losin' my mind
But the devil told me everything fine
I just woke up, fucked that bitch in her spine
I don't be doin' shit on the online
I just be bootin' up outta my mind
Copped a double, then I tripled it down
Bitch, I'ma nine, don't wait in no line

Hold up, triple seven
Park that bitch back like I'm double havin'
Hold up, triple deuces
Pour this bitch up, we got all the juices (drunk)
Hold up, speed to Heaven
Geeked up out my mind, might need a medic

Big body GLE-ski I went bought it (oh, na-na-na)
My diamonds real pissy, they potty (hey, hey)
I'm finna pull up in Benz, no Audi (oh, no-no-no)
No-no-no, we don't know nobody
Twenty bad bitches, they all in the lobby
Gettin' rich just like this, it's a hobby (ayy)
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body (ayy)
Big body, big body (hey, hey)
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body (ayy)
Big body, big body, big body, big body
If everybody could get lit just like this
Then they would and they wouldn't even tell none about it 

Say it again for the kids that just doubted
Rock that YSL, they love when I cop it
I was cleanin' up, yeah, I call that scrubbin'
I made her cut ties with her buddy
Go 'head chop 'em up like Paul Bunyan
Let it go, let it bang
