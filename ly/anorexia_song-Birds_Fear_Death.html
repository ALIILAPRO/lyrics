		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Melt my heart
And burn my ribs
Set fire to my empty skin
Trace the mirror on my wall
Slit my throat and set me free
If the soul compels me to bleed
What compels my body not to rot

The angel that watches over me gave me every chance
I can't leave the bathroom
I can wash the blood off of my hands
Is this what you expected when you held me in your arms
For me to be filled with ibuprofen and all covered in scars
It only scared me when all i had left was taste
Watching myself from the mirror but I can't see my face
I get you back and your blood drips down my leg
But under it all is just a scared little boy who wants to see his brother again
I cum in your mouth and bleed out on the floor
I die apathetic another nameless whore
