		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just got me a Rihanna
She love a nigga persona
So used to whippin' Madonna
Cookin' up like Benihana
I give a check to my mama
Then I go flex in designer
And I just got me a Rihanna
I just got me a Rihanna
What you got
Hunnid bands for them bitches
Hunnid rounds for them niggas
Riding foreign like a rental
Sky ain't never been a limit
If she ain't down when I come around
Young nigga ain't fuckin' with her
And I just got me a Rihanna
So used to whippin' Madonna

Ohh
So many watches they think I'm a jeweler
But I'm just obsessed with the time (obsessed)
When I go so hard like everyday like I'm broke
But I'm just in love with the grind (I am)
I started out with a eight (eight)
I ended up with a nine
I seen my first hundred thousand
In fives tens and twenties
It fucked up my mind (whoa)
I had to get me some money (money)
All of my niggas a hunnid (hunnid)
This a sky dweller
It don't have no stones
And this shit a half of a hunnid
I don't got goons I got creatures (creatures)
Niggas so hungry they eat cha (eat cha)
If the bitch wanna hear that Yo Gotti
Dope boy shit all in her speakers
And I want a brand new Bugatti ('gatti)
So I can pull up on Madonna (skkrrr)
And I got that Taylor Swift
And that Kylie Jenner and that Hannah Montana
And I got that boy
They call it dog food
I'm tryna eat I want all food
And I got that Katy Perry and Madonna
Bitch better have my money like Rihanna

I just got me a Rihanna
She love a nigga persona
So used to whippin' Madonna
Cookin' up like Benihana
I give a check to my mama
Then I go flex in designer
And I just got me a Rihanna
I just got me a Rihanna
What you got
Hunnid bands for them bitches
Hunnid rounds for them niggas
Riding foreign like a rental
Sky ain't never been a limit
If she ain't down when I come around
Young nigga ain't fuckin' with her
And I just got me a Rihanna
So used to whippin' Madonna

Keep the keys like Alicia (keys)
Loud pack no reefer (reefer)
Shots fired I decease ya (bang bang)
Low number I'll meet ya (Let's get it)
Get me a Rihanna
But I'm a piranha (piranha)
I eat when I wanna (I wanna)
Got rich on the corner (rich)
I got that Al Green
I got Miley Cyrus
Got bricks of Madonna (bricks)
Twenty two for that thirty six
'Cause the two for my runners
Balenciagas I done em (whoo)
A mansion for mama
I ain't got shit for a bitch
We only saving the money
We get the tens, the twenties, the fifties
We only saving the hunnids
Know what we do with the ones and fives
Yeah we hit Magic on Monday (floor)
I'm tryna knock up Rihanna
I'm tryna take her to mama (mama)
I'm tryna run up a check (I am)
I'm tryna fuck up the summer

I just got me a Rihanna
She love a nigga persona
So used to whippin' Madonna
Cookin' up like Benihana
I give a check to my mama
Then I go flex in designer
And I just got me a Rihanna
I just got me a Rihanna
What You Got
Hunnid bands for them bitches
Hunnid rounds for them niggas
Riding foreign like a rental
Sky ain't never been a limit
If she ain't down when I come around
Young nigga ain't fuckin' with her
And I just got me a Rihanna
So used to whippin' Madonna

I just got me a Rihanna
She like a nigga persona
I fuck with her forever
She was there when I had nothing
She kept it loyal forever
She can be spoiled forever
We back to back in the ghost
She keep a real nigga focused
I just got me a Rihanna
She like a nigga persona
She like the fact that I'm thuggin'
And never turn down for nothing
She know I get to the money
She never trip off the money
She my lil' soldier forever
She kept it loyal forever
I just got me a Rihanna
