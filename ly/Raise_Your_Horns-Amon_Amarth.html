		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Victory we fought hard and prevailed
Brutally we were fighting

Stormy seas rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield lit by lightning

Eagerly we filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily ravens cawing

Home shore calls
We return on bloody seas
Twilight falls
Darkness crawling

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends

No regrets we went out to war and strife
To protect king and country

Victory honor those who gave their life
Willingly we will not grieve

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will drink tonight

(Oh oh oh)
Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink tonight 

Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet in Valhalla again
