		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you would only let me,
I could show you how to love
Take our time, let all it go
If you'd would only let me
I could show you how to cry
In your darkest hour
I would lead you through the fire

But you won't let me
You won't let me
I don't want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
And I'd do anything
Yes, I'd do anything
If you'd only let me

With your hand in mine
I would show you how to laugh
Nothing heavy, nothing serious
Just forget about all that
You've been stepping back
I want to be your friend
You tear down the walls that surround you
And build you back up again

But you won't let me
No, you won't let me
I don't want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
And I'd do anything
Yes, I'd do anything

So tonight, stay with me
I know I could change your mind

But you won't let me
You won't let me
No, I don't want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
But you won't let me
No, you won't let me

I don't want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
But you won't let me
No you won't let me
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you

But you won't let me
No, you won't let me
You won't let me
