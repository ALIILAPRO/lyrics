		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living your live in endless frustration
Everyday you get nervous and teased
You think about your youth with sex and pleasure
Now the times have changed the blood you bleed

[Chorus] 
Living a destructed
it before you die
Take what you don't need to betray
Your end is nearer than you think you know
You can't survive
Take their lives, don't wait another day
Take their lives

Normal man of the civilization
Is that what you wanted to be?
You know the deadly force in your veins
And tonight you set the power free

[Chorus]

Take them into the cellar, be sure that they can't scream
They have taken all the best years of your life
You don't feed no mercy as you locked them on the chains
You don't care about your children's cries
Now there ain't no turning back the axe shines in your hand
You cut the first limb with laughin' eyes
Your crimes complete and you will pay, they'll hunt you to the ground
your days are counted now you have to run

[Chorus]
