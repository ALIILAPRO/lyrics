		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't form thoughts, trust politicians
Forfeit soul, pursue religion
Lose free will to gain protection
Sink the ship with good intention
See our minds become conditioned
As we swear by these traditions
Lose our hearts and breed division
Oh my God why can't we wake up wake up

They're selling Heaven tonight oh!
Sign on the dotted line oh!
They've got your Christ on copyright

To think you know who goes to Heaven
Is just one big misconception
Like God hates fags and communism
Create fear to feed the system feed the system

Oh!
They're selling Heaven tonight oh!
Sign on the dotted line oh!
They've got your Christ on copyright

Oh!
They're selling Heaven tonight oh!
Sign on the dotted line oh!
They've got your Christ on copyright

We are not machines
If they scream loud
They might muscle the crowd
But we won't bow down
No, we don't bow down

Oh!
They're selling Heaven tonight
But it's not alright

Oh!
They're selling Heaven tonight oh!
Sign on the dotted line oh!
They got your Christ on copyright

Selling Heaven tonight
Sign on the dotted line
It's not alright, it's not alright
it's copyright
