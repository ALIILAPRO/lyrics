		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes, tell a lie
Won't look back when I leave you behind
If you thought I'd stay
You must be losing your mind

Leaves fall down on me
As the mist settles just before dawn
Autumn kills Summer every fall
It's either all in or nothing at all

What did your love cost me
In your deceit, I almost lost me
As the wind on the moor whispers still
If the kisses don't kill you
The side effects will

Around you, roses turn blue
Honey's sour since you burned the truth
All the lies you told
You left once you gathered the gold

We left the orchard behind
A primrose path that I barely survived
'Cause Autumn kills Summer every fall
It's either all in or nothing at all

What did your love cost me
In your deceit, I almost lost me
As the wind on the moor whispers still
If the kisses don't kill you
The side effects will

The side effects will

What did your love cost me
In your deceit, I almost lost me
As the wind on the moor whispers still
If the kisses don't kill you
The side effects will

The side effects will

If the kisses don't kill you
The side effects will
