		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got roses on your dress
Pretty waves in your hair
I got jet-lag in my eyes
You were born where they sleep in my daytime

What's going on in your head?
'Cause we all, just wanna be special
What's going on in your head?
'Cause we all, just wanna be special

I was rock and you were funk
Lose yourself and got too drunk
I was slaving life away
You said, "let's get out of here someday"

What's going on in your head?
'Cause we all, just wanna be special
What's going on in your head?
'Cause we all, just wanna be special

What's going, what's going on
In your head... 'cause we all
Just wanna be special
