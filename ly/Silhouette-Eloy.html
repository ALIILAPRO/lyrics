		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She grew like the blossming oak tree
A fountain of magic spells
Her mind was of sunshowered beauty
We once knew so well
Her roots understanding of earth seeking silently
Branches of arching embrace and serenety
Flowers revealing the secret of her own mystery
Her fruit offering endless desire for true love and harmony
We will always be together
Let the winds of heaven dance between us now
Your restless tides return forever
Every flower reflects your innocent brow
As the silence of the seasons
Will unfold our lifetime memory
Our beclouded search for reasons
Echoes call afar and so persistantly
Your feeling song we thought we knew
Still we'll carry on in unison with you
We will always be together
Let the winds of heaven dance between us now
Your restless tides return forever
Every flower reflects your innocent brow
As the silence of the seasons
Will unfold our lifetime memory
Our beclouded search for reasons
Echoes call afar and so persistantly
Your feeling song we thought we knew
Still we'll carry on in unison with you
Roots understanding seeking silently
Branches searching in serenety
Flowers revealing their own mystery
Her fruit offering harmony
Roots understanding seeking silently
Branches searching in serenety
Flowers revealing their own mystery
Her fruit offering harmony
