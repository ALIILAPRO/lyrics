		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do

Dance for me

To the groove

Let’s go

It goes one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
It goes one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
One, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
It goes one, two, one, one, two, one, two 
You want to groove, I'mma show you how to move

It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
It goes one by one, even two by two
Everybody on the floor, let me show you how we do
Let's go, dip it low, then you bring it up slow
Wind it up one time, wind it back once more

Dance for me

To the groove

Let’s go

It goes one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
It goes one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
One, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
It goes one, two, one, one, two, one, two 
It goes one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
It goes one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
You want to groove, I'mma show you how to move
