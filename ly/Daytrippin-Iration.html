		  Daytrippin down in Mexico 

Met a man at Las Rocas
Livin' down here since '68
One day they found him broke down on a desert highway 
Lost the race but he found his way 

Bought some gas from Ignacio 
Spent all day at K38
Said he lost his, senorita
And he asked me, Have you seen her?
And pointed down to the shore


There's a place that I wanna go 
Waves are fast but the time moves slow 
Mezcal and a cloud of smoke 
Daytrippin down in Mexico   


Been to the top of La Mesa
Swam to the depths of Del Mar 
Always on the run but didn't have to go too far
Ended up in the Valle 
She got me under her spell
They say I'm crazy 
they don't know the story 
Whoa oh oh oh
Forget about everything you know
Take a hit and leave it all behind
