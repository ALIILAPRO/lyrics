		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby you sucha vibe
Baby you my type
I could end up with your baby if you stay the night
Don't start to act shy
Show me the other side
Yea those niggas cool
But you sucha vibe
Baby you sucha vibe
Baby you my type
You could really fuck my head up if you so decide
Don't start to act shy
Show me the other side
Yea those niggas cool
But you sucha vibe
Said I wouldn't get attached to you
I said I could always double back to you
I just want this shit to last with you
Oh no no no no
Here my feelings go
Wish they didn't show
But look how you talk to me
It's in your confidence
It's in the walk for me
It's in the way you move
The way you think
The things you do
The energy the way you're you
It's just every things so attractive
And I gotta have it baby
Baby you sucha vibe
Baby you my type
I could end up with your baby if you stay the night
Don't start to act shy
Show me the other side
Yea those niggas cool
But you sucha vibe
Baby you sucha vibe
Baby you my type
You could really fuck my head up if you so decide
Don't start to act shy
Show me the other side
Yea those niggas cool
But you sucha vibe
I ain't tryna fall off track
But I ain't tryna take a pass on you
Won't you meet me in the back
I'm just tryna show you that I do
Want you cause I'm into you
Convincing you
I'm here for you
I feel it cause
You feel it too
Tell me what we finna do
Cuz baby you such vibe
I need that in my life
Dammit you so my type
I bet you'd do me right yea
I put in work tonight
I'm talking overtime
Can I come spend the night
Won't you come spend the night yea
