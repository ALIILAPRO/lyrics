		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you here by my side
I want you here in my life
I want you here in my ride
Don't you wanna come alive
I let you in up in my life
Oh, we can slide
Come along, come and feel my vibe
Everyday everything's alright
Let me in, make you sing all night
By my side, yeah
Your kiss is something
I'm not allowed to miss
God, you're cunning
She don't wanna play
Said you got me mumbling
Take the pain away
Come and let me in and find another way
Come and fuck my day up
Want to hear my name
Always tryna find a way
Find my way back
I got more to say
Won't convince you to stay
I don't wanna play no more games
I don't want your feelings to change
I won't hold back
Feeling myself but you call me back
And I can't beat that
When you pull me back
Yeah, I can't beat that
I need you by my side
I want you here by my side
I want you here in my life
I want you here in my ride
Don't you wanna come alive
I let you in up in my life
Oh, we can slide
Come along, come and feel my vibe
Everyday everything's alright
Let me in, make you sing all night
By my side, yeah
Put your lips on mine
I don't gotta tell you twice, nah
Know you love to fight
Tell me to get out your sight
The way you say it
Swear that you drive me crazy, yeah
And girl you can't blame me
I'm not the type for changing, oh, yeah
But you like that
One call and I got you running right back
Make love in the morning, when the night ends
Then I wake up just to find you out of my bed, yeah
You push me away
I'm pulling you back, now you want me to stay
Girl I don't think we could have this any other way
I know you feel the same, ooh
I want you here by my side
I want you here in my life
I want you here in my ride
Don't you wanna come alive, come alive
I let you in up in my life
Oh, we can slide, slide
Come along come and feel my vibe, vibe
Everyday everything's alright, alright
Let me in, make you sing all night
By my side, yeah
