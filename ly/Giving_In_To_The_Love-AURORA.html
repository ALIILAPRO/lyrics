		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm losing my connection
I'm tired of the rules and your corrections
I want to live my life, be all of its pages
And underline that I am not an angel

'Cause if I'm not pure
I guess that I'm too much
I never know how to keep in, keep in touch

If I'll be somebody
I'll never let my skin decide it for me
I never had the world so why change for it?
I never had the world so why change for it?

Giving in to the love
Giving in to the love
Giving in to the love
The love, the love, the love

Someone out there is trying
To find somebody whole who is not dying
But everybody cries and nobody comforts
The television lies and now my mind hurts

And if I'm not loved
I guess that I am cursed
I gotta know how to beat it
Beat it first

If I'll be somebody
I'll never let my skin decide it for me
I never had the world so why change for it?
I never had the world so why change for it?

Giving in to the love
Giving in to the love
Giving in to the love
The love, the love, the love, the love

Giving in to the love
Giving in to the love
Giving in to the love
The love, the love, the love

La-la, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da, la-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da, la-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da
