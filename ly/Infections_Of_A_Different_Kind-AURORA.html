		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a feeling growing old with time
Like a restless in a leaves coming down
The world is a hole and we all seem to fall
Down and down

And the universe is growing tall
And we are caving into dreams of this space
Unfolding her arms cannot do any harm
Violent contractions

And if there is a God 
Would we even know his name?
And if there is a God
I think he would shake his head
And turn away

So belong to us all
Be God in the shape of a girl
Who walks this world
And I beg, I beg to be drained
From the pain I've soaked myself in
So I can stay
Okay, and more than okay for a while
For a while, for a while

Infections of a different kind
The world is being attacked by your pain
If I'm the world then why would I hurt
All that is living?

And if there is a God 
Would he then believe in us?
And if there is a God 
I think he can't hear all of us

Belong to us all
Be God in the shape of a girl
Who walks this world
And I beg, I beg to be drained
From the pain I've soaked myself in
So I can stay
Okay, and more than okay for a while
For a while, for a while

This is the breath 
This is the breath
