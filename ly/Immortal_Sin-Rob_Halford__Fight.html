		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Torn by the wrath that burns like a buried flame
Crossed in the heart from this voice that's a nagging pain
Snared to the book of God with a twisted fear
Help me from being damned by a righteous spear

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

Chained with a crooked stare that conceals a lie
Choked on a love that's judged from an evil eye
Lost in a world of hurt through a sense of doubt
Take all the numbing grief let the poison out

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin

Torn by the wrath that burns like a buried flame

It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
It's immortal sin
