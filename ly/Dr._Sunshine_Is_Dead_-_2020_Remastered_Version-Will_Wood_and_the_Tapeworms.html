		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When did I become afraid of the dark? cre my
Eyeballs just yet to adjust to seeing the light?
The room I'm in is still the same, the shadows have not rearranged it
No the only thing that's changed is how I see at night
I fumble for the switch and strap on infrareds and wish for
Sunshine when the morning's somewhere else
But I can't change what time it is or dilate my irises
Only what I look at, and I'm looking at myself

I am not the sunshine, I am not the moon at night
Well, who else could I be when I can't hardly see
I am not the sunshine, I am not the moon at night
I'm no one if I'm nowhere in between

When did I become afraid of the dark? Was it
When I left the cave and swore I'd never go back?
If we can't see each other then there's no more use for hiding
I've decided I'll abide it, why deny the color black?
I'm not a flower, not a solar-powered calculator
Damn my eyes for seeing what's not there
I'll trade in vision for a practiced intuition
Till my fears come to fruition I'm not scared

I am not the sunshine, I am not the moon at night
Well who else could I be when I can't hardly see
I am not the sunshine, I am not the moon at night
I'm no one if I'm nowhere in between

The future must know where you've been
The past predicts the state you're in
The present did and will not last, is. isn't. was. Have. hasn't. has

cll that I ask is, keep those empty frames
If nobody's in them, then no one is to blame
For your self-portraits, sign another name
Well, who should I be then, if I'll never be the same?

I will be my sunshine, I will be my moon at night
Who else could I be, when I can't fucking see?
I will be my sunshine, I will be my moon at night
I'm nowhere now here's no one now to be

cnd if dreams can come true, what does that say about nightmares?
I'll stay awake tonight
