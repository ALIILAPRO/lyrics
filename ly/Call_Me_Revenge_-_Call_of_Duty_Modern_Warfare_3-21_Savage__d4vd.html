		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me revenge
Cold as the ice in my veins
Fear is the sound of my name
I'm here to collect all your sins, I'm goin' in
Call me revenge

I'm with the squad forever (yeah)
When it comes to winnin', we better (on God)
The team loyal to me (21)
Through it all, we stand together (21)
If he fall, better pick him up (fast)
Go down, better get back up (straight Up)
Big Glock and I got mine tucked (on God)
But they know they ain't fuckin' with us (21)
No matter what, I'm with 'em (21)
He with them, we get 'em (21)
I'm a dawg but they can't sit 'em (facts)
I ain't playin' no middle (pussy)
Chopper bullets hit 'em (pussy)
And his bones was brittle (pussy)
I'm stuck on this field (21)
I been here since little (on God)
Talkin' 'bout smoke, I'm the G.O.A.T. (yeah)
Never take me for no joke (yeah)
Niggas ain't able to cope (yeah)
You follow wherever they go (21)
Hang 'em, we givin' 'em rope (21)
Slaughter Gang, you can get poked (21)
We the ones uppin' the score (facts)

Call me revenge
Cold as the ice in my veins
Fear is the sound of my name
I'm here to collect all your sins, I'm goin' in
Call me revenge
Cold as the ice in my veins
Fear is the sound of my name
I'm here to collect all your sins, I'm goin' in
Call me revenge

I get my revenge (on God)
Jump in cars and spin (21)
Keep my enemies closer (yeah)
Than I keep my friends (yeah)
Gotta get my payback (21)
Been on that since way back (pussy)
Mean mug, get sprayed at (pussy)
G Block, don't play that (21)
Kick up all the smoke (yeah)
Put 'em on the ropes (on God)
They be makin' tweets (facts)
We be at they throats (facts)
Creepin' through your bushes (21)
Lookin' through this scope (pew)
Movin' like assail' (pew)
I might jump off the boat (on God)
I'ma get my lick back (21)
I'll wait for years (21)
You gon' shed blood if you make me shed tears (on God)
And I keep a rifle (straight up)
Like I'm huntin' deer (straight up, straight up)
Serve revenge cold
Now we sayin', "Cheers"

Call me revenge
Cold as the ice in my veins
Fear is the sound of my name
I'm here to collect all your sins, I'm goin' in
Call me revenge
Cold as the ice in my veins
Fear is the sound of my name
I'm here to collect all your sins, I'm goin' in
Call me revenge

Call me revenge
Call me revenge
