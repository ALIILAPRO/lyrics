		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love and blessings, simple kindness
Fell like rain on thirsty lions
Fields and gardens, long abandoned
Came to life in dust and sand
Lovers lives, sweet as honey
Touched as if old love was new
Bankers pockets overflow with gold and money
Prophecies of wealth came true

Ain't no song like an 'ol song jol
Ain't no song like an 'ol song jolly
Ain't no time like good times jol
Ain't no time like the good times jolly

If the summer kept a secret
It was heaven's lack of rain
Golden days and amber sunsets
Let the scientists complain
Ain't no word on, in an image
Something called me from my sleep
Love and blessings, simple kindness
Ours to hold, but not to keep

Ain't no song like an 'ol song jol
Ain't no song like an 'ol song jolly
Ain't no time like good times jol
Ain't no time like the good time jolly

Everywhere you look
Everywhere you go
Everybody's looking forward
I can't get enough of that
I can't get enough of that
I can't get enough of that
Everybody's looking forward

Love and blessings, simple kindness
Ours to hold, but not to keep
