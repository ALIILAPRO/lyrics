		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in shadows
these cold nightmares
people'll come and
people will go right back
what I know is
I'll keep on walking alone

Almighty moon, I'm
begging you once again
show me the secret
tell me the answer
oh yeah I hate it
when everything's unknown

Selene, your love is magic
don't let the sun take my soul
Selene, hold my nightmares
and throw them away
they don't deserve you

don't you love your time girl ?
don't you love your time now ?

where should I begin ?
when your voice is stuck in my head ?

I see no future
written in ma' own eyes
Won't you protect me
from this rising sun
oh don't you run the night
outside the lights
it's alright

Almighty moon, I'm
watching you once again
show me the secret
tell me the answer
cause I still hate it
when you bring me the unknown

Selene, I'm still looking at you
and touches me your love
Selene, you're healing me
under your gaze, I'll come alive

don't you love your time girl ?
don't you love your time now ?

where should I begin ?
when your voice is stuck in my head ?
