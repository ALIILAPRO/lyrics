		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I open my lungs 
To breathe in forgiveness and love
Haunting me now 
Reminders of how I used to be
And on down the road 
My troubles are sure to follow
Looking out the window
The hell if I know where I will go
So I'll just keep on driving

On my way to L.A. 
Looking into the rear view 
As the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right 
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line 
Just changed my mind
Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time

Who would've known 
That pride is so hard to swallow?
As I rest on the shoulder of a road growing colder
With the trouble I own
Should I just keep on driving?

On my way to L.A. 
Looking into the rear view 
As the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right 
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line 
Just changed my mind
Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time

I know I must be doing something right
Head the other way, back to where I started out
Ask myself if I can turn it all around tonight
And stop living with doubt
Hey yeah

On my way to L.A. 
Looking into the rear view 
As the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right
 Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line 
Just changed my mind
Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time

I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
It's my heart I'll follow this time
I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
I'm gonna turn it all around tonight
Turn it all around (around tonight)
Turn it all around tonight
I'm gonna turn it all around tonight 
At the Tennessee line
