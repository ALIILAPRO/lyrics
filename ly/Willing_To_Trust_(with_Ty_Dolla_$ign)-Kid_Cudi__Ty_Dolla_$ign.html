		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the day I've been waitin' for
And I'm settin' the scene
Your touch paralyzes me in the mornin' and
I don't want you to go
Sincerely yours, forevermore
And teach me what I should know
And I count on you, show me something new, honey
Mmm

(Oh, take control of me)
(Oh, take control of me)
(Oh)

I been willing to trust someone
And I've (I), been (been), willing to trust someone (oh, I)
And I've (I), been (I've been), willing to trust someone (oh, I)
And I've (I), been (I've been), willing to trust someone

Yeah, if we ain't got trust, we ain't got nothin' (nothin')
Is this really love, what it's becomin'? (Becomin')
Funny how we turned into somethin' (somethin')
Say you wasn't even lookin' for a boyfriend (yeah)
Don't need new friends, that shit so confusin' (no, no, no)
Left your ex, thought you'd never trust (no) a man again (oh)
Don't take it out on me, nah (out on me)
Don't do me dirty, let's make this worth it

I been (been), willing to trust someone
And I've (I), been (been), willing to trust someone (oh, I)
And I've (I), been (I've been), willing to trust someone (oh, I)
And I (I), been (I've been), willing to trust someone

(Yeah, oh)
(Yeah, oh)
(Yeah, oh)
(Yeah, oh)

I got you, don't worry, love (oh, hold on me)
I got you, don't worry, love (oh, just lay with me)
I got you, don't worry, love (oh, you're so sweet)
I got you, don't worry, love (right here is where I'll be)
I got you, don't worry, love (oh, hold on me)
I got you, don't worry, love (oh, just lay with me)
I got you, don't worry, love (oh, you're so sweet)
I got you, don't worry, love (right here is where I'll be)
I got you, don't worry, love (all this time, I thought I'd never find)
I got you, don't worry, love (someone golden that I can call mine)
I got you, don't worry, love (oh, so silly of me)
I got you, don't worry, love (oh, just hold on me)
