		  Moonlight Over Paris

You say you've been overseas
I say over where
You say just a holiday
My Alsatian heir
I say I've been working late, working overtime
Haven't seen the sun since sixty-nine
Does the moonlight shine on Paris
After the sun goes down
If the London Bridge is falling
Will anybody hear a sound
If you follow the sunset will it ever end
Does the moonlight shine on Paris 

Oh and how can you just walk away
Was it something that I said
I see only black and white
You see green and red
You believe in the miracles
Water into wine
I believe it when it makes the New York Times 

Does the moonlight shine on Paris
After the sun goes down
If the London Bridge is falling
Will anybody hear a sound
If you follow the sunset will it ever end
Does the moonlight shine on Paris
