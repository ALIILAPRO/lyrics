		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe this is heaven
Or maybe that's just you
But I don't trust my judgement
'Cuz I'm just 22
My mind is running circles
My heart's out in the rain  
I know that this is sudden but

Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

I can't make my mind up
I don't know what to do
I'm trying to be honest
See all the point of views 
You tell me that you're leaving
But I wish you would stay 
I think this is worth it but
 
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

So if you're thinking "not today"
I'd rather have the truth than start a love that's fake
Baby, tell me if you need your space 
But if you're feeling lonely, I'm an hour away, hey
  
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
