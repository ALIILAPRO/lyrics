		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Til I'm brave enough to call you
I just fall through every time
I wish I'd waved when I saw you
I just watched you passing by

So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

You gave me no answers
Nor asked me to lie
You just gave me an amethyst
From your jeweled vest as you cried

So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

We shared in the basement
As the fern bent to the window
And we drew to alignment
As the water soaks the pillow

So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
You come around, I'm ruined
