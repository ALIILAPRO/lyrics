		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now?
When I need you
Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared
That there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking
This slow

My baby's got the bends
Oh, no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
And I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?

They brought in the C.I.A
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky-high

Baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would

I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race, race, race?

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
When I need you
