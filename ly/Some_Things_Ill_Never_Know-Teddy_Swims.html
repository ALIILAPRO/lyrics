		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking down the street last night
Watching strangers pass me by
Where do all our shadows go?
I guess some things I'll never know

I can fool my senses for a little while
But some things are too hard to reconcile

When I look into your eyes
There's no answers I can't find
It's a feeling that I've never known
When I'm wide awake tonight
Running circles in my mind
There's an answer I can't find
When did your heart let me go?
I guess some things I'll never know
I guess some things I'll never know

I'm running out of avenues
'Cause every road leads back to you
When memories fade, where do they go?
I guess some things I'll never know

I can fool my senses for a little while
But some things are too hard to reconcile

Oh, when I look into your eyes
There's no answers I can't find
It's a feeling that I've never known
When I'm wide awake tonight
Running circles in my mind
There's an answer I can't find
When did your heart let me go?
I guess some things I'll never know
I guess some things I'll never know

Did I turn over every stone?
Am I still there when your eyes close?
When did your heart let me go?
I guess some things I'll never know
