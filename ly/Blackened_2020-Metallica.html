		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend

Never
No, never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color my world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been

Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never
No, no, never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color my world blackened

Opposition, contradiction
Premonition, compromise
Agitation, violation
Mutilation, planet dies

Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life

Termination, expiration
Cancellation, human race
Expectation, liberation
Population, lay to waste

See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Oh, never
Oh, oh, never
Oh, fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color my world blackened
Color my world blackened
Color my world blackened
Color my world blackened
Color my world
