		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't like the way this has gone

You weave your words
Into our lives
You weave your words
Into our lives
Your weaving your words
Into our lives
Trying to make us believe
Two plus two is five

We don't like the way this has gone
We don't like the way this has gone
We don't like the way this has gone
You're dragging us back despite how far we've come

Truth is great, when it is told
Truth is great, when it is told
But greater for you is truth silenced
Truth is silenced and then sold

We don't like the way this has gone
We don't like the way this has gone
We don't like the way this has gone
You're dragging us back despite how far we've come

We don't like oh the way this has gone
You're dragging us back despite how far we've come

We don't like the way this has gone
We don't like the way this has gone
We don't like the way this has gone
You're dragging us back despite how far we've come

Who controls the past
Controls the present
Who controls the past
Controls the present
Who controls the present
Controls the past
Ignorance is strength
So tells the president
