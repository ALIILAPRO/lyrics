		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way, a-hey, a-hey-hey

Everyday, it's a gettin' faster
Everyone sayid "Go ahead and ask her"
Love like yours will surely come my way, a-hey, a-hey-hey

Everyday seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?

Everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way, a-hey, a-hey-hey

Everyday seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?

Everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way, a-hey, a-hey-hey
Love like yours will surely come my way
