		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone's damaged
A little depressed
Every now and then we get that feeling in our chest
Some days I'm a loser, brush my teeth in the dark
Head above water in a swimming pool of sharks

Ooh, it's hard to get up out of bed when everything is on its head
And nothing seems to make any sense
Like a Band-Aid on a bleeding heart
I fake a smile and fall apart
And no one ever knows I'm a wreck

When the world is on your shoulders
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way
It's just a bad day, not a bad life

Everything's backwards and I'm hanging on
No matter how hard I try I always come undone
Backed in a corner, uncomfortably numb
Watching myself become a shadow of someone

Oh, it's hard to find a place to hide
When you're running from what's inside
No matter where you go, there you are
So tonight I'll go to war with me
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy and I don't wanna fight anymore

When the world is on your shoulders
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way
It's just a bad day, not a bad life
And I know it feels so hopeless
And I know how close you are to the edge right now
So I wrote this song to say, things won't always be this way, no
It's just a bad day, not a bad life

Ooh, yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah, oh

When the world is on your shoulders
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear
Well, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way
It's just a bad day, not a bad life
And I know it feels so hopeless
And I know how close you are to the edge right now
So I wrote this song to say, things won't always be this way, no
It's just a bad day, not a bad life

Yeah, it's just a bad day, not a bad life
