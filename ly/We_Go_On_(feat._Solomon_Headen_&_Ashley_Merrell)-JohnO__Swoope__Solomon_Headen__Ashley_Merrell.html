		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is the reason you and I are here today
Where do we go from here, where do you we go from here
We goâ€¦
After you pick up pieces of shattered and broken dreams
After you get to see that the the ladder to hope it leans
After the disappointment when officers beat the trial
After the missed appointments it's hard to conceive a child
After you wishing lord I just wanna walk down the aisle
After you get the point that tears water the smile
You prayed every prayer and sang every song
Gave him every care now tell me where do we go
Love is the reason that you and I are here today
After you looking backwards face plastered on happily ever after
Faith shattered Can't fathom of having to take it back to
Square one
With the weight-i-ness of perfection
You waiting to take the exit from taking it through depression
Now You scared huh
Game plan it disappeared huh
Changed plans they just appeared huh
Must be a circus it ain't fair huh
Heavy as a bench press
I want this cup to pass cuz I fail to see the French press
I Only want you to pour if it's sweet
This cup of coffee is painting a portrait of me
Take the bitter and just throw it in the sea
But I need to taste the difference of the bitter so I'll know it when it's sweet
Take the Good with the bad
Take the Hood with the class
Take the Rain with the sun
Take the Pain when it comes
Catch a Break when you can
Catch a Wave with the fam
Let go let go control
It's chasing the wind
And just go on
