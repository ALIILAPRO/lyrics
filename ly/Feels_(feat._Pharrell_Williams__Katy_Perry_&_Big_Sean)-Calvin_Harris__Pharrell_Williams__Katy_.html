		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
No nothing ever lasts forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow (hey)
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe 

Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me (yeah)
The way you move it here (hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (hey, ooh)

Don't be afraid to catch feels (ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

I'm your window shopper (hey hi), sucker for your love, oh (yes)
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual (virtual) reality (hey yeah)
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar (hey)
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir (hey), can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (yeah)
The way you move it here (hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (hey, ooh)

Don't be afraid to catch feels (ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (oh oh oh, ah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (straight up)
Feels with me (woah)

Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention? (Like, woah)
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance (yeah, yeah)
You're looking for a little more consistency (I know)
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's (hey)
I feel my old flings was just preparing me (me)
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Flyin' first class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma "at" this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'd get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (woah, woah, woah)
Feels with me

Don't be afraid to catch feels (no, no)
Don't be afraid, baby, don't be afraid
Ride drop top and chase thrills (woah, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
I know, I know, I know
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
