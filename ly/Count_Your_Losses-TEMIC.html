		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No more words, my sire 
No more of your lies 
The king of deceit 

All the tones of silence 
Are your best allies 
They'll keep you at ease 

No more lies  
If we could only 
hear no lies 
Count your losses 
Take their ashes to the grave 
You never left your pride aside
No action will be forgiven 
Fake devotion 
Drove the motions til the end 
We didn't leave a word confined 
Our story can't be unwritten  

All that's dutiful 
Breaks inside of you  
All that's doable
Is excusable 

All that's beautiful 
Rots inside of you 
All that's scrutable 
is excusable  

Count your losses 
Take their ashes to the grave 
You never left your pride aside
No action will be forgiven 
Fake devotion 
Drove the motions til the end 
We didn't leave a word confined 
Our story can't be unwritten  

You've lost yourself again 
Now you're running on 
the streets of loss and shame 
You were getting closer 
to the great escape
But you'll never heal 
if the pain you wreak 
has brought you down 

You'll see yourself again 
when you're all alone 
The streets of emptiness
will always be your home 
And all the hearts betrayed 
won't let you be at peace
with reality right here and now 

Don't forget 
all that matters 
lies within 
  
Count your losses 
Take their ashes to the grave 
You never left your pride aside
No action will be unwritten 
Fake devotion 
Drove the motions til the end 
We didn't leave a word confined 
Your story won't be forgiven
