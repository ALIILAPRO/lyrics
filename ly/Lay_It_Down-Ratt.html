		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you don't really know mee
I know you don't really care to see me
I'm into total affection
Not being scared if you never please me
You know you really want to lay it down
Right now
And how
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down

Under the sheets you will find me
I know that nothing's for free
You take what's good for your pleasing
I'll take what's good for this crazy evening
You know you really want to lay it down
Right now
And how
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down

I know you only want romance
I'll give you all that I can
If you'll give me just one chance
To prove myself and my love

Lay it down
Lay it down
Lay it down
