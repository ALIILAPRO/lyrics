		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She can
Walk that walk, walk that walk,
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes, toes
Prime time chick, she the type to get chose, chose
Baby girl she so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout, shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about, bout
She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk

Goddamn she a sassy
Face, body, ass yeah she got the total package
Walking through the club like a nigga ain't watchin'
Struttin' that strut like she in a mall shoppin'
Can't forget the mansion, yeah she got dimensions
I wonder if she know that she the center of attention?
Middle of the floor, doing her, looking sexy
She can walk that walk, like the niggas do at weddings
She the type you wanna marry, top notch and classy
Niggas lined up trying to be her baby daddy
Excuse me what's your name? how you doing? I'm just asking
Can I take you by the head? baby I'll be gladly
Damn I want her bad, so I'm a come at her politely
By the way she flirtin', I can tell that she like me
Way across the floor, but looking at me while she dancing
That sexy ass can be, lil' mama you ain't understandin'

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes, toes
Prime time chick, she the type to get chose, chose
Baby girl she so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout, shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about, bout
She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk

She got Beyonce hips, Keishya Cole thighs
Meagan good lips, and some sexy ass eyes
She yellow like the road in the wizard of the oz
Got them other bitches hattin' talkin' like flies
Say it, then she go fed
And she taste up from her toes to her head
Take her out to eat before I take her to the bed
And give that uh uh and I don't need no meds
All I need is her, thirty minutes, and a rubber
Nigga like me you'll find nan other
Straight beast mode, three times, one hour
Give it to her, in the kitchen, bedroom, or the shower
Lil talk, I got, what she need
Head board, knockin' up against her knees, knees
Hit her from the back, so I can grab her by the waist
Flip her over then you all on her face

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes, toes
Prime time chick, she the type to get chose, chose
Baby girl she so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout, shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about, bout
She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk

Say, now let me see you walk
Left, right
Left, right
Left, right
Left, right

Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah, aah

And let me see you walk
Right, left
Right, left
Right, left
Right, left

Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah, aah

Walk that, walk that
