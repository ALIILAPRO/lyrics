		<p>
		  Lord of Lords!
King of Kings!
Yessss
Uhuhh
Aye
Listen

Lord of Lords!
King of Kings!
Praise his name yes sing
Everyday my praise and worship
I just want to bring
By grace you do forgive
For you alone I live
Jesus never left my side
To you alone I cling

Lord of Lords!
King of Kings!
P- praise his name yes sing
Everyday my praise and worship
I just want to bring
By grace you do forgive
For you alone I live
Jesus never left my side
To you alone I cling

Your word alone I hold
Wait, Pause
Demons fold
The devil he runs track
Laps, Ready
Quick to attack
But my Lord he's got my back
And you know he's quick to react
Aye bring that Oil
Yes every demon around get put in a pack

(Smoke inhaleeeeeee)
That's LOUD
Your name is what I proclaim
Yh I just wanna scream and shout
Your love is what I embrace
And no I can't live without
Serve you for the rest of my days
No I don't wanna live in doubt

Lord of Lords!
King of Kings!
P- praise his name yes sing
Everyday my praise and worship
I just want to bring
By grace you do forgive
For you alone I live
Jesus never left my side
To you alone I cling

Lord of Lords!
King of Kings!
P- praise his name yes sing
Everyday my praise and worship
I just want to bring
By grace you do forgive
For you alone I live
LISTEN
Jesus never left my side
To you alone I cling

Aye
What a beautiful name he is
YES
What a beautiful name is Jesus
You are my Shepherd
Oh Lord please lead us
You died for all of our sins
And freed us

ADONAI
EL SHADDAI
The Lord our God Almighty
Prince of Peace
ELOHIM
My God is Strong and Mighty
My God he sits up high
Watches his children
Shining brightly
Read your Bible pray
Yes hold on to the word so tightly

Lord of Lords!
King of Kings!
P- praise his name yes sing
Everyday my praise and worship
I just want to bring
By grace you do forgive
For you alone I live
LISTEN
Jesus never left my side
To you alone I cling

Lord of Lords!
King of Kings!
Praise his name yes sing
Everyday my praise and worship
I just want to bring
By grace you do forgive
For you alone I live
Jesus never left my side
To you alone I cling
