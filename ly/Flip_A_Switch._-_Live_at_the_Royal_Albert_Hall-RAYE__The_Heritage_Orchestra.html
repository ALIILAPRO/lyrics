		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't just let your guard down and fall for someone anymore
That's what stupid girls do
Yeah, I've been a stupid girl
Four days away, in his arms I invest
He won't take my heart, but he'll take off my dress
Excuses rehearsed, I am blue, I am red
Fuck lookin' for love
I'ma stay doin' what us bitches do best

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm there if he callin' me
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm there if he callin' me

You're a very silly man, block, block, mute chat
New addy in the sat, new dicks on tap
Got a best case, worst case, plan of attack
Got bitches, if they see you in the street, you're gettin' slapped
Don't threaten me or talk to me ever like that
I got brothers in the ends that'll pull up right now
You don't even wanna see the way I pull up right now
In my little black dress and my neck buss down how I (hmm, hmm)

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm there if he callin' me
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm there if he callin' me (ayy, yeah, yeah)

Bad bitch break hearts, all-black Patek watch
Swervin' through London, we got stars in the race cars
Diamonds look like Cape Cod
We attach the switch if they come and try to take ours
We got pretty bitch energy, that's why they hate us
Guns up for the real ones, let that shit bust
Tell 'em it dead if they callin', I can't pick up
Thirty in the Birkin, it's a stickup
Climb to the tip, he wanna cuff it
It's a US ting, better hope it come fit
C-O-I, he said, "Coi Leray, you lit"
We in VIP, takin' shots with my bitch
We gon'

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm there if he callin' me (ooh)
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy (that my energy)
Tell him I'm there if he callin' me

Ooh, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no
Ooh, oh no, ooh, ah, oh
Only because I was in love, I opened up
Now I'll open up to your best friend, which one?
Bitch like me, I just had to flip the switch on you (ooh)

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm there if he callin' me (baby)
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm (ooh)
A very sound bitch 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy (that my energy)
Tell him I'm there if he callin' me

Me, yeah, yeah-yeah
Ooh, ah, oh
Only because I was in love, I opened up
Now I'll open up to your best friend, which one?
Bitch like me, I just had to flip the switch on you
