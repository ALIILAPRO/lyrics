		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
This is not a one night stand baby, yeah

So, let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find

You're gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby tonight, belongs to us
Everything right, do what you must
And inch by inch we grow closer and closer
To every lil' part of each other, oh baby yeah

So let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find

You're gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Cruise with me baby
Oh oh oh 
Yeah oh oh oh
Oh baby, let's cruise
Let's float, let's glide
Oh, let's open up and go inside

And if you want it, you got it forever
I could just stay here beside you and love you baby
