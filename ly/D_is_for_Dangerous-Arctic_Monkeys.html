		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was seeking an escape

But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

"D" is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

"D" is for desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was all right
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
On the brink of an episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

"D" is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favorite worst nightmare
