		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am tied to your throne
While our conversation is out the door
I'm paralyzed to your eyes (ooh)
I was worried you'd be a surprise

She's wrapped in a
Contagious, contagious, contagious
Ribbon (oh, my)
Can't take this, can't take this, can't take this (rewind)
Contagious, contagious, contagious
Ribbon (oh, my)
Can't take this, can't take this, can't take this

Perfection hidden in the moonlight, yeah (ooh)
No dead ends when it comes to your lullaby
When you sing to me

When she sings to me
I fall way too deep
There's no way to see

Tell me while you're blushing
Are we onto something?
Or is it just a way to keep out?

She's wrapped in a
Contagious, contagious, contagious
Ribbon (oh, my)
Can't take this, can't take this, can't take this (rewind)
Contagious, contagious, contagious
Ribbon (oh, my)
Can't take this, can't take this, can't take this

I'm steady with my words
In case I wanna ride along this loop
I'm ready for the pain that runs
When you tell me she's the baddest news

Fuck what they think
You turn blood into caffeine
And you're draining all my powers
I'm addicted to your challenge

Tell me while you're blushing
Are we onto something?
Or is it just a way to keep out?

She's wrapped in a
Contagious, contagious, contagious
Ribbon (oh, my)
Can't take this, can't take this, can't take this (rewind)
Contagious, contagious, contagious
Ribbon (oh, my)
Can't take this, can't take this, can't take this

Are we descending into nothing
Or is it just another reason
For us to be awake

For us to be awake
