		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It ain't even Christmas
And it ain't your birthday
So why you callin' me with a wishlist?
Like I live in a vase
See, I've been bamboozled once before
You ain't foolin' me again
I just wanted you to know what I'm gon' say

Stop askin' me for money, get your own, I
Barely even just got home
Do I look like a tree to you?
Well, leaf me alone, if I do
And take this as your fair warnin'
Next time you're in need of somethin'
Don't call my phone, bitch

I need you to stop
Stop askin' me for shit
Ooh, I put this on in case you forget
Ooh-ooh, these niggas always want somethin' (somethin')
You know they always want somethin'
But nigga, I want somethin' too (oh-oh)
I want you to stop

A nigga just got paid
And the hair is laid
And my soul is saved
But I'm not your bank
Ask your mama
And remember

Don't call my phone, bitch

I need you to stop
Askin' me for shit
Ooh, I put this on in case you forget
Ooh-ooh, these niggas always want somethin' (somethin')
You know they always want somethin'
But nigga, I want somethin' too (oh-oh)
I want you to stop
