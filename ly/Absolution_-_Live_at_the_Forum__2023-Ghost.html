		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever since you were born you've been dying
Every day a little more you've been dying
Dying to reach the setting sun

As a child, with your mind on the horizon
Over corpses, to the prize you kept your eyes on

Trying to be the chosen one

All those things that you desire
You will find there in the fire

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

Even now when you're here you are moving
Hysterically seeking out what needs improving
And you're still asking for the sun

All those things that you desire
You will find there in the fire

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution
