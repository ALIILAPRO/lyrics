		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd sail across the ocean
I'd walk a hundred miles
If I could make it to the end
Oh, just to see a smile

You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears
The desperation and the anger
Madness and the fear

No hope, no life
Just pain and fear
No food, no love
Just greed is here

Starvation and the hunger
The suffering and the pain
The agonies of all-out war
When will it come again?

The struggle for the power
A tyrant tries again
Just what the hell is going on?
When will it ever end?

No hope, no life
Just pain and fear
No food, no love
Just greed is here

You see the full moon float
You watch the red sunrise
We take these things for granted
But somewhere someone's dying

Contaminated waters
Pollution and decay
Just waiting for disease to strike
Oh, will we learn someday?

No hope, no life
Just pain and fear
No food, no love
No seed, childhood's end
