		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up this morning, I'm shaking I can't be still, girl
Too many images running through my mind
Soon as I hit it, I can't get it out my system
Even my brother, he asked me "what you on?"

I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night
Girl, come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burnin' in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

Ever since I met you, you got me changing my schedule
If you ain't know, that shit's eventful
And losing this money is dreadful, but
Believe me, that pussy is special
You wanna meet moms, I might let you
Rollie is so presidential, keep it on while we fuck that's 'cause I meant to, yeah
Fuck you twice, we take a nap, soon as you're awake, get back
Go for three, it takes a knack
I'm taking you to places that
You ain't been, girl, face the fact, meant it, I can't take it back
Whisky straight, ain't chasing that, I'll taste the cat
Yeah, you told me I own that pearl, yeah, that's 'cause I bone you, girl
You should be my only girl, when I hit it, you feel like you own the world

I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night
Girl, come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burnin' in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

Yeah, ah, since the last time we had sex, honestly, I've been a mess, well
Fiendin' 'cause you got the best, borderline kind of obsessed and yeah
I'm on some kind of drug, I've been addicted and I cannot find enough
I call you, I'm tryna fuck, I'm in room 921, come on up
And we could put up the "please do not disturb"
I got the drink, I got the herb, I'm tweakin', now I must be cured
The only way I rest assured is if, I get my fix
I love the way your dress just slips right off your waist, right down your hips
Technique's the best, she knows some tricks and yeah
I need you now, I need you bad
You and me both been fiendin' bad, I guess what I really mean is that, yeah

I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waiting all night
Girl, come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burnin' in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

Them bath water runnin'
Fire be burnin' in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

We ain't playin' anymore
Privacy on the door (privacy is on the door)

We ain't playin' anymore
Privacy on the door (when we finish baby, ain't gon' need no more)
