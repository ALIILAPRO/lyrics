		<p>
		  What's up, Fresh? 
It's our turn, baby

Gator boots (gator boots)
With the pimped out Gucci suits (them Gucci suits)
Ain't got no job (ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy) 
But I stay shive (I stay shive)
Can't pay my rent (I can't pay my rent) 
'Cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm still fly (I'm so fly)
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E-Class (in my E-Class Benz)
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride (ho-ho-hood rich)
Got everything (we got everything)
In my momma name (ayy, in my momma name)
But I'm hood rich (uh-huh) 
La-da-di-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

Get your ca-ca-car cleaned, gems gon' shine
And tell ma get a mink, baby girl, let's ride (that's right)
You a number one stunna and we gon' glide
And go straight to the mall and tear down the inside
In that Prada, Gucci, full-mink leather (leather)
Burberry's cool, Coogi sweater (sweater)
Twenty-inches, pop my feather
The Birdman daddy, I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-Wagon so fly
Number one, don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars I am that nigga
The Gu-Gu-Gucci with the matchin' interior
Three-wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and Stunna, and we like brothers
We shine like paint, daddy, it's our summer

Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive (ho-ho-hood rich) 
Can't pay my rent 'cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm still fly (ho-ho-hood rich)
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E-Class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride (ho-ho-hood rich)
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm hood rich 
La-da-di-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

Have you ever seen crocodile seats in the truck?
Turn around and sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steerin' wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma, player's where you can find me
Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (turn left)
Bruh, your wife really love me 'cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (skrrt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go (uh-uh), boy, can you top that?
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went "uh-uh", and all of a sudden
Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard boom from the amplifiers

Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive (ho-ho-hood rich) 
Can't pay my rent 'cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm still fly (ho-ho-hood rich)
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E-Class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride (ho-ho-hood rich)
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm hood rich 
La-da-di-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man, I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck, twenty-fours with tens
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flyin' in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex' with convertible top
And the rims keeps spinnin' every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive 
Can't pay my rent 'cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm still fly 
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E-Class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride 
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm hood rich 
La-da-di-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
