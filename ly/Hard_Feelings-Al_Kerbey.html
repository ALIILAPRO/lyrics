		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me mad, like no one can
With your attitude
You talk a lot, but you don't say much
In the things you do
You're always right, in all our fights
Because no one else can shut you down
Or turn you around, you should see yourself

I'm not the kind to just close my mind
I don't think you're worth the time
It'll take to find the saving grace in you

I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
This time I don't wanna let 'em go
I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
And it's too hard not to let 'em show

You wanna feel
You're behind the wheel
And you're in control
Well all I see is insecurity
If the truth be told
There's no relief 
From the constant grief 
That you give to me
The problem, son, is you believe 
That one is a majority

You say you changed
But the fact remains
I won't take that ride again
I'm on the train
Leaving you to you

I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
This time I don't wanna let 'em go
I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
And it's too hard not to let 'em show

You say you changed
But the fact remains
I won't take that ride again
I'm on the train
Leaving you to you

I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
This time I don't wanna let 'em go
I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
And it's too hard not to let 'em show

I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
This time I don't wanna let 'em go
I have hard, hard, such hard feeling's
And it's too hard not to let 'em show
