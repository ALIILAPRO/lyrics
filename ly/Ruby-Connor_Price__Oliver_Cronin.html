		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, look
I got 'em moving in tandem
Militant how I'm advancing
Hold the baton
Salary look like a ransom
She said it's making me handsome
Showing me off
They said I've been getting cocky
This is my modesty anthem
Hold the applause
Slippers are ruby, I'm dancing
Feel like I been out in Kansas
Wizard of Oz

Bounce, bounce
They want my soul, I don't rent it out
Posting a ticket for headlining shows
Is the only time I'm ever selling out
Knocking me down in the second round
Good under pressure, they never doubt
Still gonna hit it right out of the park
At the bottom of ninth with a second out
Back against the wall, had to get them off
Never let them all get to me
Bombs, I set them off, don't upset the boss
I'ma get them all eventually
Yeah, but for now I'm just chilling
Hometown hero but the beat so villain
Got it on lock and the key code hidden
Straight to the top, we don't need no ceiling

I got 'em moving in tandem
Militant how I'm advancing
Hold the baton
Salary look like a ransom
She said it's making me handsome
Showing me off
They said I've been getting cocky
This is my modesty anthem
Hold the applause
Slippers are ruby, I'm dancing
Feel like I been out in Kansas
Wizard of Oz

Yeah, look at me I'm on the TV
I make a hit, double back, then I repeat
Got your favorite rapper tryin' to meet me
Phone buzzin, labels calling, they need me
I get it, I get it, they want the sauce
Me and Connor ain't giving no freebies
They all say that I'm cocky, it's confidence, baby
I'm sorry, I make it look easy

I feel a Wizard of Aus
Sydney, Toronto, we spinnin' the globe
Don't need your round of applause
Save it for later I'm back in my zone
That's hard
I'm back to my ways, I'm stepping' on throats
Oh, what a shame, I bet they gon' choke
You think that I changed, you don't wanna know

Oh, yeah, oh that's hard
Oh, yeah

I got 'em moving in tandem
Militant how I'm advancing
Salary look like a mansion
Something 'bout me being handsome
How's it go again?

I got 'em moving in tandem
Militant how I'm advancing
Hold the baton
Salary look like a ransom
She said it's making me handsome
Showing me off
They said I've been getting cocky
This is my modesty anthem
Hold the applause
Slippers are ruby I'm dancing
Feel like I been out in Kansas
Wizard of Oz
