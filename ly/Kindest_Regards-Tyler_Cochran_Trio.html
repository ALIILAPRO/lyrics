		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no hours til the morning
Ain't no wolves at the door
This is the same old same old
That we've been through before
Now I've out of excuses dear
And you're all out of time
My patience has ran it's course
I'm at the end of my line

Nothing but the best dear
All the letters, roses and cards
The only thing I ever got was
You're kindest regards

Long are the days now
That you can't you can't come home
Longer the nights dear
That I spend alone
Now I know there ain't no solution
Ain't no end that is near
So it's best if we both part ways
It'll be easier my dear

Nothing but the best dear
All the letters, roses and cards
The only thing I ever got was
You're kindest regards

Nothing but the best dear
All the letters, roses and cards
The only thing I ever got was
You're kindest regards
Oh yes nothing but the best dear
All the letters, roses and cards
The only thing I ever got was
You're kindest regards
