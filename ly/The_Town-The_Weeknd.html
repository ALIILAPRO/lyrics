		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left, on the road
And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne

You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left, on the road
And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne

I haven't been around my town in a long while
I apologize but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids
Who rely on me
But I remember on the bathroom floor before I went on tour
When you said we couldn't do it again
'Cause you had a thing with some other man

You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, ooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And oh
I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I will

Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
And he just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your uncheckable
Unrestrained to touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now, I'm everything, your everything, ooh

I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in
Ooh
Bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in

Ooh, oh
Ooh
Ooh
No
Let me love you

You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left, on the road
And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne
