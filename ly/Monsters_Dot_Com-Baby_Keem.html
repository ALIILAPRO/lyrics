		  Shot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo

I got the plug straight from my
Mans and she was starstruck
Ten shows back to back, come to my concert
And then she pulled up, she pulled up
Then I saw her oh my god, she's a monster

She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster

I didn't wanna knock her down
But I did though
Ten phones so a bitch don't get my info
I am way too poppin', lil' bitch
I'm popular she wanna be my main
I said that's way too cutthroat
My clothes line a bitch if she gon' fold for
I can't let her, but you see me in public
She tried to walk out the
Room wearin' my merch
I said "Bitch, come back, that's my shirt"

I got the plug straight from my
Mans and she was starstruck
Ten shows back to back, come to my concert
And then she pulled up, she pulled up
Then I saw her oh my god, she's a monster

She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
