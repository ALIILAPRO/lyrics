		<p>
		  Mi no compadre
Yeah
Whoa

Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no, mi no compadre

My seats on some reptile
You niggas some reptiles
I come with a lot of power
I come with the Aquafina
They hang off my neck and my earrings, fingers
I came with that check, then I came exquisite
I once spent a check on my transportation
We came from this section that ain't that great
See what I did when I came through faded
All of these niggas they gang related
Drug related got me walkin', pacin'
Peekin' out the window like I'm Khujo
Seen some real niggas get indicted
Seen a pussy nigga get some recognition
Twenty racks inside a nigga britches
Twenty bricks'll have a nigga twitchin'
They say you wanna conquer all the Audemar's
Diamond VVS is Niagara Falls
Dranks is drankin' fall asleep in the boat
Keep the stanky stank, nigga right in my coat
Got a bracelet wrapped around my wrist
Like to see my shit light up and glisten
Like to see some fish come back a brick
Put some bread on your head, get ya hit

Fuck around think it's a game
Fuck around, get on that drank
Fuck around with all the fuck arounds
You fuck around, get murked today
Fuck around, get work today
Fuck around with all the fuck arounds
Fuck around, you gon' get paid
Fuck around, we goin' crazy

Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no, mi no compadre

I'm not excited
We can't be reunited
Fuck it, I'm not being modest
Had a young nigga right up on Missoni
My jewelry hang off my wrist like I'm retarded
I came with the gang and they lightweight retarded
Niggas be like that bitch must been imported
Niggas shoot birds at the judge in the court

Forty chains is swanging, Mardi Gras
For forty bands a nigga daddy die
Automatic, nigga, air you out
I was abandoned, never, never more
Greedy nigga with an attitude
I been rackin' in mechanicals
I've been known to have an attitude
All the shit gon' end in casualties
I be gettin' a lot of fettuccine
I just went and bought a nigga trap
They just wanna see a nigga miserable
Put a dummy on 'em, leave him critical
Take the codeine and left the baby
Everyday a celebration
The struggle got me dedicated
This money got me levitatin'

Fuck around think it's a game
Fuck around, get on that drank
Fuck around with all the fuck arounds
You fuck around, get murked today
Fuck around, get work today
Fuck around with all the fuck arounds
Fuck around, you gone get paid
Fuck around, we goin' crazy

Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no, mi no compadre

Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no compadre
Mi no, mi no compadre
