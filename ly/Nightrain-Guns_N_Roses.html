		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more time tonight (look out)

Well, I'm a west coast struttin'
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase under my arm
Said I'm a mean machine
Been drinkin' gasoline
And honey you can make my motor hum

I got one chance left
In a nine live cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a molotov cocktail with a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
And I can tell you honey
You can make my money tonight

Wake up late, honey put on your clothes
And take your credit card to the liquor store
Well that's one for you and two for me by tonight

I'll be loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more time tonight

I'm on the night train, bottoms up
I'm on the night train, fill my cup
I'm on the night train, ready to crash and burn
I never learn
I'm on the night train, I love that stuff
I'm on the night train, and I can never get enough
I'm on the night train, never to return, no

Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Speedin' like a space brain
One more time tonight

I'm on the night train
And I'm lookin' for some
I'm on the night train
So's I can leave this slum
I'm on the night train
And I'm ready to crash and burn

Night train, bottoms up
I'm on the night train, fill my cup
I'm on the night train
Oh oh oh ohh oh yeah
I'm on the night train
Love that stuff
Ooh I'm on the night train
And I can never get enough
Ridin' the night train
I guess I
I guess, I guess, I guess
I never learn

On the night train
Float me home
Ooh, I'm on the night train
Ridin' the night train
Never to return
Night train
