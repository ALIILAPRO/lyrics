		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah 
I feel you too 
Feel those things you do 
In your eyes I see a fire that burns 
To free the you 
That's running through 
Deep inside you know 
Seeds I plant will grow 
One day you will see 
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah come on come on now take the chance 
That's right let's dance 

Snake 
I am the snake 
Tempting 
That bite you take 
Let me make your mind 
Leave yourself behind 
Be not afraid 
I've got what you need 
Hunger I will feed 

One day you will see 
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance 
Ha ha come dance 
Yeah, come dancing 
One day you will see 
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance 

Yeah I feel you too 
Feel those things you do 
In your eyes I see a fire that burns to free the you 
That's running through 
Deep inside you know 
Seeds I plant will grow 
One day you will see 
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance 
That's right let's dance 
Mm, it's nice to see you here ha ha
