		  (Dy Krazy) Whoa
Rrrt, rrrt, rrah, rrah
Rrrt-rrrt, rrah, rrah
Slatt, slatt, let's go

Your man's a crash, your partner a crash
Your ho gettin' smashed, hell yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'm so ahead of these niggas, no Matilda
Yeah, I know the Maybach extended, yeah, them sticks in there
Yeah, I know these niggas be hating on me, I made it off welfare
Better stop trippin', StickBaby, he flip it, and leave 'em death
At Jeffery's, I spend it, no pinching, check my apparel
I know y'all boys wanna be like me
And she know I beat that pussy like Ali

Yeah, she know, she know
She know (she know), she know (yeah)
Yeah, she know (yeah, she know), she know (she know)
She know (she know), she know

That I'm gonna get racks (yeah)
But I'm coming right back (yeah, yeah)
We make love in the morning time
Pretty shit, she be moaning out (oh)
Let me know if you're slime or not (slatt)
Plenty times I was down and out
Came around with my pockets on knots
'Ventador and I'm dropping the top
I went up, I ain't planning on stopping
The haters gon' hate 'cause they doing they job
Turn it up then I'm breaking the knob
Keep it G, I ain't fuckin' with y'all
I jump right in that water, didn't know how to swim
Fucked around and I turned to a shark
This shit, life, it was made to be hard
I thank God that I beat all the odds
I done told my hitter don't crash
If you do 'em nasty, keep on your mask
Coulda flipped 'em, I gave 'em a pass
Let 'em trip then we doubling back
Look at me, I'm ahead of my class
I live in my bag, I'm showin' my ass
Fully-loaded, it gotta be fast
Hit the gas, get a away from my past, yeah

Your man's a crash, your partner a crash
Your ho gettin' smashed, hell yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'm so ahead of these niggas, no Matilda
Yeah, I know the Maybach extended, yeah, them sticks in there
Yeah, I know these niggas be hating on me, I made it off welfare
Better stop trippin', StickBaby, he flip it, and leave 'em death
At Jeffery's, I spend it, no pinching, check my apparel
I know y'all boys wanna be like me
And she know I beat that pussy like Ali

I'm poppin' my shit, you know what it is
Ain't nothin' but blue hundreds, you know how I do it
In the Hellcat, it came with a shooter
It came equipped, it came with a fully
You holding that gun, but when it go down
Y'all niggas don't even pull it
Ysl so slimy, we set you up, you know we do it
Just know we playin' for keeps
Four pockets full, you better not reach
Hundreds shot emptied
Your block get smoked like guava leaf
Don't know who to trust, they all leach
They the same ones tryna preach to me
Yeah, my daughter so good, she gon' have a milli'
With a Richard Millie
Stop actin' gangster, know you're telling
Girl, stop acting like you love me
When you told me the other day you don't even trust me

Your man's a crash, your partner a crash
Your ho gettin' smashed, hell yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'm so ahead of these niggas, no Matilda
Yeah, I know the Maybach extended, yeah, them sticks in there
Yeah, I know these niggas be hating on me, I made it off welfare
Better sstop trippin', StickBaby, he flip it, and leave 'em death
At Jeffery's, I spend it, no pinching, check my apparel
