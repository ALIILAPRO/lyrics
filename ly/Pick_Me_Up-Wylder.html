		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the hardest things
That set me up
As the cold it leaves
It could pick me up
It could bring me round

And now I don't know
If I can let it be
But now and then
October turns that gold again

No, I remember all that August
I thought I forgot who I was
I was only thinking about you
As if I knew

There were darker days
That lay me low
In a waking dream
I wandered through
that year asleep

So, shake it off
That part of you
The night I slept
In the backseat with your silhouette

I still search for the rest of August
Hiding in that jacket pocket
When it all gets so much colder
I turn it over and over
So, so I might know
I'm on my own

All the hardest things
The echo of
The cold that leaves
Just to pick you up
Just to lay you low

And now, I don't know
That there'll ever be
Some kind of end
Where the leaves all turn and fall again

Rising with the rest of August
I think I forgot who I was
I was only thinking about you
As if I knew
