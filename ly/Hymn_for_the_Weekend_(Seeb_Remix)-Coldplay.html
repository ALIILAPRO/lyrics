		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was hurt, withered, dried up
You came to rain a flood

Oh I-, oh I-, oh I-
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I-, oh I-, oh I-
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (woo)

(Low, low)
(Low, low, low)
(Low, low, low)

Feeling drunk and high
(Low, low)
(Low, low, low) feeling drunk and high
So high
(Low, low, low)

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Oh I-, oh I-, oh I-
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I-, oh I-, oh I-
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (woo)

(Low, low)
(Low, low, low)
(Low, low, low)

Feeling drunk and high
Low, low
(Low, low, low) feeling drunk and high
So high
(Low, low, low)

That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the (that we shoot, yeah)
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
