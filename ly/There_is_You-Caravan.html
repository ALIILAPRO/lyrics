		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a place in my heart
So full of memories and faces
One space I save
Just for you

If we are apart
I search through those memories and places
Each time I start
I find you

I know what I feel
This part of you is so real
Safe in my heart there is you

So special to me
I know that you'll always be 
There in my heart

What more can I say
Each time I start a new day
I'd want to be there with you

So near and so far
So close the energy of senses
Wakes me with thoughts, thoughts of you

Deep down in my soul
Amongst all those memories and places
Stand out from the crowd
There is you
One day I will find
The key controlling my mind
I know that in time
I'd find you

If I could just say
When we come to start a new day
Be nowhere without you

You are in my dreams
No matter how it may seem
There in my heart there is you
