		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweep it all beneath the rug
Doesn't mean the dirt won't come up
There's a fire burnin' up
Only thing stronger than hate is love
We need a change, oh yeah
The song Amazing Grace

Won't be quiet anymore
Not unless they hear us loud and clear
Damage can't be undone
Let's not pretend it disappears
We need a change, oh yeah
The song Amazing Grace

Let's go step by step
And brick by brick
I'll carry the weight
For you
When I'm gone, don't stop
We can stand here all day
We won't move
No, not at all

We won't let the silence drown us out
They'll say a moment's not about
But we won't back out
Hands up, we're 'bout to take this down
It's gonna change, oh yeah
With love and humanity

So step by step
And brick by brick
I'll carry the weight
For you
When I'm gone, don't stop
We can stand here all day
We won't move
No, not at all
We won't move
We won't move
We won't move

We want all the power in your grief
(Can't hold us)
And all the hate you give
(Won't stop us)
We will rise up through the falls
We will make 'em hear it all
We won't stop until they know
(About us)
All the power in your grief
(Can't hold us)
And all the hate you give
(Won't stop us)
We will do it, trouble will do it
Let everybody hold us
We will break through every wall

So step by step
And brick by brick
I'll carry the weight
For you
When I'm gone, don't stop
We gon' stand here all day
We won't move
No, not at all
We won't move
We won't move
We won't move
Yeah
We won't move (we can stand here all day)
We won't move
