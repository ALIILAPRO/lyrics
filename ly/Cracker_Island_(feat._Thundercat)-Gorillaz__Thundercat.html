		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On Cracker Island it was born
To the collective of the dawn
They were planting seeds at night
To grow a made-up paradise
Where the truth was auto-tuned (forever cult)
And it's sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats every day (forever cult)
In the end, I had to pay (what world is this?)
In the end, I had to pay (I purged my soul)
In the end I had to pay (I drank to riot)
Nothing more to say (I drank to riot)

They taught themselves to be occult
They didn't know its many strategies
They taught themselves to be occult
They didn't know its many strategies (fantasies)

What world is this?
What world is this?

On Cracker Island it was raised (hey, hey, hey, hey)
By the collective from the grave (hey, hey, hey, hey)
It only came out at night (hey, hey, hey, hey)
It ate up their paradise (paradise)
Where the truth was auto-tuned (forever cult)
And it's sadness I consumed (forever cult)
Into my formats every day (forever cult)
In the end, I had to pay (what world is this?)
Out there on my silver lake (I was not there)
In the end, it will be great (beneath the hills)
I'm like a ship between the tide (I saw myself)
I held on, I survived (there in the void)

They taught themselves to be occult
They didn't know its many strategies
They taught themselves to be occult
They didn't know its many strategies (fantasy)
(Ooh, ooh)

On Cracker Island it will die (forever cult)
Join the collective in the sky (forever cult)
And on a shining bolt of light (forever cult)
Go up to paradise (what world is this?)
Where the truth is auto-tuned (I purged my soul)
And it's sadness I consume (I drank to riot)
Into my formats every day (I drank to riot)
In the end I had to pay (forever cult)
In the end I'll have to pay (forever cult)
In the end I'll be okay (forever cult)

Nothing more to say (say, say, say, say)
Nothing more to say (say, say, say, say)
Nothing more to say (say, say, say, say)
