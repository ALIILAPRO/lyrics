		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay my head, under the water
Lay my head, under the sea
Excuse me sir, am I your daughter?
Won't you take me back, take me back and see?
There's not a time, for being younger
And all my friends, are enemies
And if I cried unto my mother
No she wasn't there, she wasn't there for me
Don't let the water drag you down (Don't let the water drag you down)
Don't let the water drag you down
Broken lines, across my mirror
Show my face, all red and bruised
And though I screamed and I screamed, well no one came running

No I wasn't saved, I wasn't safe from you
Don't let the water drag you down (Don't let the water drag you down)
Don't let the water drag you down
Don't let me drown, don't let me drown in the waves, oh
I could be found, I could be what you had saved
Saved, saved, saved

Lay my head, under the water
Aloud I pray, for calmer seas
And when I wake from this dream, with chains all around me
No, I've never been, I've never been free
No, I've never been, I've never been free
No, I've never been, I've never been free
