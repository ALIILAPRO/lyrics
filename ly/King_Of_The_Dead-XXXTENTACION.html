Ayy, pick up the pace
Tell 'em why I ain't find no haze
Indeed I am ready, my outfit in vain
The needle in my vein, I'm falling asleep
King of the dead, I sever your head
When shit touch the river my reign will be fed
I touch the sky and bring life to the dead
I watch my demons become Super Saiyan
Oh, I'm not an orphan
Death, is my importance
Rush, without a soul, many will fold
Feeling my bones, I say again
Oh, I'm not an orphan
Death, is my importance
Rush, without a soul, many will fold
Feeling my bones, I say again

Found this sound in Sweden, a while ago
It's like, the more I explore the song, the more
I explore different sounds, period
It's like the more I fall in love with making music
It's nice, actually

I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a God amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies
That I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth
I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
I don't need no fucking help
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
I don't need no fucking help

Found this sound in Sweden
The more I explore, the more I fall in love with the music I make
