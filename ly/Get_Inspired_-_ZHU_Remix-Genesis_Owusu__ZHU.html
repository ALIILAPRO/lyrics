		  Huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Yeah

Clich√©, if it's not making dollars, baby, it's not making sense
How you picky with your art when you can't even pay your rent?
Chipped for years and years and years but seems you haven't made a dent
All that dreaming shit you chasing showed it's face then came and went
Feels like I'm out here scuba diving with an anchor
While my people fighting demons and the cancers
Tryna fix it singing ballads, singing anthems
How I'm so clueless with the last name Ansah?

Shawty, get (get, get, get, get, get)
Shawty, get inspired
How 'bout that? (That, that, that, that, that)
How 'bout that this time?
Shawty, get (get, get, get, get, get)
Shawty, get inspired
How 'bout that? (That, that, that, that, that)
How 'bout that this time?

How he do that?
Can't be sitting gentle in the storm
You gotta move that
I been busy breaking down the walls
I'm getting through that
Girl, this ain't my final curtain call
I bet you knew that
Knew that, knew that, knew that

Trapped (trapped)
How the fuck you figure that?
I can't be laying on my back
(I can't be laying on my, what?)
I hear them knocking on my door
But love ain't living here no more
Holding life, I gotta squeeze
(I gotta mothafucking squeeze)
These lemons got me on my knees
They biting, they some fuckin' fleas
I'm snappin', I ain't saying cheese

(Get, get, get, get, get)
Shawty, get inspired
How 'bout that? (That, that, that, that, that)
How 'bout that this time?
Shawty, get (get, get, get, get, get)
Shawty, get inspired
How 'bout that? (That, that, that, that, that)
How 'bout that this time?

(Get, get, get, get, get)
(That, that, that, that, that)
(Get, get, get, get, get)
(That, that, that, that, that)

I don't see what you see, my baby
I don't mean what you mean, my baby
I don't see what you see, my baby
I don't mean what you mean, my baby, yeah
Mean, my baby, yeah
Mean, my baby, yeah
Mean, my baby, yeah

Shawty, get (get, get, get, get, get)
Shawty, get inspired
How 'bout that? (That, that, that, that, that)
How 'bout that this time?
Shawty, get (get, get, get, get, get)
Shawty, get inspired
How 'bout that? (That, that, that, that, that)
How 'bout that this time?

(Get, get, get, get, get)
(That, that, that, that, that)
(Get, get, get, get, get)
(That, that, that, that, that)
