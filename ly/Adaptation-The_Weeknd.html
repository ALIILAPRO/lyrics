		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the sun goes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us

The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
It's just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace

I could've stayed
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway, uh

Adapted to these models
Whose adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in love and war, she's pure

So pure
Like the love that's so uncut and raw and clean
So clean
As opposed to what I offered 'cause I chose a lie
I chose the lie
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I've let it go
For a little fun, oh-ooh

I've made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

Ooh (waiting for tomorrow)
Oh, oh, oh (it's just another day)
Oh, oh (God bid yesterday)
Ooh, oh baby (goodbye)

She might just be the one
She might just be the one (oh baby)
She might just be the one (might just be the one)
Might just be the one
She might just be the one (ooh)

The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
It's just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye
