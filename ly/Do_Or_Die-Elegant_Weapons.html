		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kill to thrill intoxication
Out of control
Fight or flight euphoria
Wrecking the soul

Heels up palpitation
Scarred for life blown apart
Immaculate sedation
Shot up right into the heart

Fearing the worst
It's everything you need
Adrenaline burst
Dependence guaranteed

Do Or Die
Show no weakness
Don't live a lie
Bridges crossed and not burned
Do or die
On your own terms
Taking it all
Do or die

Rattling in concentration
Sharpening till dulled
Burning light asphyxiation
Taking it's toll
Scraping by with consolations
Of the highs and lows
Orchestrated for the set-up
Bang and on we go

Detonation's a blast
Loaded front to back
Stimulation won't last
Descending through the cracks

All for one
One for them all
Do or die
Takeâ€™em by storm
Stand or fall
Do or die

Say a prayer
Don't hold it back
It's no twist of fate
Resistance to the distancing
Sell it to them straight

Lying is the child of fear
It's going to come to blows
All is fair in love and war

Detonation's a blast
Loaded front to back
Stimulation won't last
Descending through the cracks
