		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah
This is the new anthem for bad bitches
Yuh!
Let these bitches know I'm stepping in a new era
It's a mindset
She a goal getter
Hating never made a bag
Honey do better
Over it like whatever
Stepping in a new new new
Let these bitches know I'm stepping in a new era
It's a mine-set
She a gold getter
Hating never made a bag
Honey do better
Over it like whatever
Stepping in a new new new

Tell 'em all that the price just went up
(What?)
(What did she just say?)
I said the price just went up
New city, new phone, new everything
New purse just to let 'em know what bag I'm in
Cause I'm talkin' hustle Im talking Goyard
Yuh
They talk gossip and politics I want no part
None
Speak to my management speak to Megatronic
And when you speak on me
Put some mashAllah on it
What you see is the tip of the iceberg
Tryna stack my money high as the tip of Dubai Burj
When I say it's done it is
A woman of my word
Imma keep it real with you
Just know that it might hurt

Let these bitches know I'm stepping in a new era
It's a mindset
She a goal getter
Hating never made a bag
Honey do better
Over it like whatever
Stepping in a new new new
Let these bitches know I'm stepping in a new era
It's a mine-set
She a gold getter
Hating never made a bag
Honey do better
Over it like whatever
Stepping in a new new new

Claim self made when it take a village, just give it up
Call it cocky, it's confidence
Give a damn if they don't show love
Just don't call me when I'm at the top
Fumble me that's just his loss
Think I'm crying here in the club without you
We both know that I'm not
Y'all be doing too much just stop
It's my season, all year hot
Like to tease him with some uh
Then make him roll me a blunt
This time I'm calling the shots
This time I get what I want
This time in my way is going down
I give a fuck

Let these bitches know I'm stepping in a new era
It's a mindset
She a goal getter
Hating never made a bag
Honey do better
Over it like whatever
Stepping in a new new new
Let these bitches know I'm stepping in a new era
It's a mine-set
She a gold getter
Hating never made a bag
Honey do better
Over it like whatever
Stepping in a new new new
Said I'm
Steppin' in a new new new
Steppin' steppin' steppin'
In a new new new
Uh
Like new new
