		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shouldn't you be sad right now?
Said you never liked big crowds
Acting like you like them now
Without me
'Cause you're with your friends, all proud
At some shitty bar downtown
Do you taste me on her mouth
Or just whiskey?

Hooking up instead of healing
Wanna know just what you're feeling now
What are you feeling now?

I want you to drunk text me
Saying you still need me
Tell me I'm not like her
I made you happier
I want you to drunk text me
Just empty it all out, please
Tell me you fucked this up
Tell me you're still in love with me

Wondering if you regret
All the shit you never said
That you slept with her instead
Like we never mattered
Or do you even care at all
After all the pain you caused?
Do you know that I'd still pick the phone up
If you called?

I want you to drunk text me
Saying that you're sorry
Tell me you fucked this up
Tell me you're still in love
I want you to drunk text me
Saying you still need me
Tell me I'm not like her
I made you happier

'Cause I'm no closer to closure
Wish you weren't sober
We're over, but I'm not over it

I wish you would drunk text me
Just empty it all out, please
Tell me you fucked this up
Tell me you're still in love with me

I hate that I still want you
I don't want to, but I want you
Look what you've done to me
I hate that I still miss you
I don't want to, but I love you

So why don't you drunk text me?
Saying you still need me
Tell me I'm not like her
I made you happier ('cause I'm no closer to closure)
Tell me you fucked this up (wish you weren't sober)
Tell me you're still in love (we're over, but I'm not over it)
'Cause I'm not over it

I wish you would drunk text me
Just empty it all out, please
Tell me you fucked this up
'Cause I think I'm still in love
