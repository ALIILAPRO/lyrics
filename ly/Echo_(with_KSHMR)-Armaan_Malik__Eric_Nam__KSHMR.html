		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Worlds apart
You're standing in front of me
But you're so far
It's getting hard (yeah)
To think of the reasons
We stay in the dark

Would it be for the better
If we both just surrender
And let it go? (Let it go)
Being with each other is breaking our hearts

Tell me what we're fighting for
And is it really worth the battles?
We've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo echo
I hurt you then you hold me close
We get off on the highs and lows
We've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo echo

Like an echo echo, echo echo
Echo echo, echo echo

Some twisted game
I want you so bad
Yet I push you away
Repeat mistakes
At some point we thought
Love would conquer the pain

Your eyes, they look like heaven
We use love as a weapon
We're insane
Tearing each other apart every day

So tell me what we're fighting for
And is it really worth the battles?
We've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo echo
I hurt you then you hold me close
We get off on the highs and lows
Yeah, we've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo echo

Like an echo echo, echo echo
(We've been going back and forth)
Like an echo echo, echo echo

Tell me what we're fighting for
And is it really worth the battles?
We've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo echo
I hurt you then you hold me close
We get off on the highs and lows
Yeah, we've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo echo

Is it really worth the battles?
Echo echo, echo echo
Is it really worth the battles?
Echo echo, echo echo
