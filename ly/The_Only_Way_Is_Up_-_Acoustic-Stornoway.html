		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been broken down
The lowest rung
And being on the bottom line
Sure ain't no fun
But if we should be evicted from our homes
We'll just move somewhere else
And still carry on

(If we hold on) hold on 
(Hold on), hold on, hmm
(If we hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) won't be long now

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now

Now we may not known
Where our next meal is coming from
But with you by my side
I'll face what is to come
Girl, I wanna thank you
For loving me this way
Things may be a little hard now
But we'll find a brighter day

(If we hold on) hold on 
(Hold on), hold on, hmm
(If we hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) won't be long now

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now

(If we hold on) hold on 
(Hold on), hold on, hmm
(If we hold on) hold on 
(Hold on) won't be long now

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
