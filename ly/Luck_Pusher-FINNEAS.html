		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On again, off again
That's the way it's always been for you and me
Fall in love, fall apart
Draw the circle 'til you start to see

You don't make it easy for me to stay or try to leave
I don't take it easy, I don't walk away if it's killing me
If you're bad odds I'm a luck pusher

Better off, later on when the rain has come and gone, and we've run dry
We can both find our own place to live and love and loan and die

You don't make it easy for me to stay or try to leave
I don't take it easy, I don't walk away if it's killing me
If you're bad odds I'm a luck pusher
If you're a stray dog, I can be the butcher
If you're a lost cause, I'm an overlooker
If you're bad odds I'm a luck pusher
