		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ye this is my shit
My style
My Phonk
My Wave
Focus on myself pussy
You are in the sidelane
Fuck up his head
Pussy this is no migraine
Break his whole head
When a bitch says Im biting
Don't give a fuck now my blade start the splicing
Bash out his brain hope the bitch want the fighting
She like the way that my wrist got the icing
Bad lil bitch on my dick and we ridin
Fuck off bitch
Why you acting like a thot?
Cut out his body parts and make his body rot
Bow down on your knees and respect me like a god
Why you act like you are me?
You are something you're not
Boy I'm fucked up in the booth
I will voice a broken youth
Bad bitch she want it too
Hollow tips they flying through
(Bad bitch she want it too
Hollow tips they flying through)
Ye this is my shit
My style
My Phonk
My Wave
Focus on myself pussy
You are in the sidelane
Fuck up his head
Pussy this is no migraine
Break his whole head
When a bitch says Im biting
Don't give a fuck now my blade start the splicing
Bash out his brain hope the bitch want the fighting
She like the way that my wrist got the icing
Bad lil bitch on my dick and we ridin
