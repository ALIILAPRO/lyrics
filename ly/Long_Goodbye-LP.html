		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three four
Hey baby
I worry 'bout you all the time
I know we didn't hold the light
But you are always on my mind

Yeah baby
They'll tell you it'll be alright
They'll tell you it'll all be fine
But we've done all those lonesome lines

Drag this on, it can't be wrong
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Let's relive the lie
It doesn't have to be over
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Save me for a while
It doesn't have to be over

I keep chasing
I know I'm just a dream away
I wish I found the words to say
Before our moment slipped away
Seems crazy
But looking back at all the pain
I'd bottle every drop of rain
To be the way we were again

Drag this on it can't be wrong
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Let's relive the lie
It doesn't have to be over
Stay
Say the long goodbye
Save me for a while
I don't want it to be over

Kiss a little longer
Catch a little fire
Nothing is forever
I don't believe in time

Stay, oh
Say the long goodbye
Let's relive the lie
It doesn't have to be over
Stay, oh
Say the long goodbye
Save me for a while
I don't want it to be over

Drag this on, it can't be wrong
Drag this on and on and on
