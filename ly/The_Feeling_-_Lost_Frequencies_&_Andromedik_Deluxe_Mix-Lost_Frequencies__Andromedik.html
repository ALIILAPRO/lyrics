		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're dancing, baby, under open skies
My heart is crazy, it tells me you're the one
I should run
And the feeling goes on

Yeah, we fly into the night and fight the break of dawn
We're sipping on our highs, tomorrow we are gone
I should run
And the feeling goes on

And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
Come away tonight, only you and I
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
Come away tonight, only you and I
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes

I hold on to let go
Lost all of my control
Drunk kicks and drunk feelings
I hate that we're leaving
The way my heart's beating
I'm loving this freedom
This freedom

Yeah, we fly into the night and fight the break of dawn
We're sipping on our highs, tomorrow we are gone
I should run
And the feeling goes on

And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
Come away tonight, only you and I
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
Come away tonight, only you and I
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes

(And the feeling goes on)
(And the feeling goes)
(And the feeling goes on)

And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
Come away tonight, only you and I
And the feeling goes on, and on, and on
And the feeling goes
