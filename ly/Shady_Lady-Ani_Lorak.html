		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been my superstar
But it's not what you are
You've been my superhero
Since I've lived in your shade
Every step that I made
Brought me nothing but zero

But I'm stayin' alive
Now I'm changin' my life
With a burning desire
No one knows who I am
But I don't give a damn
Gonna set you on fire

Shady Lady, I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady, I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now

Just take a look at me
Deep inside and you'll see
All I kept under cover
There is one thing I bet
You're about to regret
I'm no longer your lover

I've just turned one more page
I belong to the stage
Baby, don't call me baby

Shady Lady, I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady, I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now

I wanna light you up and leave you alone
I am a brand new star that you've never known
Shady Lady
Are you ready?

Shady Lady, I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady, I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now
