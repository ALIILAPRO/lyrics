		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome little child to the darkest fears inside
Come and join the fun, take a journey through the night
Watch the closet doors, or else the night consumes you more
Taking every piece of innocence that never sees the light, so

Grab your only ammunition, your common sense and torch
The corridors are filled with fright, when something's on the porch
How long will you last, through these memories of the past?
Since without a light to shine the only soul that's left is yours

Forced down to reckoning
Your dreams become the sickening
You thought you were alone
No they bite you to the bone, you shout

Break, break, break my mind
Break it till the tale unwinds
Force my thoughts through hell and back
Or leave me alone tonight

Break, break, break my heart
Break me till I fall apart
This can't be real, this can't be right
Now die inside the flames of your fright

You thought your safest place to breathe was right inside your room
But once the clock begins to chime your fate will lead to doom
You're looking left and right, through the doors you shut so tight
But as long as you're away they open up to scare you soon, so

Keep an eye on all your toys, 'cause some don't look the same
Your chance to act is short enough, to turn your mind insane
The Plushtrap gets impatient, from the overwhelmed sensation
So be sure to keep him on the chair or time will surely drain

Forced down to reckoning
Your dreams become the sickening
You thought you were alone
No they bite you to the bone, you shout

Break, break, break my mind
Break it till the tale unwinds
Force my thoughts through hell and back
Or leave me alone tonight

Break, break, break my heart
Break me till I fall apart
This can't be real, this can't be right
Now die inside the flames of your fright

Hey kid, why do you moan?
We can't help but notice that you're home alone
Your parents clearly trust you to be away without a phone call
That's not all, your flashlight is limited
That can't be helpful to keep you prohibited
Don't be scared, it's not like we care
Your nightmare is all that we wanted prepared
On the bed, just don't be mislead
Those toys were just meant to like you to be bled
The closet, whoops, I wouldn't run over
'Cause Foxy's inside, and he seems out of order
Oh and look, your know these guys
Chica and Bonnie don't look so alive
The cupcake is torn, your death was reborn
Can you survive till the crack of dawn

Watch your back, take a turn to the left and the right
There's no end in sight, your darkest of nights, they burn you inside, begin night five
Watch your back check the halls for your chance to survive
The shadows enraged, your mind's getting phased, your life is no longer safe

I am all alone, I'm surrounded by the fears
Haunted with shackles now they sent me straight to tears
I'm not allowed to cry, 'cause they told me I would die
Oh no, they're getting near
Help me (ha-ha-ha)

Break, break, break my mind
Break it till the tale unwinds
Force my thoughts through hell and back
Or leave me alone tonight

Break, break, break my heart
Break me till I fall apart
This can't be real, this can't be right
Now die inside the flames of your fright

Watch your back, take a turn to the left and right
(Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Watch your back, try your best to survive the night
(Nowhere to run, try and survive the night)

They're here!
