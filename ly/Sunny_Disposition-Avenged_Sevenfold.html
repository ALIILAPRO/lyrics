		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been through hell. Sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds. Viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear when so inclined
Bought peace through wars that doomed our children to die

Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls

I'd make a decision if granted the privilege
But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize

You own the burg. We sleep in streets
You dine then waste. We forage to eat
Well who pays the tab when you cross the line?
Who writes the check? Who's herding the swine?

Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced

How can we see the outside of the pen when survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous find in an illusion

(Vlader Lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum
While fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast
Not one bite he could eat
Somebody cut off his head!)

Dear radiation my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous time I will find in an illusion
It's an illusion
