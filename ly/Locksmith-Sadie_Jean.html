		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the last song I'll write about you
I need to move on, I think you do too
You were all that I wanted
You know that you still are
'Cause I've been alright, yeah, but you showed me better
I know that we're changing
But nothing feels different
I'm breaking the silence to say

If in ten years time
I'm still on your mind
Would you call and
Say you want this?
No matter where we are
You still have my heart
'Cause I locked it
And I promise
You're the locksmith

We said forever and said it too soon (said it too soon)
At least now I know, nobody feels like you do (nobody feels like you do)
You were all that I wanted
You know that you still are
I'm breaking the silence to say

If in ten years time
I'm still on your mind
Would you call and
Say you want this?
No matter where we are
You still have my heart
'Cause I locked it
And I promise
You're the locksmith

You're the one that I can see me growing old with
Build a house, I see it now, you plant me roses
And everything we dreamed about came into focus
Here's to hopin'

If in ten years time
I'm still on your mind
Could you call and
Say you want this?
No matter where we are
You still have my heart
'Cause I locked it
And I promise
You're the locksmith
