		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I recall the summer skies
I'd stay up late and I'd fantasize about
Your deep stare in sunkissed eyes
It was paradise

Oh, I'm, crossing my fingers
I, hope that you notice me
They always said that I wouldn't
Amount to a thing
I can't remember my phone number or see
Oh, I see

Maybe I should ask you out
But I know that you wouldn't
I really love you but I
Know that I shouldn't, pick up my phone
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
(Woah oh, I'm a fool but you love it)

I still can't believe that I got so lucky
You cared for me, oh
You impress effortlessly
I stop and think why did you pick me

I'm, crossing my fingers
I, hope that you notice me
They always said that I wouldn't
Amount to a thing
I can't remember my phone number or see
Oh, I see

Maybe I should ask you out
But I know that you wouldn't
I really love you but I
Know that I shouldn't, pick up my phone
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
(Woah oh, I'm a fool but you love it)

Hah, yeah i wish I could ask you out
But I know that you wouldn't
I really love you

Maybe I should ask you out
But I know that you wouldn't
I really love you but I
Know that I shouldn't, pick up my phone
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
(Woah oh, I'm a fool but you love it)

Maybe I should ask you out
But I know that you wouldn't
I really love you but I
Know that I shouldn't, pick up my phone
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it, oh woah

Maybe I should ask you out
But I know that you wouldn't
I really love you but I
Know that I shouldn't, pick up my phone
I'm a fool but you love it, oh woah
I'm a fool and you love it
