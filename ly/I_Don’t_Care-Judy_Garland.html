		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say I'm crazy 
Got no sense 
But I don't care 
They may or may not mean offense 
But I don't care 
You see, I'm sort of independent 
I am my own superintendent 
And my star is on the ascendant 
That's why I don't care 

I don't care, I don't care 
What they may think of me 
I'm happy-go-lucky, they say that I'm plucky 
Contented and carefree 
I don't care I don't care 
If I do get a mean and stony stare 
If I'm not successful 
It won't be distressful 
Cause I don't care 

A girl should know her etiquette 
Alas, alack 
Propriety demands we walk a narrow track 
When fellas used to blink at me 
I'd freeze 'em and they'd shrink at me 
But now when fellas wink at me 
I wink at them right back! 

I don't care I don't care 
If people frown on me 
Perhaps it's the lone way 
But I go my own way 
That's my philosophy 
I don't care I don't care 
If he's clerk or just a millionaire 
There's no doubt about it, 
I'll sing and I'll shout it 
Cause I don't care 

Oh, I don't care, I don't care 
When it comes to happiness, 
I want my share 
Don't try to rearrange me 
There's nothing can change me 
'cause I don't care!
