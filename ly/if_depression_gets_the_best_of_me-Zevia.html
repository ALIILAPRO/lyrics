		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty, and numb
Still can't get past all the sadness, and the crumbs I left
Help me I'm scared
'Cause the one thing on my mind
Is for me to disappear

So mama when I die
Please hold in your cry
Just know that when I'm gone
I'll always be right by your side
And lover when I leave
I know that we don't speak
I'm sorry that I failed you
But you meant the world to me

I lost my sight
I still can't see all the places
Where there might be light
I used to stare
At the mirror, now I don't
'Cause when I do I see a ghost
It's not my fault that you feel like, I'm so self centered
I'm tryna be better
But I feel under the weather

So mama when I die
Please hold in your cry
Just know that when I'm gone
I'll always be right by your side
And lover when I leave
I know that we don't speak
I'm sorry that I failed you
You deserve better than me

So mama when I die
Please hold in your cry
Just know that when I'm gone
I'll always be right by your side
And lover when I leave
I know that we don't speak
I'm sorry that I failed you
You deserve better than me
