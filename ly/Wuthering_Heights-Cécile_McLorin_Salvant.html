		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heathcliff, it's me, I am Cathy
I have come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

Bad dreams in the night
Told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my Wuthering, Wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window
