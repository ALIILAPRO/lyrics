		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

She'll make you take your clothes off 
and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain (come on!)

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (come on!)
livin' la vida loca (come on!)
She's livin la vida loca

Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill

She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (alright!)

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (come on!)
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin la vida loca

She'll make you take your clothes off
and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain (come on!)

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (come on!)

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (come on!)
Livin' la vida loca (come on!)
She's livin' la vida loca

Come on!
Gotta, la vida loca
Gotta, gotta, gotta La vida loca
Gotta, gotta, gotta la vi-
