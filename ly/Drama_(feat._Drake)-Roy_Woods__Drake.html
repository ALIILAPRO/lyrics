		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends, yeah

No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
Tumblr dreamin' ridin' in a Benz
You don't smoke but it's cool while you're friends
Silver City with your girls on the weekend
Seventeen, nights stay out past ten
House party ting turn up with your mans
Arguments all day with your 'rents
Just to go out, gotta fight for this shit
Gotta realize you're a high school girl
Don't matter how you put it, used to fuck niggas
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah, yeah

But they still trust you
They still fuck with you
Anything you do, anything you do
Everything's for you
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose
Take that L, you lose

No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends, yeah

Every lost girl I know is over twenty-six
Every lost girl I know is just too afraid to admit it
You give your body to me, I'll body that like a savage
Give and take, you give it to 'em, they take that shit for granted, yeah
Different than it was before
People 'round you want it more
B-F-F, oh yeah, for sure
Wonder what they in it for
Take your last relationship
Look how good you treated him
You could birth like four of him
Girl, you never needed him
But they still need you
They still fuck with you
Anything you do, anything you do
Everything's for you
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose

Girl, that's not me
Oh, girl that's not me
Oh, girl that's not me (drama is for you, take that L, you lose)
Girl that's not me (drama is for you, take that L, you lose)
Girl that's not me (drama is for you, take that L, you lose)
Oh, girl that's not me (drama is for you, take that L, you lose)
Oh, girl that's not me (drama is for you, take that L, you lose)

No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends, yeah

No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
No, no, need to pretend, no, no need to pretend
Drama is for you, take that L you lose
Drama is
Drama is
Drama is for you, take that L you lose, take that L, you lose
No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
