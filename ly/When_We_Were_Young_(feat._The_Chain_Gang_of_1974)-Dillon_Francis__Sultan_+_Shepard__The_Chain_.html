		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know your hopes and dreams they will collide,
Take all your things you'll go and run and hide,
Do you remember how it felt when we were young,
Do you remember how it felt when we were young.

Today we have the chance to feel again
To hear the sounds that brought us in
To laugh, to cry, to live again.

Today we have the chance to feel again
To hear the sounds that brought us in
To laugh, to cry, to live again
Like when we were young.

Like when were young
Like when were young

I know your hopes and dreams they will collide,
Take all your things you'll go and run and hide,
Do you remember how it felt when we were young,
Do you remember how it felt when we were young.

Today we have the chance to feel again,
To hear the sounds that brought us in,
To laugh, to cry, to live again.

Today we have the chance to feel again,
To hear the sounds that brought us in,
To laugh, to cry, to live again,
Like when were young.

Were young, were young, were young, were young
Were young, were young, were young, were young
Were young, were young, were young, were young
Were young, like when we were young

Like when were young
Like when were young
Like when were young
Like when were young
