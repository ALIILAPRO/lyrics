		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I like them late nights on the road
I like when you lose control
Lowkey the only love you show
Let me be clear
I accept you anyway you know
Everyday you moving the post
I might have to let you go
Let me be clear
Yeah I like them late nights on the road
I like when you lose control
Lowkey the only love you show
Let me be clear
I accept you anyway you know
Everyday you moving the post
I might have to let you go
Let me be clear

Late nights are my stompin' grounds
Worlds asleep ain't nothing around
Dark as hell still fuckin' out
Yeah we up what the fuss about
Night crawler we bring him out
Lullabye that we singin' now
It's a horror movie stay in ya house
She lost control on the whole team
Drunk as hell made a whole scene
No patience for a dope fiend
Only love that she showed me
Was being jealous of these hoes screamin'
At the top of her lungs
When it all erupts
Wont engage her on nun
Drank all in my cup
Everything went blank when we got stuck
So hungover partied all night
But tonight was only day 1
I aint even rockin my chains
Giving no signs a nigga got funds
Came with all her friends for protection just to leave the party with us aw yeah

Yeah I like them late nights on the road
I like when you lose control
Lowkey the only love you show
Let me be clear
I accept you anyway you know
Everyday you moving the post
I might have to let you go
Let me be clear
Yeah I like them late nights on the road
I like when you lose control
Lowkey the only love you show
Let me be clear
I accept you anyway you know
Everyday you moving the post
I might have to let you go
Let me be clear

I can be clear but I can be vague too
Turn this dark house to a shaderoom
Do everything that you can't do
I'll make everyone hate you
You get toxic I get toxic
Leavin' you I can't do
Hypnotic she hypnotic
Clear the tension with grey goose
Some bout her she a rough rider
What i'm driving on autopilot
Tesla vets can afford the finest
Made a mess of my ford I find it
Hard to invest in a stock ain't climbin'
Gave you all the best never gave you nothin' less
Why you turnin' up better give me some respect yeah yeah
Might let you go what you offer me but drama aye
Can't build a team just blow it up like osama aye
Can't catch the heat comin' from a cunt wit no commas aye
You respectfully was just head to me and now you dead to me

Yeah I like them late nights on the road
I like when you lose control
Lowkey the only love you show
Let me be clear
I accept you anyway you know
Everyday you moving the post
I might have to let you go
Let me be clear
Yeah I like them late nights on the road
I like when you lose control
Lowkey the only love you show
Let me be clear
I accept you anyway you know
Everyday you moving the post
I might have to let you go
Let me be clear
