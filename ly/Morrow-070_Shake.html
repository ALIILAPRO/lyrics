		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An early mornin'
No clouds up in the sky
She's paranoid
But still she don't know why, yeah
But still she don't know why, yeah
This fire, yeah
I know it burns inside
It's your decision
But still you make it mine, ayy
It makes it easier for ya, ayy

I know it's hard to swallow
I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow (yeah)
'Morrow (yeah, yeah), Tomorrow (yeah)
'Morrow (yeah, yeah), Tomorrow

Ah, did you not get the message?
Said I'm done callin' and textin'
Don't be so passive-aggressive
You're gonna pass that aggression
We in business, I've been invested
I did not come to impress ya
You're gonna know 'cause it's destined
You feel it in your intestine (yeah)

I know it's hard to swallow
I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow (yeah)
'Morrow (yeah, yeah), tomorrow (yeah)
'Morrow (yeah, yeah), tomorrow

You can't scream louder (no, no, no)
No one's around you (no, no, no)
Heart filled with malice (oh, oh, oh)
And that's how you'll have it (oh, oh, oh)
I'm still so proud of you (no, no)
Don't turn your back on me (oh, no)
We'll find our balance (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I, only I can control, need to find, to decide
Why I'm alive, in the burn and the glow
'Til I learn how to flow with the highs and the lows
(With the highs and the lows) Comes and goes 
(Yeah go) ay

I know it's hard to swallow
I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow (yeah)
'Morrow (yeah, yeah), Tomorrow (yeah)
'Morrow (yeah, yeah), Tomorrow

I'm fuckin' around
Oh yeah
I'm fuckin' around
Oh yeah
Yeah
