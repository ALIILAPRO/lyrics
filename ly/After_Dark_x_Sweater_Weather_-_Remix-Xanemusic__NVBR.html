		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

The night will hold us close (whoa)
And the stars will guide us home (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone (whoa, whoa)
I turn to ask the question
So anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

'Cause it's too
As the hours pass (cold)
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone (and now so let me)
How it feels to rest (hold)
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know (it's too)
As the hours pass (cold)
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone (and now let me)
How it feels to rest (hold)
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know (cause it's too)
As the hours pass (cold)
I will let you know (for you)
That I need to ask (here)
Before I'm alone (and now so let me)
How it feels to rest (hold)
On your patient lips (both your)
To eternal bliss (hands in)
I'm so glad to know (the holes of my sweater, it's too)
As the hours pass (cold)
I will let you know (for you)
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone (and now let me)
How it feels to rest (hold)
On your patient lips (both your)
To eternal bliss (hands in)
I'm so glad to know (the holes of my sweater)

And it's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater
