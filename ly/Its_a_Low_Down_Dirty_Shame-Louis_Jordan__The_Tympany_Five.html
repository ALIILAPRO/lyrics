		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a low down dirty, low down dirty shame
It's a low down dirty, low down dirty shame
I'm in love with a married woman, I just can't call her name

She's a no good woman, don't mean no man no good
She's a no good woman, don't mean no man no good
I don't blame that woman, I'd do the same thing if I could

She's a no good woman, don't mean no man no good
No good woman, don't mean no man no good
I don't blame that woman, I'd do the same thing if I could

Baby, baby that's alright for you
Baby, baby that's alright for you
Oh, that's alright baby, in old way you do
