		<p>
		  Man don't live off of the hype huh
Real ting eh

Yeah
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick
I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need some addressing
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my little homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses he been blackin'
Chasing women a distraction
They want be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gottao die out eventually
I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is so separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost my 50 at Tiffany's
Shoutout to Tiffany's Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I done in my life
I had to count it then count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
VIEWS already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
A gram, two poppin' to fuck
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You tried to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearing it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They got to go, they got to go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'mma have b's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this, no one a threat to me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I done in my life
I had to count it then count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
