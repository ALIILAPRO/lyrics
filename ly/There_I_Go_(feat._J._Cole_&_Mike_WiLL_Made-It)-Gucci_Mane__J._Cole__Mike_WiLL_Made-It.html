Mike WiLL Made-It, Mike WiLL Made-It
Mike WiLL Made-It, Mike WiLL Made-It
Mike WiLL Made-It, Mike WiLL Made-It
Mike WiLL Made-It, Mike WiLL Made-It
Mike WiLL Made-It, Gucci Mane slayed it (it's Gucci)
Cole walkin' out with M's, the promoter paid it (wow)
The promoter paid it (well damn)
Yeah, uh

Real nigga, I don't say that a lot
You can tell how I talk and the way that I rock
I'm a straight shooter, no sugarcoat
No booger sugar, never had a nose full of dope
It's all good folks, cope how you wanna cope
Drink what you wanna drink, smoke what you wanna smoke
Stroke who you wanna stroke
Just as long she down, if she not, fuck it, then run along, boy
It's too many fish to be pressed about a bitch
I'm stackin' too many chips, could care less about a fit
I'm in some dirty-ass kicks watchin' YouTube
I'm cuttin' grass in designer like it's FUBU
I got a real thick gal, wanna sit on my lap
No BBL, you can tell she just built like that
You ever walk up to a spot knowin' every bitch'll pop?
It's not a whole lot of niggas that done felt like that, but

There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go)
There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go)
Yeah, it's me, with the inside-out tee
Lowkey, only show up for a large fee
There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go)
There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go)
Yeah, that's him, paid an arm and a limb for him
'Cause they know the hoes jump out the gym for him (go)

Gucci Mane and J. Cole, the collaboration
They poked the bear and woke the bear up out of hibernation
These boys exaggeratin', do a lot of fabrication (liar)
But ain't no gimmicks in my gang, this shit ain't animations (liar)
Now Mike WiLL Made-It (Mike) and Gucci Mane slayed it (wow)
Think I'm the dopest rapper ever, niggas overrated (well damn)
The paint got laminated, the top decapitated (wow)
He had a buzz, but it went dry, that shit evaporated (huh?)
Big ups to Fayetteville, shout out McCaysville
I keep it trill, they go from Thomasville to Summerhill (for real)
In my Bugatti, but I used to have a Bonneville
I'm goin' Scotty, I'm talkin' switch my mood by Puffy crib (wow)
Screamin', "Yes sir" (yes sir) matching stretched furs (fur)
My diamonds go, "Brr" (brr), yeah, it's a cold world (it's cold)
I told my niggas slow motion was the best motion (slow)
And money turn these bitches on, that shit like love potion (whoa)

There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go)
There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go, yeah)
Yeah, it's me, with the inside-out tee
Lowkey, only show up for a large fee
There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go)
There I go (there he go), there I go (there he go)
Yeah, that's him, paid an arm and a limb for him
'Cause they know the hoes jump out the gym for him

Hoes jump out the gym for him (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Mike WiLL Made-It, Mike WiLL Made-It (hoes jump out the gym for him)
Mike WiLL Made-It, Mike WiLL Made-It
Mike WiLL Made-It, Mike WiLL Made-It
