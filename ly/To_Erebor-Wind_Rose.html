		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear from afar the mountain's call
Cries an era lost in fire
For the long forgotten hoard
Quenched the dwarves' desire

Baruk Khazad
Sigin-tarag
Gimil Khazad
Khaz√¢d ai-menu

Once from the golden halls
The mighty rumble of the hammers
Echoed deep within the earth
For the forgotten hoard
And for the solitary mountain
We're declaring our return

Dwarves of yore (the time has come)
Hammers high (straight to war)
Hear my words
We are returning
Claim the throne (erebor)
Break the curse (the mountain calls)
Trust my will
We are returning home

A raven in the storm,
A harbinger of rising cold
A tremor in your blood
That awakens you in the night
When the lights are gone, the axes fall
A king is to return
Now the time has come, into middle-earth we ride
For the crown, seven stars ablaze over the night
When the lights are gone, the axes fall
A king is to return

Dwarves of yore (sigin-tarag)
Hammers high (to your will)
Keep the stride
We are returning home
Open eyes...Shield the thief (side by side)
Our reward?(The arkenstone) what we live for

To the burrow of the beast
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
We have sworn to erase
Hammers fell like ringing bells
Recall the glory of the dwarves
From the hollow halls

Hear (far away)
From afar the mountain's call
Cries an era lost in fire
For the long forgotten hoard
Quenched the dwarves' desire

Over the hills
There's a terror awakened
We will stand in our father's halls
As the prophecy told
