		  How long did take it take to fall in love with me
Take me how i'm coming is a luxury
Looking at my back with some cutlery
I don't know if i can ever get enough a green
I see the truth it's in my face
We really picked up moved no trace
It ain't no shot if i don't chase
Can't see you here across the states
I'm in my tent looking at stars that i wish i was around
I left my tank on e but bitch i made it out of that town
Before i started flying they was cool with me on the ground
And i wish someone that i love told me one time they was proud
I been down bad i remember days i was penny pinching
Looking for way from my pain i was just sitting there wishing
Niggas trynna eat off my plate won't even do the dishes
See a lot of people talking at the end of the day it's just bitching but its cool though
When you're at these heights that's how you see your true lows
Now i roll a l real quick anytime i got stress to blow
So high in the heavens cooling with a god damn celestial
Yeah she was pretty but if she with me she aint never seen a pedestal
How long did take it take to fall in love with me
Take me how i'm coming is a luxury
Looking at my back with some cutlery
I don't know if i can ever get enough a green
