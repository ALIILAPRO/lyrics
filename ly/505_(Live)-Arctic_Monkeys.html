		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darlin'
What did you expect?
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Or frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, seem like a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Alright

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile (whoa)
