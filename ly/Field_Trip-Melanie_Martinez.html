		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I'm not one to take orders from ya
I'll drop another clue for you peek a boo, now do you get it
You always wonder why I just say "forget it"
'Cause talking to a brick wall gives me headaches, headaches

Spread your lies while I stretch
Spread my legs and do the splits
Yell at me on your screen
While I stand up to your being
You're not real, just like me
We were never our bodies
We're just dust, energy
Hot like melting icy cream

Tryna bring the mystical into the material
Bitch, I'm an eleven life path, I'm ethereal
I'm the definition of dichotomy, duality
Katarina in the womb for nine months, 'til she birthed me
Look at her she's a bridge and on her bridge, I'll take a shit
Fuck it up you get lit let's get deep if not I'll dip
I'll be riding solo on my field trip
Ooh, ooh, oh oh
Ooh, ooh, oh oh

I'm never gonna be what you had envisioned
You said "Blanquitas" feel more Latina than you, "Ahora lo entiendes"
You always say you're woke, it's your aesthetic
But is your empathy actually authentic, is it?

I am shy but I do speak only when I truly need
To say some shit that hopefully
Will reach the ears it's supposed to be
I try my best to show them me, my rising sign is all they see
Scorpio bitch with a sharp ass sting
I gotta Taurus Sun, Moon, Mercury

Tryna bring the mystical into the material
Bitch, I'm an eleven life path, I'm ethereal
I'm the definition of dichotomy, duality
Katarina in the womb for nine months, 'til she birthed me
Look at her she's a bridge and on her bridge, I'll take a shit
Fuck it up you get lit let's get deep if not I'll dip
I'll be riding solo on my field trip
Ooh, ooh, oh oh
Ooh, ooh, oh oh
