		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't let you hold me back, oh no
I can't let you hold me back no more
I can't let you hold me back, oh no
I can't let you hold me back no more

Take a minute and think about what you're doing
And why you're doing it, why you pursuing it
And is you really happy?
I been all around the world and back again
I rap it in a microphone 
And let 'em know that if you're coming at me I'ma never give up
Give a damn if I gotta live up to every single one of your expectations
I remember the moment of my life
The moment of eyesight, all up in the spotlight, uh
Uh, people think we gotta be the perception, what you need is an intervention
Everything that you doin' better be with intention
I hope every single one of you payin' attention, uh (uh, all my life)

I used to move a certain way because I was afraid
That I would not be loved the way that I deserve to be
Until the day the fear deserted me, deserve to be free
And do whatever the fuck I wanna do when I wanna do it
When it come to the world and creativity (all my life)

I can't let you hold me back, oh no (all my life)
I can't let you hold me back no more
I can't let you hold me back, oh no
I can't let you hold me back no more (now)
(Yeah)

I'm just tryna do my best, baby
Ain't no wonder why I'm so stressed lately
Life we livin' hard
This life we livin' hard
I don't know why I always lie to myself
And callin' anybody for you
My homies runnin' 'round, doin' shit we weren't s'posed to do
Gettin' high all night, then we turn on the local news
'Nother brother gunned down, don't know what we supposed to do
Tryna make it out
.45 in the waistband, out of place, man
I'm just tryna live my life and do it right
I know you heard me
I know they all heard me now

Help me get, get out this place, paranoid get me out this place
Paradise
Paradise
Help me get, get out this place
Dreaming of that finer space
Paradise
Ooh, paradise
We gotta get up, get up, get up, get out of here
Yeah, yeah
We gotta get up, get up, get up, get out of here
Ooh
