		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, we could be superstars
We been ridin', wreckin' cars (ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure time is up
And so we fell in love with spinnin' drops
Still only a child, but faithful error (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like fuck this glitter
Skeet off dirt, I'm ditchin'
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that rockin' with you?
I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business
And spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', he ain't never step or help
With none of these killings, you doin' a lot of cappin'
Watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of the witness

Damn, my nigga you trippin'
We could've been superstars (superstars)
Remember when we was jackin' cars (jackin' cars)
Now it's not safe for you (safe for you)
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you (safe for you)
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on a bitch
When I slide, night light on the blick
Bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down
Caught him pants down, nigga you shitted
I knew the Perc was fake, but I still ate it
'Cause I'm a gremlin
Yeah, cutthroat business, KTV, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get live, all you niggas gon' die
Time rollin', bustin' on my opponent
No half-steppin', I'm crunchin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages to stages to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate
When they gon' want me dead when I'm off probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me
I be on a fuck-nigga ass like Charmin
AK, twenty inch carbons

We could've been superstars (superstars)
Remember when we was jackin' cars (jackin' cars)
Now it's not safe for you (safe for you)
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you (safe for you)
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on a bitch
When I slide, night light on the blick
Bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down
Caught him pants down, nigga you shitted
I knew the Perc was fake, but I still ate it
'Cause I'm a gremlin

Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)
But I'm pretty sure our time is up (now your time is up)
And so we fell in love with spinnin' drops
Still only a child, but faithful error
I ain't slimin', I'm grimin'
Any way you put it I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin
Snatch and grab, sneak and geek
Sniper Gang, trust

Nightmare, baby, you know I
I bet you always see me in your dreams
