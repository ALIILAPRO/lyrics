		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna put my hands on your waist 
Wanna dance slow in the room with lights dimmed 
At night time we lie awake 
Don’t wanna go to sleep now because I like this 

come and spend the night at your place 
Looking so pretty like your face is a Paragon 
Please stay don’t go away 
Saying Chick this int a sprint it’s a marathon 

I wanna be there 
when u need it the most 
I feel so hollow when I can’t keep you close 
I wanna be there when u don’t need me at all 
Let be the one that you 
Let me be the one that you call 

The one that you call 
Let me be the one that you 
The one that you call 

By far you’re
The highlight of my days
Open up you’re eyes in morning I get lost in em 
I could never lie about it babe 
Love the shape and shade looking god given 
We could put the fire on again 
Lay down in the rain 
Plan a life in the future I could give you my name 
My love 
My name my love 

I wanna be there 
when u need it the most 
I feel so hollow when I can’t keep you close 
I wanna be there when u don’t need me at all 
Let be the one that you 
Let me be the one that you call 

The one that you call 
Let me be the one that you 
The one that you call
