		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead
I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead
To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead

When I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
And that's when I decided, that I would be better off dead

It read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back
Oh, there's no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back
Yes, because it's all over now, and baby you can bet on that
