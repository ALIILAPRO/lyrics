		  Bring the beat in

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pan?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know (it's gonna take the real work) oh-oh
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears and finally you put me first

Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need to make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

Ooh, come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, ooh
Come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
My love on top, my love on top

Baby, baby, I can hear the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
And boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again and again and again and again

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know (it's gonna take the real work) oh-oh
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears and finally you put me first

Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need to make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

Ooh, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh ooh
Come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
My love on top, my love on top

Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only man I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love
