		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My name, it means nothing
My fortune is less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
Everything I possessed, now they are gone
They are gone, they are gone

Oh, where can I go to and what can I do?
Nothing can please me, only thoughts are of you
You just laughed when I begged you to stay
I've not stopped cryin' since you went away
You went away, you went away

The world is a lonely place, you're on your own
Guess I will go home, sit down, and moan
Cryin' and thinkin' is all that I do
Memories I have remind me of you
Of you, of you
