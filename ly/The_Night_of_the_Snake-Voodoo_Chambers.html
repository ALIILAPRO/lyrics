		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come in here
By the yellow brick road
Once you open the door
Welcome home, oh my dear, welcome home
In here
We're embracing our fears
Learning how to say yes
Call on Eve
Come to love yourself
Without shame
Cause tonight
It's the night of the snake
It's the night of the snake
It's in here
When you open the door
Bodies over the floor
And your teeth biting on my neck
Your teeth biting on my neck
In here
I just want to forget
I just want to forgive what I am
Come to love yourself
Come be free, without shame
It's the night of the Snake
The night of the Snake
Surrender Dorothy
Cause we've got what you came for
So if you're feeling raw
Tap your heels
Now tap your heels
Join the night, join the dance
Be faceless
So baby tap your heels
Tap your heels now
Burn at the stake
Burn at the stake
Come and burn at the stake
it's the night of the snake
burn, burn, burn.
