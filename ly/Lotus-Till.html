		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I
See you look into my eyes
You tell me I'm the one for you baby
For you baby
And time
Time is on our side
We're so young we'll never die baby
We'll never die
So I could live forever
(Forever)
By your side
It's this bloody emotion
Sex and devotion
I love every second
Our fatal obsession
When I get you moaning
We'll fuck till we're frozen
And I can't breath
No I can't breath
Like where am I going?
(Ooh)
And where did you take me?
(Ooh)
I
When I close my eyes at night
I see the hounds of love they've come for me
I watch them run to me
And now our fates are intertwined
It's undeniable this time
They bite my heels and drag me underneath
Underneath a silver sky
Oh I could live forever
(Forever, forever)
Through sun and stormy weather
(The weather, the weather)
If I could stay forever
(Forever, forever)
By your side
It's this bloody emotion
Sex and devotion
I love every second
Our fatal obsession
When I get you moaning
We'll fuck till we're frozen
And I can't breath
No I can't breath
Like where am I going?
(Ooh)
And where did you take me?
(Ooh)
Like where am I going?
(Ooh)
And where did you take me?
(Ooh)
