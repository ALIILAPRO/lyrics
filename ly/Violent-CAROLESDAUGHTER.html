		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting

Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting

Don't make me run away out the back door
I want my clothes back
You say you miss me
So then I drive back to you
I drive back to you

Petals off of flowers
Did you ever really love me?
Now my nose is filled with powder
And I think that she's still lovely, oh no
She knows I'm a wreck
I gave you all my trust 
Then I told you just don't break it
I promise that I'll clean up 
And maybe we can make it, but no
I think we're both a mess

Don't make me run away out the back door
I want my clothes back 
You say you miss me
So then I drive back to you
I drive back to you

Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting

Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting
