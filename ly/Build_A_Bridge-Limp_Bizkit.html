		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Build a bridge to your mind
Takes me there every time
Lay it all on the line
There's a way

Build a bridge make a path
Overlook the aftermath
Make my tears be a bath
There's a way

Only if you take a ride
Go with me to the other side

Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' till you come around (till you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart (break my heart)
I'll keep buildin' till I die

Build a bridge of memories
Stretch it out over seas
To the end of the world
If there's a way

Build a bridge made of pain
Send my longin' down the drain
Have no reasons to complain
There's a way

Only if you take a ride
Go with me to the other side

Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' till you come around (till you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart (break my heart)
I'll keep buildin' till I die

Wait, wait for me
Wait, please wait for me
Wait, wait for me
Wait, please wait for me, yeah

Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' till you come around (till you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart (break my heart)
I'll keep buildin' till I die

Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' till you come around (till you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart (break my heart)
I'll keep buildin' till I die
