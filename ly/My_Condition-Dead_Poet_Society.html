		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck sitting and waiting in the black sun
I'm not to die if I could be someone
We're sure you're to scared to make it out so
Sit back and I'll be seeing it all

Can't get any holding back karmas
Fully owned and everything you fought for
We have to go until I get more
'Til I get more

This simulation we're living in
I can't ignore
I came so close to giving in
But I want more
I hold my breath 'til my own death breaks down the door
Yeah, I want, I want more

Don't fuck with God, I make own fate
Too late to save my soul from my race
I'll die alone like a forgotten safe
No one would care or remember my-, remember my-
No one would care or remember my name

This simulation we're living in
I can't ignore
I came so close to giving in
But I want more
I hold my breath 'til my own death breaks down the door
Yeah, I want, I want more
Oh, I want more

Can't quite escape my condition
Thought things would change the second I'm gone
The second I'm gone
Can't find a place where I fit in
Thought life would change but maybe I'm wrong
But maybe I'm wrong (maybe I'm wrong)
But I go on
Yeah, I go on

This simulation we're living in
I can't ignore
I came so close to giving in
But I want more
I hold my breath 'til my own death breaks down the door
Yeah, I want, I want more
Yeah, I want more
