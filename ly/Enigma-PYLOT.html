		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I understand that you do not currently remember your own identity 
Let me assure you that being here at this moment in time is no accident 
As you may be aware by now, I've been searching for you for what seems a life time 
The city is in a state of disorder, and the balance of freedom and power has been shifted 
That power now lays in the hands of those who seek to control us all, the ones who control Solai.
