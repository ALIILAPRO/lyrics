		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, DJ
I don't wanna hear my heart breaking
My feelings are loud enough
Play me something to lift me up and save me
And save me, save me, save me, save me
Will you save me, save me, save me, save me?

Hey, DJ
I don't wanna hear my heart breaking
My feelings are loud enough
Play me something to lift me up and save me

Hey, DJ
I don't wanna hear my heart breaking
Before I get too messed up
Play me something to lift me up and save me
Hey, DJ

Will you save me, save me, save me, save me?

Tell me how I got here
I can't find no inner peace
Caught up in the night before
Drowning out the memories
Don't wanna see the morning
Just wanna wake up in a dream
Where I can't feel this pain no more
I know you got the remedy

Hey, DJ
I don't wanna hear my heart breaking
My feelings are loud enough
Play me something to lift me up and save me

Hey, DJ
I don't wanna hear my heart breaking
Before I get too messed up
Play me something to lift me up and save me

I need it now, that's all I want
Take me there with one more song
I'm getting too messed up
Play me something to lift me up and save me
And save me, save me, save me, save me
Will you save me, save me, save me, save me?
Hey, DJ
