		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I correlate you with the sun
Correlate you with every victory i've won
You are the words upon my tongue
You are the nectar used in nurturing the young 
You are my sweet (sweet)
You  so sweet

You're my shady tree when i'm hiding from the heat
You are rooted in my heart and your mind are the leaves
If you leave i cant breath photosynthesis decrease
I decrease to a once was
I cannot be a once was cause (uhn)

I once was a burden to the universe
I once was a troubled child of mother earth
I once was a glutton wasting father time
I once was a mess i used to honor pride i

Stopped chasing lust and found victory
An god did she have a sweet energy
Mix a fox with a fairy whats the synergy?
You got a fox you got a fairy whats the synergy? (sweet)

Sweet
(You're mine sunshine, you're my good time)
You're my sweet
(Yeah baby, yeah baby, yeah baby)
(Sweet sweet sweet sweet)
