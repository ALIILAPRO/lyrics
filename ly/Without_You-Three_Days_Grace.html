		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I walked without you
What if I ran without you
What if I stand without you
I could not go on

What if I lived without you
What if I loved without you
What if I died without you
I could not go on

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don't feel right
But I, I can't let you out of sight,
Without you I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

What if I lie without you
What if I rise without you
What if I dream without you
I could not go on

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don't feel right
But I, I can't let you out of sight,
Without you I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

You left my side tonight
And I just don't feel right
I can't let you out of sight,
Without you I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don't feel right
But I, I can't let you out of sight,
Without you I'm no one, I'm nothing at all

Nothing at all!
