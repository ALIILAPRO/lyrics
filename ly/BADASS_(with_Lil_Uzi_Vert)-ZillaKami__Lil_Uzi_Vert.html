Yeah, I get paid throwing back a hand grenade (okay)
I was on the run, moving packs right on the way, yeah
And just a reminder, hatin' shit won't get you paid, yeah
Y'all niggas should focus on getting your fuckin' raise
At McDonald's, bitch
Why the fuck you niggas even talk to me? (Okay)
Them doggies bark at me (okay), but never bite at me (okay)
I got a sniffin' for the witness who locked eyes with me (okay)
I got the time to D, I got the fire on me, yeah

Cruisin' in the whip, I got the stick, I'm booted up (okay)
Hoes up in the house and all they asses tooted up (huh?)
Cruisin' through your block and all I see is fuckin' dust (huh?)
Where do y'all reside? (Okay) why ain't y'all outside?
Get biggy, biggy, biggy, biggy blood bags (ha, ha)
Like really, really, really, really badass (ha, ha)
Get biggy, biggy, biggy, biggy blood bags (ha, ha)
Like really, really, really, really badass (okay)

Yeah, okay, I don't ever miss (okay)
How the fuck a comment make you delete your whole shit? Yeah
Yeah, okay, maybe you a bitch (okay)
How the fuck you let my homie bust your fuckin' lip? Yeah
I thought that y'all niggas had the chops (okay)
Why you gettin' beat up and you yellin', "Fuckin' stop" (huh?), Okay
I thought that y'all niggas had the poles (what?)
Why the fuck we smokin' on your homie? Freddy Ghost (yeah, okay)

Cruisin' in the whip, I got the stick, I'm booted up (okay)
Hoes up in the house and all they asses tooted up (huh?)
Cruisin' through your block and all I see is fuckin' dust (huh?)
Where do y'all reside? (Okay) why ain't y'all outside?
Get biggy, biggy, biggy, biggy blood bags (ha, ha)
Like really, really, really, really badass (ha, ha)
Get biggy, biggy, biggy, biggy blood bags (ha, ha)
Like really, really, really, really badass (okay)

Whoa, like I'm really, really badass (Lil Uzi)
Bitch, don't look at me if you ain't got a fat ass (ayy)
Yeah, Lil Uzi got a big bag (yeah)
If I pop it, then you'll probably get your stick back (yeah, whoa, whoa)
Bitch, I'm geeked up in some mansion like a kick back (whoa, whoa)
If I leave my drink down, they gon' try to slip that (yeah, yeah)
Uh, put my .40 on my hip, lap (ayy)
I'm like Manson with this Marilyn, I'm like Nickelback (yeah)

Let me get your pussy, I'ma scratch it (ayy)
Can't relax, I'm off a batch and no you cannot match (yeah)
Geeked up off them Xanny bars and a couple flats
Go on a hit with toolie, Uzis, and a couple MACs (brrat, yeah)

Cruisin' in the whip, I got the stick, I'm booted up (okay)
Hoes up in the house and all they asses tooted up (huh?)
Cruisin' through your block and all I see is fuckin' dust (huh?)
Where do y'all reside? (Okay) why ain't y'all outside?
Get biggy, biggy, biggy, biggy blood bags (ha, ha)
Like really, really, really, really badass (ha, ha)
Get biggy, biggy, biggy, biggy blood bags (ha, ha)
Like really, really, really, really badass (okay)
