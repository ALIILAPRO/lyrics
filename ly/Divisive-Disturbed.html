		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You won't listen to me
You won't speak to me
You've become another monster
Living in your own reality
Don't bitch to me
Stop judging me
You're just another monster
Living in your own reality

When you get that fever and the fire starts
And your deepest fears begin to burn inside
You just can't seem to fill that hole in your heart
So you play the victim for the people who

Depend on the depth of your lie
You're divisive
Hatred will never go away
They will never deny
Their divisive
Hatred will never go away

Don't listen to me
Don't speak to me
You're just another hostile
Making up your own reality
Don't look to me
Stop baiting me
I know you're just another hostile
Making up your own reality

When you get that fever and the fire starts
And your deepest fears begin to burn inside
You just can't seem to fill that hole in your heart
So you play the victim for the people who

Depend on the depth of your lie
You're divisive
Hatred will never go away
They will never deny
Their divisive
Hatred will never go away

Depend on the depth of your lie
You're divisive
Hatred will never go away
They will never deny
Their divisive
Hatred will never go away

For the depth of your lie
Isn't just the killing kind
What are you fulfilling?
Now you know
They will never deny
It's divisive
Hatred will never go away

You're divisive
You won't listen to me
You won't speak to me
You've become another monster
Living in your own reality
