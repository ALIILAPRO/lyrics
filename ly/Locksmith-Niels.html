		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time you come and go
You take a bit more of my soul
Guess i'll see you down the road
Guess I'Il see you down the road
You come and go
Come and go
Guess I'Il see you down the road
Down the road
Girl I know that you've been sobbing
Now I gotta to call the locksmith
Cause you never hold a promise
Girl imma stop it
It's not good for profit
I think I'm trapped in the tropics
I don't stand with all the nonsense
Even if you try to promise
That we'll be fine
We can heal another time
But these are the games
I never wanna play
Yeah we always end up tearing
Yeah that's late in the night evening
Yeah I'm feeling suffocated
We don't have the patience
Oh shit
You become a stranger
Stranger
And you take all my essence
My essence
Hold up
You come and go
Take a bit more of my soul
See you down the road
Guess I'Il see you down the road
Oh Shit
Come and go
Guess I'll see you down the road
Come and go
Come and go
Guess I'll see you down the road
Down the road
Down the road
I'll see you down the road
