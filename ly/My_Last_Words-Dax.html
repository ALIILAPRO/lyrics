		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What would your last words be?
If someone put a gun to your head
And said you had two
Minutes before they shoot here are mine

Wish I can go and revisit the evil I
Did through the course of my life (I wish)
Wish I could go back in time take the wrongs
That I did and reverse them to right (Fuck)
Wish I can take all the pain, the hurt
The struggle and keep 'em inside (Damn)
Wish I can say that I'm sorry to people
I broke here before that I die (What)

Wish I can go back in time to my father
I didn't really mean it
Wish I can go tell my mom that I loved her
And all of this money I got I don't need it
Wish I could go to the church and I talked
The Lord in an effort to conquer my demons
I'm beggin' and pleadin'
I'm down on my knees and he's ready
To shoot and I'm practically bleedin'
So this is my destiny
I finna get death to the G
Somebody please help me, yeah
These are my last words it's Dax!

Wish I can go back in time and
Revisit myself just to make me believe
I had these goals and these dreams in my
Mind that were mine that I'll never achieve
All of these gifts and
These talents were given
By God I was blessed to receive
I was too busy worry 'bout
Bitches and money and
All of this shit that you people would think
Needed help with depression
All of my passive aggressions
I should've confessed them
I learned my lesson
I didn't get nothin' but sadness that
Fucked over all of my blessings
Fucking perfection
I shoulda walked on my own and
I traveled the common direction
Just to be trending just to be trending!
Wish I woulda not held back
Wish I woulda not felt bad
Wish I woulda hugged my dad
Wish I woulda fucked that bitch
When I had that chance
Wish I woulda sold my soul
Just to get fame and all
Shoulda played basketball
Nigga was masterful wait!
Wish I would have never put
My time into those people
Who never tried to give it to me back
Wish I would have never put my
Heart into a woman that will
Break it than allow it just
To have a second chance
Wish I would have let 'em see
What I was really dealing with
Instead of tryna hide it
On a motherfuckin' track
I blow a milli just to prove that
I'm a legend in the makin' just
To show them what it looks like
When I get it right back
These are my last, my last words

Dear God
I'm not gonna lie, I'ma need your forgiveness
I knew that no one was watching
But in my last minutes
I now know that you were a witness
So I'm repentant now that's it's sinnin'
Why? Because I need to make it to heaven
Born as a sinner, die as a winner
Period just like the end of a sentence
I swear the devil is watching me
He tried to make me his prodigy
This is my fucking apology
I don't want nothin' but honesty
Heaven to hell was just callin' me
30 seconds left these are my last words
And to the bitch that broke my heart
I just hope that you can sleep
Knowing every single man you'll meet
Will never be like me
You can run, you can hide
But you will see me in your dreams on TV
It's Dax!

Wish I can go back in time to my father
I didn't really mean it
Wish I can go tell my mom that I loved her
And all of this money I got I don't need it
Wish I could go to the church and I talked to
The Lord in an effort to conquer my demons
I'm beggin' and pleadin'
I'm down on my knees and he's ready
To shoot and I'm practically bleedin'
So this is my destiny
I finna get death to the G
Somebody please help me, yeah
These are my last words it's Dax!
