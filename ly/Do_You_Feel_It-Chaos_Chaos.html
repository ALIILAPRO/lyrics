		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay it, lay it down, let me see your hand
Show me what you got
You're always talking, but you're not playing
It doesn't match your face
Gotta find my way, away from this place
Can you take me now?
I-I want it, I want it real
Are you afraid of me now?
Are you afraid of me now?

Do you feel it, do you feel it?
Do you feel that I can see your soul?
Do you feel it, do you feel it?
Do you feel the beat in your heart?

I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now

Somedays I'm built of metal, I can't be broken
But not when I'm with you
You love me real, we have it all
Can't leave me now
I love the way, you are today
Run away with me now
Wind in my hair, 'cause I don't care
Baby, run away with me now
Run away with me now

Do you feel it, do you feel it?
Do you feel that I can see your soul?
Do you feel it, do you feel it?
Do you feel the beat in your heart?

I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now

Oh, oh
Oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh oh

Drinking in the summer, I'm good at running
I beat you in the race again
Are you afraid, when I look your way?
It's easiest to stay at home
But then we taste it, we got to have it
We have no control
Where is the love, the kind we dream of?
The kind that makes us young
The kind that makes us young

Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
