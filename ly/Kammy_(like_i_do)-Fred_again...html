Yours is the realest love
You got all my heart
Don't need your touch
Oh, oh, babe

Dem can't love you like I do, ooh
Dem can't love you like I do (do, yeah)

Hold me through the night
Take away the pain
Leave them all behind
They don't understand
Baby, you and I
Can't we run away?
Oh, oh, babe

Instead, you stay with me
Through the morning light
Hold me in your arms
We gon' be alright
Tryna say that babe, I'm sorry
Oh, oh babe

Dem don't love you like I do
Dem don't love you like I do (my guy, Fred)
Dem nuh love you like I do (when they see you're here)
Do, yeah (hey, you know when it's serious)

Dem can't love you like I do
Oh, oh, babe
