		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey now
All you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now
All you lovers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on

Hey now
All you killers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now
All you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on

'Cause there's a monster
Living under my bed
Whispering in my ear
There's an angel
With a hand on my head
She say I've got nothing to fear

There's a darkness
Livin' deep in my soul
I still got a purpose to serve
So let your light shine
Deep into my hole
God, don't let me lose my nerve
Don't let me lose my nerve

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Whoa-oh hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

Hey now
All you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now
All you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on

'Cause there's a monster
Living under my bed
Whispering in my ear
And there's an angel
With a hand on my head
She say I've got nothing to fear
She say
La ilaha illallah
We all shine like stars
La ilaha illallah
We all shine like stars
And then we fade away
