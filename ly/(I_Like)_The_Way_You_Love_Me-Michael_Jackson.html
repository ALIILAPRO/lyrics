		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Okay this is the tempo and this is the melody)
I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Drums
Like that, you know?

I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Ooh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Ooh 

I was alone, there was no love in my life 
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time 
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
Ooh

I like the way how you're lovin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
I like the way how you're holdin' me
(It doesn't matter how you're lovin' me)
I like the way how you're touchin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me)
I like the way how you're kissin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me)
You'll see

It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
Ooh
I thank the Heavens above that I met ya
Ooh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
Ooh 

I like the way how you're lovin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
I like the way how you're holdin' me
(It doesn't matter how you're lovin' me)
I like the way how you're touchin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me)
I like the way how you're kissin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me)

The world's a better place (the world's a better place)
'Cause you came in time ('cause you came in time)
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
(You took away the rain and brought the sunshine)
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time
(I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time)
Ooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
I like the way how you're lovin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me)
I like the way how you're touchin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me)
I like the way how you're kissin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me)
You see

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
I like the way how you're lovin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me)
I like the way how you're touchin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me)
I like the way how you're kissin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me)

I like the way how you're holdin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
I like the way how you're lovin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me)
I like the way how you're touchin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me)
I like the way how you're kissin' me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me)
You see

(It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me)
(It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me)
