		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, darling, darling
It's no need to worry
It's just a couple things
(Just a couple things on my mind, you know?)
If it's you and other
It's no need to worry (you don't have to worry)
'Cause I can sleep between you

I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side-better
I'm a homewrecker
Give it up
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side-better
I'm a homewrecker
Give it up, give it up, give it up

I'll keep your, your best interest
I'll keep your, your best interest
I'll keep your best interest
I'll keep your best interest

I was, I was, I was, I was out here playing games
You was out here with a lame one
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I'm the side nigga
I gotta sneak around and hide with you
I wanna see you give me five minutes
Paparazzi probably got like five pictures
(Click, click, click, click)
I won't tell anybody, it's our secret
Top, top, top, top of the morning like yeehaw
I took my shot, this is B-ball, nigga
The team you play for is see-saw
So I know that it's fake when I see y'all (yeah)
Don't wanna fuck what you got up
I will never blow your spot up
I know my place, I'm the landlord
I carry the weight 'til my hands sore (yeah)
We can't keep doing this
I'll keep your, your best interest, it's our secret
I'll keep your best interest
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
