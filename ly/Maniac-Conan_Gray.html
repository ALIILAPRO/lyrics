		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maniac

You were with your friends, partying
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So, you show up at my home, all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke?

'Cause people like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So, why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac

(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)

You just went too far
Wrecked your car, called me crying in the dark
Now you're breakin' my heart
So, I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay

Well, people like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So, why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac

(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say)

Psychopathic, don't be so dramatic
We had magic, but you made it tragic
Now you're manic, honestly, I've had it
Listen to yourself, think you need to get some help

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So, why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac

(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, some may say) You maniac
(Maniac, someone said that I'm)
