		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wind me up
Put me down
Start me off and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center
And I'm out of tune
Just kickin' this can along the avenue
But I'm alright

'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now
It's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out

Shut up
Hush your mouth
Can't you hear you talk too loud
No can't hear nothin' 'cause I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue
But that's okay

'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now
It's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out

'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now
It's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out

And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know 
You really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know 
You really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you
You really gotta jerk it out
