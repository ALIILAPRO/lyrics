		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you know that I'll be around to guide you 
Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you 
Returning nightmares only shadows 

We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now 

Crosses all over, heavy on your shoulders 
The sirens inside you waiting to step forward 
Disturbing silence darkens your sight 

We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now 

Crosses all over the boulevard 
Crosses all over the boulevard 
Crosses all over the boulevard 
Crosses all over the boulevard 

The streets outside your window overflooded 
People staring they know you've been broken 
Repeatedly reminded by the looks on their faces 
Ignore them tonight and you'll be alright 

We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
