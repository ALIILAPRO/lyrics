		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgive her
For she knows not what she does

A cross upon her bedroom wall
From grace she will fall
An image burning in her mind
And between her thighs

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

A dying God-man full of pain
When will you come again?

Before him beg to serve or please
On your back or knees

There's no forgiveness for her sins
Prefers punishment

Would you suffer eternally
Or internally?
Ah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

For her lust
She'll burn in hell
Her soul done medium well

All through mass manual stimulation
Salvation

Corpus Christi
She needs
Corpus Christi
Corpus Christi

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Corpus Christi
She needs
Corpus Christi
Corpus Christi

Body of Christ (ah, ah, ah, ah)
She needs (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Body of Christ
Body of Christ

She'd like to know God
Love God

Feel her God
Inside of her
Deep inside of her, ah

She'd like to know God
Love God
Feel, feel, feel her God
Inside of her
Deep inside of her

Inside of her
Deep inside of her

Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ, ah

Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ, ah
Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ, ah

Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ, yeah
Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ, ah

Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ, yeah
Jesus Christ looks like me
Jesus Christ, ah
