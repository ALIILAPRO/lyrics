		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Both: We're just two little girls from Littlerock.
We lived on the wrong sid of the tracks
But the gentlemen friends who used to call
they never did seem to mind all
they came to the wrong side of the tracks
Marilyn: then someone broke my heart in Littlerock
So I up and left the pieces there
Like a little lost lamb I roamed about
I came to New York and I found out
Both: that men are the same way everywhere
I was young and determined
To be wined, and dined and ermined
and I worked at it all around the clock
Jane: Now one of these days in my fancy clothes
I'm going back home and punch the nose
Both: of the one who broke my heart
Marilyn: the one who broke my heart!
Both: The one who broke my heart in Littlerock, Littlerock,Littlerock, Littlerock!

Marilyn: I learned an awful lot in Littlerock
and here's some advice I'd like to share
find a gentleman who's shy or bold,
or short or tall, or young or old...
Both: as long as the guys a millionaire!
as a kid from the small street
I did very well on wallstreet
though I never owned a share of stock
and now that I'm known in the biggest banks
I'm going back home and give my thanks
to the one who broke my heart
Marilyn: the one who broke my heart
Both: the one who broke my heart
IN LITTLEROCK!
