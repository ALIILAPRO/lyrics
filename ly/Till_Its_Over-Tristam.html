		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't care what they say
We will be here all day
We'll stay here 'til it's over
'Til the world's out of sight
We will stand, we will fight
It's not over 'til it's over
As I fell to the ocean floor
Feeling light through an open door
Saw myself rise with the water
They thought they could keep me down
Hold their breath and watch me drown
But all they did has pushed me higher
We don't care what they say
We will be here all day
We'll stay here 'til it's over
'Til the world's out of sight
We will stand, we will fight
It's not over 'til it's over
Through the night and the rain
Through the time and the pain
We'll stand and we'll never fall
And then at the end of it all
We will win, we will chant
It's not over 'til it's over
