		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Terminals, so many terminals

Tryna make my way to luggage
But you see the others
They pushin' they shovin'
They all in my area, in my area

You know I've been missin' you
Kissin' you through the phone
But now I wanna just raise you
And put you on pedestal, on pedestal
You know I've been flying
For 17 hours and now
I can't see you my girl
I feel like i criminal, a free criminal

Cus it was bad when i did it
But we start fresh
You was mad but i ran to ya
Let's start fresh
Now i'm tryna be the man for you
Let's start fresh
Took a flight and a train for you
Let's start fresh

Flight 99

Animal, was acting so animal
Back in the day i was doggin' you
I was mistreating you i wasn't treating you
Like you was general, you a general

We was at war and at love and
At war and at love and at war but
I'll tell you i'd give it up, give it up

And now i can see you
I hope you can see the way
That i have changed when i embrace you
Baby lets give it up, let's live it up

Cus it was bad when i did it
But we start fresh
You was mad but I ran to ya
Let's start fresh
Now I'm tryna be the man for you
Let's start fresh
Took a flight and a train for you
Let's start fresh

Flight 99!
