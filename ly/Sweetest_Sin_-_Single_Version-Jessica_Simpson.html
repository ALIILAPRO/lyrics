		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you imagine us making love
The way it would feel the first time that we touch
Can you think of it the way I dream of it
I want you to see it like I'm seeing it
It's a picture of perfection
The vision of you and I

Your lips upon my lips
(Can you just picture this)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin
That would be the sweetest sin, yeah

All night I lay awake
'Cause it's too much to take
Dreaming about the love that we could make
All day I think of schemes
To get you next to me
I want you so bad I can barely breathe
It's a sign of my obsession
That I can't stop thinking 'bout

Your lips upon my lips
(Can you just picture this)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin
That would be the sweetest sin, yeah

Your lips upon my lips
(Can you just picture this)
Temptation I could never resist
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin, yeah

It would feel to good
To be so bad
You don't know how bad
I want that
I would do anything
To feel

Your lips upon my lips
(Can you just picture this)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin
That would be the sweetest sin, yeah
