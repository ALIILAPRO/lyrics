		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still have your picture on the wall
I still have the nightmares where I would have to call you to calm down

I still think about you all the time
When I step out of the shower I'm reminded of the night
When we slept in the back of your car
And you left me with a pretty cool scar

Did it hurt when I kicked you to the curb?
Now I'm all alone
I guess I'll never learn

Your purple sweater's sitting in my room
I tried to wear it, but I knew that it would smell like you

I saw you dancing at the show tonight
I stood in the back
And I think that we both know why

Did it hurt when I kicked you to the curb?
Now I'm all alone
I guess I'll never learn

And I lied
When I took you on a drive
And I said I'd never speak to her
I wish I would have kept my word
