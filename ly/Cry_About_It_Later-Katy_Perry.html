		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm havin' fun
Tonight I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' somethin' brand new

I know tomorrow I'll be love hungover
But I'm ready for a shameless summer
Champagne on ice only makes you stronger

Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it non-stop, ah
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up, ah
Body to body, I almost forgot
You're not him, you're not her

I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm havin' fun
Tonight I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' somethin' brand new

I think I'm ready to be someone's new muse
I think I'm ready for a brand new tattoo
I'm gonna fake it 'til it makes me feel good

Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it non-stop, ah (one more)
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up, ah
Body to body, I almost forgot
You're not him, you're not her

I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm havin' fun
Tonight I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' some
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm havin' fun
Tonight I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' somethin' brand new

Ooh
I know tomorrow I'll be love hungover
Ooh

And it's half past three
And I got angel wings
But a devil's grin
And only one can win
No, no, no, no

(I'll cry about it later)
(I'll cry about it later)
(Tonight I'm havin' fun)
(Tonight I'm havin' fun)
(I'll cry about it later)
(I'll cry about it later)
(Tonight I'm gettin' some)
(Tonight I'm gettin' some)

I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm havin' fun
Tonight I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' somethin' brand new
