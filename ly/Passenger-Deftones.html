		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I lay
Still and breathless
Just like always
Still, I want some more
Mirrors sideways
Who cares what's behind?
Just like always
Still your passenger

Chrome buttons, buckles and leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses
Now to calm me
This time won't you please
Drive faster

Roll the window down this
Cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger

Drop these down
Then put them on me
Nice, cool seats
There to cushion your knees
Now to calm me
Take me around again
Don't pull over
This time won't you please
Drive faster

Roll the window down this
Cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows 
Down to catch my breath and then
Go and go and go just
Drive me home and back again

Here I lay 
Just like always
Don't let me 
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Take me to the edge
