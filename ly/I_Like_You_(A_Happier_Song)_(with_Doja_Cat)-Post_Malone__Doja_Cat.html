		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, girl, I like you, I do
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz
I like you, I do
I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?
I like you, I do
We went over to France and we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (I do, mm, mm)

Oh, girl, I know you only like it fancy (fancy)
So I pull up in that Maybach Candy
Yeah, your boyfriend'll never understand me (understand me)
'Cause I'm 'bout to pull this girl like a hammy, hammy (wow)
Let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady 
Hit PCH, one-eighty
Hey, I've been thinkin' lately
That I need someone to save me
Now that I'm famous, I got hoes all around me
But I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me
So please be true, don't fuck around with me
I need someone to share this heart with me
Feel you up, then run it back again (run it back again)

Ooh, girl, I like you, I do (I do)
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz (woo)
I like you, I do (I do)
I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?
I like you, I do (mm, I do)
We went over to France and we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (mm, mm, I do)

Let me know when you're free
'Cause I've been tryna hit it all week, babe
Why you actin' all sweet?
I know that you want lil' ol me
I get a little OD
But ain't shit new to a freak
Lemme drop bands, put a jewel in your teeth
He love the way I drip, turn that pool to the beach
And I coulda copped the Birkin but I cop CÃ©line
Why we got the same taste for the finer things?
Brand new nigga with the same old team
Now he got me on a leash 'cause we said no strings
You know I'm cool with that
Stole the pussy, you ain't get sued for that (get sued, sued)
Wonder what a nigga might do for that (do, might do)
I could be your Chaka, where Rufus at? (Where?)
Eighty in the Benz when the roof go back, ayy
They don't wanna see us get too attached, ayy
I just got a feelin' that we might be friends for a long, long time
You're mine, and you know I like you for that

Ooh, girl, I like you, I do (I do)
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz
I like you, I do (I do)
I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans? (Fit me in your plans)
I like you, I do (I do)
We went over to France and we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (I do, mm, I do)

I just want you, I just want you
Your heart's so big but that ass is huge
Just want you, oh baby
Do you like me too? (Yeah, I like you too)

Ooh, girl, I like you, I do (I do)
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz
I like you, I do (I do, mm, I do)

I like you
I wanna be your girlfriend, baby
