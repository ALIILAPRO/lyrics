		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm getting hickeys from my bed bugs
I'm getting busy with a bad perfume
I'm sticking kisses to a pen drug
I'm making friction with a sad vacuum

I'm getting jiggy with a rifle
I'll pull the trigger with my eyes closed
Hoping to hit you somewhere vital
And when I miss, you come and kiss me with a smile

I'm having sex with a ghost, 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleeping with a
Sex with a ghost, 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleeping with a ghoul

The only time I ever see her
Is when she's behind me in the mirror
Even from a distance I can hear her
Try to listen, but her whispers make my ears hurt

And on our dates, it's never daytime
When she gets playful with a steak knife
I need a break, maybe I'll take five
Shake it up and medicate, maybe I'll take five

I'm having sex with a ghost, 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleeping with a
Sex with a ghost, 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleeping with a ghoul

I'm having sex with a ghost, 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleeping with a
Sex with a ghost, 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleeping with a ghoul
