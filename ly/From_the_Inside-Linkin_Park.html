		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know who to trust no surprise
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)

(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(All I ever think about is this)
(All the tiring time between)
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

Tension is building inside steadily
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet)
(All I ever think about is this)
(All the tiring time between)
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

I won't waste myself on you
You
You
Waste myself on you
You
You

I'll take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

Everything from the inside and just throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you
You
You
