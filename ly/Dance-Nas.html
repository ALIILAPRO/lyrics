		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more time, one more time
Huh, one more time, huh
One more time

I dream of the day I could go back to when I was born
Laying in your arms, wishing you was here today mom
Wish you'd appear
Just for a second from heaven my tears would be gone
I wouldn't be rapping this song
I'd be happy driving up to your 8 bed room mansion
Up late, laughing bout the hard time we faced
The galaxy is so enchanting beyond, Galileo's understanding
Past the milky way and all the planets
There's something out there greater
But only god knows, scientist claim we came from apes
But they lies though, that was part of our conversation
I spark went up a star blazing
Thinking of how amazing she was
A angel gave me love
I'm thankful, to ever know a women so real
I pray when I marry my wife'll have one of your skillz
But mom you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up
Just to see you one more day
To have

[Chorus]
One more dance with you mama
If I could only have
One more dance with you mama
Praying, wish that I could have
One more dance with you mama
If I could only have
One more dance with you mama

I wish you were here,
I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace forever I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7, 02
That's when the gates of heaven opened up for you to stroll threw
Beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through you sons and your grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, mommy dance with em
And you've been my guide threw all the trouble I faced
They playing our song the lifebeat my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand and try not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed
Dreaming I could have

[Chorus]

I love you forever mom
You will always live threw me, always
Huh, huh huh, yea
