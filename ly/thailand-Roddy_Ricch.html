		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flew my bitch out from Thailand, she do the most (most)
My niggas hot like some Cayenne, sittin' in your throat (throat)
They spend a quarter million in the private, just for the show (show)
Shawty gon' call a nigga "Your Highness", 'cause we fuck on the low
And I get about twelve for a key
If a nigga playin' chess, I'm king
My niggas ridin' with Berettas, fuck a sting
You know I'm poppin' every lil' ting
Got a lot of D, got a lot of hundreds
Go to buy the bitch with a lot of money

You know Bird loungin' by the pool
You know Donbo comin' with the woo (the woo)
I think Keefa just bought some new sneakers
Five thousand, them bitches brand new
I was ridin' on the jet with lil' Setty
He my lil' bro but that nigga heavy
I spent twenty-five thou' on her titties
They took her ass fat right out her belly
I want some diamonds, I want some baguetties
Eliantte callin' every time I'm ready
Off a couple bars, I don't need a medic
If I did it, then I meant it and I said it
Dwayne Wade, how I kept the heat
Say she a squirter, it got wet on the seat
I got a burden like a man in a meet
Feel like I buy another safe every week
Fivio said she a wetty, I was sittin' at the trap house 
Whippin' shit out the crocker like Betty
All a nigga need 'bout ten racks, he'll pop you if you pop a thirty
My lil' nigga do dirty, he just need the lil' wordie
Give a fuck 'bout the verdict

Flew my bitch out from Thailand, she do the most (most)
My niggas hot like some Cayenne, sittin' in your throat (throat)
They spend a quarter million in the private, just for the show (show)
Shawty gon' call a nigga "Your Highness", 'cause we fuck on the low
And I get about twelve for a key
If a nigga playin' chess, I'm king
My niggas ridin' with Berettas, fuck a sting
You know I'm poppin' every lil' ting
Got a lot of D, got a lot of hundreds
Go to buy the bitch with a lot of money

Ayy, if I got the time, fuck her like a menace
Open up her tonsils like she at the dentist
Writin' checks, had to work on my penmanship
What you got? I spent more on the fit, I spent more on my bitch
Twenty bitches on top of the Ritz
Got the store, you should cop you some kicks
We gettin' money, hooray, hooray, hooray
Havin' dodey on dodey, ain't talkin' no stimulus
We went to war for this shit
When you stackin' up paper on paper on paper
You gon' need some more of this shit, huh
Livin' prototype, they gon' copy a nigga
I done spent some M's on my property, nigga
Got rich off "The Box" how I box me a nigga

Flew my bitch out from Thailand, she do the most (most)
My niggas hot like some Cayenne, sittin' in your throat (throat)
They spend a quarter million in the private, just for the show (show)
Shawty gon' call a nigga "Your Highness", 'cause we fuck on the low
And I get about twelve for a key
If a nigga playin' chess, I'm king
My niggas ridin' with Berettas, fuck a sting
You know I'm poppin' every lil' ting
Got a lot of D, got a lot of hundreds
Go to buy the bitch with a lot of money
