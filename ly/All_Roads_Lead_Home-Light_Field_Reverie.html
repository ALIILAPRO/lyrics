		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost sentiments
Just memories
Of every word misspoken
Swept away by the seasons
And I'm still running
From where it all began
For everything I've taken
And everything I have
I can't go back
Without you
Without you...
This river runs in circles
An endless stream of moments
Where you and I are bound in timelines
So tired and torn by the restless tempest
The path that we have chosen
Will always lead us home
This emptiness
Just a consequence
Of every dream dismantled
Washed away by time
And I'm still fighting
The bliss in letting go
Of everything I came for
And everything I know
I can't go back
Without you
I can't go back
(I can't face it on my own)
Without you...
(I have to find my way back home)
This river runs in circles
An endless stream of moments
Where you and I are bound in timelines
So tired and torn by the restless tempest
The path that we have chosen
Will always lead us home
