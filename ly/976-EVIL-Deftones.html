		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For a thousand days
You've been staring away
Are you faint
Are you thinking
Crack a smile and wink
It doesn't scare me away

Hit the brakes
I feel like cruising with you too

So I gaze
In your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me up
Your hands that I'm under
Come wake me up soon

Take a bow and wave
As we carry away
It was great
But I'm not leaving
Crack a smile and wink
It still doesn't scare me away

Hit the brakes
I feel like cruising with you, too

So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder, can you take me up
Your hands that I'm under
Come wake me up

For a thousand days
We could get carried away
Are you in
Are you in
Are you in(are you in)
(I'd give anything)
(I'd give anything for you)

So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder can you take me up
Your hands that I'm under
Come wake
So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder can you take me up
