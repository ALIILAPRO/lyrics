		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said you wanna spend your life
with me
If you really do, why did you leave?
(guess you didn't mean it)
Used to be us, now it’s just 'you and I’
Ain’t nobody else, you're my one of a kind
(did I miss the sign?
am I going blind?)
I don't think I can let go
Give me one way to forget you
Give me one way to move on
All of these tears for you to say
that I’ll be just fine
(without you)
Give me some time to forget you
Give me some space to move on
Maybe another lifetime
I would be yours
And you would be mine
Baby just like that
(everything we did together)
It all done like that
(everything is way too sudden)
Oh I wish I knew how could I get through
It's getting harder every night or two
Used to be us, now it’s just 'you and I’
(You and I)
Ain’t nobody else, you're my one of a kind
Will I survive?
I’m barely alive
I don't think I can let go
Give me one way to forget you
Give me one way to move on
All of these tears for you to say
that I’ll be just fine
(without you)Give me one way to forget you
Give me one way to move on
All of these tears for you to say
that I’ll be just fine
(without you)
Give me some time to forget you
Give me some space to move on
Maybe another lifetime
I would be yours
And you would be mine
There ain’t any other way
But deep down I wish you'd stay
I don't know will I ever find
another love like you
Baby tell me how
How should I let go
(It don't matter to you)
(It don't matter, no)
(It don't matter to you)
(It don't matter, no)
(It don't matter to you)
(It don't matter, no)
(It don't matter to you)
Oh
How do I let you go?
I’ll be just fine
Give me some time to forget you
Give me some space to move on
Maybe another lifetime
We’ll be together like we used to be
Maybe in another lifetime
I would be yours
And you would be mine
