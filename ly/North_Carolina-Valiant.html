		  Fada Dipo
Yo, Quandon (fada, fully)
(You kotch e hat, a lie) 
We a big up di whole a the dragga dem (outside, a lie, rich a lie)
(Bomboclaat) Burnt Savannah
Sav-la-mar
Yo, Negril
Kingston, Spain Town, Portmore
Ahh
Yo, Mandeville

Ahh
Hundred milli' a nuh nothing fi we draw down
From you look inna mi eye, yeah, you know seh me charge up
Me have dem gyal inna mi house a drink Hennessy and raw rum
Bare rum

Amiri jeans, and mi shoes a Gucci
Have the shirt fi prove it (have the shirt fi prove it)
Dem boy deh a newbie, all mi bitch dem boujee and mi lifestyle a movie
Jail link double park
Exhaust pon the muffler
How you fi a chap and y'ah no duffle bag?
Under mi science and mi guzu strong
Paul just send some leads, so me buy a athlete and a never track meet
Gyal pon the block a top freak and she the top meesh
So you know what that mean
Incense light up and me oil up, nuh 'fraid a Hilux
Money deh a pile up, don't size up, yo, we can't broke

Ahh
Hundred milli' a nuh nothing fi we draw down
From you look inna mi eye, yeah, you know seh me charge up
Me have dem gyal inna mi house a drink Hennessy and raw rum
Bare rum

Di skull a call me early morning
So me just reverse e mortgage
Yo, turn that down, turn that down, turn that down
Me buck a skull from North Carolina
Yeah, so me hold him down, me guzu him and me tie him up
Me put him name in a bold in a join up
Some likkle boy better know we no buy luck
Yo, Quandon, tell dem talk facts, no raw cash
When the Crown pon the ground make your gyal pussy drown
We nuh 'fraid a no clown
Yo, Quandon, tell dem talk facts, no raw cash (raw cash)
A we run Uptown, better know when we 'round
Better know when we 'round (bup, bup, bup, bup)

Ahh
Hundred milli' a nuh nothing fi we draw down
From you look inna mi eye, yeah, you know seh me charge up
Me have dem gyal inna mi house a drink Hennessy and raw rum
Cyaan' done
