		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know anything about you
So close, just a touch away
Your love hits me like no other

They say I'm a true believer
I know something's taking over now
I wanna run but I don't know how
You just crossed my border now
Just a kiss away

Give me a break
I'm melting away
You're so dangerous
Or is it too late?
Gotta know what's on your mind

I'm out of control
'Cause you want it all
You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your eyes

Dangerous

I'm out of control

Don't you push it to the limit
'Cause you know I'm hungry for your touch
No doubt, I wanna be your lover

They say, just a pretender
I know something's taking over now
I wanna run but I don't know how
You just crossed my border now
Standing face to face

Give me a break
I'm melting away
You're so dangerous
Or is it too late?
Gotta know what's on your mind

I'm out of control
'Cause you want it all
You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your eyes

Dangerous

I'm out of control
'Cause you want it all
You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your eyes
