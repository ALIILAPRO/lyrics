		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tears fall on my pillow case
Don't say it's too late to save us
I know you don't have to say it, I know
Our fate must be wrong 'cause there's
No way there's no you and me
So please stay, please stay

'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't
Love me like you say you do
Don't love me like you say you do
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
But I know how to make it work
Keep lying like you always do
And I'll keep on believing you
But I know, I know, I know
Yeah, I know, I know, I know

Please say we're not wearing thin
But I'm still your everything
I know that it's not the case, oh, I know
Now every day I wake up with a belly ache
'Cause it's clear that you're not gonna stay
But I hoped, no

But I know, I know, I know, I know
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't
Love me like you say you do
Don't love me like you say you do
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
But I know how to make it work
Keep lying like you always do
And I'll keep on believing you
But I know, I know, I know, I know
I know
