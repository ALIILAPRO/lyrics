		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ow

Who's that sexy thang I see over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thang hangin' 'round my neck?
That's gold, show me some respect (oh, ah)

I thank God every day (uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me, too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me, too

I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to VIP
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

I thank God every day (thank God, uh-huh)
That I woke up (woke up) feelin' this way (and I feel good, uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh (baby)

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (oh, ayy)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too (I would wanna be me too)
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

Ow
(Turn the bass up)
Turn the bass up
Ow
(Turn the bass up)
Let's go

I thank God every day (said I thank God, uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (feelin' this way, uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh (baby)

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (oh)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (hey, hey, hey-ayy)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
