		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up town another endless night
Hearts break in early morning light
(Yeah) I take my time

Downtown a lonesome boy at home
Don't know what's really going on
(Yeah) I take my time


But underneath it all I know it feels so right
I feel I'm going crazy but I won't cry tonight


Don't turn away 
I need to say 
You are the one that leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know I never meant to break I promise
(Woah) I never meant to say goodbye
Don't turn away 
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you


If I could start it all again
I'd know you're more than just a friend
(Yeah) I turn back time


But underneath it all I know it feels so right
I feel I'm going crazy but I won't cry tonight


Don't turn away 
I need to say 
You are the one that leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
