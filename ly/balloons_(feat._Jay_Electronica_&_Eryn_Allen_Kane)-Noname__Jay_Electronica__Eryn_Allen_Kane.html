		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo
When I was monumental, I was tatted up and bad as fuck
And dreamin' up scenarios where serotonin laughed at us
Psilocybin with the hybrid, baby couldn't pass it up
Coochie cutters in the concert with the lights on
And maybe I'll play the right song and tell you my secret
I used to swim in the dungeon where Moses pled her allegiance
Harriet happiness, I hibernate the masochist
Every slave in a slave town ready to bleed god
Married a tree top for money and new crib
Your daddy just lost his, petty capitalism
Niggas are broke for a livin' but pray for riches in death
Niggas under distress
Niggas s'pposed to finesse, uh

I'm on the moon, I cry balloons
They black and blue tonight
And if the homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back
Homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back tonight
I'm on the moon, I cry balloons
They black and blue tonight
And if the homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back
Homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back tonight

In the land before a lamb
Monasteries and Narcan
Casual white fans
Who invented the voyeur?
Fascinated with mourning, they hope the trauma destroy her
Why everybody love a good sad song?
A dark album, like
"Tell me that your homie dead, your mama dead
Your brother bled all on the street
The corner where the Walgreens and White Castle is
Ooh-wee, yeah, we know that you miss him
And if you sing about his sister, then we buyin' a ticket for real"
Front row, center, still gratitude, she love 'em
But she can't tell if it's genuine or just consumption
Analyze the gumption, monopolize the landscape
She just another artist selling trauma to her fanbase

I'm on the moon, I cry balloons
They black and blue tonight
And if the homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back
Homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back tonight

Baby, hit me back, where you at?
We on a spaceship
We waitin' under the dark moon
Where you at and where you go?
Supernova stars gon' take us home
Baby, hit me back, where you at? (uh-huh)
We are on a spaceship (uh-huh)
We waitin' under the dark moon
Where you at and where you go? (Bismillah hir Rahman-nir-Raheem)
Supernova stars gon' take us home

Like Lazarus, I was dead for three whole nights
Alakazam, I shook back like casino dice
Satan call me magical negro
Cool, you got that
I popped on the world stage with my AK cocked back
Saw the Roth' family in half to get my clout back
In the heart of Knightsbridge, pullin' bunnies out top hats
Everywhere I step foot I leave a trail of names of the sons of Yakub
In a trail of flames, I'm on fire
I'm plugged in directly to Messiah
I run with the mighty Conners, we expose the liars
These infidels killed my mom, it's all-out war now
I swear on the Mahdi to never put my sword down
The crescent and the star with the red in the foreground
Is the flag that I bang as I'm layin' the law down
Stab us, the beach head behind enemy lines now
I'm Pink Floyd in Berlin, I'm tearin' the wall down
Face to face, I bet nary a devil would test me
And some fuckboy 85er would come run up and press me
It's all a hoax, quite simple, a joke like Zelenskyy
The imams, the rabbis, and the pope incidentally
Couldn't stop my boat, God from quotin' quotes from the senseis
If anybody asks, tell 'em Farrakhan sent me
It's the war of armageddon and I'm beggin' the listener
If you ain't fightin' that mean you either dead or a prisoner

I'm on the moon, I cry balloons
They black and blue tonight
And if the homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back
Homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back tonight
I'm on the moon, I cry balloons
They black and blue tonight
And if the homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back
Homie in the back, then tell him to hit me back
