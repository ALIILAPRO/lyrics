		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything has been said before
There's nothing left to say anymore
When it's all the same
You can ask for it by name

Babble babble bitch bitch
Rebel rebel party party
Sex sex sex and don't forget the violence
Blah blah blah got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing along

Babble babble bitch bitch
Rebel rebel party party
Sex sex sex and don't forget the violence
Blah blah blah got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing

Are you motherfuckers ready
For the new shit?
Stand up and admit
Tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it? no
Do we want it? yeah
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

Babble babble bitch bitch
Rebel rebel party party
Sex sex sex and don't forget the violence
Blah blah blah got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing along

Everything has been said before
There's nothing left to say anymore
When it's all the same
You can ask for it by name
Are you motherfuckers ready
For the new shit?
Stand up and admit,
Tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it? no
Do we want it? yeah
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

And now it's you know who
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why, you don't care
And now it's you know who
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why, you don't care

And now it's you know who
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why, you don't care
And now it's you know who
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why, you don't care

Babble babble bitch bitch
Rebel rebel party party
Sex sex sex and don't forget the violence
Blah blah blah got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing.

Are you motherfuckers ready
For the new shit?

Tomorrow's never coming

Stand up and admit
So let us entertain you

Blah blah blah blah everybody sing along
