		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lady, I know it will hurt you
But it's much harder to ignore
There is a chance and I promise
I won't hurt you anymore

Hollywood nights, we're romancin'
You can trust me anytime
Somewhere, oh babe, there is someone
Oh, you're dancin' in my mind

Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
I'm your fool, come on
Teach me the rules
I will send an S.O.S. for love
Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
I'm your fool, you need love

Like I do
I will send an S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop

If loving you is wrong, babe
Oh, I don't wanna be right
I've got you under my skin, babe
Oh, baby, hold me tight
I'm ready for our romance
I wait a million years for you
I love you more than I'm sayin'
Baby, that's for me the truth

Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
I'm your fool, come on
Teach me the rules
I will send an S.O.S. for love
Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
I'm your fool, you need love
Like I do
I will send an S.O.S. for love

Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop

Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop
