		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wouldn’t know if it kept calling
My melatonin isn’t forming
Was kinda hoping, you wouldn’t notice, I had a moment
Should I go if I get bored of being lonely?
Are you lonely?
There’s a new me paying old fees in the front seat
So I won’t be anywhere for any other
Count down from three, and breathe, can you handle it?
‘cause damned if I won't be digging in my heels
Coalescing all our favourite evenings
I’m waiting on my dreams to come and get me
‘cause Hell, it’s been a ride
Shoulda known it’d get boring
In the hellscape, I was first place
to the coffin, in the garden, it was creaking
So I won’t be anywhere for any other
Count down from three, and breathe, can I handle it?
‘cause damned if I won’t be digging in my heels
Coalescing every other ending
I’m waiting on my dreams to come and get me
‘cause Hell, it’s been a ride
‘cause damned if I can’t be all that I would need
It’s a lesson, one I’m never learning
Who have I been kidding?
I’m dealing with it all alright
I’m setting free
