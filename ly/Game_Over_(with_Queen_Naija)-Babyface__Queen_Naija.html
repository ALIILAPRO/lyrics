		  What do I do?
(The game is over)
What do I do?

You must got me fucked up
Nigga, you must got fucked up
Can't believe you had me all up in my feelings, thought you lucked up (lucked up)
You thought you had a dumb one
Probably thought that I wasn't paying attention but I'm on to you
And I can see that dog in you (see the dog in you)
Especially when you started acting out irrationally
Givin' your energy to hoes who ain't even half of me
Nigga, that's blasphemy (yeah, yeah)

What do I do, what do I do, what do I do (what do I do)
Now that I know the truth, I know the truth, fuckin' with you, you?
(I don't wanna leave) I don't wanna leave
(But I gotta go) but I gotta go (this is not for me)
Yeah, you had a good run, had your fun, now I'm done and your game is over
(I don't wanna leave) I don't wanna leave
(But I gotta go) but I gotta go (this is not for me)
Yeah, you had a good run, had your fun, now I'm done and your game is over

You finessed me into thinking you were solid (solid)
All that sweet shit you was talkin' wasn't valid (valid)
You only think about yourself, boy, you so selfish, and you're childish
You don't turn me on no more, instead you turn me off (turn me off)
Always get mad 'bout little petty shit, it turns me off (turns me off)
You never take me on no dates and you don't show me off
I wonder why you never show me off, oh

What do I do, what do I do, what do I do (what do I do?)
Now that I know the truth, I know the truth, fuckin' with you?
I don't wanna leave (I don't wanna leave), I don't wanna leave
(But I gotta go) but I gotta go (this is not for me)
Yeah, you had a good run, had your fun, now I'm done and your game is over
(I don't wanna leave) I don't wanna leave
(But I gotta go) but I gotta go (this is not for me)
Yeah, you had a good run, had your fun, now I'm done and your game is over

What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
Why do you ask when you already know?
Now that I know the truth, I know the truth, fuckin' with you
If it ain't so, ayy

Don't wanna keep runnin' in circles (circles)
It doesn't have to be this hurtful (hurtful)
I know you wanna leave but you can't go (you can't go, but I gotta go)
Why you wanna spend tomorrow (tomorrow)
Wastin' all your time in sorrow? (In sorrow)
I know wanna leave so you should go (you can go, ooh, I don't wanna leave)

(I don't wanna leave) I don't wanna leave (I don't wanna go)
(But I gotta go) but I gotta go (this is not for me)
Yeah, you had a good run, had your fun, now I'm done and your game is over
(I don't wanna leave) I don't wanna leave
(But I gotta go) but I gotta go (this is not for me)
Yeah, you had a good run, had your fun, now I'm done and your game is over
(Game is over)

Over, over
The game is over, over, oh
The game is over
