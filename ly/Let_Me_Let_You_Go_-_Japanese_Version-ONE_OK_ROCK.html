		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, oh
Girl
Why'd you let me let you go?

Bullets in the dark
Shooting through my hesitating heart
We were never gonna go far
'Cause I'm no good at loving

Someone else good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue to tell the truth

It's breaking me, I'm not just losing you
I'm losing what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you go? 
Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?

Wish you made me stay
Wish you didn't let me run away
'Cause you knew that I would never change
'Cause I'm not good at lying

To Someone else good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue to tell the truth

It's breaking me, I'm not just losing you
I'm losing what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you go? 
Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?

I tried, I tried to love you
I swear, I tried
But how can I love you if you're not here?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear, I tried
I tried, I tried to love

It's breaking me, I'm not just losing you
I'm losing what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you go? 
Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go? 
Oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
Oh
