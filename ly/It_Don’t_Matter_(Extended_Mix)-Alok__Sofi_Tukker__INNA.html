		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be)
('Cause you're always in my head like the song I can't forget)
(It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be)
('Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody)

Tell me now
Why do I still hear you when you're not around?
Why do I keep thinking 'bout you way too loud?
Wherever I am, mmm

It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like the song I can't forget
It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody

It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like the song I can't forget
It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody

All night long
All night long, I'm feeling like you're close enough
Close enough to touch me, 'till I get the rush
Wherever I am, mmm

It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like the song I can't forget
It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody

It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like the song I can't forget
It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody

If I could sink myself into your skin, I tried to
I wanna bathe in the air you breathe in
I feel you dance in my mind even when I'm alone
Want you to know

It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like the song I can't forget
It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody

It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like the song I can't forget
It don't matter where I'll go, it don't matter where I'll be
'Cause you're always in my head like my favorite melody

It don't matter where I'll go
