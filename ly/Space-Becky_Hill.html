		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's like we're only honest on the weekend
Only when we're out our minds
Now we're tryna swim in the deep end
Different people, different times

You got troubles with your mother
Then you make me suffer
Mistakes I haven't made
And I got problems with my father
It's hard to love another
Without being afraid

Well, maybe we need space
Space
Well, maybe we need space
Space

I thought it would take a conversation
But now we've spent a week apart
It feels like we're losing our patience (patience)
Tryna find each other in the dark

You brush mountains under carpets
Hoping it's forgotten
Until another day
And I just wanna talk it over
Try and pull us closer
But you just run away

Well, maybe we need space
Space
Well, maybe we need space
Space

In the distance
In between us
We can find our way home
And if you want to
Be how we used to
We just need some time alone

Oh, you got troubles with your mother
Then you make me suffer
Mistakes I haven't made
And I just wanna talk it over
Try and pull us closer
But you just run away

Well, maybe we need space
Space
So, maybe we need space
Space

Well, maybe we need
Maybe we need
Maybe we need
Space
Space
Space, yeah

It's like we're only honest on the weekend
And now we're running out of time
