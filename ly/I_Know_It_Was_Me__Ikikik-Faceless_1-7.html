		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just need a g easily
tryna overdose rip the smoke
cigarrettes i'm fed on things
that keep me whole

i just need a g reason be
tryna cope alone rip my soul
slick regret infested mess
that seep my dome

maybe my vibe is different i got no time to switch it

maybe my mind has twisted i got no time to fix it

maybe the lines are tripped an fucking my sight with sickness

but i cannot find the the shit that gone keep my knife at distance

i just existed
didnt get ask if it was worth it
now she just witnessed
me turning to scars to fill the purpose
her eyes go misted
i'm sorry no mischeif
i'll keep all that shit out your house
but i can't keep myself out the ground

I just cant sleep right
pills on my bedside
taking my face
i'm taking my aim
my soul it gone fade
but fuck it aight

i just cant sleep right
sinking my teeth tight
hold on my fate
im fucking afraid
been going insane
for days like

maybe my vibe is different i got no time to switch it

maybe my mind has twisted i got no time to fix it

maybe the lines are tripped an fucking my sight with sickness

but i cannot find the shit that gone keep my knife at distance
