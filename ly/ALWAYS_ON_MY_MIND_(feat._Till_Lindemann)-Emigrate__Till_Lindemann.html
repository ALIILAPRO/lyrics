		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three, yes)

Maybe I didn't treat you (didn't treat you)
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you (didn't love you)
Quite as often as I could have

Little things I should've said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

(Mhm, you're right)

Maybe I didn't hold you (hold you)
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you (told you)
I'm so happy that you're mine (ja)

If I make you feel second best
Es tut mir leid, I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied
Satisfied

Maybe I didn't treat you (treat you)
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you (love you) (yeah)
Quite as often as I could have

Little things I should've said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied
Satisfied

(I'll call you)
