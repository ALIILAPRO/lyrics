		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna be another him, that shit is over
Finally, you found yourself a friend, and you run him over
Ever since the start, I saw the end around the corner
'Cause I know you so well

So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad, you know
So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad (uh)

My baby's bad, you know
My baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know

You know I'm not gonna leave your side, and I can't deny it
Tried to play it cool but I can't hide my true desire
'Cause I can see the dirty in your eyes, my favorite liar
And I know you so well, well, well, well

So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad, you know
So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad (uh)

My baby's bad, you know
My baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know

I can see the way you look at me, waiting to attack
You are on your worst behavior, I want it just like that
I can see the way you look at me, waiting to attack
You are on your worst behavior, I want it just like that (uh)

My baby's bad, you know (oh)
My baby's bad, you know (ooh yeah)
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know (hey!)
My-my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know (woo!)
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know (uh)

So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad, you know
So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad (uh)
