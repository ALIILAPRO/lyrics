		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My-

Maybe it couldn't work out
In the end
Maybe this what I deserve now
Better off as friends
And I know
We're not perfect with love
But maybe
I could be worth it, love

Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
My love
Fall in love with you, you
