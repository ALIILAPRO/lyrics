		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
Watching

All the commotion
The kiddie like play
It has people talking
Talking

You
Your sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving

Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying

You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire

Hot as a fever
Rattle of bones
I could just taste it
Taste it

If it's not forever
But there's just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest

You
Your sex is on fire
You
Your sex is on fire

Consumed
With what's to transpire

And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire
