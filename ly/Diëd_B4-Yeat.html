		  (Yellow, black Chanel hoodie, ayy, CGM
Where you at?) yellow, black Chanel hoodie
Got C's and B’s in it
Zooey Deschanel, this my movie
I just act in it
Steppin' on these hunnids on the floor
And I'm not on Neiman’s (yeah)
Everybody act like they on God
That Perc' a demon i told 'em I died before
They wouldn't believe it (I did)
Your wifey wan' come drink and eat my semen
(Let's go) brand new big body Trackhawk got
No keys in it (Skrrt)

On this X everyday for no reason, yeah (yeah)
I was on my business shit without no tie
(Without no suit and tie)
Said what you want about me but I got ties
(Mob ties) they asked me, "Who the fuck
Gon' slide?" I told 'em, "My guys"
I like takin’ the Oxy’, I
Like closin' my eyes, yeah
So I been shippin’ that gas
I got you on lows and highs (Got your Za')
Yes, they see the wave comin' on
They see the rise (See the way)
Yeah, when we go up, boy
You better not be surprised

Called up Eliantte, flawless diamonds
Then I peed in 'em
Twizzy pulled up with the shh-shh
(Bah bah) , this shit ridiculous
Every time I take the X
When I’m in predicaments (Ride)
Brand new Chrome Hearts what
I mix with VETEMENTS (yeah)
I wake up in the mornin' with
A- and get my pickle licked
Y'all trippin' on that cash
(Trippin') , boy, I'm Pickle Rick
Boy, I triple dog dare you to
Slide, that's a triple lick, yeah
I could get your thot to
Slide with one simple trick
I'm not talkin' 'bout porn advertisements
(yeah) i'm talkin' 'bout, I got all
Of these money signs, yeah
(Racks) off the drugs, I'm a chemist
I do every science, yeah
(yeah) when I go back for the top
I hope my seat reclines (yeah)
Yes, I been rockin' that Alyx
I'm not no mountain climber (yeah)
Call my twizzy a tarantula, my fuckin' slimer
(Dog)
Yeah, I be with my twin, yeah, my twizzy
(yeah)
Yeah, it's a cold world, I rock Moncleezy
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
They asked me how I got this money up
This shit so easy (yeah)
Pullin' up in Range Rover trucks
This shit so greasy (Swerve, swerve)
And my fan paid to understand me
So just believe me (yeah)
Off these shrooms and ecstasy
My whole world been in 3D (3D)
