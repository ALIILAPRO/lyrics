		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it were up to me
I’d turn you into a stone
And turn the lights down low for effect
And I’d steal your cigarettes and I'd be
Softer than I am through cigarette smoke
And if anybody asks, I'll say I
Did it as a joke, so
But how about his loneliness
He gets it from his mom
100 dollars for his haircut
But a smile from God
And when he touches you you’ll wonder how
He keeps his hands so soft
He got some money from his grandma
Guess he’ll never have a job

Oh pretty boy (pretty boy)
Don’t speak (don't speak)
You pretty boys (pretty boys)
Are only good for one thing (for one thing)

But anyways
That isn’t even what I meant to say
I meant to sing a song to
You to make you fall asleep
And I wouldn’t have to talk to you
And you wouldn’t talk to me
But I could lay on top of you
And soak in all your heat
Don’t let them catch you crying, boy
If it didn’t really hurt
She took a drink to jog her
Memory but it didn’t really work
She meant to sing a song
But couldn’t memorize the words
She only knew the chorus she had
To mumble through the verse

Oh pretty boy (pretty boy)
Don’t think (don't think)
You pretty boys (pretty boys)
Are only good for one thing (for one thing)
