		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Music: M. Korsback. Lyrics: M. Korsback / N. Dahlin]

[Solo: N. Dahlin & M. Korsback]

The night is coming early. The sun has left us for another day.
And we can't see the brightness. Is there possibly another way?

[Bridge:]
As I try to catch the summerbreeze, I see your smile it fades away.

The sun is rising early. The night has left to take another day.
We can't get what we've lost in vain. The silence strikes us like a hurricane.

[Bridge:]
The emtyness will not reduce our pain. You gave us sunshine, now comes the rain.

With the angels in the sky. We'll be with you in minds, hearts and souls.
With the angels in the sky. We'll be with you wherever you go.
We will cry we will never loose this pain, but we will meet another day.
You're an angel in the sky.

[Solo: N. Dahlin / H. Juhano]

And now I feel so lonely, there is no happiness, no light in sight.
But I know that I must go on. And maybe one day I will see things bright.
Maybe one day I will see things bright.

[Solo: N. Dahlin]

And now I feel so lonely, there is no happiness, no light in sight.
But I know that I must go on. And maybe one day I will see things bright.
Maybe one day I will see things bright.

[Rep. Chorus]

[This song is dedicated to our angel: Johanna Carlsson. We will never forget you. R.I.P.]
