		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm leaving home for the Coastline
Some place under the sun
I feel my heart for the first time
'Cause now I'm moving on, yeah, I'm moving on

And there's a place that I've dreamed of
Where I can free my mind
I hear the sounds of the season
And lose all sense of time

I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean

The summer air by the seaside
The way it fills our lungs
The fire burns in the night sky
This life will keep us young, yeah, keep us young

And we will sleep by the ocean
Our hearts will move with the tide
And we will wake in the morning
To see the sun, paint the sky

I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean

I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean

I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream
You know what I mean
