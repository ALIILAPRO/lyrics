		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Change is the only thing is this life that don't change
It's either flowers and diamonds or rage
Here pass the blame
I'll drink it straight with a chaser of shame

And I don't wanna sugar coat shit for your benefit
Cause you gotta leave and I'm waiting
And you're holding me down
And I got a long list of everything you did
And you better believe that it's staying
'Cause it's part of me now

You said you loved me so many times I forgot the meaning
Your broke down truck at a green light is kinda revealing
You bought me a record to play on my birthday
Don't even listen to punk
Do you know me?
You said you loved me so many times I forgot the feeling

Eyes are the only thing in this life that don't lie
But yours have fooled me every time
Though I try to cut ties, they're too hard to unwind
But I keep running back to you every time

And I don't wanna sugar coat shit for your benefit
'Cause you gotta leave and I'm waiting
And you're holding me down
And I got a long list of everything you did
And you better believe that it's staying
'Cause it's part of me now

You said you loved me so many times I forgot the meaning
Your broke down truck at a green light is kinda revealing
You bought me a record to play on my birthday
Don't even listen to punk 
Do you know me?
You said you loved me so many times I forgot the feeling

You said you loved me so many times I forgot the meaning
Your broke down truck at a green light is kinda revealing
You bought me a record to play on my birthday
Don't even listen to punk 
Do you know me?
You said you loved me so many times I forgot the feeling
I forgot the feeling
