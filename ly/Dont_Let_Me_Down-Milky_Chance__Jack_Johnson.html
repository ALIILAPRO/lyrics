		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I seen her eyes and yet, she got me shinin'
Oh, she really did like no one ever did
I've seen 'em fall and yet, she made the call
And so much in my dream, you never can redeem

Just die a little bit, oh, fly a little
Forever leavin' ground, amazement all around
Please him, please him
When you leave him

Just don't let me down
I'm begging you
Just don't let me down
I'm begging you
I'm dreamin' of a dream that is never gonna end
Oh, you gotta see it, it'll treat you right
Just don't let me down
Heavenly

I seen your wings when they're workin', when they're open
When they take you out, what they bring back home, and
I seen this place when it's full of all the light that comes in
Between the moments, even if they're broken

And I was crawling with thoughts fallin' of pieces
Of things that we believe
Who are we to dream?
The wind was blowin', it's made itself at home
But it's leavin' and you're leavin'

Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, I'm begging you
Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, begging you
I'm dreamin' of a dream that is never gonna end
Oh, you gotta see it, it'll treat you right (treat you right)
Just don't let me down
Heavenly

There comes a day that I'm leavin'
Oh, I'm begging you, don't let me down (don't let me down)
Treat me right, treat me right
Heavenly

Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, I'm begging you
Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, begging you
I'm dreamin' of a dream that is never gonna end
Oh, you gotta see it, it'll treat you right (treat you right)
Just don't let me down
Heavenly
