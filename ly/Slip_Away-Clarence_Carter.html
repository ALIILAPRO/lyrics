		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What would I give
For just a few moments
What would I give
Just to have you near

Tell me you will try
To slip away somehow
Oh, I need you, darling
I want to see you right now

Can you slip away
Slip away
Slip away
Oh, I need you so

Love, oh, love
How sweet it is
When you steal it, darling
Let me tell you somethin' now how sweet it is

Now I know it's wrong
The things I ask you to do
But please believe me, darling
I don't mean to hurt you

But could you just slip away
Without him knowing you're gone
Then we could meet somewhere
Somewhere where we're both are not known

And guess can you slip away
Slip away
Slip away
I need you so

Oh, can you slip away, baby
I'd like to see you right now, darling
Can you slip away now, baby
'Cause I got to, I got to see you
I feel a deep burning inside
