		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You let me violate you 
You let me desecrate you 
You let me penetrate you 
You let me complicate you 

(Help me) I broke apart my insides 
(Help me) I've got no soul to sell 
(Help me) the only thing that works for me 
Help me get away from myself 

I wanna fuck you like an animal 
I wanna feel you from the inside 
I wanna fuck you like an animal 
My whole existence is flawed 
You get me closer to God 

You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings 
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything 

(Help me) you tear down my reason
(Help me) it's your sex I can smell 
(Help me) you make me perfect
Help me become somebody else 

I wanna fuck you like an animal 
I wanna feel you from the inside 
I wanna fuck you like an animal 
My whole existence is flawed 
You get me closer to God 

Through every forest
Above the trees 
Within my stomach
Scraped off my knees 
I drink the honey
Inside your hive 
You are the reason
I stay alive
