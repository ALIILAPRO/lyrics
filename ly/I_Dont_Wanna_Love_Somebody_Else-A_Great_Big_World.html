		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I built a world around you
Oh, you had me in a dream,
I lived in every word you said
The stars had aligned
I thought that I found you
And I don't wanna love somebody else

Oh, we left it all unspoken
Oh, we buried it alive
And now it's screaming in my head
Oh, I shouldn't go on hoping
Oh, that you will change your mind
And one day we could start again
Well I don't care if loneliness kills me
I don't wanna love somebody else

Oh, I thought that I could change you
Oh, I thought that we would be the greatest story that I tell
I know that it's time to tell you it's over
But I don't wanna love somebody else
