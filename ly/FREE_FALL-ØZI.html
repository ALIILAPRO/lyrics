		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  V1:
At your crib
intoxicated
poured our heart and feelings by the fireplace
What you say?
I canʼt concentr0te
Iʼm magnetized, you pull me straight to outer space yeah
Pure electrified, yeah itʼs that look you gave
caught onto something, we ainʼt never anticipated
Risk it all
Hands off the handle bars
Zero-g,
Iʼm in deep, let go and feel the fall

Pre:
Feelin my heart losin gravity
Feelin like Iʼm on the moon, yeah
Goin full force, wonʼt pull the brakes
Nothin stoppin me, Iʼm just

Hook:
Free-a0lling in love with you
Fallin, no parachute
Bottom is where Iʼll be real soon
Can you meet me there tonight?
Straight in it like I got nothin to lose
Pray to God, hope Iʼll be making it through
Adrenaline rushin,
Arms wide open,
Stay right there, Imma be coming to you
Bottom is where weʼll be real soon
Fall with nothin to hold on to

V2:
On my way
Accelerate
Work my way down, you feel your heartbeat racin
You feel the same
I see it in your face, yeah
Donʼt gotta say nothing,
Iʼm feelin your legs and your body shake
I know itʼs been 0 minute since you felt this way
Letʼs take it step by step, work it by your pace
So just know that whenever youʼre with me youʼll be safe
No, I wonʼt ever walk away
