		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better run

Twelve o'clock and the party's getting louder
Johnny's got a burner and an attitude
Came to dance and bubble
But he's ready if anybody wants to try and get rude
1 a.m and the scuffle begins
He sees his friends with some paigon yutes
He steps outside, time to decide if the shotty's about to get you

Run, run for your freedom
Better run, run, you don't wanna see the kingdom
Run, run if you wanna see the sun
We don't wanna lose another one
Run, run for your freedom
Better run, run, you don't wanna see the kingdom
Run, run if you wanna see the sun
We don't wanna lose another one
Run, run, no
Better run, run
Run, run
Better run, run

Five o' clock and Johnny and his crew been camping out all afternoon
Outside in the ride, waiting for the residents so they can swoon
They've been plotting, get the bag, go through the bag
Take everything and move
But what you gonna do, what you gonna pull
If they come back home too soon?

Run, run for your freedom
Better run, run, you don't wanna see the kingdom
Run, run if you wanna see the sun
We don't wanna lose another one
Run, run for your freedom
Better run, run, you don't wanna see the kingdom
Run, run if you wanna see the sun
We don't wanna lose another one
Run, run
Better run, run (you better run)
Run, run 
Better run, run

What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
Where you gonna hide when you see those flashing lights?
Where you gonna run? Where you gonna turn?
When they catch you slipping by surprise
What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
Where you gonna hide when you see those flashing lights?
Where you gonna run? Where you gonna turn?
When your life flashes before your eyes

Run, run for your freedom
Better run, run you don't wanna see the kingdom
Run, run if you wanna see the sun
We don't wanna lose another one (we don't wanna lose another)
Run, run for your freedom
Better run, run you don't wanna see the kingdom (you better run)
Run, run if you wanna see the sun
We don't wanna lose another one
Run, run (you better run)
Better run, run (you better run)
Run, run (you better run)
Better run, run (you better run)
Oh!
