		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was a sweet young boy
I wanted to become a hero
With dreams and hopes
I overflowed
Every day was shinning
I get older time passed in life
Reality showed it's faces
I must avoid disaster
Every day was gloomy
Injustice, unreason,
boredom and unforgiveness
Overflow the world
There is no future
I saw as a child
But still the world
slowly keeps on moving on
It moves so slow
There's the sky, the ground,
and the flowers and life
Look at the World,
it's beautiful
Even if sorrow comes over you
And you are never alone

Sun and dreams and
hopes and life
will sink below the horizon
Night of sorrow comes
And we will fall asleep
and will survive
and we will forget our sorrow
Strife and peace,
this town and breads
All the fruits of earth
Pain and paradox,
Rain and depression
There is everything
You can have anything
keep your dream
Don't give up
There's the sky, the ground,
and the flowers and life
Look at the World,
it's beautiful
Even if sorrow comes over you
And you are never alone
The cords of love
and the bonds of friendship
Look at the World,
it's beautiful
Because there is everything
in this wide world
All here except a hero
There's the sky, the ground,
and the flowers and life
Look at the World,
it's beautiful
All of these
are the fruits of the earth
And you, yes you,
will never be alone
