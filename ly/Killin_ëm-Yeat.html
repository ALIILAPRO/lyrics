		  (I'm working on dying)
(Bnyx) I got, I got

Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round blicks
Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round chops
Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round blicks
Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round chops
Them drugs is killin' 'em, killin 'em
Drugs is killin 'em, drugs is killin 'em
The mob is killin' 'em, mob is killin' 'em
Mob is killin' 'em, killin' 'em
Them guns is killin' 'em, guns is killin' 'em
Gun gon' shoot, it go killin' 'em
Amphetamine killin' 'em, 'phetamines killin' 'em, yeah, and a muhfucker spendin' 'em
I'm drinkin' that dirty, that mirty, that cup, that mud, that muhfuckin' what?
We come from that dirty, we drinkin' that dirty, we come from that dirty stuff

Yeah, I got some brothers who movin' that chicken, yeah
Ride on that bitch with AP, on my wrist, on my feelings, touching the ceiling
Yeah, I been servin' them boys like I'm workin' at Chili's
Yeah, it's Christmas, it's cold, this shit could get chilly
I touched me a muhfuckin' milli', yeah
I'm swervin', this diamond, the jewelry
I'm on the side with the gremlin, gremlin
Pull up and fuck my system, the mayhem
Them drugs is killin' 'em, drugs is killin 'em
Drugs is killin 'em, killin 'em
I'm takin' the Perc' with Amoxicillin
Hit the ceiling lil' bitch, and I'm feelin' 'em
No, you can't rock with the mob, can't rock with the gang
Lil' bitch we not feeling ya (uh-uh)
All this shit feeling familiar
Got the game in the lock and I'm killin' 'em
I touch a mil' every first of the month, that's why my pockets not big enough
Ride 'round the city inside of the Tonka, yeah, but this shit still not big enough
Come every time back from my break, yeah, and I'm all on the charts
When I geek up, lil' bitch, I go to the sky, bitch, I live on the stars
Fuck what you sayin', lil' bitch, you is not one of us, you is not one of ours
Yeah, I made this shit up, but I'm back on the charts (yeah)
Head number one for the month, yeah, stay number one for the year (yeah)
Yeah, I turn up the muhfuckin' metal, yeah, I'm crankin' them gears (lil' crank)
Yeah, I pull up to London with shanks on me, bitch, I'm stabbin' the Urus (yeah, the shank)
Fuck what you sayin' lil' bitch
I'ma do all this shit, bitch, I do it for years (I got, I got)

Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round blicks
Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round chops
Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round blicks
Got hunnid round blicks, got hunnid round chops
Them drugs is killin' 'em, killin 'em
Drugs is killin 'em, drugs is killin 'em
The mob is killin' 'em, mob is killin' 'em
Mob is killin' 'em, killin' 'em
Them guns is killin' 'em, guns is killin' 'em
Gun gon' shoot, it go killin' 'em
Amphetamine killin' 'em, 'phetamines killin' 'em, yeah, and a muhfucker spendin' 'em
