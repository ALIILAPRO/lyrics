		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear the voices echoing around me
Angered eyes that don't even know who I am
Looking to kill again (they will kill again)
As the unknown enemies surround me
Wicked laughter resonates inside my head
And I am filled with dread (and adrenaline)
What did I do, why do I deserve this?
So indifferent, why do I deserve to die now?
Give me a reason why?

Then it all goes a blur, let instinct take flight
Find my hands on his throat, yet hear myself say

Tell me now, who taught you how to hate?
'Cause it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way, you become
Dead to everyone

A father's pride, my son walking beside me
I look around and marvel at the children play
In perfect disarray (so innocent)
No judgment, pure exhilaration
Black to white, the colors aren't on their minds
Nothing predefined (all different)
There's always one who plants an evil seed and
Preaches fear to pull you to the other side
Into a world of lies

Everything is unsure when you've lost your sight
Can it still be if you're what made you this way?

Tell me now, who taught you how to hate?
'Cause it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way you become
Dead to everyone (you're not anyone)

Oh, oh

Lost all innocence
Invested in arrogance, you burn all your life (no telling you)
No deliverance, consumed by the best events of hate
Don't deny
Deep in your heart does it still remain?
Do you think you can bring it back to life again?
Is it still in your soul? (No saving you)
Where's the deviant?
The unholy remnant that has made you this way?
Lay before the disdain

Tell me who, who taught you how to hate
Because it isn't your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way you become (you become)

Tell me now, who taught you how to hate
'Cause it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way you become (you become)

You become
Dead to everyone
(You're not anyone)
