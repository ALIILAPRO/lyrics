		<p>
		  Hey-oh-oh-la-la (Vierre Cloud)
Hey-oh-oh
Hey-oh-oh-la-la 
Hey-oh-oh

A new kind of love
Genetically altered
Enough of love life
And I can't believe it's not love
I can't help myself
And you don't have to say that
It sparks across flesh
You'll feel it kicking in soon

Are you falling in love?
I have a feeling you are
Are you falling in love
With a feeling?

Hey-oh-oh-la-la 
Hey-oh-oh
Hey-oh-oh-la-la 
Hey-oh-oh

So you're running late
And it's not even like you
You were doing so well
Did the dog eat your homework again?
I can't help myself (hey-oh-oh)
'Cause my friend says in real life
"It's only the police that ever come looking for you" (hey-oh-oh)

Are you falling in love?
I have a feeling you are
Are you falling in love
With a feeling?

Are you falling in love
Or only feeling you are?
'Cause if you're falling in love
Let me feel it

I've been busy, you know that
You know you're just saying that
Are you going to get that?
What's that supposed to mean?

I've been busy, you know that
You know you're just saying that
Are you going to get that?
What's that supposed to mean?
