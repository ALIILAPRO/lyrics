		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're already past temptation
We've already crossed that line
And, baby, when you saw me naked
I've never felt more alive

Love's a risky bid
Play me like roulette
Don't think with your head
Yeah, I don't ask for much
Just all of your love

Baby, don't think twice, na-na
One second can change your life, na-na
Trust the way you feel tonight, na-na
Heaven is a shot in the dark
So shoot with your heart
And don't think twice, na-na
One second can change your life, na-na
Trust the way you feel tonight, na-na
Heaven is a shot in the dark
So shoot with your heart
Don't think twice

Am I drunk or am I dreamin'? (Am I dreamin'?)
'Cause, babe, I've never seen this clear (before)
This could be your best investment (best investment)
If you just stay right here

Love's a risky bid (hey, yeah)
Play me like roulette (hey, yeah)
Don't think with your head (no, no, no, no)
Yeah, I don't ask for much (hey, yeah)
Just all of your love (hey, yeah)

Baby, don't think twice, na-na
One second can change your life, na-na
Trust the way you feel tonight, na-na
Heaven is a shot in the dark
So shoot with your heart
And don't think twice

(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
You better love
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Come to me, ooh
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ooh, yeah
Shoot for the starts, shoot for your heart
And aim for love

Love's a risky bid (na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Play me like roulette (and love somebody)
Don't think with your head (na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Don't think with your head (you better love somebody)
Love's a risky bid
Play me like roulette (na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Don't think with your head

Baby, don't think twice, na-na
One second can change your life, na-na
Trust the way you feel tonight, na-na
Heaven is a shot in the dark
So shoot with your heart
And don't think twice, na-na
