		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't be sleeping, keep on wakin'
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside, I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can't keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Can't you see it? I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
Oh, I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby, yeah
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
Ooh, I got to say
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I'm sorry, oh, I promise
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)

Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
