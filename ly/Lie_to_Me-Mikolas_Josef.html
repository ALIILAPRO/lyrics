		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, oh she a good girl at home
But, her skirt goes up like Marilyn Monroe's
Papa likes the drama, mama hotter then lava
She rocking high heels Prada, her face like Madonna
By the way she moved, got me making a puddle
Baby I already knew you would be nothing but-a trouble
Damn it everybody knows she never loved for real
Honey bunny up all night wannabe couple goals queen

I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo
When you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmm
But goddamn it, come and count to three, now sit down GGY
I'm on fire

So, come and lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new, I always knew
So come and give it to me

When the beat dropped, she dropped, dropped it like it's hot
And now without a second thought she got me doing what I'm not
Then it got heavy, Mom I'm feeling home already
But steady plenty motherfuckers wanna eat my spaghetti
Then she got one of my friends
She got him dripping on wood
I know it hurts so bad but it feels so good
Quit sweet-talking me now baby I don't give a fuck
You should've thought about me before you fucked him at the club

I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo
When you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmm
But God damn it, come and count to three, now sit down GGY
I'm on fire

So, come and lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new, I always knew
So come and give it to me

You know I like it
When you lie, lie, lie
You look so good
When you lie, lie, lie
Set my camel in the mood
When you lie, lie, lie
When you lie, lie, lie

So, come and lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new, I always knew
So come and give it to me
