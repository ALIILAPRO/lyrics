		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you have lost the power
That used to lift your feet
And all you have is anger
For all the things you've seen

Believe we grow in numbers
The seed will give a tree
Life has a road for difference
Close your eyes and you'll see
Gold in your pain

Something's coming up
Something's coming up 
My friend,
It's all around
Something's coming up 
The wind is full of hands to help

The only way to live in
A world that doesn't care
Of how you could breathe in
A non-dreaming air
Is to believe in the next day
Seek beauty everywhere
The wind will lift my fears
The shadows of the day
Hope is in my veins
Something's coming up
Something's coming up
My friend
I know by now
Something's coming up
The wind is full of hands to help

When the weight is so strong
And I can feel my eyes
Burning all day long
From the fire of my cries
I remember the tree
That came out of the pain
I remember how beauty
Sometimes comes out of the rain
Time is my strength

Something's coming up
Something's coming up
My friend,
Its all around
I know that now
Something's coming up
The wind is full of hands to help

Seeds of gold
Seeds of gold
Seeds of gold

Something's coming up
Something's coming up
My friend, I know by now
Something's coming up 
The wind is full of hands to help

Seeds of gold
Seeds of gold
