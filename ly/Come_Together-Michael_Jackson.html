		  Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

Here come old flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He's got ju-ju eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker
He just do what he please
Check

He wear no shoeshine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is
You got to be free

Come together, right now
Over me

He bag production
He's got walrus gumbo
He got Ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knees
Hold you in his arm 
'Til you can feel his disease

Come together, right now
Over me

Ah, come together, baby
Woo, ah
Come together, baby
Come together
Come together, oh yeah

He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one mojo filter
She say one and one and one is three
Got to be good looking
'Cause he's so hard to see

Come together, right now
Over me, yeah
