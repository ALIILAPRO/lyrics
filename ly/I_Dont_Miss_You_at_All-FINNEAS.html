		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear I don't
Miss you at all
And I barely still remember
Who's in the pictures on my wall
'Cause, no, I can't
Recall your scent
Jasmine, tuberose and lily
Or your silly French accent
All but forgotten
About those eyes
The shade of green that if he'd seen
Would make F. Scott Fitzgerald cry

But I won't
Break down at two A.M. and call
'Cause I don't
Miss you at all

And I'm sleepin' fine
I don't mean to boast
But I only dream about you
Once or twice a night at most
And it feels so good
Eating alone
I don't get distracted by your smile
And miss the green lights drivin' home
No sign of stoppin'
The house isn't far
But I think our song is comin' on
And now I wanna crash the car

But I won't
Make that mistake again and fall
So I say I don't
Miss you at all
And someday I won't
Miss you at all
