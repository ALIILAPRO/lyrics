		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't take yourself so seriously
Look at you all dressed up for someone you never see
You're here for a reason but you don't know why
You're split and uneven your hands to the sky
Surrender yourself

And I wonder why I tear myself down
To be built back up again
Oh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again
All that's left of myself
Holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down
And hope I wake up young again
Hope I wake up young again

Don't let those demons in again (mhm hmm)
I fill the void up with polished doubt, fake sentiment
Surrender yourself

And I wonder why I tear myself down
To be built back up again
Oh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again
All that's left of myself
Holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down
And hope I wake up young again
Hope I wake up young again
Hope I wake up young again

Why won't you take me seriously
Look at me all fucked up over someone I'll never meet

And I wonder why I tear myself down
To be built back up again
Oh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again
All that's left of myself
Holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down
And hope I wake

I wonder why I tear myself down
To be built back up again
Oh I hope some how I wake up young again
All that's left of myself
Holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down
And hope I wake up young again
Hope I wake up young again
Hope I wake up young again
