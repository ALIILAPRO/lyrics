		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles within my brain (cocaine)

Something blowing in my head
Winter's ice, it soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

My eyes are blind but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the trees
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me

Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow

Right
Don't you think I know what I'm doing?
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one that's really the loser
This is where I feel I belong (right)

Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
