		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There go the street lights
The night's officially on
I got the green light
To do whatever I want
Gonna stand outside, the box
And put the rules on hold
Tonight

Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)

Hey baby, I see you looking over here, baby
Are you gonna keep looking or get up?
And talk to me
Here's an opportunity that you don't wanna miss tonight

Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)

Do what you wanna do
Tonight the world does not exist
No, no, no, no
Move how you wanna move
All my girls work it out, like this
Give me room to shake, shake, shake

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)

All night don't stop
Who cares? Let's rock
All night, don't stop (don't stop, don't stop)
Who cares? Let's rock

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Hey baby
Ohh

All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop, stop, stop)
