		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
You're gonna make me cry

You're gonna make me cry

Precious kisses, words that burn me
Don't you know that lovers never ask you why? (Ask you why)
In my heart, the fire's burning (my heart)
Don't you know that lovers shouldn't make you cry?

You're gonna make me cry
Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
You're gonna make me cry
