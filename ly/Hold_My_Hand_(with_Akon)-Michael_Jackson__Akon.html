		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Oh, alright
Ooh, Akon and MJ
Oh, yeah (yeah)

This life don't last forever (hold my hand)
So tell me what we're waiting for (hold my hand)
We're better off being together (hold my hand)
Being miserable alone (hold my hand)

'Cause I been there before and you've been there before
But together we can be alright (alright, yeah)
'Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight (ooh, yeah)

So if you just hold my hand
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can (hold my hand)
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just hold (ooh)
Hold my (hold), hold my (hold), my hand (hold my hand)

The nights are gettin' darker (darker, hold my hand, oh)
And there's no peace, inside (inside, hold my hand, yeah)
So why make our lives harder? (Hold my hand, yeah)
By fighting love tonight, baby (so hold)

'Cause I been there before and you've been there before
But together we can be alright (alright)
'Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight (yeah)

'Cause you could just hold my hand
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can (if you just, if you just)
Things will go better if you just hold my hand (yeah)
Nothing can come between us if you just hold
Hold my (hold), hold my (hold), hold my hand (hold my hand)

I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (yeah)
Take my hand don't let go, baby, hold me (yeah)
Come to me and let me be your one and only (hold my hand)
'Cause I can make it alright 'til the morning (hold my hand)

I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (hold my hand)
Take my hand don't let go, baby, hold me (ooh, hold me)
Come to me an let me be your one and only (one and only)
'Cause I can make it alright 'til the morning (hold my hand)

Hold my hand (yeah)
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can (hold my hand, hold my hand)
Things will go better if you just, hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just hold
Hold my (hold), hold my (hold), hold my hand (hold my hand)

Hold my hand (yeah, yeah)
All I can (yeah, yeah)
Hold my hand (woo)
Hold my hand (whoa, ahh)
Nothing can come between us if you just (ooh)
Hold my (ooh), hold my (ooh), hold my hand (ooh)
Hold my hand
