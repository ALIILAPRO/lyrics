		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trippin on back from the last say summer
Never tell a pack that I never stay runnin
Sippin on facts, damn know I got stacks
In the lab takin bitches straight for another cat
Lace shit when I never had shit
Bitch move, make your motherfuckin head split
Cost to the lost never really gon pay shit
Tell me ain't really gon chase it
Dreams to the play, no fake
Hands to the way, niggas know I ain't play
Fast to the brake when I switch all day
Stans when I press to the dam all day
Stickin up signs, read "Never mind me"
Point to the ground, stake down to the V
Stay, please stay, bitch you got no key
Never take a seat, bitch you never gon see (gon see)
Play with the cake when I run along back
Change when I say that I stay with the mac
Fake what the niggas comin back to the rack
Late to the game that I watch no pack
Walk straight through, don't ask, don't shoot
Run real soon, no cash, no loot
Dreams fall short, no time, never knew
Never no rules, nigga, never no shoes
See no fued and take never stock
Got no tries on the goddamn block
Niggas think big but you still a mall cop
Limited rigs never fuck with the top
Hands all free as I walk through sea
Eyes on me, bitch can't you see
Tell em that light still lasts if you need
Stack on bags and the gas for the weak

Stack on bags and the gas for the weak
Stack on bags and the gas for the weak
Bags and the gas for the weak

Takin my life, thinkin it's right
Switch in the midst and the point to the type
Watchin my thoughts in the back of my mind
Tellin that I know for fact that they mine
Watch me, I'm solo
I walk with your photo
Take money from the locked door
Bitch move back, what you came for
Swingin down the waterway, take a dip in the plache
I come with the landscape, I run with the wrong day
Tell me, bitch, that I wait outside
Tell me shit that I never hide
Thinkin down with no side-to-side
Break down with no shit to try

I don't know about you, but I'm havin a really great time
There's no way that I can express to you what I'm feeling right now
My heart is full to bursting, except to say
I'm the king of the world!
Whoo! Whoo whoo whoop!
