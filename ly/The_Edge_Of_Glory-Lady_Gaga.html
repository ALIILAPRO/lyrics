		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
But I got a reason that you should take me home tonight

I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight

It's hot to feel the rush, to brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you

I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight, alright, alright

Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight, alright, alright

It's hot to feel the rush, to brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you

I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you

I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you

I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge

I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you (with you, with you, with you, with you)
I'm on the edge with you (with you, with you, with you, with you)
I'm on the edge with you (with you, with you, with you, with you)
I'm on the edge with you (with you, with you, with you, with you)
