		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I brought my antennas to the sea
Tried to connect, won't you talk to me?
There were whispers inside of the concrete and we
Heard the broadcast, the testimony

And all I found was a static state of mind
All I found was a static state of mind
We ran out of options and I saw a black light
All I found was a static state of mind

(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain, baby
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) oh, make it rain
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain

She sat by the road, holding a sign
She ran out of time counting satellites
But there ain't enough space between her house and mine
I heard how she was spending her nights

And all I found was a static state of mind
All I found was a static state of mind
We ran out of options and I saw a black light
All I found was a static state of mind

(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain, baby
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) oh, make it rain
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain

And all I found was a static state of mind
All I found was a static state of mind

(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain, baby
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) oh, make it rain
(Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) make it rain
