		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones
Who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soarin' through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"

Lord, what will become of me
Once I lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothin' new?

How long will it be cute
All this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growin' tired
From turnin' red and fakin' smiles
Are we only biding time
'Til I lose your attention?

And someone else lights up the room
People love an ingénue

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growin' up to breakin' down
And I wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothin' new?

I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh, whoa (oh)
Oh, whoa (oh)

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me?
Will you still want me?
Will you still want me when I'm nothin' new?
