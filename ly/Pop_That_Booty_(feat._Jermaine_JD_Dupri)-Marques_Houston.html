		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah,come on
One more time 
JD, MH
So so Def is in the building
MH and Pied Pied Pied Pied Piper
MH and Pied Pied Pied Pied Piper
We get the girls so so hyper 
We make 'em say dad a dad a da

Pulled up to the party
In a black Lexus jeep (yeah)
Hop up out the whip I'm feelin' freaky (ohh)
All the ladies comes surrounding me
'Cause I'm so important like the H in HCI
This one girl she making my body feen
I'm fed up on hypnotic and ice cream
So I stepped to her like I knew her
Introduced her to Jacob the jeweler

Mami won't you come take a ride with me (ohh)
Be the girl of my fantasies
But first won't you do one thing for me
Baby won't you come pop ya booty for me (0hh)

[Chorus:] 
Love the way you move so sexy (oohh oh)
I love when you are all up on me
But there's one thing I have to see 
Is the way you pop that booty (pop it for me)
I love the way you move so sexy
I love when you all up on me (ohh oh)
Girl take the floor and you'll see
Let me see you pop that booty

MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper (come on)
MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper
We get the girls so so hyper (come on)
We make 'em say dad a dad a dada a da

Girl shake that ahh like there's no rules
Love the way you move in those high heel shoes
So pop your booty like Beyonce'
Got me falling crazy in love with you
Making me want to say
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Girl you shaped like a coke bottle
So let me see you pop your thing full throttle

[Chorus:]

MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper
MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper
We get the girls so so hyper 
We makem say dad a dad a da
(so so def is in the building)

I don't do too many skinny or the runway frail
Thick with it is how we like it in the ATL
Sick with it, pants low with a real wide load
As soon as you hit the door everybody was like whoa
I bet it's hard for you to go to the mall and buy clothes
'Cause your waist is so little and your ass is like whoa 
You poppin' that thing like a Luke video
Mesmerized by the sound and the way the flutes blow
Drink in my right hand, another in my left
Crew right behind me screamin So So Def
Now forgive me if I'm sturring
But I gotta no 1 thing
How in the hell did you get all that in those jeans
I'm behind you grindin
Molding elapse
I ain't never seen nobody pop they booty like dis
What I'm saying is
What you doing is major, the way you keep
Shaking, shaking, shaking what cha momma gave ya

Mami dancing all on me
She not wearing any panties (ok)
I love like it when she call me dad-da
The way she pops it like she from Jamaica 

[Chorus:] 

MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper
MH and Pied Pi Pi Piper
We get the girls so so hyper 
We make 'em say dad a dad a da

Yeah MH, JD, Piper, TUG 
T Scott you a fool fo dis one (oh yeah)
Holla
Chris Stokes, holla at cha boy man
Bring that ish back or something
