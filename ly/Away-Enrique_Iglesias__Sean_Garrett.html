		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Away, away
Oh
Away, away

(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I)

This feels like the coldest day in a hurricane
Looking through a glass window
And you're screaming to the top of your lungs
And the bell's done rung
And the crowd can't hear you
And all that I can see is a building burning
(I just gotta rescue my baby)
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone, I just wanna be here
Would you pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking
And the only one who can save me is you, but you want to

Throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away

You used to ask why was I so skeptic (of love)
Girl, 'cause it changes
And it ain't got to be no real reason
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that opens, and the moment you walk in, it close
(Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help)
Ooh, love, oh, love, oh, love, oh, love
Just ain't what it used to be

I confronted my fears with open arms
Although you said you will never give up on us
But now you blow me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know
I gotta know why you wanna blow me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know why you wanna blow me away

Perfect we said we'd never be
So why is this happening to me?
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (Way)
No way, no way (No way, no way)
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (No way, no way)

Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know
I gotta know why you wanna blow me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
