		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, watching white skies
Wishing with closed eyes
Ooh, run for a lifetime
Follow this answer

I put my pictures down
They're not as good as the real thing
I wish I could go home
You're just nostalgic
Where do we wander from? I'm only noticing now
So be here with me

And I watched the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world

I was setting in stone until I noticed it right
Do you see how you've grown?
Don't be sorry, then
And I fall from your bones
And now I know I'm alive
I want you to find it

And I watch the water unfold
It's the feeling I want you to know
'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world

Thaw your hands now
Put color in your cheeks
I missed you back then
So be here with me

And I watch the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
And I watch the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world

'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I show another way of the world
And I watch the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world
