		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, Double O
I catch your bitch and I hit with the Trojan (Kutta, cut that shit up man)
White diamonds like a dove or lotion (woo)

Pussy young nigga try fuck with the kid
But they can't fuck up nothin', I got on my motion (whoa)
I promise I come for the smoke
Young Double with me and the guns are smokin' (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I fuck on that bitch, get in motion
Drop twenty-some karats, my shit out the ocean (let's go, let's go)
I cop me a Cartier skeleton, yeah, scoliosis (slatt, woo)
Back to back Lambo' with Taurus (woo)
I fucked that bitch with a virus (woo)
I put the beam on the carbon (woo)
I put the Drac' on the Charger (woo)
Blew down that bitch like a Dodger (woo)
Racks longer than martyr (woo)
I came to school tardy (woo)
I was fuckin' your daughter (sex)

Whole lotta bags (whole lotta bags)
FN in the Jag' (F in the back)
Put some hoes in the cab
Put the child in the trash (yeah)
Let it hit like Steve Nash (yeah, yeah)
I get lettuce, that's cash (cash)
I go 'Vette on they ass
I'm not finishin' last (I'm not finishin' last)
I'm stackin' my cash up (cash), I was gettin' my bag (gettin' my bag)
I was tellin' we playin' but Double O tryna spazz (tryna spazz)
I don't need my shit cut, it's snakes in my grass (snakes in the grass)
I'm smashin' the gas (smashin' the gas, yeah)

Pussy young nigga try fuck with the kid
But they can't fuck up nothin', I got on my motion (walk down)
I promise I come for the smoke
And young Double with me and the guns are smokin' (let's go, let's go)
I fuck on that bitch, get in motion
Drop twenty-some karats, my shit out the ocean (okay)
I cop me a Cartier skeleton, yeah, scoliosis (woo)
Back to back Lambo' with Taurus (woo)
I fucked that bitch with a virus (woo)
I put the beam on the carbon (woo)
I put the Drac' on the Charger (woo)
Blew down that bitch like a Dodger (woo)
Racks longer than martyr (woo)
I came to school tardy (woo)
I was fuckin' your daughter

Diamonds, they look like water
I'm fuckin' your daughter, Lil Double O been lit
Everywhere I go, got a chopper
Fuck blowin' up rappin', I'd rather just rob 'til I'm rich
Down with a bust down for the one wrist
Slime told me, gave her a G6, now the ho lit
Uh, since the ho act rich, I put that lil' ho on the move
Slime the boy out, get that shit off your wrist
Can't get no sleep, I'd rather chase money talkin' bricks
Got more money than my opps, why the fuck I'm on dick?
Don't do no talkin', just pull up with choppers and hit
That my twin, we pull up and step on shit
Double O with the scope with the chopper, I don't need no pick
Pen hittin' too hard like a football hit
With seven-hundred FBG, YSL
Catch a body, you gon' get a bag, don't tell

Pussy young nigga try fuck with the kid
But they can't fuck up nothin', I got on my motion
I promise I come for the smoke
And young Double with me and the guns are smokin' (yeah)
I fuck on that bitch, get in motion
Drop twenty-some karats, my shit out the ocean (okay)
I cop me a Cartier skeleton, yeah, scoliosis (woo)
Back to back Lambo' with Taurus (woo)
I fucked that bitch with a virus (woo)
I put the beam on the carbon (woo)
I put the Drac' on the Charger (woo)
Blew down that bitch like a Dodger (woo)
Racks longer than martyr (woo)
I came to school tardy (woo)
I was fuckin' your daughter

(Taurus)
