		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Okay)

Don't have to write me a letter
'Cause I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

We love every hair on your head
Love you like God loves you
And you say that you're scared
My bae, I'm prepared for having the baby blues

Baby blues
Baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

You name your babe Lilac Heaven
After your iPhone 11
"Crypto forever" screams your stupid boyfriend
Fuck you, Kevin

We love every freckle you have
We love you like God loves you
If you're ever stressed out, just dance in the night
If you get those baby blues

Baby blues
Baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

Pink slippers all on the floor and
Woven nets over the door
It's as close as we'll get to the dream that they had
In the one night sixties
And Jason is out in the lawn
And he powerwashes every time things go wrong
If you're stressed out just know you can dance to your song
'Cause we got you

If you get the blues
Baby blues
Just know this is your song
It'll live on and on way past me and you
If you get the blues
Baby blues
You've got us, we've got you
So there's nothing to lose, and we love you

So don't write me a letter
I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear
