		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Percocet? You want one?
No
Oh, don't do Percs?
No, I don't, personally, no, um, but, uh
You know, I got a Perc' in my motherfuckin' bag in there
I put ten of them, pop a Perc' right quick, no cap, I'm itchin' right now
Uh, are you gonna make it? Are you gonna be okay?
For sure, man, come on, I ain't no addict (addict)

Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah
Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah
Ooh, look how I came, I'm the freshest in this bitch
(In this bitch, in this bitch, ooh, yeah, go)

Walk out the bank, all blues (all blues, yeah)
Put that thing in sport, now I'm shootin' at the troops (baow)
They say they all in cahoots, I put a money bag on your crew (money)
This truck might be clean (clean), but the other truck got the tools (grrah)
Please don't try, dip you like some queso (dip 'em)
Hunnid bands, hunnid bands, hunnid bands, shoot 'em with potatoes (potatoes)
Run a bag, run a bag, run a bag, all the way to the 'partments ('partments)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, now we in the cockpit (go)
Look at my shirt, collab of leaks, woo, dry fit (of leaks)
I'ma bring a bad piece to the tropics (piece)
Say she want me to get her geeked, you can try this (hey)
It's charity, baby, it's non-profit, I got this (uh)
This clarity, baby, my VVs is so flawless (VVs)
Number one, I gave her the keys, now she poppin' (the keys)
Chopping up, chopping up chicken like Felipe's, no hibachi (whip)
I just bought that lil' bag from Paris, they don't got this (su')

Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah (su')
Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah (go)
Ooh, look how I came, I'm the freshest in this bitch 
(Fresh, in this bitch, in this bitch, ooh, yeah, su')
Walked out the bank, all blues (all blues, yeah)
Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah
Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah

We the ones made the rules, made it cool and paid the dues
Came in the game screwed, came with tools, same shoes
I got the cotton mouth
Sippin' on drank, can't do the brew (drank)
He poppin' a loud mouth
Feed him to the gang, he gang food (gang)
We went a different route
If the bitch ain't fuckin', kick 'em out (get out)
Won't do shit for the clout
Who want the smoke? Pick 'em out (who?)
I'm talkin' 'bout Arizona, last time a nigga done seen a drought
I done popped a Percocet, yeah, two-thirty, got me itchin' now
Percocet 'fore I walk in and get geeked
Styrofoam cup, fill it up full of codeine
I pulled off the lot, that new V came with no keys
And I got them stuffed crust pies, make they nose bleed

Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah (su')
Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah (go)
Ooh, look how I came, I'm the freshest in this bitch 
(Su', in this bitch, in this bitch, ooh, yeah, go)
Walked in the bank, all blues (all blues, yeah)
Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah
Percocet 'fore I walk in this bih, yeah
