		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where will you go now
Now that you're done with me?
Where will you go now
Now that you're done with me?
I don't blame you
You should be done with me
I don't blame you
You should be done with me

Why won't you even talk about it?
Or even hear about it?
Or even feel about it? (Metro)
Like the covers that come off in the heat
We don't have to lie
We don't have to lie right here
And it's alright
I should've waited somehow
I shouldn't have pushed so hard
I always push too hard
And now it's just a blackout
And now it's just a blackout
('Til further notice)

My mama always told me, "Put yourself first"
I don't really fall in love with women, man, 'cause love hurt
I hit a couple broads, I can't lie, I put my dick first
Now you runnin' 'round playin' payback and that shit hurt
I should've treated you better (21)
Used to deal with lames 'til she ran into a stepper (on God)
Big dawg Savage, I'm a Zone 6 repper (21)
Niggas throwin' salt, but the Draco came with pepper (straight up)
She say we ain't goin' nowhere 'cause all I do is sext her (on God)
Whoa, never knew that I had to propose, no (21)
I was fine with you bein' one of my hoes, for sure (on God)
She say she seen us bein' somebody goals, what are those? (21)
I thought about givin' you the key to my heart, but it's froze

Where would you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where would you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where would you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where would you go now?
Now that you're done with me
'Til further notice (ah-ah)
'Til further notice (ah-ah)
'Til further notice (we'll keep you posted)
'Til further notice (we'll keep you posted)

(Ooh) if energy makes energy
X-rated love, X-rated love
If energy makes energy, makes energy
X-rated love, X-rated love

You know the love was X-rated, it's how we made it
Drinkin' help balance the patience, watch how you take it
Can't keep no pictures, it's too dangerous, a bit X-rated
Took everything up for the takin', I couldn't save it
See red and blues, I hit the pavement, got love, got vacant
She needed angles, I need angels, I'm fightin' Satan
Leave me faded, I feel painless, I go out gracious
I'm tryna feel a shade of greatness by celebratin'
Bring entertainment, goin' brainless, like goin' dumb on my hiatus
She fall more in love every time that I tip
I fade away every time that I-
Take a sip, I been goin' off the rip
I been bumpin' more Coldplay, the world cold as shit
I know one thing 'bout the old one, can't have more fun with it
Knew exactly how to roll one and how to tote a stick
Even if she had to show some' she never let him hit
Always knew she always on one and I can bear with it
Yeah, I can bear with it

Where will you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where will you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where will you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where will you go now?
Now that you're done with me
'Til further notice
'Til further notice
'Til further notice (we'll keep you posted)
'Til further notice (we'll keep you posted)
