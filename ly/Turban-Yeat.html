		  (Y'all are now tuning into my nigga Artist, fuck nigga)
Let's go

Perfect, rockin' a turban (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Sippin' on mud but this bitch like bourbon (dirty, dirty)
I took the coupe out the lot, bitch, I'm thinkin' 'bout swervin', yeah
I'm 'bout to sign for a lot 'cause this shit ain't urgent (okay)
I got a whole lot of money comin' in (All day)
They told me it's a couple thots waiting outside
Told 'em, "Bring 'em in" (okay)
She said that she wanna come pull up and suck on my cock
Told her, "Drink my kids"
I knew all this shit from the start
So I already told you what it all is
Oh my, oh my gosh, oh my goodness, ah
I already did what I can (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
I'm 'bout to do it again (I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)

Got off the phone with my twizzy, we ran it up, yeah, we was doubled up
I call my bitch and she pull up and lick it up, yeah, she's a slut, slut, slut
I had to build this shit up from the bottom, I told her that shit's not enough
Every time they wanna lie about it, I'ma ask 'em 'bout it 'cause they bluff
Ran it up, we so up, we so up, up, up, up, up
Woah-woah, woah, we so up, up, up, up, up
Woah-woah, up, woah, up, woah-woah, up
Woah, uppy, woah, woah-woah, uppy
Ran this shit up from the bottom, I knew I was gon' go
Tonka truck, I'm 'bout to hop in a Ghost (okay)
Told 'em I needed that money to pay all my bros, you ain't even close to us
Told 'em it is how it is, that's how this shit goes
I wrapped my money up, this shit look like a turban
My diamonds flawlessed off, I said these bitches surfing
Yeah, I'm sipping on this mud, it's dirty, it look like bourbon
Yeah, she text me what I'm doing, I told her, I'm busy swerving
Yeah, I got a lot to do, it ain't easy being this perfect

Perfect, rockin' a turban (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Sippin' on mud but this bitch like bourbon (dirty, dirty)
I took the coupe out the lot, bitch, I'm thinkin' 'bout swervin', yeah
I'm 'bout to sign for a lot 'cause this shit ain't urgent (okay)
I got a whole lot of money comin' in (All day)
They told me it's a couple thots waiting outside
Told 'em, "Bring 'em in" (okay)
She said that she wanna come pull up and suck on my cock
Told her, "Drink my kids"
I knew all this shit from the start
So I already told you what it all is
Oh my, oh my gosh, oh my goodness, ah
I already did what I can (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
I'm 'bout to do it again (I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
