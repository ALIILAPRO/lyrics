		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the corner into my car
I drive forever never get far
The 45 is slowly getting loaded
I send another song to my star

California mountains in the mornin'
Stitch it up, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get it off
Take more than your....

Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

A pendulum inside of my bed
Swingin' low, I hope to get hit
The overflow is slow, but not enough no
Another drop will never fix it

California mountains in the mornin'
Get along, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get if off
Take more than your friends

If I call you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man

Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

I shut it down the look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead a' covered in flies
The big sleep without a bed of roses
The light of day will never tell lies

All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
California mountains in the mornin'
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement
Take more than your friends

If I call you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man

On the river into my dock
I paddle throught the shadow and fog
To ponder all of those who came before me
Another piece for building my arch
