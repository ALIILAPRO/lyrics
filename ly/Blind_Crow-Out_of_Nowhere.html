		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With every breath that we take we're getting closer to the edge
On top of the mountains where darkness reign the nights
The thunders talk, the angels watch
Where wrath preach the hatred to punch the kindness
The faith come and wash them all
Horror, begin to play with the anger
Give birth, they name it life
Separate, their lovely child and throw him to hell
Where he belongs
The more he laughs louder the world cries
The more he understands, the deeper he descends and falls
The words choke him inside, lay him to die
He can't stay for long
There's no place for love
The flames of burning lives
Shatter the sky and blind their eyes
The hope digs underground
They sleep with one eye open now
Now the time has come no one hear the sirens
Deaf ears and frosted minds
This is hell where the cowards rule the hopeless
Life is gone and leave them all
The shadows dance around us and cheers
The mothers leave their kids and bury them underneath
Flashback by the time that god preach
This is the gift for the humans
They'll know in the end
Wasted
The flames of burning lives
Shatter the sky and blind their eyes
The hope dig underground
They sleep with one eye open now
