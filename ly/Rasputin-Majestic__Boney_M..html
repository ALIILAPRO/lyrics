		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people look at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Yeah

Ra-ra-rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-ra-rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
On, on

Yeah

Lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people look at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Yeah

Ra-ra-rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-ra-rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

Let's go

Yeah
