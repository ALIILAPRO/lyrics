		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't wait
For the weekend to begin (I)

I'm working, all week long (I)
I dream the days away
I wanna, sing my song (I)
So let the music play
I have to get my kicks, and fly tonight
And when the clock strikes six
On Friday night
I need to blow it all away (I)

I can't wait
For the weekend to begin (I)
I can't wait
For the weekend to begin

I make it what I can (I)
I try, I try
I'm shakin' up my plan (I)
And I get by
I'm saving all my soul and all my pain
So I can lose control on Saturday
I'm gonna blow it all away (blow)

I can't wait
For the weekend to begin (I)
I can't wait
For the weekend to begin (I)

I can't wait
For the weekend to begin
For the weekend to begin
Begin
Begin
Begin
Begin
Begin
Begin

I can't wait, for the weekend to begin

I've got to get my fix, and fly tonight
And when the clock strikes six 
On Friday night
I'm gonna blow it all away (blow)

I can't wait, for the weekend to begin (I)
I can't, I can't wait, for the weekend to begin (I)
I can't, I can't wait, for the weekend to begin (I)
