		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking on glass is getting old
You look for my stare
My shoulder's getting cold
It's hard to hide, I don't care
Recall a moment when I made you smile just because
And that's where I'll be
With my, my crooked halo above (halo above, halo above)

Our crooked halos
A fallen angel and the devil's son
But our crooked halos
Aren't fooling anyone
(Our crooked halos)

Seems like forever that I've been hugging rose stems
Fed you flowers to rid the bitter taste left by them
Recall a moment when I made you cry just because
And that's where I know we'll be, our crooked halos above

Our crooked halos
A fallen angel and the devil's son
But our crooked halos
Aren't fooling anyone
(Our crooked halos)

Blindly I reach for your hands
Chain them with mine
Forced to drag me along
Lest you leave me behind
Till death do we rot
Trapped my heart in a cell
Tied a permanent knot
Around a match made in hell

(Our crooked) halos
A fallen angel and the devil's son
Our crooked halos
Aren't fooling anyone

Halos
A fallen angel and the devil's son
But our crooked halos
Aren't fooling anyone
(Our crooked halos)
