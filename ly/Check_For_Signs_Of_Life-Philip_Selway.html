		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coming back again
To what I know is not the same
It feels all out of place

Goofing days abide my time
Hope lies between the lines
It's in the cracks we wait

So let some daylight get in
Check for signs of life
There's dust on everything
I say your name
It sounds different, now you're gone
Well, this life has changed and shaped us all
And this life has changed forevermore

I couldn't be alone tonight
I need you hear by my side
I'm lost without you now
All the walls are closing in
Memories of a life has been
Traces all around

So let some daylight get in
Check for signs of life
There's dust on everything
I say your name
It sounds different, now you're gone
Well, this life has changed and shaped us all
And this life has changed forevermore

I'm crawling
Dear God, it hurts to be alone
I'm crawling
God, it's a curse to be alone

So let it show
Don't let the silence grow
I'll wait for you here
Go to sleep
And find a place to dream
