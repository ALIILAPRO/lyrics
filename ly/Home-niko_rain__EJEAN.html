		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Niko rain, this a hit yeah

Let go
Know I miss you so
And when you're feeling lost
Just know you're not alone
Yeah
And though
You know I miss you so
Although the road is long
I know we'll make it home
Yeah

It's been a long time
Since I've felt your comfort
The warmth that fills my room
I don't need another empty palace
Yeah
My castle's made for you
And I've been turning pages
And turning worlds over for you
The road has taken me through
Something scary
Something new
But I can't wait
To show you
When I come back home
To you

Let go
Know I miss you so
And when you're feeling lost
Just know you're not alone
Yeah
And though
You know I miss you so
Although the road is long
I know we'll make it home

And though
You know I miss you so
Although the road is long
I know we'll make it home
