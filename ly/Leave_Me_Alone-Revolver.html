		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will dance with another girl
If you'd love to love to see me do
I would stand right in front of her
Like I'm standing right in front of you, yes I'd do

I could tell her many words of love
I would always want to tell you
I would kiss her so many times
I could never never never do the same to you

Leave me alone, I don't believe in
Friends that don't show secret feelings
And if you go when I'm sleeping I know that you'll come
Back and say that you
Leave me alone, but I can't promise
I will be home, I've seen enough now I'm done

I could drive a car all night long
Just to meet you in the morning lights
I could leave and write another song
But can't help falling out of love tonight

Leave me alone, I don't believe in
Friends that don't show secret feelings
And if you go when I'm sleeping I know that you'll come
Back and say that you
Leave me alone, but I can't promise
I will be home, I've seen enough, oh please don't
Leave me alone, no I can't promise
I will be home, I've seen enough now I'm done
