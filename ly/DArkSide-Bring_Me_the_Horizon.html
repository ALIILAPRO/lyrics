		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sinking under
Think my angel's fallen
Safe place, plundered
Bastards kicked the doors in

Picked the stitches and now I can't stop bleeding
Three in the morning, I haven't slept all weekend
Six feet in the dirt, and the dead's still breathing
Don't give a fuck if my heart stops beating

Hey, I'm begging you to stay
My darkside won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Hey, don't let me out your sight
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?

Something haunts me
Footsteps in the basement
Out of body
But there's no escaping

I picked the stitches, now I can't stop bleeding
Three in the morning, I haven't slept all weekend
Six feet in the dirt, and the dead's still breathing
Don't give a fuck if my heart stops beating

Hey, I'm begging you to stay
My darkside won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Hey, don't let me out your sight
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?

Something's in the way
Don't know what I can say
Memories are haunting me
A sickness taking over
So bury me alive
There's nowhere left to hide
And say goodbye
'Cause maybe I
Maybe I will miss me when I'm gone

Hey, I'm begging you to stay
My darkside won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Hey, don't let me out your sight
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?

Can't trust myself tonight
Can't trust myself tonight
Can't trust myself
Can you talk me off the ledge again?
