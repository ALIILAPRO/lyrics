		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up to the scent of roses
He's chosen
While I slept
And coffee brewing fills the room
With the scent that fills our bed
With the energy to go all day
While love juice fills our spread sheets
Then I fall right back asleep while he drops kisses over me
In my dreams
You never never leave
My heart is yours
And through our kisses we both breathe
Not a care
In the world
Could make us lose
Loving waking up every morning
Just us two
You're here for dinner
Then by midnight
It's hugs goodbye till next time
And the aura I anticipate is replaced by yours and hers
And I know that I'm not one to speak
You don't belong to me no, no
But I'm in love with my dreams that build me false reality
Cause in my dreams
You never never leave
My heart is yours
And through our kisses we both breathe
Not a care
In the world
Could make us lose
Loving waking up
Every morning
Just us two
You never call me after midnight
But invite me over and I just might
Take the risk and risk it all night
While you risk it all for me
You never call me after midnight
But invite me over and I just might
Take the risk and risk it all night
While you risk it all for me
Cause in my dreams
You never never leave
My heart is yours
And through our kisses we both breathe
Not a care
In the world
Could make us lose
Loving waking Up
Every morning
Just us two
Cause in my dreams
You never never leave
My heart is yours
And through our kisses we both breathe
Not a care
In the world
Could make us lose
Loving waking Up
Every morning
Just us two
