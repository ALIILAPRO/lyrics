		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We'll be dancing soon
We'll be singing songs
As the DJ plays
All the love lives on

I know how you're feeling
Everybody's in dates
I just wanna reach out
Hold you, that's my one wish

We'll be dancing soon
We'll be singing songs
As the DJ plays
All the love lives on
And we'll raise a glass
Waiting for the sun
You and me at last
No, it won't be long

'Til we're dancing, dancing
Dancing, ooh
We'll be dancing, dancing
Dancing, ooh
'Til we're dancing, sipping
Tastes so good
We'll be dancing
Tastes so good

I know how you're feeling
Everybody's in dates
I just wanna reach out
Hold you, that's my one wish

My mama told me there's hope in the break of the dawn
I'm saving a bottle to pop with my friends in the sun
Get me, I'm ready, I bought the confetti, come on
It won't be long 'til the time's come

We'll be dancing soon
We'll be singing songs
As the DJ plays
All the love lives on
And we'll raise a glass
Waiting for the sun
You and me at last
No, it won't be long

'Til we're dancing, dancing
Dancing, ooh
We'll be dancing, dancing
Dancing, ooh
'Til we're dancing, sipping
Tastes so good
We'll be dancing
Tastes so good

Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Tastes so good
