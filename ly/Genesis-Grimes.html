		  My heart, I never feel
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know

I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know

My heart, I never feel
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know

My heart, I never feel
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know

My

Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I am the one in love

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I am the one in love

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I am the one in love

Home and I know
Playing the deck above

I am the one in love

My heart, I never feel
I never see

Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know
