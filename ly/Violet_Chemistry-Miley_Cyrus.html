		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave
And your phone is lost
But the car's outside, waitin' out on the street

Tonight we'll just be wrong (wrong)
Ain't done this in so long (long)
We ain't gotta talk, baby, we'll keep the stereo on
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave

Stay awhile, stay awhile with me (oh, oh)
Stay awhile, don't deny the violet chemistry (oh, oh)
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me (oh, oh)
Stay awhile, put your arms around me
Put them around me

When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave
Can I bum a cigarette? (A cigarette)
We could paint our names in black on the marquee

Tonight we'll just be wrong (wrong)
Ain't done this in so long (long)
We ain't gotta talk, baby, we'll keep the stereo on
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave

Stay awhile, stay awhile with me (oh, oh)
Stay awhile, don't deny the violet chemistry (oh, oh)
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me (oh, oh)
Stay awhile, put your arms around me
Put them around me

Fingers start to dance along the figures and the shapes
Mixing all the colors like we're making a Monet
There's something between us that's too major to ignore
May not be eternal but nocturnal, nothing more
