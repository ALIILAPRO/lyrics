		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be touched, be loved
I wanna heal, be hugged
It's just the two of us
Or that's what we swore

And if I've lost my charm
Apologies due, no harm
'Cause you've got ahold of my heart
And I know it's worn

So won't you please
Spare me indignity
And won't you please
Give me some decency
And won't you please
Call it if our time is through
'Cause I know that we
Fall apart when nothing's new, nothing's new

I want to be close to you
But I don't know what to do
'Cause if we are near to through
It may make it worse

And if I start to grieve
'Cause it feels you're 'bout to leave
Forgive me, I'm not as naive
I've been here before

So won't you please
Spare me indignity
And won't you please
Give me some decency
And won't you please
Call it if our time is through
'Cause I know that we
Fall apart when nothing's new, nothing's new

Nothing's new, nothing's new
Nothing's new, nothing's new
Nothing's new, nothing's new
Nothing's new, nothing's new
Nothing's new, nothing's new
Nothing's new, nothing's new, nothing's new

Please, spare me indignity
And won't you please
Give me some decency
And won't you please
Call it if our time is through
'Cause I know that we
Fall apart when nothing's new, nothing's new
