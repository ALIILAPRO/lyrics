		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been feeling like I'm dead bitch
I've been steady fiending make my head itch
Smack your fucking skull and dig a ditch I leave you headless
Restless, I've been wearing plates and armor reckless
Snap your bodies bones and turn your flesh up into breakfast
Witch I want my cane
Flash to the past to destroy every single mistake
Matter of fact give me throat and the pain with the black mag and summoner
Cape I'm going to bring all the thunder and rain like a summoner mage come and
Change my own fate at the gate
Guardian angel won't see me in pain, now my life fading away
I've just been on and off
I dump her she cost a lot
Because I'm a phenomenon
But I do not talk a lot
Wearing a leash and collar now
She shaking and drip it out
She wearing all black when she leave the house
She spit when she kissing now
She watching me bleed and she lick it out
Moons out goons out, I got fucking blades
Chains, snatch your brains rearrange your fucking face
Moon out goons out, I got fucking blades
Chains snatch your brains rearrange your fucking face
