		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on
Come on
Lay it on me
All right

I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, come on (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on, you know (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on, you know (bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad

The word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
And my friends you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, come on (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on, you know (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on, you know (bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, come on (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on, you know (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on, you know (bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again

You know I'm bad, I'm bad, come on (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know it (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know, come on (bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now

You know I'm, woo, I'm bad, you know it (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, baby (bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know it, come on (bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
