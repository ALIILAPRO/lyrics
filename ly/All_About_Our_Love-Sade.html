		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's all about our love
So shall it be forever
Never ending

After all this time
After all is said and done

We have seen some suffering, baby
It has not always been perfect

After all this time
After all is said and done

Darling, we know it
Whatever may come
We can get through it
As if it's just begun
Oh, it's just begun

It's all about our love
So shall it be forever
Never ending
Darling, we know it

After all this time
After all is said and done

After all this time
After all is said and done
