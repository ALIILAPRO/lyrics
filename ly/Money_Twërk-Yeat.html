		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
My twizzy gon' lose it, pull out the lil' Uzi (damn, Trgc made that?) 
Make hits, slidin' like Toosie, get bread like Lil' Boosie
Yeah, yeah, ayy
Yeah-yeah, yeah, ayy-yeah
Yeah

My twizzy gon' lose it, pull out the lil' Uzi (bah)
Make hits, slidin' like Toosie, we rich like we Boosie
Got hunnids on me every day, I got blueys (yeah)
Color of the jeans, I buy Trueys and Ksubis (yeah)
Take the bitch to Margiela, she go (go)
Fuck out the way, you can't ride in my boat (skrrt)
Hunnids and fifties, we addin' up sixties
Fuck money and bitches, that's all that we know
No AM to PM in 7-Eleven
Go double cup Wock' and then mix with a Perc' (yeah)
I might mix with an X, I might go leave the Earth
I'ma boot up with God, he said I put in work (yeah)

They ask me, "What do them racks do?" (A lot)
I told them (what? Yeah)
Make that bitch twerk, make that bitch twerk (yeah, yeah)
Just left the Earth, she go berserk (let's go)
My money twerk, my money turn up (up, up)
My money flip, my money burn up (yeah, skrrt)
I got two phones, one to scam, one to burn on (brrt)
Hellcat do the turn around then do the donut (skrrt)
Whole street smell the rubber, do a burnout in the Trackhawk (skrrt)
Back to back, switch it to the Cayenne on the black top (woo)
How I make two hunnid bands off a laptop?
Eliantte diamonds on me, I'm flooded
Yeah, you not my twizzy, nobody (shh)
You not my bitch or my cuddy (uh-huh)
Yeah, Balenciaga, Margeli' (Balenci')
Yeah, you rock Marc Jacobs, you smelly (uh)
Yeah, came out the beast, out the belly (uh)
Please, don't make me go shh like Melly (bah)
I been in LA, I been in Elly
Canary yellow diamonds on piss, R Kelly (yeah, yeah)
Everything Chane'-ne', everything Chanelly (Chanelly)
I was broke, broke, now I made a milli'
I was livin' locked up, makin' money, goin' silly
Doin' hits, had to buzz, I don't care, I don't feel it (yeah, yeah)
Balenciaga my sweat suit
I got your bitch extra wet in a wetsuit (ooh)
Got your bitch suckin' dick, blow it like kazoo (woo)
Her coochie balder than bald, that bitch Caillou
She fell in love with me 'cause the bitch freaky (freaky)
This bitch gon' cap a lot, call her Fushigi (Fushigi)
I told my fiends I might haircut my beanie
I don't wish for shit in this life, fuck a genie, yeah (uh, uh)
First, I'ma pour up the Tris for the real ones
Second, I pour up some Wock' so I feel some (go)
Then, I'm gon' take me a Perc' so I feel some more
And then take me an X, so I feel some more (so I feel some more)

My twizzy gon' lose it, pull out the lil' Uzi (bah)
Make hits, slidin' like Toosie, we rich like we Boosie
Got hunnids on me every day, I got blueys (yeah)
Color of the jeans, I buy Trueys and Ksubis (yeah)
Take the bitch to Margiela, she go (go)
Fuck out the way, you can't ride in my boat (skrrt)
Hunnids and fifties, we addin' up sixties
Fuck money and bitches, that's all that we know
No AM to PM in 7-Eleven
Go double cup Wock' and then mix with a Perc' (yeah)
I might mix with an X, I might go leave the Earth
I'ma boot up with God, he said I put in work (yeah)
