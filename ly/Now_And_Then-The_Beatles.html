		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you

And now and then
If we must start again
Well, we will know for sure
That I will love you

Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
Always to return to me

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if you go away
I know you'll never stay

Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you

(Good one)
