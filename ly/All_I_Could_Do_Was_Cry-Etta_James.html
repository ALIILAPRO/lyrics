		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At last 
My love has come along
My lonely days are over 
And life is like a song

Oh yeah, yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover 
The night I looked at you

I found a dream 
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill 
To press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known

Oh yeah, yeah

You smiled, you smiled 
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine 

At last
