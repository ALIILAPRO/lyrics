		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just beyond the circle of light
(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)
What's in the gloom and the thorns and the briar?
(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)

There's no mistaking the wolf for the wind
He's been here before and he'll be here again

In my dream I ground my jaw
(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)
I'll be your good man outside the law
(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)

There's no mistaking the wolf for the wind
He's been here before and he'll be here again

Underneath this dome of red
(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)
White dog circling overhead
(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)

There's no mistaking the wolf for the wind
He's been here before and he'll be here again
There's no mistaking the wolf for the wind
He's been here before and he'll be here again
