		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey it's me
I got some news for you
I hope this letter finds you well  

Talk* 

And hey your ducks are going crazy
Come home

Talk* 

Learning how to light a fire 
Seek the easy way it all goes down from here 
What do I have left now from the smoke again 
Now we are strangers anyway 
Welcome to peacetown 

I question my purpose out there 
And I wake and go back to start again 
Time is no consequence down here 
Oh a mile and a half away 
Welcome to peacetown 

So leave me here
Let it wash away 
Let all of them know

I'll tell you when I heard the story 
The free and easy way fame goes down from here 
Dear thoughts are in my mind 
And a waking of desire 
Welcome to peacetown 

So leave me here 
Let it wash away 
Let all of them know 
how the world caught fire 

You should have seen this winter 
But it was too cold for you anyway 

So leave me here
Let it wash away 
Let all of them know 
How the world caught fire
