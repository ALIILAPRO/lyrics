		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You watch the phone
Like it was the TV
If you're all alone
Well, whose fault can that be
Your keys, your bag, the car
They're where they always are

And the light goes down
And all the lights, come on
And they call to me
Oh come on come on
And you don't make, you don't make no difference to me

You look at me
Say what you talking about?
Well me, I'm going out
With or without
I know I don't get far
And we're where we always are

The light goes down
And all the lights come on
And they call to me
Oh come on come on
And you don't make you don't make no difference to me

You don't make no difference to me
You don't make no difference to me

So you fix a drink
Cause it's time to drown
And the clock speeds up
And then it slows right down
The life that we have missed
I think it still exists
How can you resist?

And the light goes down
And all the steet lights shine
And they call to me
Ooh, be dead a long time
And it makes, it makes a difference to me.

And the light goes down
And all the lights come on
And they call to me
Oh come on Come on
You can make, you can make a difference to me
Come on make a difference to me
Come on make a difference to me
