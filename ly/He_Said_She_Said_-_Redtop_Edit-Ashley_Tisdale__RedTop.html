		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy walk in the spot, he so fresh n', uh, huh
He got what he needs, impressin'
Just look at the way that he dressin'
Ain't no question, chicks like, 'oh'

Girl walk in the spot, she stops traffic
She's got everything, like her asset
So Jessica Alba fantastic
Instant classic, boys like, 'whoa'

Baby, I can see us movin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us kissin' like that (like that)
We don't need no more than he said, she said
Baby, I can see us movin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us kissin' like that (like that)
We don't need no more than he said, she said

He said, "Girl, you winnin'"
She said, "Boy, where you been?"
Stop talkin', let's get with it
Just like that they

He said, "Girl, you're amazing"
She said, "Then why you waitin'?"
No more deliberatin'
Watcha doin'? Let's get to it

Boy, actin' as if there's no pressure
He'd do anything to get with her
He'd say anything to convince her
Money spent, two diamond spent her

Girl, playin' it cool, but she's with it
She's lovin' the fact that she's gifted
Everything that he do, she gets lifted
Feels so wicked, lovin' like, 'whoa'

Baby, I can see us movin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us kissin' like that (like that)
We don't need no more than he said, she said
Baby, I can see us movin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us kissin' like that (like that)
We don't need no more than he said, she said

He said, "Girl, you winnin'"
She said "Boy, where you been?"
Stop talkin', let's get with it
Just like that they

He said, "Girl, you're amazing"
She said, "Then why you waitin'?"
No more deliberatin'
Watcha doin'? Let's get to it

One day with you, boy, just one day with you
Everything's so brand new
Every day I think of being with you
No one else but us two
All our dreams would come true
If we just got together

Baby, I can see us movin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us kissin' like that (like that)
We don't need no more than he said, she said
Baby, I can see us movin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that (like that)
Baby, I can see us kissin' like that (like that)
We don't need no more than he said, she said

He said, "Girl, you winnin'"
She said "Boy, where you been?"
Stop talkin', let's get with it
Just like that they

He said, "Girl, you're amazing"
She said, "Then why you waitin'?"
No more deliberatin'
Watcha doin'? Let's get to it
Just like that they

You gonna like, uh, huh, it
You gonna want it, uh, huh
You gonna like it, uh, huh
We don't need no more than he said, she said

You gonna like it, uh, huh
You gonna want it, uh, huh
You gonna like it
We don't need no more than he said, she said
