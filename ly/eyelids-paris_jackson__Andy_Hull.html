		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut my eyelids
So I can't see you float out the door
Burn my tongue out
'Cause I don't want to taste you no more
Break my fingers
So your song can't come out of my bones
Tear my heart out
So the feel of that memory is gone

Now I don't know your name
It wouldn't matter if I did any more
Now I don't know your name
I'm afraid of what's under the floor

Took your memory
Took a few other things from the shelf
I'm a habit
But I blamed it on everyone else
Take a picture
Put your unfettered fire in my frame
Please, forgive me
I was found but I lost it again

Now I don't know your name
It wouldn't matter if I did any more
I don't know your name
I'm afraid that I'm lower than the floor
I don't know your name

(I'm fallin', and I'm tryin')
(I'm callin')
(I'm clean but I'm fallen)
It wouldn't matter if I did any more
I don't know your name
I'm afraid that I'm lower than the floor
I don't know your name
It wouldn't matter if I did any more
I don't know your name
I'm afraid that I'm lower than the floor
I don't know your name
It wouldn't matter if I did any more
I don't know your name
I'm afraid of what's under the floor
I don't know your name
