		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think today is the best day of my life
Gonna rent a bicycle and ride
Around the city, 'round the city from 9 'til 5
I think today is the best day of my life
Fuck thinking 'bout the future all the time
If I'm alone, I'm alone and I don't mind

Movie stars in black and white pictures (mm-mm)
Warm beer and Valium mixtures (mm-mm)
Am I in a dream? Crazy as it seems

I think today is the best day of my life
Saw a billboard, it said something like
Everything, everything's gonna be alright, ah
I think today is the best day of my life
My girlfriend looked worried and asked me why
But I don't know, I don't know, so I didn't reply

Laying on the car, you've got stars
I've got scars they don't see

I think today is the best day of my life
Last night all I wanted to do was die
Right now, I'm happy to be alive
