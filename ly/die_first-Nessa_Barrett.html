		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're all I ever wanted
So how come I'm still haunted
By the thoughts inside my head
You love me, but no matter what you say
There's only one of two ways
That this is gonna end

Someone dies or someone gets hurt
But if one of us dies

I hope I die first
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna ever learn
How to fall asleep without you
Tell me what's worse
Losin' you now or later?
Maybe I can break the curse
And I can be in love forever
If I die

You're my fire and my safety
You never mean to break me
And that's why I'm afraid
'Cause someday, everybody's leavin'
You promise that you'll stay
But that's a promise you can't make

Someone dies or someone gets hurt
But if one of us dies

I hope I die first
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna ever learn
How to fall asleep without you
Tell me what's worse
Losin' you now or later?
Maybe I can break the curse
And I can be in love forever

If I die first
I hope I die first
I can be in love forever
Love forever, love forever

Can't escape it, that's how it works
Someone dies or someone gets hurt
But if one of us dies

I hope I die first
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna ever learn
How to fall asleep without you
Tell me what's worse
Losin' you now or later?
Maybe I can break the curse
And I can be in love forever

If I die first
I hope I die first
I can be in love forever
Love forever, love forever
If I die first
I hope I die first
I can be in love forever
Love forever, love forever
