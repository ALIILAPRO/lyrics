		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her

But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now
