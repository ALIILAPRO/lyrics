		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh

Put my heart on the table
Told them niggas I'm next
All the hurt wasn't fatal
I can tell I was blessed
Stopped my daddy from working
Saved my momma from debt
Told the devil to shut up
Cause he was never a threat
I put my people through school
I was tossing them rent
So how they hate on a nigga
That never ask for a cent
Put my life in a pen
I swear I would do it again
Thought you niggas was friends and still

They ain't show me no respect yeah uh
No respect yeah uh, no respect yeah uh
These niggas talking while I'm talking
Quit the talking
They ain't show me no respect yeah uh
No respect yeah uh, no respect yeah uh
They ain't show me no respect

When I started they hated
Now is happy belated
How the fuck did I make it
Kept my ass in the basement
Turn my dreams to reality
Told myself I would chase it
I don't believe in no gravity
Got it all calculated
These niggas trying my patience
I swear they testing my greatness
Used to say I was basic and
Now I'm rapping on stages
Took the game yeah I raped it
Play the fifty I faked it
Swear to god there's no
Limit's, I'm moving faster, i'm racing
I pray to god yeah all my hands and my knees
Let a nigga go far
Yeah on the ground but I'm really
Out living in the stars
Yeah got a galaxy flow that's the
Reason why I'm finna stand apart
Yeah I swear I'm finna go
Far but these niggas

They ain't show me no respect yeah uh
No respect yeah uh, no respect yeah uh
These niggas talking while I'm talking
Quit the talking
They ain't show me no respect yeah uh
No respect yeah uh, no respect yeah uh
They ain't show me no respect

Yo, Mr one Take I started a trend
Came from a place where no one makes it
I ain't start with no friends
I used to take the bus
I didn't start with a benz
A couple cribs from the music
'cause I started a business, yo
A couple million make 'em
Speak a little differently
I been making hit's since I was
Making hit's in little league
I been talking shit
Started cursing in elementary
I was writing raps while they were
Practice words for they spelling bee
All I wanted was to pop off and help
I turned down a deal cause
My homie was getting shelf
I said that I'm the greatest
I'll always defend the belt
They hate me, they don't know me
They never met me they self
They call me corny 'cause I come with a cause
And use my stage to flip a
Page and get the youngins involved
I never signed a contract because
They come with a clause
Every track is unprotected sex
I'm coming in raw

They ain't show me no respect yeah uh
No respect yeah uh, no respect yeah uh
These niggas talking while I'm talking
Quit the talking
They ain't show me no respect yeah uh
No respect yeah uh, no respect yeah uh
They ain't show me no respect
