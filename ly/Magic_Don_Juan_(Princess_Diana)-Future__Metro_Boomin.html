		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, okay
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Okay, 'Bandz
Let's go
Pimpin' these hoes 
Workin' that magic like I'm Don Juan, woah

I got thick shit workin' that magic like I'm Don Juan
Talkin' poles, I got that bat on me like Ken Griff'
I'ma get vibey, fly a hundred vibes one trip
She was hittin' like that, I called her back so I could make sure

Got that sniff on me, that white shit like I'm Tom Brady
I'ma put a sports car on two wheels like it got hydraulics
The way I be hallucinatin', I had to stop from doin' a Molly 
(You must be hallucinatin')
Two hundred racks when I'm in Chanel get me in that mode (let's go)
I'm back in my bag again, I ain't even bought no clothes
Bam, check off, check, let's go
Pimpin' these hoes, workin' that magic like I'm Don Juan, woah
Fifty thousand in profit on hoes, that's a bad week
Bust my AP down in emeralds, cost a Richie Mill
You play with them birds, I'm makin' you bleed just like I'm Isley
Servin' that dog, it'll make you scream on shit like Lil Jon
'Fore this rappin' shit, I was servin' shit like Paul Wall
I can't fuck with them bitch gon' sign me like Prince Harry
I put the Ferrari on my wrist cost more than a nigga house
When I seen the plug who tried to front me, I'm a cash out

I got thick shit workin' that magic like I'm Don Juan
Talkin' poles, I got that bat on me like Ken Griff'
I'ma get vibey, fly a hundred vibes one trip
She was hittin' like that, I called her back so I could make sure

Yeah, yeah, nigga
You know what the fuck it is (yeah)
Them Princess Diana diamonds ain't cheap
Put up ya fuckin' mortgage
The biggest
Fuck no, they gotta put up they mortgage
Crazy, are you stupid? (Woo)

Them Princess Diana diamonds ain't cheap
I'm chargin' two-fifty just to tweak
Ridin' with two hundred rounds on the seat
Burnin' 'em M's, 'bout to get a B
She make a film just for me to see
After she suck it, let her hit the key
I'm puttin' double-C's on a trish
Get you white money trickin' like this
I hit a popstar, I'm the G.O.A.T.
I got a supermodel in my lap
Bring down the door, junkies in the trap
Fucked off a half a dollar shootin' crap
I put your rap career in my ear
Niggas so crooked, bought the bitch veneers

Pour up the drink, I'm peelin' back the seal
Water on my chain like a Navy SEAL
Loaded on sticks, ready to go to war
Move like the military on tour
I got my finesse game on point
Codeine the movie, Spike Lee Jordan
I got a lit bitch, she goin'
I'm puttin' some drug money on her arm
I get a line on you, we scorin'

Brrt-baow, nigga, we scorin'
Are you dumb?
Them Princess Diana diamonds ain't cheap
Put up ya fuckin' mortgage
That's what we doin'
Crazy, are you stupid, stupid?
Brrt-baow
They gotta put up they mortgage 

Them Princess Diana diamonds ain't cheap
I'm chargin' two-fifty just to tweak
Ridin' with two hundred rounds on the seat
Burnin' 'em M's, 'bout to get a B
She make a film just for me to see
After she suck it, let her hit the key
I'm puttin' double-C's on a trish
Get you white money trickin' like this
I hit a popstar, I'm the G.O.A.T.
I got a supermodel in my lap
Ring down the door, junkies in the trap
Fucked off a half a dollar shootin' crap
I put your rap career in my ear
Niggas so crooked, bought the bitch veneers
Top of the charts they lovin' my skill

Look how long we go for, look what we do for a livin'
Man, we do this shit for a livin'
You niggas is playin' games, man
Stop fuckin' play games on how I eat
And how I do my thing, man
Nigga, do something else
