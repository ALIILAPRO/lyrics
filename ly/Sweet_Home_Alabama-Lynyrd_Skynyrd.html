		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three)

(Turn it up)

Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again and I think it's a sin, yes

Well, I heard Mister Young sing about her (southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A southern man don't need him around, anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the Governor, boo, boo, boo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you, here I come Alabama

(Oh oh oh, Alabama, oh oh oh, Alabama)
(Oh oh oh, Alabama, oh oh oh, Alabama)

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (yes, they do)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how 'bout you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama, oh, sweet home, baby
Where the skies are so blue and the governor's true
Sweet home Alabama, Lordy
Lord, I'm coming home to you, yeah yeah

My, Montgomery's got the answer
