		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy
Lil' 14, yeah

You used to say you in love
I used to say that shit back
Takin' that shit from the heart
Now look, where the fuck are we at?
Girl, you got me just goin' out bad
Love scars and you got me real sad
Lookin' like you had a past
I was hopin' that shit was gon' last, oh

Shawty, I just want your love for a minute
I be captain, baby, you can be lieutenant
Swear I lose my mind every time that I'm in it
You won't get a dime, naw, naw, not mine

Spinach, spinach
I been here for a minute, minute, ayy
Playin' games with me shawty
This is not no scrimmage, scrimmage
Swear that I did it, did it
I do it, I does this, I does it
Ayy, shout-out my bloody, my whoadie
Lil' nigga, and shout out my bousins, woah
I swear I'm bloodied up B's
Never throwin' up, C's
Ayy, these niggas is disgustin'
Somethin' like a disease
Your bitch pussy nasty as fuck
She got a lil' bit of yeast
Gettin all the money, count it up
Countin' all my green, woah-ayy
Girl, you got me goin' out bad
Girl, you got me real sad
Devil in me make me mad
You used to say you in love, yeah, hey
Shawty you so fucked up
You used to say you in love
You got me so fucked up
Shawty, I don't need you anyway
I just sit back in my Balenciaga's
Sippin' that lemonade
Mixin' it with Hennessy
Dominatin' any enemy
