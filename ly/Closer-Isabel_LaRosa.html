		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loose jeans, green eyes
Smiles never reach his eyes
He always seems to be in control
Faded Levis, it's all just a disguise
So he doesn't have to get close

You know, I know
That I see through the masquerade
You're scared to get close
But I promise you'll be okay

I wanna get closer, head on your shoulder
Talk about plans we have when we're older
I wanna get closer, it's getting colder
But maybe in your sweater I'd be warmer
I wanna get closer i wanna get closer

He talks like he knows
That girls wanna wear his clothes
But he'll never give them away (Away)
Faded t-shirts draped over the bleachers
You know they'd look to good on me (On me)

You know, I know
That I see through the masquerade (Oh)
You're scared to get close
But I promise you'll be okay

I wanna get closer, head on your shoulder
Talk about plans we have when we're older
I wanna get closer, it's getting colder
But maybe in your sweater I'd be warmer
I wanna get closer i wanna get closer

You know, I know
That I see through the masquerade
You're scared to get close
But I promise you'll be okay

I wanna get closer, head on your shoulder
Talk about plans we have when we're older
I wanna get closer, it's getting colder
But maybe in your sweater I'd be warmer
I wanna get closer, head on your shoulder
Talk about plans we have when we're older
I wanna get closer, it's getting colder
But maybe in your sweater I'd be warmer
I wanna get closer i wanna get closer
I wanna get closer i wanna get closer
