		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

Come on, Barbie, let's go party

I'm a blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly
You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky

You can touch
You can play
If you say, "I'm always yours"
You can touch
You can play
If you say, "I'm always-"
Come on, Barbie, let's go party

Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Come on, Barbie, let's go party

I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah, ah, ah, yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah, ah, ah, yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party

Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky

You can touch
You can play
If you say, "I'm always yours"
You can touch
You can play
If you say, "I'm always-"
Come on, Barbie, let's go party

Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Come on, Barbie, let's go party

I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
