		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Ha ha, ha ha, ha, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Time I tried to get a better, better half
Poor fool, he doesn't know! Ho ho ho ho ho
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho (ah, ah, ah, ah)
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go

Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
It's him, I know it is him
Your part is silent, little toad
A toad, madame? Perhaps it is you who are the toad
Serafimo, away with this pretense!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my (ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Poor fool, he makes me laugh, ha ha, ha ha, ha, ha
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Ah, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Behold, she's singing to bring down the chandelier

Ladies and gentlemen, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time
When the role of the Countess will be sung by Miss Christine Daae
In the meantime, ladies and gentlemen, we shall be giving you the ballet
From Act Three of tonight's opera
Maestro the ballet, now

Ah!
Raoul, Raoul
Christine, come with me
No, to the roof
We'll be safe there

Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats
Do not panic
It was an accident, simply an accident
