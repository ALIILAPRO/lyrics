And I don't got no twin
Nigga thinking that we Siamese, yeah
And I just make him ran, nigga went and did a high knees, yeah
Shawty asked him for the sun, had to tell her, Pisces, yeah
I've been cookin' in the kitchen, shawty think I'm Guyanese
And I just got some yens, niggas thinkin' that I'm Chinese
And I just did it again, niggas knowin' that they like me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, huh
Yeah, and I just made some bands, and I just made some grands
They call me Triple H, huh, a nigga will get slammed, huh
A nigga tryin' me, huh, I promise they get blammed, yeah
I'm really 'bout that cheese, huh, they call me Uncle Sam, yeah
I hop up in that Lamb', I got that bread like jam
She look at me like, "Damn"
You gettin' money, no ma'am, huh
Eat on that meat like it's ham, huh
Girl, I'm one slice like I'm bread
Jotaro, what is the stand?
Nigga, they actin' like-

(Shit, what?)
Huh, broke her today, yeah yeah
I ain't talkin' cray, yeah yeah
Show me the face (show me the face, yeah yeah)
Out in LA, yeah
I got the blade (I got the blade, yeah yeah)
Akimbo the strap (Akimbo the strap, yeah yeah)
Practice my aim
Ballin' her wrist, I'm takin' 'bout my PJ
I got the blade in my hand like I'm Migi
I know these niggas they mad when they see me
She give me top of the head like a tee-pee
Tap boy ting, everything lock off
Show get lock off
Hoes them, lock off
Close it, lock off
Gyal dem top off
Leave me on read, she gettin' blocked off
I told that boy, he ain't better than me
I told that boy, "Pay me my fee"
I told that boy, "You ain't better than me
Made more cheddar than me, you ain't get it like me"
You ain't taller than me, you ain't ballin' like me
You ain't stronger than me, you ain't rather than me
He ain't bothered that she give me top and she leave
I got that pride and (?)
