		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big deeds 
Big guy 
Feel sus when you love your own advice 
No money too broke
Feel sus got my hands around your throat
Hate it but you love it
Fuck face right above it ahhh 
Tell me that you want it 
Love my lifestyle what do you want? 

This place sucks I'm taking off wrist
Stupid bitch she sucking on my dick ah 
Fell in love but I don't wanna say it 
Fell in love but I don't wanna say it 

I'm not in control
Of my Brain anymore 
They tell me I'm worthless 
Might as well ride dead on the floor
Say I'm just a human
Beg to differ cause I think I'm more 
Well they think that I'm stupid 
Man I love it when I say that they're wrong 

Big deeds 
Big guy 
Feel sus when you love your own advice 
No money too broke
Feel sus got my hands around your throat
Hate it but you love it
Fuck face right above it ahhh 
Tell me that you want it 
Love my lifestyle what do you want?
