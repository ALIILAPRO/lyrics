		  Mi casa su casa

I've been watching you all night
Over on the dance floor
Moving how I like, yeah

I can see it your eyes
This is what you came for
Baby don't be shy

Because you got something I've been wanting 
A long long time
And I got something you've been wanting
That's no crime cause

You got a body 
I got a body
Let's have a party
Mi casa su casa

I got a body 
You got a body 
Let's have a party 
Mi casa su casa

It's a quarter after five yeah
And it's damn near light outside yeah
Said we don't have a ride yeah
So let's get one

They be looking at us side ways
They be thinking we ain't right yeah
But baby it's our life yeah
It's our life yeah

Because you got something I've been wanting 
A long, long time
And I got something you've been wanting
That's no crime cause

You got a body 
I got a body
Let's have a party
Mi casa su casa

I got a body 
You got a body 
Let's have a party 
Mi casa su casa

You got a body 
I got a body
Let's have a party
Mi casa su casa

I got a body, and 
You got a body 
Let's have a party 
Mi casa su casa

I've been looking at you all night long
From over on the dance floor
I really wanna take you home

You got a body 
I got a body
Let's have a party
Mi casa su casa

I got a body and 
You got a body 
Let's have a party 
Mi casa su casa
