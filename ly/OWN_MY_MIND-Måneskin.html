		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I don't know your secrets, I'm no visionary 
Yeah, I don't know your story but I like what I see 
So, tell me what you've been missing
I'll do anything to get you ticking
And you might be the answer to the sinner in me

Oh, it's automatic
You know I just gotta have it
I'll make your body a habit
You know there's some kind of magic, uh-huh

Do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?
Do you wanna, do you wanna
All the time, all the time?
Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?
Yeah, do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?
Own my mind, own my mind?
Own my mind, own my mind?
Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?
Do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?

In my civilization you're the king and the queen
I'm praying at your altar 
If you know what I mean
Yeah, everything I've been missing
You've been serving up in your kitchen
No, I'm not even superstitious
But I'm feeling you're something vicious, yeah 

It's automatic
You know I just gotta have it
I'll make your body a habit
You know there's some kind of magic, uh huh

Do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?
Do you wanna, do you wanna
All the time, all the time?
Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?
Yeah, do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?
Own my mind, own my mind?
Own my mind, own my mind?
Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like? 
Do you wanna, do you wanna 
Own my mind, own my mind?

Do you want a long night?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna go once, go twice?
Uh-huh
Do you wanna a long night?
Do you wanna be mine?
Do you wanna go once, go twice?
Uh-huh

Do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?
Do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?
Do you wanna know what the good good bad things all feel like?
Do you wanna, do you wanna
Own my mind, own my mind?
