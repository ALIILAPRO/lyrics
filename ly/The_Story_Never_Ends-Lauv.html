		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stick, stick to your stones 'cause that's all you know
I was caught in the middle
I swallow my words down to the bone
'Cause nothing's that simple

Late at night, you pour it out
Know that only brings you down

But go ahead, give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, whoa
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And whoa
We all know

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

Wound me like a toy, spinning too fast
In every direction
How, how could I stay when you lit a match
To all my intentions?

Late at night, you pour it out
Know that only brings you down

But go ahead, give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, whoa
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And whoa
We all know

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

That's who you are
Crash the car
And blame the road
Never your fault
After all
I would know

The story never ends (the story)
The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

The story
The story
The story
The story
