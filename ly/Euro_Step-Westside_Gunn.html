		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Conductor, conductor, conductor)
Ayo
Flygod

Ayo, rockin' all Sacai in the 911 softtop (skrt)
Hopped out, big drum on it, had to sort it out (brr, brr)
Peace, my name's West, but I'm from the East (ah)
Ayo, the only nigga that got five bitches with five visions
Open your eyes, listen, this our time, Christie's and Fly
Waitin' for fly bitches, sippin' pain in the rain
Never got wet, this for my niggas that's locked in the cage
Brushin' their waves with a chip bag, drop it like Six Flags (skrt)
Clothes from Fifth Ave, I was broke and got rich fast
How you figure you niggas ill and you illin', millin', and shillin'
Icon, what a wonderful feeling, put holes in your building (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Allah willin', I be touchin' big bags (ah)
Goyard leashes on all-red Saint Bernards
Saint Laurents, water whip the coke with the Avian
They be on bullshit, I be on real time
I be out in France with Clovis, sippin' real wine
Toast to my real niggas that's sellin' dope still (ah)
I be sippin' red wine, toast to my niggas (brr)
Toast to my niggas in the field, still (brr)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, red wine
Toast to my niggas in the field, sellin' dope, yeah
To my niggas still in field, sellin' dope (ah)

"My middle knuckle is bigger than all my knuckles on this hand right here, bruh
You ain't got a scratch on your middle knuckle
You know what I mean, you ain't been through nothin'
You never ate
You never been in the, in the crib with welfare cheese and fried bologna
And all that stuff like that for dinner at nighttime, man
Don't come to me with that lil' punk ass shit"
