		  Guess I'm flyin' international
We can meet, but no more lies at the Oriental
Ayy, ayy, now I'm so professional
I just need you one more time to get it right, you know

Won't you upgrade? I know it hurts
You deserve it, I know your worth
If you think you can't make it happen
We keep it optional (we keep it optional)
We don't make sense, we don't make sense
We don't make sense enough to give this time
But if you'll be mine
We keep it optional

(Ooh) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
