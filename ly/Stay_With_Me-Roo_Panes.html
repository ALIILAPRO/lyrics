		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I've been everywhere, but
I've been nowhere
It was all viridian in vermillion blood
There was a void before me it
Was as deep as truth
Because all the world couldn't hide
The view of you

Stay with me! Oh stay with me you're
Right where you are supposed to be!
Stay with me! Oh stay with me you're
Right where you are supposed to be!

You're my Eldorado you're my holy grail
I found my treasure through
The rain and hail
Knowing I was taller when upon my knees
Knowing you'd back to me if I
Just said please! Please! Please!

Stay with me! Oh stay with me you're
Right where you are supposed to be!

Oh you take me back to the morning light
You take me back to the morning light
The very moment that I found my sight
You're forever by my side
You take me back to the morning light
You take me back to the morning light
The very moment that I found my sight
I'm forever by your side
