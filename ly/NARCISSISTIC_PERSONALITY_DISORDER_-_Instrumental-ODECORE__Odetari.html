		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Off of the drank
I'm off of the drugs
I feel like I'm in slow mo
Glad that you came
Let out all the pain
I'm sorry for your sorrow

Let it go
Don't face it
Let it go
Don't face it
Let it go
Don't face it
Let it go
Don't face it
Rage, love, lust, on fire
Rage, love, lust, on fire

Forgive me for breaking my promise
I'm sorry
Forgive me for breaking my promise
I'm sorry
I'm heartless
I'm nobody
I feel like I'm Roxas
That's why I only stick around them girls that's toxic

You don't want my love
You don't want my love
I'm so full of myself, I'm selfish
I'm so full of myself, I'm selfish
Everybody want some help, can't help it
Everybody want some help, can't help it

You're not sad about anything
Hahaha
Very good
I cannot feel sorrow
No matter what misery befalls the world

Let it go
Don't face it
Let it go
Don't face it
Let it go
Don't face it
Let it go
Don't face it

I'm so full of myself, I'm selfish
I'm so full of myself, I'm selfish
Everybody want some help, can't help it
Everybody want some help, can't help it
Rage
Love
Lust
On fire
