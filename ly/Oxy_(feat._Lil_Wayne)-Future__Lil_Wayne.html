		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see funny faces
Oxy, Oxycontin
For the world
Oxy-Oxy, yeah Freebands
I just told Richie we rich

Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique, Oxy

Medicine Man
Medicine Man taking off never to land
United we fall, together we stand
I pop a whole, she took a half
I'm feelin' gold, she lookin' tan
It never gets old, she never get mad
"We too high to fuck," I never hear that
Cotton candy, sweet as gold
Make that pussy open, close
She take her meds up her nose
Looking like she smell a rose
It says Herm√®s on my clothes
20 mg, that's my dose
I fucked her off one of those
She act like she saw a ghost
Wake up baby, comatose
Wake up baby, vamonos
Sleeping like we on an island somewhere in Galapagos
It's lonely at the top we hold hands, Geronimo
100% cotton oxymoron, oxycontin

Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Oxycontin (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique, Oxy

Matchy-matchy nigga just stop it
Niggas always try to copy
Drinkin' sake
Hachi Tachi
I eat beef, Johnny Rocket
Over the bowl in the faucet
Crank that hoe, John Gotti
Ben Frank, meet the pocket
Pocket watchin', pick a pocket
Richard Mille prolly
Got me lookin cocky
Juuggin' in the lobby
Catching, Jeremy Shockey
Cuban link my wallet, and it's camouflagin'
It ain't no discussion
Had her hit your target
Bentley with the roof
Got Versace carpet
Sippin' lean like soup
Yeah hachi tachi
I'ma pop an X
I'ma try the Oxy
I just tried, oooh
I can't feel my body

Oxycontin
Oxycontin
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
Look at my wrist, Oxy
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Oxycontin (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Oxycontin (Oxycontin)
Look at my bitch, Oxy
Look at my clique, Oxy

Freebands!
Yeah I got some pills
Yeah I got the Perc
Yeah I got this big booty bitch in my vert
And I got a room, and it's downtown
And my white bitch
