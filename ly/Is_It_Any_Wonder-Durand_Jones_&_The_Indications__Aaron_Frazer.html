		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This road is gone take us back now
You look so fine, I don't know how to act now
They say my child, don't stroll off easy

'Cause when it's time, you gone hear what she said

Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?

If you ever, leave me alone
I'll be cryin' wishin you'd come home

Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh

When I look in your eyes I see you starin' at me girl
And when it's time, I see you holdin' on me girl
'Cause you, you got a hold on me, yeah
So, I'm gonna make you see, yeah
Aw, yeah

Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?

When the sun goes down at night
Gone let you know that everything's alright

Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Aw, baby
