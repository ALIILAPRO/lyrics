		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I plugged my phone into the wall
Next to the bathtub, water cold
I didn't notice 'cause you got in my 
headed on the freeway in the night
I'm going eighty, no headlights
I'm losing focus

Thinking 'bout the night that you cracked me 
like an egg in the backseat
Better call me a taxi
(You're so stupid just standing with a cigarette)
And your necklace makes me forget my checklist
You will everything I won't
Now I like the smell of smoke but

I think you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea
I think you're a bad idea
I can't believe how far I fell
I think you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea, we're a bad idea
I think you're a bad idea
But what the hell

Black and green t-shirts in the wash
I shrunk your jeans, the water's hot
You're so distracting, but I'm not upset
I wasn't perfect, I was fine
Now I can't do a thing right
You're how I'm acting
I just can't forget

the night that you cracked me 
like an egg in the backseat
Better call me a taxi
(You're so stupid just standing with a cigarette)
And your necklace makes me forget my checklist
You will everything I won't
Now I like the smell of smoke but

I think you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea
I think you're a bad idea
I can't believe how far I fell
I think you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea, we're a bad idea
I think you're a bad idea
But what the hell

I know they say love can be blindin'
No one said you get absent-minded
I resisted, look what the time did
Goin' crazy and you're indicted

I think you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea
I think you're a bad idea
I can't believe how far I fell
I know you're a bad idea, you're a bad idea, we're a bad idea
I know we're a bad idea
But what the hell
