		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  so the man was tired and the car was starved
and the sun was setting
no the moon was tired and the cow was carved
i remember every second

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
yes i saw the way you talk to your cell phone

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
then i thought about the man with the shotgun

so the man took a shotgun out of the trunk
waited on the hood with the headlights on
radio was playing christmas songs

later on he thought he saw something
realized he never saw anything
now he drives with his headlights off

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
yeah i saw the way you climbed out the window

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
and now you never answer your cell phone
