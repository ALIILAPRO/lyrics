		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me more, I adore you
Can't recall life before you
Anymore, I can't afford to
Give it all, I do it for you

Hold me down for a minute
That's a lotta 0's for a Twenty-six but I won't admit it
'Cept in the dark, step out the light
Way too bright for me
Bitch, I might, bitch, I might leave
But not you
Tell you everything when I get another second to

Tell me more, I adore you
Can't recall life before you
Anymore, I can't afford to
Give it all, I do it for you

I'm devoted
Hours turn to minutes when I listen to you talkin'
Never noticed
But you must've been a godsend
'Cause I needed you, yeah, I needed you
Oh

Tellin' me I should've tied my ends
Tellin' me I gotta watch my dosage
Took too much and thought that I was dead
And I thought of you, yeah, I thought of you

(Tell me more, I adore you) is this Hell or Heaven?
Might be just the medicine (can't recall)
You decide, you decide it (life before you)
You decide, you decide, you de- (anymore)

Is this hell or heaven? (I can't afford to)
Might be just the medicine (give it all)
You decide, you decide it (I do it for you)
You decide, you de
