		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Step the fuck up, bringing that thunder
With my gunners, better take cover
Pull up, fuck discrete, ride with the whole fleet
Shoot up the whole street, fuck it I'm too deep
Yeah, yeah
All my guns just G-LOCK, ain't no safety (yeah, yeah)
My mama gave birth to Satan, no mistaking (yeah, yeah)
All my habits gonna chauffeur me to my casket (yeah, yeah)
Savage grippin' that fucking full metal jacket (yeah)
(Man, shoot that bitch) yeah, yeah
(Shoot that bitch again) yeah, yeah, yeah
Got that heat, pull it out the bag like it's trick-or-treat
Blow his high, blow his fucking mind, fuckboy R.I.p
T-i-t-t-y B-A-B-Y smoking vanilla sky
W-e, double the T, O, you can bet your bitch been by
T-o double M, Y, cruising that five with my lil' boy $lim
S-c-r-i-m, bitch, I'm him, crowned the king of hymns
200K on a Benz and it got no tint so you bitches know it's me
I'm gettin' head from a bitch and this my revenge from when she ain't notice me
Every day I get a call from my boy Kyle, talking 'bout more Ms, more Ms
Coming in, coming in, doubling, tripling, stock price dividends, I ain't got time to spend
Yeah, these motherfuckers hate that I ain't struggling
If I was dead, the same ones hating claim, "We loved him"
Rather me OD'd like the rest and boxed the fuck up
"Scrim, man, use your deep voice", shut the fuck up

Northside, ayy (ayy)
Northside, ayy (ayy)
Northside, ayy (ayy)
Northside, ayy (ayy)

Northside, northside who I be (ayy)
Northside, northside who I be (ayy)
Northside, northside who I be (ayy)

Northside, northside, I'm from the N (N)
Northside, 985, blow a O (O)
Smoke my opps, when they die, rated R (R)
Shit that bitch did in my car, black T (T)
Hide my face with the ski, shooting H (H)
Fuckin' numb to the face, red S (S)
On my motherfuckin' chest you know I (I)
Think I'm Superman when high, give her that D (D)
I-c-k when she off that motherfucking E (E)

Northside, northside who I, ayy (ayy)
Northside, northside who I, ayy (ayy)
Northside, northside who I, ayy (ayy)
Northside, northside who I

We ain't done, motherfucker
We got more for that, yeah (from Northside, motherfucker)
(You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Pull up with the stick in the trunk
Runnin' 'round smellin' like funk
Duckin', I'm off of that junk
Baddest bitch up in the front
Got my whip slidin' on blades
Run through the North like a maze
Ride with the gang like parades
Wetto been sicker than AIDS
Motherfuckers know that when I say go
I mean it right now, not a minute
Switchin' up my image, I'ma push it to the limit
Cookin' boys like a motherfuckin' skillet
You don't want a visit, have them killers punch your ticket
Have 'em shootin' 'til the whole clip finished
Hoes want Slick, yeah they all dick-sick, every bitch I hit like a pin-up

Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, okay, go

Don't know what I'm smokin' on, but this shit deadly
All these brokeboys smoking mojo mixed with reggie
I'm in that you can't see me bitch and you won't catch me
Spent 250 on my diamonds just for flexing
Got that plug up on that drank like I'm from Texas
Back to my diamonds, I just bought it, not to wear it
I can't spend money fast enough, shit gettin' scary
I'm that ghost that haunt your dreams, that Bloody Mary
I'm that fiend, killer of dreams
Pushing that buggy, uh
Bitches wanna fuck me, might let her touch me if she lucky
Bust out the blade, I go insane, laughing like Chucky
Fuck what they say, I'll push in they lane and make myself comfy
