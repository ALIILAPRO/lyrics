		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen it all
I have seen the trees
I have seen the willow leaves
Dancing in the breeze

I've seen a man killed
By his best friend,
And lives that were over
Before they were spent.

I've seen what I was
And I know what I'll be
I've seen it all
There is no more to see

You haven't seen elephants
Kings or Peru

I'm happy to say
I had better to do

What about China?
Have you seen the Great Wall?

All walls are great
If the roof doesn't fall
And the man you will marry
The home you will share

To be honest
I really don't care
[gibberish]

You've never been
To Niagara Falls

I have seen water
It's water, that's all

The Eiffel Tower
The Empire State

My pulse was as high
On my very first date

And your grandson's hand
As he plays with your hair

To be honest
I really don't care
[gibberish]

I've seen it all
I've seen the dark
I've seen the brightness
In one little spark
I've seen what I chose
And I've seen what I need
And that is enough
To want more would be greed
I've seen what I was
And I know what I'll be
I've seen it all
There is no more to see

You've seen it all
And all you have seen
You can always review on
Your own little screen
The light and the dark
The big and the small
Just keep in mind
You need no more at all

You've seen what you were
And know what you'll be
You've seen it all
There is no more to see
[gibberish]
