		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Went to see my sweetheart
Last night around about ten
She said, "Home sweet, Papa"
Squeeze me every now and then

I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

We went out to a movie
Stop in the very last row
We hadn't been there a good five minutes
Before she's ready to go

I had to roll with my baby
I had to roll with my baby
I had to roll with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime
Can't buy me no whiskey
I guess I'll have to settle for wine
And then I can

Roll with my baby
I know I can roll with my baby
I'm sure I can roll with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

She's such a sweet woman
I'll never let her go
'Cause deep down inside of me
Lord knows I love her so

I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way
