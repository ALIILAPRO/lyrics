		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you really think of me?
Did you think I wouldn't see
How you never wait for me?
So I'ma keep you at arm's length, yeah
I could let a little thing really get to me
But it isn't worth it, honestly
I don't wanna go and throw it all away
But we need to attenuate

We just need to pull back our dosage, ah
We just need to lower the voltage
I just need a little room, ah

Insanity, oh, you're driving me up every wall
Degrading me, oh you're, you're
Putting me off, yeah
After back-to back weekends
You're blowing up
And you act like none of it is your fault
If we're gonna stay on the up and up
You've gotta lower your dose

We just need to pull back our dosage, ah
We just need to lower the voltage
I just need a little room, ah
I just need a little room, ah

I don't wanna fake like everything's fine
I don't wanna wait to the boiling point
Wanna break the tension, it's an intervention
Drawing the line 'Cause you pushed me out
You watched me fall
I'm bleeding out, when it all comes down
I know I'll just forgive it all
I'll just forgive it all

I just need a little room, ah
I just need a little room, ah
