		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes on me
Rainbows on my body
I don't even know your name
Flying on the carpet
Tripping
I got tunnel vision
So why do I feel so sane

There's a hole in the ground and I'm digging further down
Singing hey now, hey now
Air's getting loud and there's colours in my mouth
Singing hey now

High season
I don't a really need a reason
To get high
This season
I just wanna chase the feeling
If I'm never going home
Then I'm never feeling low
So this is my
High season
I don't a really need a reason to get

H-h-h-h-high
H-h-h-h-high
H-h-h-h-high
H-h-h-h-high

Spinning
Crawling on the ceiling
I don't recognise my face
Everything its burning
Lines blurring
Say I'm gonna be ok

There's a hole in the ground and I'm digging further down
Singing hey now, hey now
Air's getting loud and there's colours in my mouth
Singing hey now, hey now

High season
I don't a really need a reason
To get high
This season
I just wanna chase the feeling
If I'm never going home
Then I'm never feeling low
So this is my
High season
I don't a really need a reason to get
High high high

Breakfast at midnight
Fucking up our whole life
Damn right, damn right
Bed time at day light
Fucking up our whole life
Damn right, damn right

High season
I don't a really need a reason
To get high
This season
I just wanna chase the feeling
If I'm never going home
Then I'm never feeling low
So this is my
High season
I don't a really need a reason to get

H-h-h-h-high
H-h-h-h-high
H-h-h-h-high
H-h-h-h-high
