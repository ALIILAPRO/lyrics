		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel, that sent you away
I was looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Called you on the phone, another dimension
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Down by the ocean, it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was looking for you

Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
On Redondo beach and everyone is so sad
I was looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Pretty little girl, everyone cried
She was the victim, of sweet suicide
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was just looking for you

Desk clerk told me, girl was washed up
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Picked up my key, didn't reply
Went to my room, started to cry
You were small, an angel, are you gone, gone?

Down by the ocean it was so dismal
I was just standing with shock on my face
The hearse pulled away and the girl that had died, it was you

You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone, gone
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone, gone
Gone, gone
Gone, gone
Goodbye
