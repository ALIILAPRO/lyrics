		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when you're not there
And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two-hour bath
And how you've convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me

And I like the sound of old R 'n' B
And you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen thousands of times

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me

(Listen to me now)
And I could list a million things
I love to like about you
But they could all come down to one reason
I could never live without you

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me
