		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the lost cause, with nothing left to lose
Crossing every line, we're breaking every rule
Forget your future, and fuck your rumors
Another generation built from underneath

We are the outcast, but we're where we belong
You tried to shut us up but we're still singing this song
We are the outcast, made this way from the start
Twisted and deranged the ones you fear in the dark
We are the, we are the, we are the outcast
We are the, we are the, we are the outcast
We are the, we are the (Outcast)

We are the nightmare, the voice in your head
Creeping up behind, we're breathing down your neck
So fuck your future, and fuck your rumors
We're everybody that you never thought we'd be

We are the outcast, but we're where we belong
You tried to shut us up but we're still singing this song
We are the outcast, made this way from the start
Twisted and deranged the ones you fear in the dark
We are the, we are the, we are the outcast
We are the, we are the, we are the outcast
We are the, we are the (Outcast)

We were never what you wanted us to be
A generation built from underneath
C'mon

We are the same, united by one name
We are the same, united by one name
Outcast, outcast, outcast
United by one name

We are the outcast, but we're where we belong
You tried to shut us up but we're still singing this song
We are the outcast, made this way from the start
Twisted and deranged the ones you fear in the dark
We are the, we are the, we are the outcast

We are the same, united by one name
We are the same, united by one name
(Outcast)
