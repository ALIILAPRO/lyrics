		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I die young
Catch your graces
After we're both gone
I'll swap places with you
'Cause Heaven don't make for a thing like you
'Cause Heaven don't make medicine like you

If I die young
Catch your graces
Thought that I'd move on
But fuck you're amazing, when you
Hang on every word everything I do
Heaven never made anything like you

If I die young
You can bury me anywhere
Hell, I don't care, girl
As long as I'm with you
Well, I'm sorry but

If I die young
Catch your graces
After we're both gone
I'll swap places with you
'Cause Heaven don't make for a thing like you
'Cause Heaven don't make medicine like you

I've had
The time of my life
Just thinking of you
Sink into my skin 'til that shit turn blue
Heaven wasn't made for my red tattoos
Oh, why, babe?
Please don't pull out the knife
I'm still dreaming of you
Hope I don't awake 'cause this life's abuse
If you lay me down least I'll be laying with you

I can die young as long as I'm with you
Just come and die young, we'll tell a story of two
Before I die young, I'm coming over to you
'Cause I can die young as long I'm with you

If I die young
Catch your graces
After we're both gone
I'll swap places with you
'Cause Heaven don't make for a thing like you
'Cause Heaven don't make medicine like you

If I die young
Catch your graces
After we're both gone
I'll swap places with you (I'll swap places)
'Cause Heaven don't make for a thing like you (I'll swap places)
'Cause Heaven don't make medicine like you (I'll swap places, I'll swap places
