		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not on your life
Won't let it break me
Won't give up the fight
But on this last thread, I'm holding so tight
Feed my imaginings, don't let a sweet dream die
Not on your life
I'm not abandoning
I have survived
Somehow still standing through death and through time
I need your love like a drug keeping me alive

Drowning in your blinding light

I will be more than my survival
Only scars on my heart
Even in dreams I hear you calling
Breaking the surface, I won't let go
You're part of me

Can't stop me now
Just clawed my way back from deep underground
No time for hatred, no holding back now
Set me on fire, I like it the way it burns
Hands on your heart
Who really thought we would make it this far?
What good could come from embracing the dark?
We found each other through brokenness and now look how strong we are

Drowning in your blinding light

I will be more than my survival
Only scars on my heart
Even in dreams I hear you calling
So I know it's still worth believing
It's not just a feeling
As long as I don't let it go
Don't let me go

I will be more than my survival
Only scars on my heart
Even in dreams I hear you calling
Breaking the surface, I won't let go
You're part of me now and always
