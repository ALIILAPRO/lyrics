		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something sparked within me
A flame ignited in my fragile heart
And before I knew it was burning
Scorching me right from the start

Fluttering, my impulse
A naive, prying little Butterfly
Gracefully it gathers the passion I hold deep inside.

Come my darling, have our fingers intertwine
Let me taste your lips as we cross the line

If this world can’t see that what we have is love.
Our flame will grow, tonight I’m letting go

I want to hold you in my arms
And heal my open wounds and scars
Please, let me hear you say
“No, this isn’t wrong”
Take me far away

Save me with your kiss,
Bring back those memories I’ve missed
I want to captivate everything we have
Then and now and forevermore

Hours, minutes, seconds I’m near you
Still, I can’t restrain myself

If this love is real 
I will wear it on my sleeve
and burn in hell

Wanting turns to longing
Just how much longer, will I make you mine?

This I promise dear
I will love you til’ the end of time.

Mind and heart forgotten for another night.
Feel you skin, so fine as our souls align

Bathe in madness as if time does not exist
An endless bliss, all that I want is this!

My love for you is not a dream
No matter far it may seem
What we had felt tonight
Never felt so wrong
Yet it felt so right

Touch me once again
You know I will always give in
I don’t need anything
Anything but you
Then and now and forevermore

Woken by my tears, I watch the rising sun
As the fear arises within my heart
"It's alright" you whisper, yet I still could see it wasn't true
Have you been crying too?

I want to hold you in my arms
And heal my open wounds and scars
Please, let me hear you say
“No, this isn’t wrong”
Take me far away

Save me with your kiss,
Bring back those memories I’ve missed
I want to captivate everything we have
Now and forever

Pulling near and far
No matter wherever you are
A magnet drawn to you
This is what we do
It will all pull through

Touch me once again
You know I will always give in
I don’t need anything
Anything but you
Then and now and forevermore
