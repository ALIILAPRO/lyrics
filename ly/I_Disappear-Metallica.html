		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey, hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey, hey, hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Here I go into new days

Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Ha!

Hey, hey, hey
And I went
And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey
And I went on
And I went on down that road
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, and I went on
And I went on down that road

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Disappear, huh!

I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone
Oh yeah, I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone baby
I'm gone, I'm gone

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone
Do you teach me while I'm here
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Disappear.
