		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you running from me
Everywhere I go you still won't stay
See the sky above me
Everywhere I go you still gon see
Baby come get comfy
Listen to da boy and you'll be safe
Come and vibe upon me
I guess I guess I guess I guess
It's Mr. Mack Uk
The master class for "after you's"
Chivalry ain't dead but all the other niggas bastards boo
Mr. clean right here with a little fro and killa flow
Killa cam but we could kill it too just so them niggas know we picture perfect
Post a classic moment make dem niggas nervous sip da surface
Get to what's across our cup of minted mocha
Flip the quota
But the question is are you down with that?
Are buyin' that?
Is you fine with my rhymes keeping minds intact?
Oh you fine?
I won't ask that question again
Never been in a place so content
See the vibes on da stage it amazin'
Station my heart in the music but shorty you might be the runner up
Word to ma
I can't lie I can't front
We worlds apart but gravitize
Why you running from me
Everywhere I go you still won't stay
See the sky above me
Everywhere I go you still gon see
Baby come get comfy
Listen to da boy and you'll be safe
Come and vibe upon me
I guess I guess I guess I guess
I guess never mind
I thought you was cool with the fact that we led a bind
But the train fucked up the elastic band that we had now I have no say in nada
Kaytranada the way that I made the rhythms get in tune to yo way the vibe struck now We Don't got that same alignment
It was all for nothing
Cause and effect of a lost construction
Built to be kilt by a loss of function but it did
I don't know the ethics
Kinda got me stressing early morning hadn't caught a breakfast
Ain't catch break I need that shit like effective immediately
I thought it was you but you loss that blessing
Why you running from me
Everywhere I go you still won't stay
See the sky above me
Everywhere I go you still gon see
Baby come get comfy
Listen to the boy and you'll be safe
Come and vibe upon me
I guess I guess I guess I guess
Why you running from me
Everywhere I go you still won't stay
See the sky above me
Everywhere I go you still gon see
Baby come get comfy
Listen to da boy and you'll be safe
Come and vibe upon me
I guess I guess I guess I guess
