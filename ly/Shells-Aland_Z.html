		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna hold you
I wanna hold you to your thousand dangers
Bleed out the sounds of magic and lovesick tunes 
These record players got nothing on you
Got nothing left to lose
We brace ourselves for
The grand rebellion
The start of something new
Our morphing level

Death will awaken the moment we own it, show it the truth
Spiders know how bad we have it when we develop our youth
Must we confront it? (Oh yeah)
Must we live by it? (Oh yeah)
Identify it? (Oh yeah)

Baby, I must admit my heartbreak would kill me inside
I'll need just you, me, and the floor

Dance all night my disco queen
Got you close
You're close to me
(Check out my new dress)
It's time we reinvent ourselves
(Passion for progress)
It's time we both break out our shells like

Dam dam dam, ba dam bam boom yeah
Dam dam dam, ba dam bam boom yeah
Dam bam boom yeah
Dam bam boom yeah
Dam dam dam, ba dam bam boom yeah

How will I do you
How will I know your truth
Your sweaty palms, they
They give away your desperate lust for truce with all your voices

I thought I was human when I was just guilt with life
Did my enemies lie to me? 
What a waste of my time
Told me I was in danger but never mentioned it twice
Take my photograph, throw it, and put it over the fires, my

Baby, I must admit my heartbreak would kill me inside
I'll need just you, me, and the floor

Dance all night my disco queen
Got you close
You're close to me
(Check out my new dress)
It's time we reinvent ourselves
(Passion for progress)
It's time we both break out our shells like

Dam dam dam, ba dam bam boom yeah
Dam dam dam, ba dam bam boom yeah
Dam bam boom yeah
Dam bam boom yeah
Dam dam dam, ba dam bam boom yeah
