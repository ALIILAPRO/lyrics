		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around
Take me baby, kiss me all over, play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of
Do me baby, like you never done before
Ho, ooh give it to me till I just can't take no more
C'mon, do me baby, like you never done before
Ho, ooh, I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait, oh

Hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
Here we are looking for a reason 
For you to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season
So baby please stop teasing me
Ooh, what ya do, I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad

So do me baby (do me baby), like you never done before
Ooh, give it to me till I just can't take no more
C'mon, do me baby, like you never done before
Ooh, I want you now, I just can't wait no more

I said, ooh
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh
Do me baby, yeah, do me baby, give it to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, do me baby, ooh
I want you now, ooh, yeah
Do me baby
Ooh, give it to me
Do me baby, do me baby, don't want to do it all alone
I want your love, yeah
Do me baby
Ooh, give it to me
Oh, yeah, do me baby, this feeling is too strong
Make me wait too long, I want you now

Oh, you're leaving me no choice
Okay, what are you gonna do, you just gonna sit there and watch
Alright
Are you sure you don't want to close your eyes?
Oh
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not gonna stop until the war is over
Oh, help me
There
Okay, okay
Oh
I'm so cold, oh, just hold me, oh, oh
