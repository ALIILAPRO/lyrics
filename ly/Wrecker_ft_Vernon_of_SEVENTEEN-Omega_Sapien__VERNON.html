		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Choppas on deck my neck look glitter
Make that wish ya boys look bitter
고추잡채 I eat for dinner
I say you want all that thriller
Choppas on deck my neck look glitter
Make that wish ya boys look bitter
고추잡채 I eat for dinner
I say you want all that thriller

I'm scared of nothing but the police
I want that moshpit so they searchin' for me
I feel I feel it comin' pressures on me
Open that moshpit you can do that for free

위용위용 get the police on jumper
위용위용 got that busted out bumper
삐용삐용 red and blue to the dumpster
Pardon me, my check long like cucumber
Presidential campaign for my country
Prеsidential bling bling yea that's on me
Votе for me cuz I'm the one and only
Kpop prince gotta link with the Brodie?
Oh god wow she wanna rock it now
Oh god now she wanna stop it now
Spittin' facts at the booth 너는 잠이 와?
Pow pow bang 너무나 잔인한
Wreck this city goes round and round
Pack this heat baby check this sound
200k I just got that down
Pound for pound feel like 신 right now
Choppas on deck my neck look glitter
Make that wish ya boys look bitter
고추잡채 I eat for dinner
I say you want all that thriller
Choppas on deck my neck look glitter
Make that wish ya boys look bitter
고추잡채 I eat for dinner
I say you want all that thriller

I'm scared of nothing but the police
I want that moshpit so they searchin' for me
I feel I feel it comin' pressures on me
Open that moshpit you can do that for free

Vernon
The industry cut-throat
The gap that's in the streets of Seoul
The emptiness equals my soul
Don't even know what I want anymore
But we still ride this, encore
Material things, make room for more
20k, just dropped on clothes
There's no stoppin' this anymore
Top off, I'ma drop it
Hot head in the cockpit
Pull up for the profit
Comin' for your safety deposit
Got the key to unlock it
So sweet like chocolate
Champagne, I'ma pop it
Call me Kpoppapi
Choppas on deck my neck look glitter
Make that wish ya boys look bitter
고추잡채 I eat for dinner
I say you want all that thriller
Choppas on deck my neck look glitter
Make that wish ya boys look bitter
고추잡채 I eat for dinner
I say you want all that thriller

I'm scared of nothing but the police
I want that moshpit so they searchin' for me
I feel I feel it comin' pressures on me
Open that moshpit you can do that for free
