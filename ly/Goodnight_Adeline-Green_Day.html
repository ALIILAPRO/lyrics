		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you feel my pain?
Can you sing my sorrow?
Here comes a better day
But it's got nothing to do with tomorrow
I'm sick in bed again
My head is under my pillow
My spirit's broken
And my face is in the gutter singing

Goodnight Adeline
You're going to say goodbye and let it go
Sooner or later
Whatever, whenever
Goodnight baby let it go

Somedays are holidays
Somedays you call your mother
Somedays you're sober
But you're still waking up with a hangover
I'm like a dead weight
I'm going to meet my maker
I'll see you later
When I get my shit together singing

Goodnight Adeline
You're going to say goodbye and let it go
Sooner or later
Whatever, whenever
Goodnight baby let it go

Goodnight Adeline
You're going to say goodbye and let it go
Sooner or later
Whatever, whenever
Goodnight baby let it go
