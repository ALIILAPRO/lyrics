		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He is half man and half machine
Rides the metal monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A savior comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas

Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Faster then a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns

Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Ah

He is the Painkiller (killer)
This is the Painkiller (killer)
He is the Painkiller (killer)
This is the Painkiller (killer)

Pain, pain, killer, killer
Pain, pain, killer, killer

Can't stop the Painkiller
Pain (pain)
