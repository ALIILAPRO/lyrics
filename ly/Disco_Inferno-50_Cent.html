		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, let's go

Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl

Go, go, go, 50 in the house
Bounce, y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sounds sicker over Dre drums, nigga
I ain't stupid, I see Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves it so erotic
I watch her, I'm like, "Bounce that ass, girl"
I get it crump in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here, we'll thump in here, oh
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good?
Outside the Benzo on dubs, I'm in the club with the snub
Don't' start nothin', it won't be nothin', uh

Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl

Let's party, everybody stand up
Everybody put your hands up
Let's party, everybody bounce with me
Sip champagne and burn a lil' greenery

It's hot, disco inferno
Let's go, you're now rockin' with a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fo' sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look, homie, I don't dance, all I do is this
It's the same two-step with a lil' twist
Listen, pimpin', I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a lil' Cris' with a lil' Dom Perignon
And a lil' Hennessy, you know we finna carry on
I'm hollerin' at these shorties in the club tryna get right
We gon' be up in this bitch 'til we break daylight

Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl

You see me shining, lit up with diamonds
'Cause I stay grinding, uh-huh
Homie, you can catch me swoopin'
Bentley coupin', switching lanes, haha
If you see me rollin', you know I'm holdin'
I'm 'bout my paper, yeah
Nigga, I'm serious, I ain't playin'
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay, let's go

Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl
Lil' mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothin' to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl
