		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was it all in my head?
Wasn't meant to be
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
I still fuckin' hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doin' to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me

You fuckin' broke me, I'm crazy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were my baby
I wasn't perfect but I worked so hard
You still called me leavin'
Had to leave the shit
All the shit you were doin' to me
Called me so many names
Started to believe
Made me fuckin' hate myself
You never wanted me, you wanted someone else
You made a home start to feel like a shell
Took a look in the mirror and I started out to see
A man who wanted some love, you could never give to me

Was it all in my head?
Wasn't meant to be
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
I still fuckin' hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doin' to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me

I wasn't perfect, always flirtin' with different women
And gettin' too fucked up, we couldn't have a conversation
But what you did was worse, it was fuckin' unhuman
I caught in bed with another man, just left feelin' stupid
I went home with things killing, drinking and feelings to break
I got madder and madder, and I lift him out of bed
You were screamin', and me and him were fightin' on the floor
I had blood spillin' out my head, leaving from the door
I was wearing shades and that face 'cause you knew I was meeting fans
It was the lowest point that I ever fuckin' felt as a man
I got hate in my heart and an endless addression
I can't let it all go 'til you answer my question

Was it all in my head?
Wasn't meant to be
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
I still fuckin' hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doin' to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
Now you're dead to me
Now you're dead to me

I couldn't see it then, but I see it now
Thank you so fucking much for ripping my heart out
Stomping on it and cutting it and bleeding it out
Finally figured out so much about myself
I was never the problem, I can finally see
You just weren't the right fucking person for me
Take care, wish you well and the best
Hoping our paths never cross again
Said what I had to and needed to say
Gonna love myself like I should have yesterday

Was it all in my head?
Wasn't meant to be
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
I still fuckin' hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doin' to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me (now you're dead to me)
Dead to me (now you're dead to me)
Fuckin' dead, dead, dead, dead (now you're dead to me)
Fuckin' dead, dead, dead, you're dead to me
