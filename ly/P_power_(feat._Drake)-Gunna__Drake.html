		  (If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

She wanna go viral (viral), we fuckin' for hours (hours)
That pussy got power, that pussy got power
She wet in the shower (wet), that pussy gettin' louder (louder)
We ain't saying no vow (vow), she fuckin' no coward (nope)
I'm dickin' it deep (deep), she wanna get geeked (geek her, uh)
She sniffin' that flour (flour), we geekin' for hours (skeet-skeet)
Get play as a player (we player), that P get devoured (P)
Told my brother, "She ours" (she ours, slatty)

I'm comin', my baby, fuck it, I'll crocodile Birkin the baby (fuck it)
We don't take breaks, she wan' fuck on the daily
Had to stop, get some Percs for this lady
We go CC, make her wanna go crazy
I hit Mercedes inside a Mercedes
Power, that P got you poppin' in places (P)
I'm givin' her the D, I'm the D-boy, baby (I'm giving her the D, I'm the D-boy, baby)
I'm in her gut like the sit-up (sit-up)
I drop the dick off like a dealer (yeah)
I left a few racks, pay your rent up (rent up)
She make that lil' pussy pop like a pimple
I'm parkin' right here in the center (yeah)
I tell her, "Pull up," she gon' mop up the drip up 
That's why I upgraded her denture (why?)
In her mouth, in love with your dentals

She wanna go viral (viral), we fuckin' for hours (hours)
That pussy got power, that pussy got power
She wet in the shower (wet), that pussy gettin' louder (louder)
We ain't sayin' no vow (vow), she fuckin' no coward (nope)
I'm dickin' it deep (deep), she wanna get geeked (geek her, uh)
She sniffin' that flour (flour), we geekin' for hours (skeet-skeet)
Get play as a player (we player), that P get devoured (P)
Told my brother, "She ours" (she ours)

I'm comin', my baby, forget a crocodile Birkin, my baby
Show you a link, now you workin', my baby
You fuck on me, it feel personal, baby
Trust me, it's comin' full circle, my baby
The dash in the Benz is virtual, baby
You seein' 3D off a Perky, my baby
Seein' HD off the 2C, my baby
31 gang it get spooky, my baby
How can I worry 'bout blockin' with buttons 
When niggas is out here and Glockies is bussin'?
How can I not be the topic discussion 
When niggas got rich off of droppin' my govy?
How do you even be rockin' with buddy? 
The pictures I've seen, I'm like, "Damn, he got lucky"
Take it from him and I leave him with nothin'

She wanna go viral (viral), we fuckin' for hours (hours)
That pussy got power, that pussy got power
She wet in the shower (wet), that pussy gettin' louder (louder)
We ain't sayin' no vow (vow), she fuckin' no coward (nope)
I'm dickin' it deep (deep), she wanna get geeked (geek her, uh)
She sniffin' that flour (flour), we geekin' for hours (skeet-skeet)
Get play as a player (we player), that P get devoured (P)
Told my brother, "She ours" (she ours, slatty)
