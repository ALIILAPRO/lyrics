		  Ladies and gentlemen
You already know what it is
Okay, yeah
Aww, shit
I'm tryin' to run in this mutherfucka
I'm tryin' to, anyways
Got two hard lookin' mutherfuckers
C'mon

I was tryin' to enjoy my night but you then came here
Turned around the vibe I had before I came here
I done turned into a rude dude (man)
Why you had to fuck up the night? 
Now we got to fight, I'm a knock out ya lights
You ain't doin' nothing but runnin' yo' yap-yap
You got to go to the trunk, but, homeboy, I am strapped-strapped
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you had to fuck up the night? 
Now we got to fight, I'm a knock out ya lights
Your little lady tryin' to hold you back, you better listen to her
She better not talk that shit, I'm a have to put something straight through her
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Now, why you had to fuck up the night? 
Now we got to fight, I'm a knock out ya lights, c'mon

Yeah, goddamn, you think you cool, you think I'm not you think you tough
Goddamn, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
Goddamn, you talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church
Goddamn, you think you cool, you think I'm not you think you tough
Goddamn, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
Goddamn, you talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church

It's a Sunday at the park, I'm chillin', trying to get ma swerve on
Some little lame trying to run that game, trying to get his serve on
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck up the park? I'm a put you in the dark, clap on, clap off

You ain't doin' nothing but runnin' your pie hole
You gon' make me do somethin' that a get your eye swole
Now, I don't wanna be a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck up the park? 
I'ma put you in the dark, clap on, clap off
If that's your car, you need to go ahead and get into it
Better not talk that shit, you gon' make me put something through it
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck up the park? I'm a put you in the dark, lights on, lights off

Yeah, goddamn, you think you cool, you think I'm not you think you tough
Goddamn, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
Goddamn, you talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church
Goddamn, you think you cool, you think I'm not you think you tough
Goddamn, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
Goddamn, you talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church

Now, niggas think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
Until I pull they card and I show them what I got, kinda like
He don't wanna play around anymore, he don't wanna play around
Your niggas think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
Until I pull they card and I show them what I got, kinda like
He don't wanna play around anymore, he don't wanna play around anymore
Them bitches think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
Until I put they card and I show them what I got, kinda like
They don't wanna play around here
Them bitches think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
Until I put they card and I show them what I got, kinda like
They don't wanna play around here, you stupid

Yeah, goddamn, you think you cool, you think I'm not you think you tough
Goddamn, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
Goddamn, you talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church
Goddamn, you think you cool, you think I'm not you think you tough
Goddamn, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
Goddamn, you talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church
