		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight I feel ambitious and so does my foot 
as it sinks on the pedal
I press it to the floor
I don't need a girl, don't need a friend
Cause my friend Lonesome's unconditional
We're flying forever bored
And for a moment I love everything that I see and think and feel
I love my broken side view mirror
Cause it's so perfect I'm so perfect you're so perfect you're not here
I hear the change in gears

My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
This is an open road song

The night is beckoning
Although I have nowhere to go but home
Feels good to be alone
With every turn comes a new frame of mind
If I could frame my mind 
Where would it hang?

My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
This is an open road song

I crack a window and feel the cool air cleanse my every pore
As I pour my poor heart out
To a radio song that's patient and willing to listen
My volume drowns it out
Yeah, but that's O.K. cause I sound better than him anyway, any day
Yeah, my voice is as sweet as salt
I search for comfort and I find it where I've found it many times before
Times before can be forgotten

My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
This is an open road song
