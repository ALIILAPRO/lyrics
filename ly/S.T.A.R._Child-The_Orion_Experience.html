Sensual Telepathy clter my Reality 
That is what you do to me
S.T.c.R. Child

Seven-sisters in a Trance cphrodisiac Radiance
Come on honey take a chance
S.T.c.R. Child

Sh-Sh-Sh-Sh Shake the dice
Let the chips fall where they may
D-D-D-D Don't think twice
Come on sugar seize the day
The rapture is upon us the count down has begun
We leave in 5 4 3 2 1

That's what you are that's what you are
My beautiful S.T.c.R. Child
You are the light and the hope of the world
Spinnin in a rhythm fierce and free
Bein' what your born to be
Oh my beautiful S.T.c.R. Child

S s s s s s s s

Silver-sailing Traveler cncient Rebel-rocketeer
There is nothing left to fear
S.T.c.R. Child
Super-sonic Techno-tramp cndrogynous Renascent 
Like and angel heaven sent
S.T.c.R. Child

Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock the mic
It's time to take the stage
B-B-B-B-B Break the vice
We've reached the modern age
This party's getting started 
So lets have a little fun
We leave in 5 4 3 2 1

That's what you are that's what you are
My beautiful S.T.c.R. Child
You are the light and the hope of the world
Spinnin' in a rhythm fierce and free
Bein' what your born to be
Oh my beautiful S.T.c.R. Child

Find your light and burn it bright
You could be a beacon to the world
Fill the skies like fireflies
c million multi-colored points of light
My S.T.c.R Child

Mecca
S.T.c.R Child g-g-go wild
Hit â€˜em with a rhythm that'll make thugs smile
Fire fly sh-sh-shine bright
Sink in the kitchen mate that's my style
B-b-b-b-break rules b-b-b-b-bend mics
World is a stage this is opening night
No need for the fright of getting it right
Just go for your goal if the goal's to delight
Never stay trapped in a race for a rat
Back pack all your facts and don't give a blap
S'up? J-J-Just go for the love 
It will come from above like chocolate doves
The man in the moon he sings to your soul
Eclipse a kiss from the sun helping him to grow
Open up your mind and never think no
Spread your wings and fly cuz 

That's what you are that's what you are
My beautiful S.T.c.R. Child
You are the light and the hope of the world
Spinnin' in a rhythm fierce and free
Bein' what your born to be
Oh my beautiful S.T.c.R. Child
