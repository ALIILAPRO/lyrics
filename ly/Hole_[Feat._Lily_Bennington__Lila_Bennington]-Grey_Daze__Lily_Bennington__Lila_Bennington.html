		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would have sailed away, if I'd known that nothing would change 
Staring out my window sill, in my wasted prison cell 

And I know what you want 
And I know what you feel 
As I cradle your loving 
And watch you disappear 

And I feel your heart beatin', pounding in my head 
And I'd like to control you, 'cause I can't control myself, myself 

Rain come my way, mold my head like a ball of clay 
Softly wither into my grave, never to see the sun again 

And I feel your heart beatin', pounding in my head 
And I'd like to control you, 'cause I can't control myself, myself 

All alone in a crowd by myself, so sorry wish I could find a way 
Back into your hole again, but I've become your enemy 

And I feel your heart beat, pounding in my head 
And I'd like to control you, 'cause I can't control myself, myself
