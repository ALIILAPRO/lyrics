		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In all my years of living
It isn't very often that I get pissed off
I try to chill with the waves
But damn, you've crossed the line

I've been so gracious
And yet, you hurt the son of mine
That's right, the cyclops you made blind
Is mine

No

I'm left without a choice
And without a doubt
Guess the pack of wolves is
Swimming with the shark now
I've gotta make you bleed
I need to see you drown but before you go
I need to make you learn how

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves

You are the worse kind of good
Cause you're not even great
A greek who reeks of false righteousness
That's what I hate

Cause you fight to save lives
But won't kill and don't get the job done
I mean you totally could
Have avoided all this
Had you just killed my son but no

You are far too nice mercy has a price
It's the final crack we're about
To break the ice now you reveal your name
Then you let him live
Unlike you I've got no mercy
Left to give cause
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves

And now it is finally time to say goodbye
Today, you die
Unless, of course, you apologize
For my son's pain and al this cries

Poseidon, we meant no harm
We only hurt him to disarm him
We took no pleasure in his pain
We only wanted to escape

The line between naivete and
Hopelessness is almost invisible
So close your heart the world is dark and

Ruthlessness is mercy-

Die

Ruthlessness is mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is

What have you done?

When does a ripple become a tidal wave?

Forty three men under your command

When does man become a monster?

I am your darkest moment
The monster that always draws near
Any last words?

All I gotta do is open this bag

What?

Remember me
