		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it
Go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

Now you're holding this against me
Like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
