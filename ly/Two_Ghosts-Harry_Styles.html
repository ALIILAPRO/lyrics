		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like somethin' that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
Tryin' to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
This was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Tellin' those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half-empty
Tryin' to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half-empty
Tryin' to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

Tryin' to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just tryin' to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
