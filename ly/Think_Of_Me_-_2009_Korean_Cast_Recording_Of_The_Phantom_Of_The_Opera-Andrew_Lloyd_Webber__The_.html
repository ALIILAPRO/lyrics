		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of me, think of me fondly 
When we've said goodbye 
Remember me, once in a while 
Please promise me you'll try 
When you find that once again you long 
To take your heart back and be free 
If you ever find a moment 
Spare a thought for me 

We never said our love was evergreen 
Or as unchanging as the sea 
But if you can still remember 
Stop and think of me 
Think of all the things 
We've shared and seen 
Don't think about the way 
Things might have been 

Think of me, think of me waking 
Silent and resigned 
Imagine me trying too hard 
To put you from my mind 
Recall those days 
Look back on all those times 
Think of the things we'll never do 
There will never be a day 
When I won't think of you 

Can it be, can it be Christine? 
Bravo! 
Long ago, it seems so long ago 
How young and innocent we were 
She may not remember me 
But I remember her 

Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade 
They have their season so do we 
But please promise me that sometimes 
You will think of me
