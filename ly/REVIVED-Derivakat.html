		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White streak in my hair but no stress now
Trade-off, that guy's looking like a mess now
Driving off the tracks, but I'm back
And I've seen hell but this is a bit more my style
I'm alive, I'm revived, I survived
You surprised? Gonna cry about it?
You should see the other guy
I've returned and I've waited my turn
A decade of time to make everything mine

Am I the bad guy?
I'll be the bad guy again
Just like last time
And we all know how that ends
No one came to help
So I'll help myself instead
You think I cared?
It was always a means to an end
I've got my second chance
I've got a new lease on life
It's not just circumstance
No, it was all in good time
So who cares? So what?
I'm not calming down
Screw that, keep up
Now look around

There's nothing wrong with me
I'm better now that I'm free
'Cause I've seen the other side
And now I'm back where I wanna be
It was thirteen and a half years I spent
On that platform in hell
But I've come back hell-bent

White streak in my hair but no stress now
Trade-off, the guy's looking like a mess now
Driving off the tracks, but I'm back
And I've seen hell but this is a bit more my style
I'm alive, I'm revived, I survived
You surprised? Gonna cry about it?
You should see the other guy
I've returned and I've waited my turn
A decade of time to make everything mine

This is my sunrise
This is my dawn
This is what I've waited for all along
All of this time
All this is mine
Mine, mine, mine, I'm alive
Shut up and listen
'Cause I'm back and I've found my will to live
I'll say I'm sorry but you don't have to forgive
'Cause regardless, I'm moving on
Regardless, to the next big thing
A throne will always await a king
But now the train's left the station
The ticket price of my patience
A decade stuck in location
Of misery and damnation
And now I see the causation
Of all this pain and frustration
It's everything that I've taken
Oh, yes, I blew up the nation

There's nothing wrong with me
I'm better now that I'm free
'Cause I've seen the other side
And now I'm back where I wanna be
It was thirteen and a half years I spent
On that platform in hell
But I've come back hell-bent

White streak in my hair but no stress now
Trade-off, the guy's looking like a mess now
Driving off the tracks, but I'm back
And I've seen hell but this is a bit more my style
I'm alive, I'm revived, I survived
You surprised? Gonna cry about it?
You should see the other guy
I've returned and I've waited my turn
A decade of time to make everything mine

White streak, white streak in my hair
And I'm not going, not going back there
And if there's one thing, one thing that I'll swear
I'll be back for a while, kid
So go ahead and smile
