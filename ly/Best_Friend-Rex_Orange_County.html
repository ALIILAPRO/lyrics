		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should've stayed at home
'Cause right now I see all these people that love me
But I still feel alone
Can't help but check my phone
I could've made you mine
But no, it wasn't meant to be and see, I wasn't made for you
And you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy

And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

But won't you wait?
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool
That makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt?
You're still my favorite girl
You better trust me when I tell you
There ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world

You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
I said that
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
Best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend

I say that I'm happy
I say that I'm happy
But no, no, no, no
No, no, no

Oh, I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
And I can't wait to be your number, your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one
I might just be the one
