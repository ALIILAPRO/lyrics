		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watch the walls around me crumble
But it's not like I won't build them up again
So here's your last change for redemption
So take it while it lasts because it will end
My tears are turning into time I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye

I can't live without you
Can't breathe without you
I'm dreamin' 'bout you honestly
Tell me that its over
'Cause if the world is spinning and I'm still living
It won't be right if we're not in it together
Tell me that it's over
And I'll be the first to go
Don't want to be the last to know

I won't be the one to chase you
But at the same time you're the heart that I call home
I'm always stuck with these emotions
And the more I try to feel the less I'm whole
My tears are turning into time
I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye

I can't live without you
Can't breathe without you
I'm dreamin' 'bout you honestly
Tell me that its over
'Cause if the world is spinning and I'm still living
It won't be right if we're not in it together
Tell me that it's over
And I'll be the first to go
Yeah, I'll be the first to go
Don't want to be the last to know
Over, over, over

My tears are turning into time
I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye

I can't live without you
Can't breathe without you
I'm dreamin' bout you honestly
Tell me that its over
'Cause if the world is spinning and I'm still living
It won't be right if we're not in it together
Tell me that it's over
Tell me that it's over
Honestly tell me,
Honestly tell me,
Don't tell me that it's over
Don't tell me that it's over.
