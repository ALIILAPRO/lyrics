		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night, I spiralled alone in the kitchen
Making pretend that the furniture listened
Wasn't the best of my mental conditions, but I tried
Thinkin' of you without any forgiveness
Because I was the one who would stay up and call you
And I'd drive to your house for the shit that you went through
And I wasted my breath when I tried to console you, didn't I?
'Cause we didn't happen the way we were supposed to

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you

Pulled the knife off my bag, it was right where you left it
But your aim's kinda perfect, I'll give you the credit
I just drank something strong to try to forget, but it wasn't right
No, you're not even here, but you're doin' my head in

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh

I should hate you, I feel stupid
Like I almost crashed my car
Drivin' home to talk about you
At my table in the dark
All I ever think about is
Where the hell you even are
And I swear to God I'd kill you
If I loved you less hard

After all of this time, I still get disappointed
Bet you're doing alright and you don't even know it
How it's all 'cause of you that my standards are broken in my mind
I would bend back to you if you left the door open

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh
