		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I flaunt cha, cause' girl I really want cha
And you looking nice, got me cooler than a bag of ice
Now freeze, freeze, freeze, now go
Drop it fast and move it real slow, oh!
What, you smell so fruity
I'm a pirate and you're my booty (arg)
So move it in close
And let me have my daily dose (uhhh)
Girl, I've been thinking about you, thinking about me
What you think about it?

Five fingers to the face
Five fingers to the face
Five fingers to the face
Five fingers to the face

I love Martina, Vanessa, and Georgina
It's a ladies choice, so Ima' make sure to make some noise (oh)
And now we're sweating, got my turbo engine revving
They stop and stare, all the haters think it's just not fair
That I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun
And I'm about to put this club in gear
So fellas grab a cup, what
All my ladies you know what's up, yeah
Put your hands to the sky if you're feeling fly, and tell me that you, what
Cause' I'm the man in charge, and ya know I'm living large
I got a big white house and a fancy yacht, and a garage full of classic cars
What you talking bout' boy, oh calm down
I know you don't think you can just come up in here and buy me!
Come on, you know what I got for you

Five fingers to the face
Five fingers to the face
Five fingers to the face
Five fingers to the face
Oh yeah!
