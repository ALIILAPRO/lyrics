		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The city sky's feeling dark tonight
We're back to back with our heads down
Just look at me, give me more tonight
Just give me more of your love now

Let's set fire to the lonely night
You're beautiful when you look at me
Let's give love another life

Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine
Just call my name on the edge of the night
And I'll run to you, I'll run to you

I would run to you, if you want me to
Just give me some kind of reason
I'll take the pain, take it all away
Just give it some kind of meaning

Let's let go, let it be the start
You know I'm feeling the same thing
Let's let go of our broken hearts

Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine
Just call my name on the edge of the night
And I'll run to you, I'll run to you

Even if it's gonna break me, love
Gonna make my way to you
Anyway it's gonna take me, love
I run to you
I run to you
Run, run

Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine
Just call my name on the edge of the night
And I'll run to you
I'll run to you

Even if it's gonna break me, love
I run to you
