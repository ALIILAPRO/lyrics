		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the holiday remix
Ah-ah

Think I only want you under my mistletoe
I might change your contact to has a huge North Pole (baby)
You said you like my stockings better on the floor 
Boy, I've been a bad girl I guess I'm getting coal (no)

Lemme come warm you up
You been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb
Sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho" (ha,ha)
I don't want Santa's elves
Underneath this ol' tree
Here's a lil' carol I wrote
It's about you and me (me)

You're my wishlist 
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' (Christmas)
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin'
When you're comin' down the chimney, ooh, it feels so good 
I need that Charles Dickens
You be Santa Clause and I'll be Mrs. 
I'll take you for a ride I'll be your vixen 
I don't even know I'm talking Christmas 
I'm talking, I'm talking (ah-ah-ah-ah)

I'm talking decking all the halls (decking all the halls)
I'm talking spiking eggnog (spiking eggnog)
I'm talking opposite of small (opposite of small)
I'm talking big snow balls (ha, ha, ha, ha)

You got a new toy for me 
I'm out here trimming the tree
I caught that holiday glee
My true love gave it to me 

Lemme come warm you up
You been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb
Sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho" 
I don't want Santa's elves (no, no)
Underneath this ol' tree (tree)
Here's a lil' carol I wrote
It's about you and me (me)

You're my wishlist (wishlist)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' (Christmas)
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin' (kissin')
When you're comin' down the chimney (ooh, it feels so good)
I need that Charles Dickens
You be Santa Clause and I'll be Mrs. 
I'll take you for a ride I'll be your vixen 
I don't even know I'm talking Christmas (oh, oh)
I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking (ah, ah, ah, ah)
(I'm talking, I'm talking, nah, nah, nah)
(I'm talking Christmas, ooh, ooh, I'm talking, I'm talking)

Look at all those presents that's a big sack
Boy, that package way too big to gift-wrap
Woke up this morning thought I'd write a Christ-smash
How quickly can you build a snowman? Think fast
