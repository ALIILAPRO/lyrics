		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In our headlights
Staring, bleak
Beer cans
Deer's eyes

On the asphalt
Underneath 
Our crushed plans
And my lies

Lonely street signs
Power lines
They keep on flashing
Flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

Your breath
Hot upon my cheek
And we crossed
That line

You made me strong
When I was feeling weak
And we crossed
That one time

Screaming stop signs
Staring wild eyes
Keep on flashing
Flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

The devil grins from ear to ear when he sees the hand he's dealt us
Points at your flaming hair and then we're playin' hide and seek

I can't breathe easy here 'less our trail's gone cold behind us
'til in the john mirror you stare at yourself grown old and weak

We keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night...
