		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look at me with those eyes, those eyes
I feel like I'm in paradise, paradise
God, I know, it's too good to be true
After a couple months passed, we're past
You needed someone new, found a new flex
God, I know, I'm in it to lose

Can't you see I'm cryin'?
Can't you see I'm broken?
Still falling for the same old tricks
You're a broken heart that can't be fixed
Giving me the whole world
Then set it all on fire
'Cause you do it for the hell of it
You're a goddamn narcissist

I'm hatin' how my head works, heart hurts
You leave me at my worst, I put you first
All I know, it's killing me how
You're looking at me, looking at me crawlin', callin'
Begging you to come back, so pathetic
How I need you here to breathe
And you're not even missin' me

Can't you see I'm cryin'?
Can't you see I'm broken?
Still falling for the same old tricks
You're a broken heart that can't be fixed
Giving me the whole world
Then set it all on fire
'Cause you do it for the hell of it
You're a goddamn narcissist

So I run to the car, leave you in the past
Driving fast, driving far
And when you call me hurtin'
I won't flinch, I won't fall
And I'll do it for the hell of it
'Cause even I can be a narcissist
Run to the car, leave you in the past
Driving fast, driving far
And when you call me hurtin'
I won't flinch, I won't fall
And I'll do it for the hell of it
'Cause even I can be a narcissist

'Cause even I can be a narcissist
