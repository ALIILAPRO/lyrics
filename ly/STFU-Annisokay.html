		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never believe
Never believe
Never believe

Do you still believe the myth?
Do you still believe the hype
Still following the piper
Like the corpse that draws the flies?
It was all just a load of bullshit
Born of the fake fucking news
That you read out like the gospel
And you still believe it's true

It's easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is so damn flat
It is easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is full of hate

Never just believe any old shit you read
Mixing urban myths with science fiction
Never just repeat what someone else believes
Spreading hate and fear with pure fiction

Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up now
And start using your own brain

Do we still believe in ghosts?
Do we still believe the rumours
Of someone throwing apples
Over the walls of Eden?
It was all just a load of bullshit
Born of the fake fucking news
That you read out like the gospel
Full of facts from a social feed

It's easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is so damn flat
It's easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is full of hate

Never just believe any old shit you read
Mixing urban myths with science fiction
Never just repeat what someone else believes
Spreading hate and fear with pure fiction

Shut the fuck up
You crowned yourself the king
(Shut the fuck up now)
Of the weak and the cowards
You crowned yourself the king
Without using your own brain

Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Oh
Shut the fuck up now
