		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First off you can take a load off
And if you're feeling funny, you'll get bucked off
Like a grey hair, you'll get plucked off
And like a parasite, you can suck off
I don't know who made you but they probably fucked up
You've go a lot to say but you don't use your mouth
If you wanna kick dirt, you can go south
A little crack in your bones, that's a small shell

I have a special place that I've always trusted
It's been with me for some time, we are well adjusted
If someone knocks at your door and they are uninvited
You can call the dogs out and show them how to bite it

Fingers still moving, they'll get chopped off
So what would make you think that you can mouth off?
Like a grey hair, you'll get plucked off
Like a parasite, you can suck off
I don't need your reasons, you can suck it
To me, you ain't nothing but a name in a bucket
If you wanna kick dirt, you can go south
A little crack in your bones, that's a small shell

I have a special place that I've always trusted
It's been with me for some time, we are well adjusted
If someone knocks at your door and they are uninvited
You can call the dogs out and show them how to bite it

You can let the dogs out
You can let the dogs out
You can let the dogs out
You can let the dogs out

I have a special place that I've always trusted
It's been with me for some time, we are well adjusted
If someone knocks at your door and they are uninvited
You can call the dogs out and show them how to bite it
