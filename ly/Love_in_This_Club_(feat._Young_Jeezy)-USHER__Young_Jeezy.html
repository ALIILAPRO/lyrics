		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I do it for the ladies
But I gotta keep it hood
Where we at Polow? (Ay)
I see you Ryon
Yo, Keith, you was right
But we just gettin' started
Yeah, man

You say, you searching for somebody
That'll take you out and do you right (do you right)
Well, come here, baby, and let daddy show you 
What it feel like (feel like)
You know all you gotta do is 
Tell me what you sippin' on (sippin' on, sippin' on) (ay, ay)
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin' all night long

Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side (ay)
And I think that, shorty, I got a thing for you, yeah
Doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin' it
I can tell by the way, you lookin' at me, girl

I wanna make love in this club (ay) (wanna make love)
In this club (ay) (yeah)
In this club (ay) (ohh, I), in this club (ay)

I wanna make love in this club (ay) (make love)
In this club (ay) (in this club)
In this club (ay) (yeah), in this club, yeah

Listen, if you got some friends rollin' wit' you, baby
Then that's cool (that's cool, that's cool)
You can leave 'em wit' my homies
Let 'em know that I got you (got you) 
Ay, ha (hey, hey)
If you didn't know, you're the only thing
That's on my mind (my mind)
'Cause the way I'm staring at you
Got me wantin' to give it to you all night

Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side (yeah, yeah)
I can't take it no more, baby, I'm coming for you
You keep doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin' it (ay)
If we close our eyes it could just be me and you

I wanna make love in this club (ay)
In this club (ay)
In this club (ay), in this club (ay)

I wanna make love in this club (ay)
In this club (ay) (in this club)
In this club (ay), in this club (ay)

I wanna make love in this club (ay) (ay, yeah)
In this club (ay) (ay, yeah)
In this club (ay), in this club (ay) (ay, I wanna make love)

I wanna make love in this club (ay) (make love, alright)
In this club (ay) (Polow, you a fool for this one, homie)
In this club (ay), in this club, yeah (yeah, let's go)

I'm what you want (I'm what you want)
I'm what you need (I'm what you need)
He got you trapped (he got you trapped)
I'll set you free sexually, mentally
Physically, emotionally (ay)
I'll be like your medicine
You'll take every dose of me (ha, ha)
It's going down on aisle three
I'll bag you like some groceries (woo)
And every time you think about it
You gon' want some more of me (yeah)
'Bout to hit the club, make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap star, that's if you had your regular car
You ever ever made love to a thug in the club with his sights on?
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on (yeah)
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor (oh)
You can meet me in the bathroom (oh whoa)
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go (I)

Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touchin' like this
I know you scared, baby, they don't know what we doin'
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop 
And I don't care who's watchin', watchin', watchin' 
Watchin', watchin', oh, in this club
On the floor, baby, let's make love

I wanna make love in this club (ay)
In this club (ay) (in this club)
In this club (ay), in this club (ay) (make love)

I wanna make love in this club (ay) (yeah)
In this club (ay) (in this club)
In this club (ay), in this club, yeah (lovin' in this, love in this club)

Ay, yeah
Ay, ay
Love, oh, in the club
What you want, can you freak me, babe? (Ay)
In the back (ay), on the side (ay)
In the front (ay), left, right (ay)
Ay, yeah (ay)
Crank that back, back (ay), yeah
