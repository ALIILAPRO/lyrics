		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And alka seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot

It's been awhile since we talked last and I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name

I love the way she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back in my arms into my arms once more for sure

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise

And it doesn't stop there
Man I swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song

But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word

And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like you

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot
