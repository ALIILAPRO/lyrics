		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where did you come from? I wanna know
The way that you're moving
It's hard to move on
I can't help but feel what
I feel for you baby
I know we've just met but
I hope you ain't taken

Senorita, I wanna get to know ya
You got that kind of flavor
That I just wanna taste and come back around
Baby, I'm burning up like fire
You're hotter than Dubai
Together we can burn this motherfucker down

Together we can together we can
Burn this motherfucker down

Where did you come from? I wanna know
The way that you're moving
It's hard to move on
I can't help but feel what I feel for you
Baby i know we've just met but
I hope you ain't taken

Senorita, I wanna get to know ya
You got that kind of flavor
That I just wanna taste and come back around
Baby, I'm burning up like fire
You're hotter than Dubai together we can

Senorita, I wanna get to know ya
You got that kind of flavor
That I just wanna taste and come back around
Baby, I'm burning up like fire
You're hotter than Dubai
Together we can burn this motherfucker down

Together we can together we can
Burn this motherfucker down
