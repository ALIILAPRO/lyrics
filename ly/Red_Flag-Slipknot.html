		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Past just saving, this is like escaping
Running wild in the middle of weeds
Eyes can't see me, careful with your breathing
Get away or they get to feed
Strength's not enough, be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer, you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better, begin it
Your energy won't keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

You don't know me
You can't hold me
This is beginning
You are an ending
They'll smother their own just to feel you
They'll get you alone just to steal you
They'll eat you alive just to kill you
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Vultures salivate, poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation, cattle on displacement, you want
To reason but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all could fuck off 
And go back to hell where you belong

You don't know me
You can't hold me
This is beginning
You are an ending
They'll smother their own just to feel you
They'll get you alone just to steal you
They'll eat you alive just to kill you
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Plague, don't panic
Don't believe the riddle that confuses you
Bitch, so manic
I can see the light that exposes you
So dramatic, now it's all empathetic means
The bigger the mouth that I can eat you with
Force of habit, God you reek of your havoc
But consider the sources you've been tampering with!

They'll smother their own just to feel you
They'll get you alone just to steal you
They'll eat you alive just to kill you
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing
They'll smother their own just to feel you
They'll get you alone just to steal you
They'll eat you alive just to kill you
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Now you're nothing
Now you're nothing
Now you're nothing new
New
New
Yeah
