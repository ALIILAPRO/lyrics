		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know me, you know me
You know the whole me, gang shit

These are my friends
These are definitely my friends
This is the first lesson
And me realizing
I wasn't alone
Fuck it

Creeping through the night
On a Routemaster bus
One street to another
And as I look around
All I see is fragile hearts
Hello, mate
I'm not gonna be here forever
Fuck it

You are my friend
Somehow, we all remain together

Their acceptance is making me feel a bit awkward
Let's dance again, shall we?

So, here we go
Shoulders up
Type out
Here comes the routine

All the pain and all the Cartier you can wear
I wanna give you a big kiss on your sweaty forehead
These are my friends
These are my friends
I love ya

Let's dance again, shall we?

(You're my brother, you're my brother, you know?)

Fucking hate ya
I don't mean that, actually
I actually really like ya
I've got no fucking choice, now shut up
I'm sorry
