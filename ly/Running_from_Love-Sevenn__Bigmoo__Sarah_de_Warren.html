		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your skin on me
Still lingering
And piece by piece 
You take it all


Feelings creeping in
And it's scaring me 
I can barely breathe
But my heart still beats
Right in front of me
But i'm out of reach
Behind these walls 


I keep running from love when it comes
Afraid of being close cus so close is too much
So touch me in the dark, would that be enough?
Would that be enough?
If i keep running from your love


Run-nana-nana-nana
Running from ya 
Nana-nanana-nana
Running from ya 
Nana-nanana-nana
Would that be enough?
If i keep running from your love

Your skin on me
Still lingering
And piece by piece 
You take it all


Feelings creeping in
And it's scaring me 
I can barely breathe
But my heart still beats
Right in front of me
But i'm out of reach
Behind these walls 


I keep running from love when it comes
Afraid of being close cus so close is too much
So touch me in the dark, would that be enough?
Would that be enough?
If i keep running from your love


Run-nana-nana-nana
Running from ya 
Nana-nanana-nana
Running from ya 
Nana-nanana-nana
Would that be enough?
If i keep running from your love
