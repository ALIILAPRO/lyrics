		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no
Oh no
Oh no, oh no

You'll never make me stay so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you please let me be
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me

She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you please"
I am the stuff the you want, I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be, ooh

She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She's sayin', "That's okay, hey baby do what you want"
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star

Dirty Diana, no (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty Diana, no (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty Diana, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty Diana (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty Diana, ooh (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty Diana, no (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty Diana, no (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty Diana let me be, ooh (oh, oh, oh)

Ooh

She said, "I have to go home 'cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"
Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "Unlock the door 'cause I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"

Dirty Diana, no (ooh)
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no (oh)
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no (dirty Di-, dirty Di-)
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be, ooh (oh)

Oh (oh, no)
Oh (no)
Oh

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
