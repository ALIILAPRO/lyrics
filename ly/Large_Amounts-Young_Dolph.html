		<p>
		  Ayy, yo, BandPlay
(Let the BandPlay)

I don't mean no harm but I been showin' my ass lately (damn)
Large amounts daily (damn), I been goin' crazy (damn)
I been dancin' with the devil, God, can you save me? (Please)
Every dope boy dream to ride in a brand new Mercedes (uh)
Bad bitch say I'm her favorite (yeah, yeah)
Drippin' in the latest (drippin', drippin')
Bitch say I'm contagious (hey, hey)
I don't believe none these niggas, don't see none these niggas
These niggas be cap (Super cap)
I got a confession to make (what?)
I sold my soul to the trap (yeah, yeah)

Sold my soul to the trap
Got my money and took it back
I show all my niggas love
If I don't know you then you get taxed
If I didn't grow up with you
Then I can't serve you, you might be a rat (damn)
Came through the door with them racks (racks)
We got the straps in through the back (hey)
Came in the door with this shit (yeah, yeah)
Long money, lil' nigga, I'm thinkin' 'bout ownin' shit (racks, racks)
Sold all them bricks in your raps
But you was broke and shit (ayy, cut that shit out)
Yeah, I just spent twenty-thousand just on the coat and shit
Ayy, blind to the bullshit, call me Ray (Ray Charles)
My location is the bank, that's where I stay (yeah, yeah)
Hardest worker in the business, call me James (James Brown)
Set my old-school on some forgis and blew out their brains (uh)

I don't mean no harm but I been showin' my ass lately (damn)
Large amounts daily (damn), I been goin' crazy (damn)
I been dancin' with the devil, God, can you save me? (Please)
Every dope boy dream to ride in a brand new Mercedes (uh)
Bad bitch say I'm her favorite (yeah, yeah)
Drippin' in the latest (drippin', drippin')
Bitch say I'm contagious (hey, hey)
I don't believe none these niggas, don't see none these niggas
These niggas be cap (super cap)
I got a confession to make (what?)
I sold my soul to the trap (yeah, yeah)

Yeah, I had to do what I had to do (ayy)
I had to move when I had to move (ayy)
I come from shit so I can't lose (for real, for real, though)
Got-got-got-got a pocket full of Blue's Clues (woo)
Bad bitches, I got beaucoupes (woo)
Don't get in this coupe with them shoes (ayy, take 'em off)
Get money, forever my mood (woo)
They watchin', they study my mood (yeah)
Nigga, I don't play by the rules (yeah)
Shinin' heart, check out the jewels (woo)
I put on the baguettes today (woo)
Picked up a bag yesterday (woo)
I do my thang with the weight (ha)
Under the floor, got a safe (hey)
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money
I could never ever, ever let a bitch run me
I'm in the Ferrari eatin' hot wings from Crumpy's
Park Avenue and Orange Mound on a Monday

I don't mean no harm but I been showin' my ass lately (damn)
Large amounts daily (damn), I been goin' crazy (damn)
I been dancin' with the devil, God, can you save me? (Please)
Every dope boy dream to ride in a brand new Mercedes (uh)
Bad bitch say I'm her favorite (yeah, yeah)
Drippin' in the latest (drippin', drippin')
Bitch say I'm contagious (hey, hey)
I don't believe none these niggas, don't see none these niggas
These niggas be cap (super cap)
I got a confession to make (what?)
I sold my soul to the trap (yeah, yeah)
