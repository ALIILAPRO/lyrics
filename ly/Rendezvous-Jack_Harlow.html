		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hit-Boy)

I became exactly what I wanted to (wanted to)
I became a millionaire at twenty-two (twenty-two)
Tellin' girls I love 'em and they love me too (woo)
I don't question if they mean it 'cause I know they do
Started bein' me when I realized it was okay to
Middle school bumpin' Waka Flocka, "O Let's Do It"
First album and I know just how it's gon' debut
Track three is where I tell her we gon' rendezvous
I'm signed to the gatekeepers (facts)
Don't believe the gossip 'cause it ain't true
Half of the dreams I had already came true
And they never told me anythin' I couldn't do
I got a mirror in my room I like to look into
At seventeen, I never thought that I would look this cute (Woo)
Classmates can't believe the place I took it to
If I didn't rap then I would be a good masseuse
Fun fact, but it's a hidden talent, 'cause she rubbin' my back (back)
All these different cities, I'm becomin' sidetracked
She leavin' my hotel wearin' somethin' I packed
My wardrobe's spread across the whole map (whole map)
JWise used to book me for the open mics
Kills me when they act like this was overnight
Like we didn't do a tour in a tiny van (mmm)
Eight deep at the show, it might be eight fans (mmm)
That builds character, somethin' y'all could probably use more of
If I told the truth to her, I know she'd be tore up
They love it when I rap and I don't even put a chorus
Turkey on ciabatta from the deli, shout out to Morris
Thirty grand to show up, we might as well pour up
Fake handshakes, we know you ain't goin' for us
Ooh, it's somethin' 'bout your aura
I know
