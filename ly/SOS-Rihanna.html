		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
You know, I've never felt like this before (oh, oh)
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
This feels, like, so unreal (oh, oh)

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

S.O.S., please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right
S.O.S., please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (over heels)
Boy, you keep me hanging on, the way you make me feel

S.O.S., please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard (Y-O-U are)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me (yeah)
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And, boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

S.O.S., please, someone help me (yeah)
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard (oh, why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', I can't sleep at night (ooh)

This time, please, someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it (all of the time)
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it (best of me, I'm losing it)

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
Oh-oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
Oh-oh
