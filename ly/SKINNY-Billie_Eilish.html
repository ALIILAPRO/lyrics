		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hmm, hmm

Fell in love for the first time
With a friend, it's a good sign
Feelin' off when I feel fine
Twenty-one took a lifetime
People say I look happy
Just because I got skinny
But the old me is still me and maybe the real me
And I think she's pretty

And I still cry
Cry
And you know why

Am I acting my age now?
Am I already on the way out?
When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage
I'm a dog in a dog pound
And you said I was your secret
And you didn't get to keep it
And the internet is hungry for the meanest kinda funny
And somebody's gotta feed it

Oh, do you still cry?
Still cry
Cry

I never did you wrong (never did you wrong)
And my (oh), my patience is gone (is gone)
And I (I), I never did you wrong (you)
I, I loved you for so long (hmm)
