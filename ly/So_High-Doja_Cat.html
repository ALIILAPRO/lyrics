		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me, you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths

You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high

You got me so turnt up, this dude gotta be so high
Weed always on my mind, now he always on my mind
Doja, know you want some of this purr
You ain't gotta say a word, just spark that, let's get burnt, uh
Then we'll roll up a hunnid fuckin' blunts
All up in my mouth, now I'm all up in your
This nigga got pounds of it all up in his trunk
Now we both look Asian, he wavin' and I'm drunk
I got dank shit in my cup, you know what I'ma do to you
I could get real used to you, blow, weed, X
And we sippin' on that juicy-juice
That's just what she choose to do, uh
Man, this shit these drugs will do to you

Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me, you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths

You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high

Six hits, ten pounds, gone off the dro
Six hits, ten pounds, gone off the dro
Six hits, ten pounds, gone off the dro
Gone off the dro, gone off the dro
