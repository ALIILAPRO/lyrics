		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in

What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in

What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in

Now would you be yourself or play a role?
Tell all the boys or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away?
Or play me off or would you stay?
Oh

And if at first you don't succeed (Oh)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

And if at first you don't succeed (Oh)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again

And if at first you don't succeed (Oh)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again

And if at first you don't succeed (Oh)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
