		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't be so bad
I still feel you there
Tears, they fell so many
How could I be so wrong?
How could I be so strong?
Nothing else compares
How could I be so wrong?
How could I be so strong?

I came to find death, I stayed for life
I came here foolish, I left here wise
I'm waiting for something I can't deny
A truth, a sermon, a sacrifice
I wanna wake up and all is love
Forget the trouble I made up
The waves are coming across the shore
These dreams of mine go on and on

How could I be so wrong?
How could I be so wrong?

I came to find death, I stayed for life
I came here foolish, I left here wise
I'm waiting for something I can't deny
A truth, a sermon, a sacrifice
I wanna wake up and all is love
Forget the trouble I made up
The waves are coming across the shore
These dreams of mine go on and on
