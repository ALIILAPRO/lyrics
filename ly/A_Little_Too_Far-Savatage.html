		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember
Look at me
And all the things we'd said we'd be
We'd beat the house
We'd push the odds
We'd take it all we had the cards

With years to burn
And years to trash
Living lies based on flash
But somehow reaching for the stars
I think we went a bit too far

Got to get back
Got to get back
I never meant to take it this far

When everything you touch turns gold
Can weigh you down
Can make you old
When metal doesn't ring the same
Reaction from inside your brain
And all those years we offered up
To gods who couldn't get enough
And though we still stay up all night
The mornings aren't quite as bright

Got to get back
Got to get back
I never meant to take it this far

And all those things we thought we'd learned
As we watched our bridges burn
While standing in the afterglow
I guess we gave them quite a show

When John Wayne caught the last train out
And Spock and Kirk have had enough
And no one's left to beam me up
Got to get back
Got to get back
I never meant to take it this far
