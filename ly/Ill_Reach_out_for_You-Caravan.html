		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't wanna spend your life like a shadow
Living in and out of your dreams
Gotta find a way, way out of there

Gotta know that something good is a coming
When you can't work out what it seems 
You're gonna need someone 
Someone who cares
Someone, someone good
Someone who can make a change
And tell it like it should
Someone who can say
I don't care what time it is just
Find another way

You're gonna need somebody to lean on
Be the one to help you on through
One who says
I'll reach out for you

There's a time for living
A time for dying
There's a time for less
And a time for more
There's a time to make a stand
A time to lend a hand
And to weigh up all of
That is yours

There'll come a way
There'll come a day
You need a helping hand

Oh o oh it's such a crying shame
Could be a loser's game
You gotta come
Come right out and say

If I could tell you
Life would be easy
I'd be one step nearer to my youth
If we can take it
Just one step further
We would find the same
The same old truth

You've gotta stand or you will fall
What you do not what you say
Oh you got to make a choice
You got to find a voice  
Come on and take
Take this chance to say

I'll reach out for you
I'll reach out for you
