		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Don't know why, but I think that he makes me smile)

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby, that's my favorite part (oh)
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love (yeah, yeah)

If you wanna stay, we're takin' it slow, baby
'Cause you and me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine, oh-oh

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part (babe)
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love
