		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue Monday
Blarin' loudly out the speakers
Fluorescent liquid in his beaker
Another night they've gone too far
She said
"I don't usually do this kind of thing
Does it change the way you think of me?"
Thinkin' isn't his forte

And she said
"If you dance with me, darlin'
If you take me home
Will we talk in the morning?"

They leave
Weave around the night's commotion
And dodge a Mexican standoff
And catch a cab back to his flat
There's no romance
Sprawled out across the couch
Can't even make his fuckin' face out
An age-old ritual

And she said
"If you dance with me, darlin'
If you take me home
Will we talk in the morning?"

Sometimes I close my eyes
And sometimes, I see you're fine

She said
"If you dance with me, darlin'
If you take me home
Will we talk in the morning?"
