		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew I loved you, before I knew you
The hands of time would lead me to you
An evening star, watched from afar
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here

Now wrapped in moonlight, at last together
Here in the incandescent glow, we are all we need to know
As we softly please each other 'til the stars and shadows glow
And we sing with our dreams among us

It guided me here, It knew you'd be here

I knew I loved you, before I found you
And you had built my world around you
Now all my days, they're now my nights
And my tomorrows will all begin and end, with you
