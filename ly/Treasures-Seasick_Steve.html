		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I walk down your street
Through your barred windows you look at me
And you wonder, have I come to ask
For one of your precious things that do not last

All your treasures
All your treasures

You think you know me but you don't know
That there's more to this picture than that shows
And you fear that I come to steal
Your security that ain't real

All your treasures
All your treasures

I will leave now and you won't cry
With relief now you'll just sigh
You'll remember come one day
And you'll walk out your door
'Cause you can't stay

While all your treasures
All your treasures slip away

All your treasures
All your treasures
