		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If the night turned cold 
And the stars looked down
And you'd hug yourself 
On the cold, cold ground
You wake the morning 
In a stranger's coat
No one would you see

You ask yourself
Who'd watch for me?
My only friend 
Who could it be?
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me

When your belly's empty 
And the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg 
Too dumb to steal
You search the city 
For your only friend
No one would you see

You ask yourself
Who could it be?
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I hate to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me

You're not the easiest person 
I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both 
To let our feelings show
Some would say 
I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry

If there's one guy
Just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me

When the world's gone crazy
And it makes no sense
And there's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out
Your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see

If there's one guy
Just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it 
But it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me

I hate to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me

I hate to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me
