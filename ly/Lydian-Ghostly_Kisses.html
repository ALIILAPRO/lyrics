		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How I wish I always knew
I would always drift towards you
Even if I risk my old ways
To uncover what I blindly kept away

What I blindly kept away
What I blindly kept 

And how small a thought can seem 
Yet last beyond any other ideas?
Well, none of it matters
If you're not here to see it with me

If I always knew
How to break down walls like you
Even if it’s not what we need now
At each and every turns there’s always you

Every turns there’s always you
Every turns, always

And how small a thought can seem 
Yet last beyond any other ideas?
Well, none of it matters
If you're not here to see it with me

Walking in the streets 
Filling my thoughts and my reverie
Can only hear this Lydian theme
Over and over in my head

And how small a thought can seem 
Yet last beyond any other ideas?
Well, none of it matters
If you're not here to see it with me
