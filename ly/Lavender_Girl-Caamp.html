		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd never danced
'Til I danced with you, my love
Couldn't hear the music
But I'm sure it was good stuff
I'd never sang
With a tear falling from my eye
And every time I lose it
Oh, and I'm not afraid to cry

I'd never spoke
To one like you before
Told you all my secrets
And you wanted more
I'd never looked
Into eyes as clear as yours
And every time I lose it
Nothing matters more

Oh, don't look now
If the superstition's got you down
There's no right way to get back to a heart, oh Lord
Don't you worry 'bout how
But I got it all figured out
They can take my name and take my fame
Lavender girl, take me back to the start

Oh, don't look now
If the superstition's got you down
There's no right way to get back to a heart, oh Lord
Don't you worry 'bout how
But I got it all figured out
They can take my name and take my fame
Lavender girl, take me back to the
Lavender girl, take me back to the
Lavender girl, take me back to the start
Lavender girl, take me back in your heart
