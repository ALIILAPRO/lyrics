		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lights are all turned down in this town
And we're not allowed to dance here anymore
When we're fighting without sound
Better take it underground
'Cause we're not allowed to dance here anymore, anymore
Anymore
When we're fighting without sound
Better take it underground
'Cause we're not allowed to dance here anymore, anymore

So then they take your rights
So you don't see them going
We don't truly understand but someone we all know it
Let the people dance
Let the people dance
All we have are memories of nights like this

But the lights are all turned down in this town
And we're not allowed to dance here anymore
When we're fighting without sound
Better take it underground
'Cause we're not allowed to dance here anymore, anymore
Anymore

When we're fighting without sound
Better take it underground
'Cause we're not allowed to dance here anymore, anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Let the people dance
Let the people dance
