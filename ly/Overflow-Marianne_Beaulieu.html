		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the thoughts start spiraling
And the words won't seem to come
You can try to be yourself
Wait that's too much
Don't act like someone else
You're not blending in enough
The river's flowing in
They say turn it down a notch
Feel that overflow
Already came this far
Too bad it's how things are
It'll come and go
You're not alone
Feel that overflow
Already came this far
Too bad it's how things are
It'll come and go
You're not alone
An avalanche of thoughts
It never seems to stop
There's a million other kids
Who think outside the box
You're not comfortable inside
You've been acting your whole life
So when the morning comes
Make sure you see the light
Feel that overflow
Already came this far
Too bad it's how things are
It'll come and go
You're not alone
Ooh
Feel that overflow
Already came this far
Too bad it's how things are
It'll come and go
You're not alone
I can't help but feeling lost
In a sea of make-believe
I'll let that overflow wash over me
Me
Feel that overflow
Already came this far
Too bad it's how things are
It'll come and go
You're not alone
No ooh
Feel that overflow
Already came this far
Too bad it's how things are
It'll come and go
You're not alone
Feel that overflow
Already came this far
Too bad it's how things are
It'll come and go
You're not alone
