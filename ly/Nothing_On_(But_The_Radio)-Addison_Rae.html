		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm calling 'cause I need you
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get
And you know how good I can be
I'm calling just to tell you
Get here, I'll make it all worth your while
I can make you some food
I know you'll be wearin' a smile

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And my heart playing the song that you like
You're with me tonight

You better get here soon
Or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And my heart playing the song that you like
You're with me tonight

When you get here, boy, we can dance
You know what I wanted is no romance
I've turned all the lights down low
And we've got nothing on but the radio

'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And my heart playing the song that you like
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And my heart playing the song that you like
You're with me tonight
