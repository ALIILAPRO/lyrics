		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They see me doin' me and
They get so inspirated bitch you know me
I ain't worried 'bout who hatin'
Smokin' seaweed, man, now I sit adjacent
Fallin' jewels jinglin' hanging from
Me while a ranger
Posted, no clip, just peace in my holster
Plan B, pull the blade on him, now he hold up
Grow up
I ain't Sosa but I still made her glow up
Thunder man, tundra boy, cold like Dakota

Young and I'm gorgeous
The flow fuckin' flawless
I know that talk is cheap
But from me you can't afford it
Drugs in my cauldron, mixin' up the potion
Young white witch in the Styx, just flowin'
Creepin' like I'm Voldo
Posted in the corridor
Gimme the light like Sean Paul
Smokin' like I'm on parole
I said, "Stop, you lyin'
You actin' like you grind
You flexin' in them Benzes
But them bitches still parked
Hope your momma ain't around to
See her son be nothin'
Hope you know nobody 'round when
You say you stuntin'"
No mask, no axe, just a blade on my lap
Birdbaths in the back let you
Know it's like that
Green grass, white stone
Got a pool in my room
Diving board made of diamonds
Shining while I'm in my tomb
No Rolex, no, give a fuck about the time
Cause no matter what they say
I know I'll always be mine
