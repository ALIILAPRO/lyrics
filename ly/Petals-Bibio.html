		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To see age in a flower
The dawns are speeding up
You know it'll hurt you
Feel all of a sudden
Tired and teary-eyed
You knew it'd kill you

Don't wear a tie that'll choke you to death in the city
Take it off and forget
Spare the fret that'll make you miss all of summer
Sweat it out and forgive

To see loss in a shower
The petals turn to mush
It still disappoints you
Then less of a sudden
You wire your weary mind
To let it deceive you

Don't force a smile that'll make you resent the city
Play it soft and forgive
Keep the frown that'll make you squint in the summer
Play it slow and forget
