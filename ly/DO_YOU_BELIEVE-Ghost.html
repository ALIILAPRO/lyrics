		<p>
		  Do you do believe in? Ohhhh
I'm asking, do you believe in? Ohhhhh
Do you believe in?
Just a question Ghost a ask, you know? Haha

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all, is said and done
You're going to be my only one, oh oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Then what am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
And I can't do that there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
But I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you oh oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

But I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
Oh I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
