		  Oh my God
(Oh my God)

I don't really talk like this, I know (I know)
But this nigga got a real big woo for sure (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Said he wanna take it to the room, let's go (leggo)
He ain't gotta tell me what to do, I know (for sure)

Nasty, you ain't gotta ask me
Give it to you like you need it, no IG, he double-tap it (daddy)
Dick so good, make you put it in a caption
I'm drunk, I need that action (damn)
He want a quickie, let him lick me, then I started gaspin' (huh?)
The way his tongue be goin' crazy, you wouldn't imagine (oh my God)
I let him stick me, hair got frizzy, I might let him crash in (whoa)
I'm joking but his woo got me thinkin' so irrational (woo, woo)
I only speak the truth, I'll be the last one to gas him up
I tell him that he better eat it like he starving (what?)
Put this pussy in his mouth while he yawning
He put that woo all down my throat until I started coughing
He kill it every single time, put me in a coffin (yeah)

I don't really talk like this, I know (I know)
But this nigga got a real big woo for sure (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Said he wanna take it to the room, let's go (leggo)
He ain't gotta tell me what to do, I know (for sure)

I don't really talk like this, I know (I know)
But this nigga got a real big woo for sure (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Said he wanna take it to the room, let's go (leggo)
He ain't gotta tell me what to do, I know

He like it when I bend it over and I arch my back
He tap me on my shoulders, I said, "Yeah, I like that" (whoa)
This pussy don't purr, this pussy'll bite back
And that woo so good, I sound like his hype man
Now that woo got me doing all the nasty things I said I wouldn't do
We can do it in the car or we can take it to the room
Pull the panties to the side, watch a movie and make it two
We just finished number one, but I'm ready for round two

I don't really talk like this, I know (I know)
But this nigga got a real big woo for sure (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Said he wanna take it to the room, let's go (leggo)
He ain't gotta tell me what to do, I know (for sure)

I don't really talk like this, I know (I know)
But this nigga got a real big woo for sure (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Said he wanna take it to the room, let's go (leggo)
He ain't gotta tell me what to do, I know
