		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I be your lover
Can I be your lover for tonight
Can't believe I suffered
Can't believe I suffered for a goodbye
Can I be your lover
Can I be your lover for tonight
Can't believe I suffered
Can't believe I suffered for a goodbye

I'm slowly finding my old groove again
But it's lonely going down this road again
And I'm hoping that we would still be friends in the end
But I'm hoping, yeah I'm hoping

Can I be your lover
Can I be your lover for tonight
Can't believe I suffered
Can't believe I suffered for a goodbye
Can I be your lover
Can I be your lover for tonight
Can't believe I suffered
Can't believe I suffered for a goodbye
