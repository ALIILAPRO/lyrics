		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk me back to the door
'Cause you don't want me to go alone
You keep everything inside
It makes sense cause you're a Scorpio
I wear a mask too, I can see through you
Can you see me too?
Everyone wants you
I wonder how that feels
Has it always been like this or
Did you make a deal
With the devil
Did she cut your heart out
And add it to her collection?
Or were you the exception, Scorpio
Get me out of your web
Get me out of your web
Get me out of your web
