		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We should leave our lovers
And be with one another
Run your fingers through my hair
And hide under my covers

We should leave our lovers
We should run after each other
We can share our secrets
'Till they swallow one another

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
But you'll never leave your lover, no
You'll never leave your lover

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another, no

Leave me in the silence
I'll let you cut me open
Help me from the inside out slow motion

I feel you in my blood, baby
Bring your body closer
Love me with your sad eyes
Drain me of my color

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
But you'll never leave your lover, no
You'll never leave your lover

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another, no

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
But you'll never leave your lover, no
You'll never leave your lover

Fiction echos
Gold echos
Saints echos

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another, no

You'll never leave your lover, no
You'll never leave your lover
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another

I need you like no other, no
I need you like no other, no
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another

I need you like no other, no
I need you like no other, no
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
But you'll never leave your lover, no
You'll never leave your lover

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another, no

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
But you'll never leave your lover, no
You'll never leave your lover

We should leave our lovers
We should, we should leave our lovers
I need you like no other, no
I'll never find another, no

We should leave our lovers
So then we can choose each other
