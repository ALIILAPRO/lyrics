		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Einstein was not a handsome fellow
Nobody ever called him Al
He had a long moustache to pull on
It was yellow

I don't believe he ever had a girl
One thing he missed out in his theory
of time, space and relativity
Is something that makes it very clear

He was never gonna score like you'n'me
He didn't know about Quark, Strangeness and Charm
I had a dangerous liaison
To have been found out would've been a disgrace

We had to rendezvous some mesons
On the corner of an undiscovered place
We got sick of chat chat chatter and the
look upon everybody's face

But all that does not anti-matter now
We've found ourselves a black hole in space
And we're talking about Quark, Strangeness and Charm
Copernicus had those Renaissance ladies

Crazy about his telescope
And Galileo had a name that made his
reputation higher than his hopes
Did none of those astronomers discover

While they were staring out into the dark
That what a lady looks for in her lover
is Charm, Strangeness and Quark.
