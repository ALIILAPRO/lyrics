		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold the line for this caravan of souls
No one really knows the way home
No one really wants to atone
Hold the line as it breaks just like a wave
We succumb to all the depravity
As it slowly digs our grave

It seems the only way to be reborn again
Is to already have passed on before
It seems the only way is through
And the only thing that ever meant anything was you

Hold the line for this caravan of souls
No one really knows the way home
No one really wants to atone
Hold the line as it breaks just like a wave
We succumb to all the depravity
As it slowly digs our grave

It seems we’re here again, this inquisition for the truth
I’ve never seen this beauty before
It seems the only way is through
And the only thing that ever meant anything was you
Hold the line

Hold the line for this caravan of souls
No one really knows the way home
No one really wants to atone
Hold the line as it breaks just like a wave
We succumb to all the depravity
As it slowly digs our grave

The only way out is through
The only way out is through

Hold the line for this caravan of souls
No one really knows the way home
No one really wants to atone
Hold the line as it breaks just like a wave
We succumb to all the depravity
As it slowly digs our grave

Hold the line
Hold the line
Hold the line
Hold the line
