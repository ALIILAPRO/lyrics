		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late in the night
You say that you need me
Chasing the highs
Touching the skies
You can believe me
Dive into where your heart lies
Searching for a paradise


But if we ever met in another life
Would we still be together till
The worlds collide
Running through my mind
You put a spell tonight
On me


Take me to the firestorm
Catch me like you did before
Nobody but you
Who can take me to
Take me to the firestorm, firestorm


Nobody but you
Who can take me to
Take me to the firestorm, firestorm


You light my fire
You get me higher
Reach for the stars
Flying to mars
And you must feel it too
Nobody gets me like you
But you


But if we ever met in another life
Would we still be together till
The worlds collide
Running through my mind
You put a spell tonight
On me


Take me to the firestorm
Catch me like you did before
Nobody but you
Who can take me to
Take me to the firestorm, firestorm
Take me to the firestorm
Catch me like you did before
Nobody but you
Who can take me to
Take me to the firestorm, firestorm


No one in this world
Just me and you
Let it all unfold
I see
Fire in the sky
Fire burning bright
On me


Take me to the firestorm
Catch me like you did before
Nobody but you
Who can take me to
Take me to the firestorm, firestorm
Take me to the firestorm
Catch me like you did before
Nobody but you
Who can take me to
Take me to the firestorm, firestorm
