		  (Germ)

We always out here mobbin' (uh)
Diamonds on my bitch, I told her she be better be with the robbin' (yuh)
Hot topics, hot pocket rockets at your noggin (uh)
Tesla truck, turnt get away stunts I just wanna get away (uh)
We always out here mobbin' (uh)
Diamonds on my bitch, I told her she be better be with the robbin' (yuh)
Hot topics, hot pocket rockets at your noggin (uh)
Tesla truck, turnt get away stunts I just wanna get away (uh)

(Shakewell)
 
Came from out of town, buss it down, no I need the whole shit
Grab a fronto leaf, roll this cookies out by the ocean
I just hit my walk, hit the stage now they start to notice
Now it's 125 for a line of this wocky potion
Said that they want static that's my cousin I'ma slide for em
If it's shameless money then you know that I would die for em
Lost too many homies that make me feel like my heart torn
Gotta put on for em, I just came back from a world tour
All sorts of Gucci, this Prada it make me look good
We can shake it up, get to shootin' like a look book
Y'all be fake as fuck, just gon' do it for the youtube
You can make the sauce, I'm the one who wrote the cookbook

(Germ)

We always out here mobbin' (uh)
Diamonds on my bitch, I told her she be better be with the robbin' (yuh)
Hot topics, hot pocket rockets at your noggin (uh)
Tesla truck, turnt get away stunts I just wanna get away (uh)
We always out here mobbin' (uh)
Diamonds on my bitch, I told her she be better be with the robbin' (yuh)
Hot topics, hot pocket rockets at your noggin (uh)
Tesla truck, turnt get away stunts I just wanna get away (uh)

Top down today we drinkin ros√©
Cocaine colored whips, and big ass backwood full propane
Slidin' through the jungle, steppin on opps doin' em the worse way 
Hundred till I fall, niggas cant kick it move along 
Pocket full of Benji's got me feelin' like the mayor now
Money, power, respect, these niggas gon' have to watch me ball now 
Ridin' with that 100 years, can't go out like no clown dog 
Pesos more pounds dawg, lit bitch lit sick jaw dog
Slidin' bout some bullshit y'all niggas cant compare too 
Bag moves, new whips flipped bitch it's bad news 
Cash still rules everything around me, what that bag do?
Crazy what that bag make a bitch do 

We always out here mobbin' (uh)
Diamonds on my bitch, I told her she be better be with the robbin' (yuh)
Hot topics, hot pocket rockets at your noggin (uh)
Tesla truck, turnt get away stunts I just wanna get away (uh)
We always out here mobbin' (uh)
Diamonds on my bitch, I told her she be better be with the robbin' (yuh)
Hot topics, hot pocket rockets at your noggin (uh)
Tesla truck, turnt get away stunts I just wanna get away (uh)
