		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been lonely, trying to get your attention from a thousand miles away
And you know me, always overthinking the worst possibilities
Yeah, we both know, in between you and me, there's an ocean
Castaway in a sea and it's frozen
I'm exposed, can't you see, all I need is a little warmth

Without your arms around me
Without you on my skin
Without you on my body, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I don't mean to be desperate, or pretend that I'm not torn
But I don't want to let go of the things that keep me warm
Without you I'm just cold

I built a little boat with a sail from the memories I've been collecting
And I'll hold out for the wind to blow me, take me home the whole way, in your direction
Yeah, we both know, in between you and me there's an ocean
And I'm just trying to get a little closer
Pull me in, 'cause I'm here and all I need is little warmth

Without your arms around me
Without you on my skin
Without you on my body, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I don't mean to be desperate, or pretend that I'm not torn
But I don't want to let go of the things that keep me warm
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold

And I need a little fire and you're my gasoline
Light me up, I'm burning, with all these things I feel
I'll always hold this flame for you, but it's naked on the breeze
So let me in, don't lock me out, don't cast me out to sea

Without your arms around me
Without you on my skin
Without you on my body, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I don't mean to be desperate, or pretend that I'm not torn
But I don't want to let go of the things that keep me warm
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold
Without you I'm just cold
