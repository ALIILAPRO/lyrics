		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how to say things that I know are gonna hurt you
I don't know how to carry this burden but I still do
Growing up hasn't made much sense since I left school
Now I'm all alone in my room thinking how did I fuck this up again?

Cause when you're down
I'm not around
When you call for me
I turn down the sound
Instead of facing what I know
I turn away out of hope
That maybe someday I won't think of leaving
When you need me

And I know you wonder how I spend my time
Cause when you text me I take two days to reply 
And I don't know why you won't leave me
The man I am is half of who I used to be

'Cause when you're down
I'm not around
When you call for me
I turn down the sound
Instead of facing what I know
I turn away out of hope
That maybe someday i won't think of leaving
When you need me

I'm doubting myself
Cause everything I said is in the past
That's the past 
Thought that we were gonna last
We could've been happy ever after
Now we're a disaster
And I couldn't run away faster
Cause I never could give you what you want
I tell myself that cause i don't know what i want (hold up)
I need a lesson on self love
No I don't need drugs
Now you're gone I just really wanna see ya
Cause when you're down
Im not around
When you call for me
I turn down the sound
Instead of facing what I know
I turn away out of hope
That maybe someday I won't think of leaving
When you need me
Hello?
