Kamelia Jamelia
Kamelia Jamelia

She's so pretty and I want her
She's the lady, wanna get her
She's my lady, Kamelia

She's so pretty and I want her
She's the lady, wanna get her
She's my lady, Kamelia

She can take you everywhere,
Has a mood of billionaire
Something special in the air
When she's around!
She's the devil in disguise!
If you dare to look her eyes
She would trap you like a prize,
Again AND AGAIN!

Oh oh oh
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love
Oh oh oh
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love

Kamelia Jamelia
Kamelia Jamelia

She's so pretty and I want her
She's the lady, wanna get her
She's my lady, Kamelia

What up baby girl?
Don't wanna interrupt
Just want a little minute
She said, OK whassup?
I seen you across the bar, just sippin' on your drink
No ring on the finger, what I'm supposed to think?!
That you're single girl,
Well I'm a single guy
And by the smile on your face, says I'm right
I wanna hold you up, I like the water
You know I like the pond
Girl, you're my swan

Oh oh oh
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love
Oh oh oh
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go my love

Kamelia Jamelia
Kamelia Jamelia

She's so pretty and I want her
She's the lady, wanna get her
She's my lady, Kamelia

She's so pretty and I want her
She's the lady, wanna get her
She's my lady, Kamelia
