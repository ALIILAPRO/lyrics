		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen baby got to leave you but you know I still love you
But something isn't right, I need my body on the line and I fell too soon

My heart still dreams for you
But my body wants another lover
Is it fair to say that I miss you
When my body wants another lover

Turn out the lights now I want to remember you
I need skin to let me in I want to believe in you

Part of me believes that we have something that's forever unbreakable
But I need to move around, I need to breathe, I need to run just to make me feel

My heart still dreams for you
But my body wants another lover
Is it fair to say that I miss you
When my body wants another lover

Turn out the lights now I want to remember you
I need skin to let me in I want to believe in you
