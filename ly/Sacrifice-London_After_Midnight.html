		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And here we go again,
We've taken it to the end,
With every waking moment,
We face this silent torment

I'd sacrifice,
I'd sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you

I'd sacrifice,
I'd sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you

Darkness is all I want to see
I could never put in to words
What it is you mean to me

I'd sacrifice,
I'd sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you

I'd sacrifice,
I'd sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you
Love you, love you, love you

The candle is burning low
At the window to my soul
The reaper is at my door now
He's come to take me home

I'd sacrifice,
I'd sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you

I'd sacrifice,
I'd sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you

I, I'd sacrifice
