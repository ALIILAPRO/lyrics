		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Built a bridge, but it's burning
Had a table set, now it's turning
We faced the flame, was it worth it?
For the fall

We can't breathe through all the smoke
Within our chest we try
But we're fighting fire with fire, with fire, with fire

Can't love you, we can't hate you
We're just in between flickering
I can't love you, but can't hate you
But don't you see?
We're fighting fire with fire, with fire, with fire
We're fighting fire with fire, with fire, with fire
We're fighting fire with fire
We're fighting fire, with fire

We watch the flames getting taller
Tried to tame it, but there's no water
Run away but keep getting caught up
Every time, ooh

We can't breathe through all the smoke
Within our chest we try
But we're fighting fire with fire, with fire, with fire

Can't love you, we can't hate you
We're just in between flickering
I can't love you, but can't hate you
But don't you see?
We're fighting fire with fire, with fire, with fire
We're fighting fire with fire, with fire, with fire
We're fighting fire with fire
We're fighting fire with fire
