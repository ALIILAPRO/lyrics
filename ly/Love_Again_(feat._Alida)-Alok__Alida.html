		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the sun goes up, when the sun goes down
It's been six days now with insomnia
Try to touch my skin but I feel nothing
I just think of you, don't know what to do

Clock is ticking out and I hear the sound
Like an empty soul playing all day long
And I move my feet but I feel nothing
I pretend to smile but I cry inside

Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?

When the sun goes up, when the sun goes down
All the things I do to get rid of you
Try to make new friends, try to go outside
And I act okay but it's not the same

(I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn)
(Learn to love-love-love-love again?)
(Tell me how will I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I)

Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?

Tell me how
How baby, I need to know, oh
Tell me how
How 'cause my heart's icy cold, oh

Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?

Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again?
