		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Chika-chika-uh) hit 'em
Plain Pat, what up?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
I ain't playing no more 
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Ha-ha, ha-ha, hey

This is my story, this is my song
If you feel it, motherfucka, you can't go wrong
To the screw-face niggas, what you on?
Get off that, get a goal and focus, dawg
See, I'm what you need, you fiendin' now
Ask around and I'll bet you figure out
How to zone and control your future while
Yeah, I think I'm in the future too
I'm unlike fools, who precede the jewels
To be like them, I be like who?
I be like me, Mr. K-i-d S-O-L-O D-O-L-O
See the Lord adore me, He met me half way
No guts, no glory' I always say
So until I reach what I came here to find
Along with inner peace, life will always be a grind
One day I'll be what the world want me to be
I was born to be Super Duper Scott
The one bad bitches called super duper lame
Now super duper fame gives me super duper brains
86 the cape, but I'm super duper high
Soarin' passed the moon, a super duper lonely guy

Down and out, so I'm out and down
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in

For even in Hell, I still have faith
To one day be free with my father at the gates
But make no mistakes, I'll show you what time takes
To be a success on Earth, mixed with all the hate
I stand on my pivot, my life you could not live it
For the things that I've seen have been too damn explicit
But soon you will get it on a CD with some credits
I provide my grind, mixed with no edits
They say they don't want me when I'm fucked up and forgotten
Until I rise up amongst the evils tryna stop 'em
Slow down, bitch, my money is what I'm clockin'
I'm tick-tockin', once I start, I ain't stopping
Such bullshit that my soul deal with
When my room's dim lit, I pray to God help with, uh
My endeavors and any kind of weather
Hoes be pleather fake so I erase 'em out my sim
Now do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide tryna read my mind
Do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide tryna read my mind

Down and out, hey
Down and out, out

Down and out, so I'm out and down
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in, hey (la-la-la-la-la)
Down and out, so I'm out and down (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in (la-la-la-la-la)
Down and out, so I'm out and down (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in, hey (la-la-la-la-la)
Down and out, so I'm out and down (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Then lookin' for a substance to drown in (la-la-la-la-la, whoa, whoa)

Down and out
Down and out (la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Down and out (la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Down and out
yeah, yeah
Okay, okay
this how we gon' do it
Plain Plat presents
"A Kid Named Cudi"
Hello
All the time, nigga
All the grind, nigga
