		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Ayy, I don't really go outside, but when I do, dawg, they better pray (let's go)
I been with my kin, locked in, thinkin' 'bout better days (let's go)
One too many coupes, dawg, which one I'ma drive today?
Ain't too much changed, dawg, you know I'ma get high today
Still pullin' up on dirt roads, still filled up with chemicals (okay)
Laughing at them hurt hoes, I'm twisting medicinal (okay)
I'ma pop my shit, boy, I could never let up (let's go, let's go)
Drugs, they keep me down, but that money keep my head up (ayy, turn me up)
First things first, yeah, I'ma get it 'til the motherfuckin' bag right
Percs on top of percs, on top of percs, must be the half-life (I'm perc'd up)
They really ain't on shit, back and forth like a half pipe (back and forth, back forth)
Fuck it, I'll pour some more, dawg already sipped a half pint

They lookin' for my blessing, ayy, I'm lookin' for they section, ayy
Pullin' up with some hoes I hit thinkin' that they flexin', ayy
Money on me, no stressin', ayy, twenty mil' in checking, ayy
I take a look at my wrist any time I need reflecting, ayy
Got me thinkin' 'bout Heaven, if I die, will I even go?
Will I see my fam and my homies, dawg, I need to know (yeah)
I'm tryna move it slow, hit a exit on the scenic road (skrrt)
Youngin' in the ground, where the men in my family seem to go
Too many thoughts 'bout dyin', why I'm always sippin' on the jug
Shit really ain't 'bout tryin', dawg, it's hard to put down all the drugs
Thought this shit would be different, thought this shit would fix my fam for once
OG handed me the blunt said, "Youngin' look, it never was"

Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Ayy, I don't really go outside, but when I do, dawg, they better pray (let's go)
I been with my kin, locked in, thinkin' 'bout better days (yeah, yeah)
One too many coupes, dawg, which one I'ma drive today? (Swerve)
Ain't too much changed, dawg, you know I'ma get high today
Still pullin' up on dirt roads, still filled up with chemicals (okay)
Laughing at them hurt hoes, I'm twisting medicinal
I'ma pop my shit, boy, I could never let up
Drugs, they keep me down, but that money keep my head up (let's get it, get it)
First things first, yeah, I'ma get it 'til the motherfuckin' bag right
Percs on top of percs, on top of percs, must be the half-life (that perkie)
They really ain't on shit, back and forth like a half pipe (back and forth, back forth)
Fuck it, I'll pour some more, dawg already sipped a half pint
