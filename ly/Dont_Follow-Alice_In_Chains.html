		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I ain't never coming home 
Hey, I'll just wander my own road 
Hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow 
No, say goodbye don't follow 
Misery so hollow 

Hey you, you're livin' life full throttle 
Hey you, pass me down that bottle, yeah 
Hey you, you can't shake me round now 
I get so lost and don't know how
And it hurts to care, so I won't now

Forgot my woman, lost my friends 
Things I'd done and where I've been 
Sleep in sweat, the mirrors cold 
See my face, it's growin' old 
Scared to death, no reason why 
Do whatever to get me by 
Think about the things I've said 
Read the page, it's cold and dead 

Take me home 
Yeah, take me home 
Take me home 
Take me home, yeah 
Take me home 

Say goodbye, don't follow
