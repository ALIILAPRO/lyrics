		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should you stay, should you go 
You're beginning to see 
I go hot, I go cold 
It's just the devil in me 
You've got to understand I am in love with a beautiful man 
So if you're feeling insecure you've really no cause to be 

I want you near me, don't you run away 
I just got used to having you around 
I want you near me, come on here and stay 
Don't let me down 

You're so good with your hands 
To help me with a hook or a zip 
Indispensable that's what you are 
For the occasional kiss 
I'm only playing games with you, I can't be nice without being cruel 
I know it's not fair, but I make the rules 

I want you near me, don't you run away 
I just got used to having you around 
I want you near me, come on here and stay 
Don't let me down 

All I want, I've decided 
Is your attention undivided 

I want you near, don't turn away 
I want you near me, won't you stay
