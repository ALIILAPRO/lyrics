		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's useless
I tried but to no avail
To tell you how much I know
How much I care
Come home

Breathe until your lungs fail
You can sing till you go deaf
Everyday that you don't call her
I can feel it
You're coming down

I am sick
I am horrified at everything I hear
The youngest daughter lost her way
Everyday repeats itself again
The cycle of our misery
It drives us all insane
Please come home

The poison takes away from us
Now you're sick to death from all the drugs

Breathe until your lungs fail
You can sing till you go deaf
Everyday that you don't call her
I can feel it
You're coming down
