		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  YSL got it for cheap
Now all these niggas think I hit a stain like bleach
7 AM on the beach
Studying flows, the ocean got hella to teach
I put a 6 on my beak
Old lady fingers get numb from pinching my cheeks
I haven't slept in a week
I just been covered in blues, I feel like Mystique
I gave my jeweler Margiela, he gave me a skeleton
I had to bust down the bones
Got dirty looks at the movies, the money was calling
I forgot to silence my phone
Got an invite to a show out in Paris
A nigga just downloaded Rosetta Stone
All I wrote down on my rider croissants
If they can't provide em I'll leave it alone
Meeting with Sony, I post on the 'Gram
And now whole lotta rappers are digging my grammar
Charging em $200 a stanza
They pay out of pocket like Vick in Atlanta
Money been jumping it's too much to handle
I call my accountant we working in tandem
Used to get Metcalf for summer
Last week I made double that, school cannot hold a candle
I'm up in Momotaro with lil shorty
I keep the Virgil on me like a 40
Couple of Cubans on me, they imported
They got my neck froze, rigor mortis
I hit the breaststroke in the Benz
Swimming through South Beach with the fins
I just been going crazy with the pen
Cuz I don't get shit off of spins
YSL got it for cheap
Now all these niggas think I hit a stain like bleach
7 AM on the beach
Studying flows, the ocean got hella to teach
I put a 6 on my beak
Old lady fingers get numb from pinching my cheeks
I haven't slept in a week
I just been covered in blues, I feel like Mystique
Shorty she down for whatever
I keep my flow under the weather
I'm coal when they come with the pressure
Put diamonds all over the bezel
I can't even count em, too many to measure
Steering wheel light as a feather
It's matching the shade of interior leather
Feeling more patient than ever, taking my time
Enjoying the ride, I'll get there whenever
I'm in the booth when niggas are sleeping
Nike Tech hoodie I'm reaping
Hellcat usually sound like a demon
Gave it the Forgis, now that bih creeping
I got 10 toes on the cement
I got 10 fingers on throat, the game in a choke
They hotbox the lab, they burning an oak
They took me to space, I don't even smoke
I hop in the Uber, I smell like a roach
Praying this shit will come out of my clothes
Normally I wouldn't really be tweaking
But I spent a rack and a half on the coat
The berry is bur, I rarely defer
Call Harry for fur, no pun intended
I pick up a pendant, the VVs are looking like ice in a blender
The quality splendid
YSL got it for cheap
Now all these niggas think I hit a stain like bleach
7 AM on the beach
Studying flows, the ocean got hella to teach
I put a 6 on my beak
Old lady fingers get numb from pinching my cheeks
I haven't slept in a week
I just been covered in blues, I feel like Mystique
