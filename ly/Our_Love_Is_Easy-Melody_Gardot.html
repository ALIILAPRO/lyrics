		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep within your heart, you know it's plain to see
Like Adam was to Eve, you were made for me
They say the poisoned vine breeds a finer wine
Our love is easy

If you ask me plainly I would gladLy say
I'd like to have you round just for them rainy days
I like the touch of your hand, the way you make no demands
Our love is easy

Oh our love is easy
Like water rushing over stone
Oh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known

Physically speaking we were made to last
Examine all the pieces of our recent past
There's your mouth of tears
Your hands around my waist
Our love is easy

Every time we meet it's like the first we kiss
Never growing tired of this endlessness
It's a simple thing, we don't need a ring
Our love is easy

Our love is easy
Like water rushing over stone
Oh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known, oh oh oh

Our love is easy
Like water rushing over stone
Oh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known

Deep within your heart, you know it's plain to see
Like Adam was to Eve, you were made for me
They say the poisoned vine breeds a finer wine
