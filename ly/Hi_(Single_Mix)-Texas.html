		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  High, high, high
We got high, high, high
We got high, high, high
We got high (high, high, high, high)

Yeah, yo, yo
Ayo the vision that I can reveal is so real
Sail through, the boat is four mil'
Still real as Enzo Ferrari
On a rich two hundred band Bulgari
Pool party Spanish calamari
Sippin' Cardi B backwards, that's Bacardi
Spinning through Spanish ocean
Pussy soaking slid through grease even met the Pope and
Hoping no commotion, no provoking
Both of our hearts get left unbroken
True love embraced with a new hug
Ghostface, baby face, lace with a new dove
We stick together like new cubs
Look fly together like blue doves
We stay buggin' out like a few bugs
Where my shit at?

I'm gonna take my time on this road
I've gotta find a place we call home
I've gotta change your mind, yeah, before we get old

High, high, high
We got high, high, high
We got high, high, high
We got high (high, high, high, high)

Yo listen, yo look, loo-loo-look
Yesterday I sent you an emoji
With two hearts, a kiss and a roadie
How could I resist the bliss of your lips
Or miss the chance to bless your hands and your wrists
With black and blue diamonds
We was climbing to the top of the world, girl
We was finding out about each other
The street lovers sometimes lose their way when they lay in deep cover
Cuddle in a huddle, we would snuggle in a bubble
With a duffel bag of cash, no worries and no struggles
Ruffle up my feathers 'til my cards got shuffled
Then my heart got befuddled
And the only rebuttal was "Can we try again", you and I again
Cayman islands under the sky again
You in a white dress looking your very best

I'm gonna take my time on this road
I've gotta find a place we call home
I've gotta change your mind, yeah, before we get old
I'm gonna take my time on this road
I've gotta find a place we call home
I've gotta change your mind, yeah, before we get old

High, high, high
We got high, high, high
We got high, high, high (up, up in the sky)
We got high (high, high, high, high)
We got high, high, high (yeah, we got high)
We got high, high, high (up, up in the sky)
We got high, high, high
We got high
