		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lovin' him is like drivin' a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Lovin' him is like tryna change your mind, once you're already flyin' through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all

Losin' him was blue like I'd never known
Missin' him was dark gray, all alone
Forgettin' him was like tryna know somebody you never met
But lovin' him was red

(Red, red)
(Red, red)
But lovin' him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Touchin' him was like realizin' all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizin' him was as easy as knowin' all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like tryna solve a crossword and realizin' there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishin' you never found out that love could be that strong

Losin' him was blue like I'd never known
Missin' him was dark gray, all alone
Forgettin' him was like tryna know somebody you never met
But lovin' him was red

(Red, red) oh, red
(Red, red)
Burnin' red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But movin' on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burnin' red
Lovin' him was red

Oh, losin' him was blue like I'd never known
Missin' him was dark gray, all alone
Forgettin' him was like tryna know somebody you never met
'Cause lovin' him was red

(Red, red) yeah, yeah, red
(Red, red)
Oh, burnin' red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burnin' red
(Red, red) yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

His love was like drivin' a new Maserati down a dead-end street
