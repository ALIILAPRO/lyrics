		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To keep it real I'm not that friendly
I'm just charismatic
I used to think I needed him
But I was just distracted
Now every time I look in the mirror
I feel ecstatic
Tell the cameraman there's no good side
They're both attractive

How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty
Ooo Ahhh
How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty
Ooo Ahhh

I'm a bad bitch with no makeup
Feel like wow right when I wake up
This Margiela not Marc Jacobs
It ain't cheap
I'm a bad bitch when I wake up
Been that bitch just shy don't say much
You'd have trouble finding someone good as me

Ooo
Been waiting to bloom
Got too much too soon
And didn't get far
Ooo
Now all that I need
To trust my instincts
Is be who I want

To keep it real I'm not that friendly
I'm just charismatic
I used to think I needed him
But I was just distracted
Now every time I look in the mirror
I feel ecstatic
Tell the cameraman there's no good side
They're both attractive

How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty
Ooo Ahhh
How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty
Ooo Ahhh

I I I
I could use a little TLC
Left home and I landed in the belly of the beast
Everywhere I go somebody wants something from me
If you like wait until you see what I got underneath

Ooo
Been waiting to bloom
Got too much too soon
And didn't get far
Ooo
Now all that I need
To trust my instincts
Is be who I want

To keep it real I'm not that friendly
I'm just charismatic
I used to think I needed him
But I was just distracted
Now every time I look in the mirror
I feel ecstatic
Tell the cameraman there's no good side
They're both attractive

How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty
Ooo Ahhh
How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty
Ooo Ahhh

To keep it real I'm not that friendly
I'm just charismatic
I used to think I needed him
But I was just distracted
Now every time I look in the mirror
I feel ecstatic
Tell the cameraman there's no good side
They're both attractive

How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty like that
How'd you get so pretty like that
