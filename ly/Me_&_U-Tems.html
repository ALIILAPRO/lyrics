		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You
You
Yeah
This is my decision, decision
This is my decision
I don't think you listen, you listen
I don't think you listen

For me to come out
It must mean I'm at the door
It must mean I'm not the same
It must mean I'm on your case

For me to come out
It means that I'm at the door
I want to show you my world

Give me one break, I need faith
Faith to believe you
Faith to receive you

Give me something I'm lacking
I don't need nothing
You are my everything

Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me, only you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me, only you

Make me your matter
Make me your matter
Make me your matter

Show me your substance
Make me your person
Make me your person

Give me one break, I need faith
Faith to believe you
Faith to receive you

Give me something I'm lacking
I don't need nothing
You are my everything

Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me, only you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you

All I want, only me and you
All I want, only me and you
All I want, only me and you
All I want, only me and you

Only me and you
Me and you, only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and, me and you, and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and, me and you, and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and, me and you, and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
Only me and you
