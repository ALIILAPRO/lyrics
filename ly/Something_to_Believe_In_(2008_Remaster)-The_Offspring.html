		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe that reality's gone
Disillusion's real
I believe that morality's gone
And there's nothing to feel

If you take the sacred things
Things that we hold dear
Empty promise is all you'll find
So give me something

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in

I believe in a changing of the guard
Put our feet on the ground
See it happen in your own backyard
Everything breaks down
Do you accept what you are told
Without even thinking?
Throw it all and make your own
And give me something

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in

Where they lead, you will follow
Well, I guess that's just the way it goes
And if you look away
You'll be doing what they say
And if you look alive
You'll be singled out and tried

If you take home anything
Let it be your will to think
The more cynical you become
The better off you'll be

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
