		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you to hold me
Don't let me go
Be the one and only
Take all control

Stay with me forever
At least for the night
Even when you leave me
Lead me to the light

You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keeping me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away
You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keeping me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away

Take me away

Promise you won't wake me
Before you leave
Leave me in a daydream
Just you and me

Stay with me forever
At least for the night (the night)
Even when you leave me
Lead me to the light

You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keeping me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away
You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keeping me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away

Take me away
