		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One buck shot
And they might not make it
Drag em on the floor
While their body's shaking
Fear unlocked
While their voice is breaking
Swear to God
When I want something take it
One buck shot
And they might not make it
Drag em on the floor
While their body's shaking
Fear unlocked
While their voice is breaking
Swear to God
When I want something take it

There's a violence living inside me
Purify me
Tell me how
To my eyes
Not this time
Heal my vibe
Got my psyche whispering lightly
Suicide Dreams
Trickling through my mind
All the lies
Kill my vibe

It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle

One buck shot
And they might not make it
Drag em on the floor
While their body's shaking
Fear unlocked
While their voice is breaking
Swear to God
When I want something take it

Bring me guidance
In my ignorance
Awake
Awake
My fates
Crying

There's a violence living inside me
Purify me
Tell me how
To my eyes
Not this time
Heal my vibe
Got my psyche whispering lightly
Suicide Dreams
Trickling through my mind
All the lies
Kill my vibe

It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle
It's a battle

One buck shot
And they might not make it
Drag em on the floor
While their body's shaking
Fear unlocked
While their voice is breaking
Swear to God
When I want something take it
One buck shot
And they might not make it
Drag em on the floor
While their body's shaking
Fear unlocked
While their voice is breaking
Swear to God
When I want something take it
