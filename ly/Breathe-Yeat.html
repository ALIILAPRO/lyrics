		  Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe

I was bored, bought a jet, made a billion (breathe)
Nah, fuck that bitch, I need a trillion (breathe)
Nah, fuck that bitch, I need to feel it (breathe)
Make me so damn mad, make me feel it (breathe)
I won't ever give you time to (breathe)
I won't ever give a fuck if you (breathe)
I don't really give a fuck 'bout you (breathe)
You need to chill, you need to breathe (breathe)
I'ma ask you to leave (breathe)
Yeah, my money so deep (breathe)
And as far as I could tell, they wanna sound like me (breathe)
They wanna be like me 

I'ma cut it open, I'm doing surgery
And that limelight make 'em go insane
Yeah, I make 'em go insane
Why the fuck would you come? (Yeah)
When you level up, you makin' money, billion
And you make your money taller than the ceiling
I told you, I lost all feeling
Hold your breath 'til you pass out
I hope to God you crash out
I recommend you cash out (yeah)
Heard you went up, now you going down (yeah)
Know you know I don't stress
I could not care less
But she know I'm the best
Got 'em turning they heads

I know I'm a asshole
I know when I dip and go
I know when I lose control
Got the system on overload (yeah)
I don't fuck with you, squish you like a bug
They ain't fuck with me, so it's fake love
I won't shake your hand, bitch, you need a glove
Wash the blood of my hands, I need Dove
I said fuck love, bitch, I need a tug
I make a fuck ton of money, you make none
I hit home-runs, bitch, you 'bout to bunt
I don't breathe 'cause it's fun (breathe)

I was bored, bought a jet, made a billion (breathe)
Nah, fuck that bitch, I need a trillion (breathe)
Nah, fuck that bitch, I need to feel it (breathe)
Make me so damn mad, make me feel it (breathe)
I won't ever give you time to (breathe)
I won't ever give a fuck if you (breathe)
I don't really give a fuck 'bout you (breathe)
You need to chill, you need to breathe (breathe)
I'ma ask you to leave (breathe)
Yeah, my money so deep (breathe)
And as far as I could tell, they wanna sound like me
They wanna be like me 

I'ma cut it open, I'm doing surgery
And that limelight make 'em go insane
Yeah, I make 'em go insane
Why the fuck would you come? (Yeah)
When you level up, you makin' money, billion
And you make your money taller than the ceiling
I told you, I lost all feeling
Hold your breath 'til you pass out
I hope to God you crash out
I recommend you cash out (yeah)
Heard you went up, now you going down (yeah)
Know you know I don't stress
I could not care less
But she know I'm the best
