		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm feeling like a stranger
'Cause I'm stuck here
Living like my parents is my worst fear
They had some kids and got lost in the suburbs
Working jobs they hated made them suffer

And I'd rather die
Than live my father's life
And pretend like I'm satisfied

So line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
Line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
I'm diving off the edge

Crashing in these secondhand motel rooms
Driving cross the country 'cause I want to
I can't slow down
Because I'm scared to stand still
I can't go home
Because it feels like hell

And I'd rather die
Than live my father's life
And pretend like I'm satisfied

So line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
Line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
I'm diving off the edge

Why should I come back to earth
When all that's there is tears and hurt?
There's absolutely nothing there for me, for me

Diving off the edge feels good
I'm finally not misunderstood
I know that there is no way I can stay
I'd rather die than ever live my life that way
I'd rather die than ever live my life that way

Line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end
Line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
'Cause I don't need no sleeping
When I'm diving off the deep end

I'm diving off the edge
I'm diving off the edge
I'm diving off the edge
