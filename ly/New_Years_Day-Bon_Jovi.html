		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The midnight bells are ringing
A ship is setting sail
A newborn baby's crying
As lovers say farewell

I'm singing hallelujah
Amen, the angels say
Let's hope tomorrow finds us
It's New Year's Day

Let's toast to new beginnings okay
Raise up a glass and say
For all of our tomorrows
And what was yesterday come on

I'm singing carpe diem
I'm saying seize the day
Come on, let's live forever
It's New Year's Day

Where does the time go
Just watch the wind blow
Sha la la la
It's New Year's Day
Green does the grass grow
Outside my window
Sha la la la
It's New Year's Day

This message in a bottle
The wisdom of the wine
It's just a rainy Monday
This isn't Auld Lang Syne

I'm singing hallelujah
Amen, the angels say
Let's hope tomorrow finds us
It's New Year's Day
