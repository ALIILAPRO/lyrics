		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Uh, uh, uh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, oh

Took my time to get this shine, but I still skipped the line (on God)
I realized the ho still on my mind, I guess the bitch divine (hello)
And yeah, I could do this shit myself, that's dead or alive (alive)
And yeah, you could care 'bout just yourself, if you pickin' sides (pickin' sides)
Niggas thinkin' that they gang, they not even squad (squad, squad)
Yeah, I told 'em, "If you gettin' played, then you played a part"
Really I know I can't change my ways, you know who we are (who we are)
Talkin' crazy, now he in the sky, told him, "Pick a star" (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

I made this shit look easy, juice
But it ain't easy, believe me, truth
You know I'm droppin' 'em off, Bruce
Give you a clue what I'm countin', blues
Smokin' that leaf if it get loose
My niggas drillin', we might as well truce (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I hit the blunt just for a lil' boost
Yeah, my new bitch, she Canadian Goose (oh, oh)
I know you lose 'em, how you get 'em, I won't take your bitch (bitch)
Yeah, I told 'em I make money, money don't make this shit (yeah)
Change my life off being me, so why would I fake this shit? (Yeah)
They try to take my flow, don't fuck with no plagiarists (at all)

We could solve it, if that shit a problem (nah, for real)
Nigga, I was gettin' guala, I said fuck a prom, uh (for real)
I was rockin' BAPEs, when I seen y'all niggas rockin' Toms (for real)
When you feel like this, no, you wouldn't even change your flaws

Took my time to get this shine, but I still skipped the line (on God)
I realized the ho still on my mind, I guess the bitch divine (hello)
And yeah, I could do this shit myself, that's dead or alive (alive)
And yeah, you could care 'bout just yourself, if you pickin' sides (pickin' sides)
Niggas thinkin' that they gang, they not even squad (squad, squad)
Yeah, I told 'em, "If you gettin' played, then you played a part"
Really I know I can't change my ways, you know who we are (who we are)
Talkin' crazy, now he in the sky, told him, "Pick a star" (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
