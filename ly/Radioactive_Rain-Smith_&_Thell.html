		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands in the air towards the heavens
And our eyes were ever blue
Oh, we promised us forever
But forever came too soon

You stuck your tongue out catching snowflakes
And didn't notice it was dust
There is poison in the ashes
But we never thought that it was us

And now I jump without a parachute again
(In the radioactive rain)
Typical me to never think 'bout where I land
I land I land I land I land…

And we danced, danced, danced
In the radioactive rain
Before we ever knew 'bout pain
There was something about this fame that made you
Change, change, change

But we blame it all on the game
Wanna have a last dance with me
In the radioactive
Radioactive rain

There's a moment before dying ¨
When you're weightless in the air
We saw the smoke on the horizon
Without a thought of being scared

And now I jump without a parachute again
(In the radioactive rain)
And let's pretend that we don't know where this will end
Will end will end will end

While we dance, dance, dance
In the radioactive rain
Before we ever knew 'bout pain
There was something about this fame that made you
Change, change, change

But we blame it all on the game
Wanna have a last dance with me
In the radioactive
Radioactive rain

Dance, dance, dance,
And we danced, danced, danced
And we danced, danced, danced
In the radioactive
Radioactive rain

And we danced, danced, danced
And we danced, danced, danced
And we danced, danced, danced
In the radioactive
Radioactive rain

While we dance, dance, dance
In the radioactive rain
Before we ever knew 'bout pain
There was something about this fame that made you
Change, change, change

But we blame it all on the game
Wanna have a last dance with me
In the radioactive
Radioactive rain
