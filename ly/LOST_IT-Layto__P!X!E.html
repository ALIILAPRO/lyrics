		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cold hard facts so tough to say,
keeps my mind in disarray, 
hit me back with extra topspin,
piss me off, oh I can lock in,
na, you don't give a fuck what they say about me,
yeah, drive me mad so fast, so cheat, yeah,
rip me up,
and break me down,
then stand me up,
and knock me out

looking at the stars in the sky,
oh, what a damn mess I made,
haven't shown my heart since yesterday,
I been weighing out all my options,
can't read my mind cuz I-
lost it,
baby I,
lost it, 
baby I

come and hit me with a whimper
not a bang,
gas me up and go away
i've been weighing out all my options,
can't find no words to say,
yeah, I don't give a fuck if the whole world see,
yeah, lose my mind on live TV, yeah,
build me up,
can't help me now,
i'm on my back,
i'm going down

looking at the stars in the sky,
oh, what a damn mess I made,
haven't shown my heart since yesterday,
i been weighing out all my options,
can't read my mind cuz I-
lost it,
baby I,
lost it, 
baby I

lost it, lost it,
i know you fell off when we
paused it, paused it,
all because you just can't be alone,
the type of boy who's going through my phone,
and now i'm just being honest,
you were so damn obnoxious,
I thought you need to know,
Then we tried it,
but you brought me down,
now i'm flying

looking at the stars in the sky,
oh, what a damn mess I made,
haven't shown my heart since yesterday,
i been weighing out all my options,
can't read my mind cuz I-
lost it,
baby I,
lost it, 
baby I
