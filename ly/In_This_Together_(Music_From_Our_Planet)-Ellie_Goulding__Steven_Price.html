		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it really over?
The echoes just seem to get longer
How did we get here?
There was so much love in us
And all I have left is my faith
That I can change

I can't watch this burn
I can't watch this burn to the ground
You'd have thought we'd learned
You'd have thought we'd learned by now

I can hear the whole world singing together
I can hear the whole world sing, "It's now or never"
'Cause it's not too late if we change our ways
And connect the dots to our problems
I can hear the whole world sing, "We're in this together"
"We're in this together"

Pickin' up the pieces
I listen out for beating hearts
And now it's time for healing
The sun will rise, but this time it's so bright
And all I have left is my faith that we could change

'Cause I can't watch us lose
Like I watch us lose what we found
You'd have thought we'd learned
You'd have thought we'd learned by now

I can hear the whole world singing together
I can hear the whole world sing, "It's now or never"
'Cause it's not too late if we change our ways
And connect the dots to our problems
I can hear the whole world sing, "We're in this together"
"We're in this together"

Oh, oh

Oh, I can hear the whole world singing together
And I can hear the whole world sing, "It's now or never"
'Cause it's not too late if we change our ways
And connect the dots to our problems
I can hear the whole world sing, "We're in this together"
"We're in this together"

Ah-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
