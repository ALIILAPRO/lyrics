		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Pray out loud as I pray out loud sittin'
Yeah, yeah
Days are long and my nights are spent wishin'
Hmm, hmm
So it seems I'm complete, doubt that
Hmm, hmm
Silent suffering, baby
Yeah, yeah
Thoughts spin 'round
Yeah, these thoughts spin round my head
Yeah, yeah
Thinkin' 'bout all the special things you said
When I sleep you're what I see, can't shake it
Silent suffering, baby

And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon be fine
Maybe so, maybe not
And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon be fine
Maybe so, maybe not

Sunday afternoon
And I'm dreamin' of you
Please don't go throw your love away
I'm missin' you

And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon be fine
Maybe so, maybe not
And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon be fine
Maybe so, maybe not
