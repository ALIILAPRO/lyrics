		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'd rather be kissing in Summer, somewhere in the sand
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want

I smell like a rose, can I have you in doses?
No, I don't wanna fight, but I will if you like
I don't swim, I just dive right into those blue-green eyes
No, I don't wanna fight, I just, I just wanna be

Kissing in Summer, somewhere in the sand
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want

And da da da da da da
The sun in our eyes, this love is blind
Let's not decide whether we're too far gone
'Cause I'd rather be

Kissing in Summer, somewhere in the sand
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want (That's what I want)

Oh oh, oh, oh da-da-dumn
That's what I
Dum da-da-dum, oh
That's what I
