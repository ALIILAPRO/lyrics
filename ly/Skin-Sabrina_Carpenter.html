		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe we could've been friends
If I met you in another life
Maybe then we could pretend
There's no gravity in the words we write
Maybe you didn't mean it
Maybe blonde was the only rhyme
The only rhyme

Want my heart to be breaking, breaking, no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been telling your side
So I'll be telling mine, oh

You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin
If I don't let you in

You're telling it how you see it
Like truth is whatever you decide
Some people will believe it
And some will read in between the lines
You're putting me in the spotlight
But I've been under it all my life, said, all my life

Want my heart to be breaking, breaking, no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been telling your side
So I'll be telling mine (mine)

You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin
If I don't let you in-oh

You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin
If I don't let you in-oh

I just hope that one day
We both can laugh about it
When it's not in our face
Won't have to dance around it
Don't drive yourself insane
It won't always be this way

You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin
If I don't let you in
