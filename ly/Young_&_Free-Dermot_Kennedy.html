		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do we go from here? Something came in with the night
Snow came in heavy, my boys and me wandering blind (yeah)
Well, it's temporary darling
Now that bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan heard all our lines
Meant what I said, I want all of this all of the time

Ooh when I'm gone
At the dune with the dawn
Well that's all I could want

We were young
We were free, come on now, let it go
We were young
We were free
I was living in the cold, I'm coming home
Perfect line to open with
Her heart was never meant for this
Ooh we're never over it
We were young
We were free (yeah yeah)

All that she said to me stays with me, never to die
Held me brand new in the silence that went through the pines
Like I said already darling, I don't want you looking back at all the ghosts left behind
Know you'll stay near me so road remains hopeful this time

We were young
We were free, come on now, let it go
We were young
We were free
I was living in the cold, I'm coming home
Perfect line to open with
Her heart was never meant for this
Ooh we're never over it
We were young
We were free (yeah yeah)

Keep it another fortnight, keep it another fortnight
All I'll ever know, baby we were bound to burn
Keep it another fortnight, keep it another fortnight
All I'll ever know, baby we were bound to burn
Baby we were bound to burn

We were young
We were free, come on now, let it go
We were young
We were free
I was living in the cold, I'm coming home
Perfect line to open with
Her heart was never meant for this
Ooh we're never over it
We were young
We were free (yeah yeah)

Oh, when I'm gone
At the dune with the dawn
Well that's all I could want
