		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not sure where i'll live next year
Drank last night now i've got the fear
The sinking feeling
Tired of breathing
Fell asleep and missed my stop
20 more minutes to walk to my block
And now i feel it
The sinking feeling
I always thought i'd have it sorted by now
You make me feel like i'm back down south
Holding my breath in my own house
Sometimes i wish i had it in me to shout
I'm only nineteen, already burned out
Life loves to knock the lively ones down
(sinking feeling, sinking feeling)
(feeling, feeling)
Sinking feeling
Sinking feeling
I've been an adult for two years
I'm not sure how to make it clear
That i'm not me yet
I'm still teething
I always thought i'd have it sorted by now
You make me feel like i'm back down south
Holding my breath in my own house
Sometimes i wish i had it in me to shout
I'm only nineteen, already burned out
Life loves to knock the lively ones down
You make me feel like i'm sinking
You make me feel like i'm sinking
(sinking feeling)
(sinking feeling)
(sinking feeling)
(sinking feeling)
