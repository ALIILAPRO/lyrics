		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see, then maybe somehow, we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, "Later"
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
Uh-huh
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to (woo)

Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the B-boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man 'cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, three and fours in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't hard to

Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
Get on it
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't
Don't stop
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to (hoo-hoo)
Jam
It ain't (hoo-hoo)
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't
Don't you (hoo-hoo)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam (hoo)

It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam 
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam 
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam (get down, hoo)

Ooh

Get on it

Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
Uh-huh
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't too much 
It ain't too much for me to
Jam (get on it)
Uh-huh (get on it)
It ain't too much stuff (hee-hee)
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to 
Jam
Too much
It ain't too much stuff (jam)
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Get on it
Get on it
Give it, baby
Give it to me
Won't you really give it to me
Got to give it
You just want to give it
