		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh

It feels so good it should cost
Bought her alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ugh, huh"
Like a mix of Master P and Rick Ross (uh, uh)
She seem to make me always feel like a boss (uh, uh)
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost (uh, uh)
She said I'm going too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song, oh something wrong
Might need a intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent

Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh

Gettin' loose while I'm on the deuce, see me roll out
Watch you surf, hit the coast, and this feelin', I got
Plenty adventures for the evening, we go journey, we off
From the light to guide us home, we in the moment oh oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losin' everything that I had
She been on me, boy, unless you got somethin' to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord won't hurt me, we all live in sin
Kids see ghosts off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
Now put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama we let it go
Watch the guitars roll, now let your friends know

Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh

Just do that and then let me the music do something, then do that again
That'd be enough for a record
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes if you can get it
You know, three minutes max
