		  (Nat08 be kickin' shit)
Uh-huh

I took a trip to the hood so I could make it out (make it out)
Just so y'all can't say I got shit handed down (handed down)
I did it dolie, no one put shit in my bank account (ayy, hold on, hold on)
If you don't know me then shut your mouth (shut your mouth)

What goes around comes around like an echo sound (sound)
Ha, karma's a bitch, I guess you know it now (ha, ha)
Said I could never snitch and made three hundred thou' (thou')
And I got goons by my side, so come around (ha, where they at?)
And, bitch, I'm tough by myself
Yo, you over there, come around, let's go (where they at?)
Y'all some internet goons, get up off your couch (get off your coach)
Bitches be crazy, want have my baby, gotta wait it out
I'm seventeen but all these ladies wanna hit it
Bitch, I woke up this morning on some different shit
The only ho I need is a whole lotta green
In the money brick, I'm a star
Like the roof of a Cullinan (Cullinan)
Put some bread on your head, you'll start crumbling (crumbling)
I heard the opps favorite dance is the running man (ha, running man)
They call me a, uh, cop, I start chuckling
'Cause when I skirt up from behind all the gangsters buckle in
Grrah

I took a trip to the hood so I could make it out (make it out)
Just so y'all can't say I got shit handed down (handed down)
I did it dolie, no one put shit in my bank account (ayy, hold on, hold on)
If you don't know me then shut your mouth (shut your mouth)

I took a trip to the hood so I could make it out (make it out)
Just so y'all can't say I got shit handed down (handed down)
I did it dolie, no one put shit in my bank account (ayy, hold on, hold on)
If you don't know me then shut your mouth (shut your mouth)

What goes around comes around like an echo sound (baow, baow, baow)
Ha, karma's a bitch, I guess you know it now
Said I could never snitch and made three hundred thou'
And I got goons by my side, so come around (ha)
