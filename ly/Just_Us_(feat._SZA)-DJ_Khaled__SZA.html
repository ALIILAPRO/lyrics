		  We The Best Music
Another one
DJ Khaled

Back against the wall, middle fingers in the air
Busting through the crowd, they gon' feel me now
Straight shooter from the hip, yeah, we heavy in here
Tell me get 'em, then I got 'em (get 'em)
99 problems, but you ain't one
Been so high lately, I don't care who's goin' down
You could see it in my eyes, he be hitting it right
Got me wishing that he wasn't, oh no
And I need it all night
Real love, show me what it feels like?
Fuck it, I let you pull up on me broad day light
Shots over here, fuck the other side
We don't gotta lay low, we grown
A field trip and I don't need no chaperone
I'm tryna get ghost
Oh, oh (another one)

It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

It's lovely at the top, private destination
Sippin' on the rocks, only way with us
This kinda love dangerous when there's nothing else to lose
So don't make me wild out (let's ride)
Got 99 problems, what's one more?
50 feet get you touched at your front door
Leaving fast and we spinning slow
Side eyes let me know that we visible
And I need it right now (yeah)
Ten toes down, show me what it's all about
Thuggin', we only duckin' when the boys come out
It's us over them, fuck the other side
We gon' turn the lights off, we hard
What we doin', don't nobody gotta know
I ain't tryna get ghost, oh yes
Oh, oh

It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

This how an angel sounds (no, no, do-do)
It's just, uh, it's just us, it's just us
It's just us
It's always us, it's always us
It's only us
It's just us, it's just us, it's just us
It's always, it's always us, it's always us

It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them (yeah, yeah)
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

You're all that I need, ooh, yeah
It's just, uh, it's just us, it's just us
We The Best Music
It's always, it's always us, it's always
It's just us, it's just us, it's just us
Another one
It's always, it's always us, it's always
