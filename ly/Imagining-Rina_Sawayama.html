		  Could we be imagining
Could we be imagining
Could we be

Wide awake
Didn't mean to lose my precious mind today (mind today)
Sick and tired of waking up so far away (so far away)
I don't know if Mercury's in retrograde
Am I okay? Nah

I don't wanna get too close, shit gets complicated (ah)
I don't wanna take it off, emotionally naked (ah)
Really don't feel too good, fake it 'til you make it (ah)
I don't wanna talk right now, got me agitated

I'm imagining
So tell me what the fuck is almost happening?
Right now my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm imagining
So tell me what the fuck is almost happening?
Right now my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I, I, I, I, I, I (oh)

Could we be imagining?
I, I, I, I, I, I

Be-belly aches, lidocaine
Suddenly I find it hard to concentrate, yeah
Struggling to recognize a side of me, ooh
I just wanna short circuit the night away
Am I okay? Nah

I don't wanna get too close, shit gets complicated (ah)
I don't wanna take it off, emotionally naked (ah)
Really don't feel too good, fake it 'til you make it (ah)
I don't wanna talk right now, got me agitated

I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm imagining
So tell me what the fuck is almost happening?
Right now my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm imagining
So tell me what the fuck is almost happening?
Right now my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm imagining
So tell me what the fuck is almost happening?
Right now my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging

Could we be imagining? (Could we be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could we be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could we be imagining?)
Could we be imagining?
Could we be imagining? (Could we be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could we be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could we be imagining?)
Could we be imagining?
(Could we be imagining?)
(Could we be imagining?)
(Could we be imagining?)
(Could we be imagining?)
