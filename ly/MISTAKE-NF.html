		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like I'm at standstill waiting for you to tell me I'm ok
If time heals, tell me why do I kill myself
Tryna show you I'm not a mistake
I've got qualities that I'm not proud of
I've made promises that I walked out on
I've had days I feel I don't deserve love
So think what you think, just don't call me a

Mistake, might of made some
Can't argue with that, but I ain't one
Even though I sometimes get afraid of
Having to face the wrath of an anxious me
I get it 'cause I actually
Feel the same sometimes I think
I might be a lost cause who turns off
'Cause the way I read
Into what I've been through
You'd think I'm mental
But it pays off though when the rent's due
I pursue what I love and if it goes
South and falls down just know
I'll stand on my own two feet
Don't you see
Those that oppose on me
Most won't leave
Thinkin' I might retreat
Show my teeth quick if you turn on me 'cause

I feel like I'm at standstill waiting for you to tell me I'm ok
If time heals, tell me why do I kill myself
Tryna show you I'm not a mistake
I've got qualities that I'm not proud of
I've made promises that I walked out on
I've had days I feel I don't deserve love
So think what you think, just don't call me a
Just don't call me a
Just don't call me a

Mistake 'cause I'm not one
Misplaced but I found a
Lot of resentment
Causes a mess when you let it get to the place of
No confidence
Struggle with it, that's obvious
But not enough to make me second guess
If I'd die for the ones I love
So don't you get confused
Thinking if you
Bring me down I'ma just choose
To let myself get used
I don't live like that
I feel trapped
I might lash out
I gotta watch my back
Cross my path, especially with ill intent
You'll regret you ever took that task
If and when this thing could all go bad
Don't you act like no one warned you yet 'cause

I feel like I'm at standstill waiting for you to tell me I'm ok
If time heals, tell me why do I kill myself
Tryna show you I'm not a mistake
I've got qualities that I'm not proud of
I've made promises that I walked out on
I've had days I feel I don't deserve love
So think what you think, just don't call me a
Mistake
