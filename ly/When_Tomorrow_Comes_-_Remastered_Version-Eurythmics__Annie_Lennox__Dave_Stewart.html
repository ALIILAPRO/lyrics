		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Underneath your dreamlit eyes
Shades of sleep have driven you away.
The moon is pale outside
And you are far from here.

Breathing shifts your careless head
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives.
Another day, another night
Has taken you again my dear.

And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there
When you need someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes

Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea
Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea
Last night while you were
Lying in my arms

And I was wondering where you were
You know you looked just like a baby
Fast asleep in this dangerous world.
Every star was shining brightly
Just like a million years before.

And we were feeling very small
Underneath the universe.

And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need
Someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
