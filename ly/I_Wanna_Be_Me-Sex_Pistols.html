		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn the page and it´s 
The scoop of the century
Don't want to be L seven I had enough of this
This is brainwash and this is a clue

To the stars who fooled you
Tell me why you can´t explain
You´re only looking for vinyl yeah
Didn´t they fool you they want to be you

Gimme world war three we can live again
You didn´t fool me but I fooled you
You want to be me yeah You want to be me
You want to be someone yeah ruin someone
Yeah, Didn´t I fool you I ruined you yeah
Didn´t I fool you I sussed you out

I got you in the camera and
I got you in my camera
A secund of your life ruined for life
You want to ruin me in your magazine
You want to cover us in the margarine
And now is the time to realize
To have real eyes

Down down down down
And I´ll take you down on the underground
Down in the dark and down in the crypt
Down in the dark where the typewriter fit

Down with your pen and pad ready to kill
To make me ill
Down want to be someone you want to be someone
Ruin someone

Make it as someone you want to be me ruin me
A typewriter god a black and white king
PVC blackboard books black and white
I want to be me
