		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh, my heart, it's a fish on the rocks and it bakes in the bad sun
Oh, my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh, my heart, it's a rocking great boulder and stuck in the gutter

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far, it come back floating
And I watch it wash up with the dead fish
But it ain't quite dead, it just is lifeless

Oh, my heart, it's a house in tornado
Oh, my heart, it's a house in the sky in the eye of tornado
Oh, my heart, it's a roof in El Niño
Oh, my heart, it's a roof made of straw in the jaw of El Niño

And I pour my heart a new foundation
But it don't set hard, it just stays shaking
And I scratch my name, I scratch my name in
But it don't set hard, it gets mixed back in

Bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum

Oh, my heart, it's fish out of water
Oh, my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh, my heart, it's a black in a rainbow
Oh, my heart, it's so damn cold
So damn cold

And I throw my heart into the fire
'Cause I want to set my heart on fire
And I watch it try befriending embers
But the ice don't melt in mid December

Oh, my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh, my heart, it's a fish on the rocks and it bakes in the bad sun
