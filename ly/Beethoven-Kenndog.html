		  (Hit makers)

If you- if you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (with the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes
Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots

If you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (and the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes
Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots

I've, I've been runnin' 'round the city on the same thing
Got the city locked, I see why I'm in the chain gang
Reach for my neck, I'ma make it go bang, bang
They don't really want me, they just want me for my ding-a-ling
Style with no stylist, ride with no mileage 
She givin' me brain like she just finished college
I'm just bein' honest, I don't carry wallets
The bands in my hands can't fit in my pockets
Rich bitch take dick, that's my type
Simp with the blue strips, that's what I like
You know I'm a big dawg, but I don't bite
Done helpin' niggas out, I ain't finna ghost write
It's a miracle, niggas tryna be lyrical
Town have the general, eatin' niggas like dinner roast
Niggas makin' it difficult, therefore I give it minimal
All you niggas disposable, diamonds lookin' invisible

If you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (with the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes
Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots

If you see the homies with the guap (with the guap)
With the knots (and the knots), in the Rolls (in the Rolls)
That's how I know you niggas really, really broke (really broke)
With no goals (with no goals), and it shows (and it shows)
The money blue, designer shoes
Jimmy Choo, Louis boots, boots
