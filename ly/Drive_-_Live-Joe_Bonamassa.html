		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, you've been feeling poorly
I've been dealing with stress
Why don't we go out tonight
Put on your favorite dress

And let's drive
Into the night into the light
Let's ride
Put on an old blues song
Let all our troubles be gone
And drive 

Feel like I've been a prisoner
Of my own design
I've been such a bad listener
But I hear you tonight

Let's drive
Into the night, into the light
Let's ride
Put on some old blues songs
Let all our troubles be gone
Let's drive
Let's drive

30 miles from Santa Fe
Bound for San Anton'
Even though it's dark out here
I don't feel alone

Let's drive
Into the night, into the light
Let's ride
Put on an old blues song
Let all our troubles be gone
Let's drive

Put on an old blues song
Let all our troubles be gone
Let's drive
Let's drive
