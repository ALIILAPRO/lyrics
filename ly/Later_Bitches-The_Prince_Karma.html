		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What the hell do you mean I've gotta wait in line?
This is complete and total bullshit!
If- if I show you my tits, will you let me in?
Can you just- just take another drink with me?
Thanks
Later, bitches!

Oh my God!
This is like- this is like, the best song ever!
I just- I just love it so much!
Shit, I don't feel so good
I shouldn't have that last shot
Later, bitches!

Oh my God
I'm so horny right now
I shouldn't have said that out loud, ha
I'm not, like, wearing any underwear
So, you know
Can I have another shot?
Hey, before we get out of here
Can you- can you just do me one favor?
Can you say, "Later, bitches!"
