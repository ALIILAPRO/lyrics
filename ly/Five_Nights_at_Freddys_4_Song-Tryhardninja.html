		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a legend
A legend born long ago
About a wicked
A wicked man no one knows
Went and unraveled
Six innocent little souls

The souls found bodies
The bodies started to move
Some say they still walk
Walk the halls staying from view
I got a secret
That I am here to tell you
That place is this very place
And all the stories are true

This world's a scary place
We're not monsters, just changed
Bigger hands for grabbing a hold
We were lost to foul play
But we got an upgrade
Lots more teeth for eating you whole
Here comes another chapter
Your heart is beating faster
'Cause you're the one we're after

Five nights at Freddy's 4
Thank you for bringing us home

We were just like you
Like you just playing a game
That's when the wicked
Wicked man led us astray
Without a warning
Our lives have been rearranged

As for our story
The story's not over yet
There's still one secret
One secret left to be said
Tonight when you are
Safely tucked into your bed
Close all the doors that you want
We're already in your head

The world's a scary place
We're not monsters just changed
Bigger hands for grabbing a hold
We were lost to foul play
But we got an upgrade
Lots more teeth for eating you whole
Here comes another chapter
Your heart is beating faster
'Cause you're the one we're after

Five nights at Freddy's 4
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home

Here comes another chapter
Your heart is beating faster
'Cause you're the one we're after

Five nights at Freddy's 4
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home
