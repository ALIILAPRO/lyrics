		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (L.A., L.A.)
(L.A., L.A.)

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel
Living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God we don't get along, so now I sing

No one's gonna take my soul away
Living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees, and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel, lookin' to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby that's alright with me"

No one's gonna take my soul away
Living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees, and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost

When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me, "Life isn't that hard"

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees, and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
