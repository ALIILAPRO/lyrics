		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you're lonely, want someone to hold me
You know I could be the one for you
I know you've been lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you
I know that you're lonely, want someone to hold me
You know I could be the one for you
I know you've been lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you

I know that you're lonely, want someone to hold me
You know I could be the one for you
I know you've been lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you
I know that you're lonely, want someone to hold me
You know I could be the one for you
I know you've been lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you

I know that you're lonely, want someone to hold me
You know I could be the one for you
I know you've been lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you

I know I could be the one for you
I know you've lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you
I know that you're been lonely, want someone to hold me
You know I could be the one for you
I know you've been lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you

I know that you're lonely, want someone to hold me
You know I could be the one for you
I know you've been lonely, want someone to hold me
Thinking I could be the one for you
