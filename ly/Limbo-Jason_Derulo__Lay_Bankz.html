		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Head, shoulders, knees, and toes
How low can you go?
Don't leave me in limbo, limbo

Ay, miss thicker than thick
Jump up to make your pants fit
Please help me understand it
Booty so big, yeah, they swallow panties
You need someone to notice
My ego needs some stroking
You say it with emotion
I can't tell your heart is broken

Oh, you look like somebody that I used to love
Ooh, girl, how we just met and I'm kissing on you?

Head, shoulders, knees, and toes (toes)
How low can you go? (Go)
Don't leave me in limbo
I love you
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes (toes)
How low can you go? (Go)
Don't leave me in limbo, limbo

Na-na-nai, na-na-nai
Na-na-nai-nai-nai
Na-na-nai, na-na-nai
Don't leave me in limbo

Uh, it's really simple, he's so into my potential
Ass fat, but that don't mean I'm walking by to tempt you
Tryna play a game, he ain't getting in my head
Came with his girl, he tryna leave with me instead

Boy, please
Like my nigga, I put him on freeze
Like my star, double C on the feet
I'm not really brokenhearted
I'm just always on to the next
How we just met and now he tryna kiss up on my neck?
What? (Damn)

He just want a night with a bad girl, yeah
Pretty in the face, but I'm savage, yeah, uh
Nothing like your last, welcome to my world
Quick to leave a nigga in limbo 'cause I ain't your girl

Oh, you look like somebody that I used to love (I used to love)
Ooh, girl, how we just met and I'm kissing on you?

Head (Head), shoulders, knees, and toes (toes)
How low can you go? (Go)
Don't leave me in limbo
I love you
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes (toes)
How low can you go? (Go, baby)
Don't leave me in limbo, limbo

Na-na-nai, na-na-nai
Na-na-nai-nai-nai
Na-na-nai, na-na-nai
Don't leave me in limbo
