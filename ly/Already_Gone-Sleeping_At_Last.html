		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even without fists held high
It never would've worked out right
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I, I didn't come here to hurt you now
I can't stop

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
But someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss
Then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
But someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

So I'm already gone

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
But someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

I'm already gone

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
