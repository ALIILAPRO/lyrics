		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make way for to me fall
I'm too far from orbit now
The silence is so deafening
No way to save you from
What's hidden from our view
And it's nothing more than stars
That are meant to align
The weight on my heart
Is taking me under now
For sounding the call
Run
Weather the storm
This will be over when
It comes for us all
Make way for to me fall
I'm too close to the end of it all
Just waiting for a light to guide me home
When every star aligns
Nothing lives forever
It's fated for the ocean to be my grave
The moment I crashed
Into silent waters
In my wake
Unearthing every shipwreck
I know
There's no safe harbor here
Under the waves
In a deluge of souls
I saw the beacon
The moment I caught a glimpse
Of my dying reflection in your eyes
The light in me is waning
I became the amber sky
All the lives I had to wager
So I can finally die
The world beneath us tremors
When It calls you from below
With your eyes upon your maker
It beckons you home
