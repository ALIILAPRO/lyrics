		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We couldn’t follow the fields
We couldn’t live of the yields
And so we slowly slipped away

It was a city of jade
From the year it was made
Then it started to decay

But i'm still here
Lost everything, everything

I know that it will fall
These crumbling walls
But it’s all that is left to me
It seems like we’re in withdrawal
But so are they all
And it’s all that is left to me
I write your name into stone
I read it alone
And it’s all that is left to me
Your love songs cover this home
But nobody knows
And it’s all that is left to me

In the temple divine
Can’t tell the writing from vines
But i know just what they’ll say

“Here stood a mightier kind
Tikal and Copan combined
But they started to decay”

But i'm still here
I lost everything, everything

I know that it will fall
These crumbling walls
But it’s all that is left to me
It seems like we’re in withdrawal
But so are they all
And it’s all that is left to me
I write your name into stone
I read it alone
And it’s all that is left to me
Your love songs cover this home
But nobody knows
And it’s all that is left to me
