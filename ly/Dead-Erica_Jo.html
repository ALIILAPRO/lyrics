		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darkness settles on the hallowed
The air bites colder than a knife
Already lost my head, my halo
If my mind gets rid of the things I did
And I can't remember, well then I better
Have fun tonight

Can't remember all the things I thought I would
Can't remember all the things I said
Can't remember all the things I thought I would
Maybe I'll remember when I'm dead
Uhh

I'm feeling tingles through my body
As soon as they turn down the lights
I left my ego in the lobby
I don't give a fuck about looking fuckable
Dried my tears and everyone here
Knows it's demon time

Can't remember all the things I thought I would
(Don't remember but I got my third eye)
Can't remember all the things I said
(I don't plan for it, think I'll handle it
Days are decades but the nights just blur by)
Can't remember all the things I thought I would
Maybe I'll remember when I'm dead
(One, Two, Three, Let's go)

Uhh
