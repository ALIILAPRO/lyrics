		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care if your world is ending today 
I wasn't invited to it anyway 
You said I tasted famous, so I drew you a heart 
But now I'm not an artist I'm a fucking work of art 
I've got an F and a C and I got a K too 
And the only thing missing is a bitch like you

You wanted perfect 
You got your perfect 
But now I'm too perfect for someone like you 
I was a dandy in your ghetto with 
A snow white smile and you'll 
Never be as perfect whatever you do 
What's my name, what's my name? 
Hold the S because I am an ain't 
What's my name, what's my name? 
Hold the S because I am an ain't 

I am a bone top, a death's head 
On a mop stick 
You infected me, took diamonds 
I took all your shit 
Your "sell-by date" expired, 
So you had to be sold 
I'm a suffer-genius and 
Vivi-sex symbol. 

You wanted perfect 
You got your perfect 
But now I'm too perfect for someone like you 
I was a dandy in your ghetto with 
A snow white smile and you'll 
Never be as perfect whatever you do 
What's my name, what's my name? 
Hold the S because I am an ain't 
What's my name, what's my name? 
Hold the S because I am an ain't 

I've got an F and a C and I got a K too 
And the only thing missing is a bitch like you 
I've got an F and a C and I got a K too 
And the only thing missing is a bitch like you 
I am a dandy in the ghetto with a snow white smile 
Super-ego bitch, I've been evil awhile 
I am a dandy in the ghetto with a snow white smile 
Super-ego bitch, I've been evil awhile 
What's my name, what's my name? 
Hold the S because I am an ain't 
What's my name, what's my name? 
Hold the S because I am an ain't
