		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you won't do
Do for love
You tried everything
But you don't give up

What I do for you
You wouldn't do for me
I tried everything
But you just don't see
How much I do for you
I give all of me
But you never do the same
No not for me
Oh no

I had to tell her stop fronting
Like I'm not out in the field just hunting
I was just wondering
Did you know hunger
The type that means that your stomach is rumbling
The type that means you got to wake up and get on job
I'm between Manny and London
They telling me I'm one of the baddest in the country
The lyrics are one hundred
Hair and nails have been funded
Wait I got a question
Why you tryna pull us in a silly direction?
Why you tryna teach me as if I need a teacher?
I never get a break so I'm never fully rested
I just got a big bag of money and invest it
I carry the weight of my city on my left leg
I made a mistake, you could never be my best friend
You're moving hella selfish

What I do for you
You wouldn't do for me
I tried everything
But you just don't see
How much I do for you
I give all of me
But you never do the same
No not for me
Oh no

I know you're looking pretty but allow me
I'm starting to feel like you're going on bawdy
You got a Mercedes
Mummy's in an Audi
Me I'm on the road grinding when it's cloudy
You lay in the sun getting a tan
I'm the man, I'm the man
I just do what I can
I was one of the boys
It was a gang
Come a long way from a Renault Megane
I'm like you're thinking when there's nothing to analyse
Making a mess like there's nothing to sanitize
I made a promise
I won't tell a lie
If I'm a deadbeat go get a better guy
If not, just chill out
I need a ride or die with me not a sell-out
I got the pad and the pen out
To put it in writing
This arguments dead out

What I do for you
You wouldn't do for me
I tried everything
But you just don't see
How much I do for you
I give all of me
But you never do the same
No not for me
Oh no
What I do for you
You wouldn't do for me
I tried everything
But you just don't see
How much I do for you
I give all of me
But you never do the same
No not for me
Oh no
