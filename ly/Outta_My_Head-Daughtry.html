		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought it would be easy
But it ain't for me
It's kinda hard when you lay your heart
On a one way street
I really thought by now
You woulda slipped my mind
But the kind of love sent from above
Is the killing kind

Put my mind to rest and try to sleep it off
It'll be alright when the morning comes
Or am I wrong

Ain't no doubt about it
I can't live without it
Tried to forget you
But I can't get you outta my head
Just when I think you're gone
You come back and turn it on
And just like a simple song
I can't get you outta my head

Well I saw you dancin'
Dancin' in my dreams
I saw your face and I can't erase
All the things I've seen
Even if I try
'Cause Lord knows I've tried
I can't escape
And I can't shake the pain inside

Crazy when she comes and crazy as she goes
I'm holding out my hands with nothing left to show
Guess that's the way it goes

Ain't no doubt about it
I can't live without it
Tried to forget you
But I can't get you outta my head
Just when I think you're gone
You come back and turn it on
And just like a simple song
I can't get you outta my head

Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head

Crazy when she comes and crazy as she goes
I'm holding out my hands with nothing left to show
Guess that's the way it goes

Ain't no doubt about it
I can't live without it
Tried to forget you
But I can't get you outta my head
Just when I think you're gone
You come back and turn it on
And just like a simple song
I can't get you outta my head

Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
