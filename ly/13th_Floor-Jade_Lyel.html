		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to wake up from a dream
That's better than my life so I just stay asleep (I just stay asleep)
Skate around town and the skies all pink
In a fake world where I can't overthink
The past will find me anywhere I breathe
Devil in her eyes but she is so sweet
I know it's gone
But it won't ever leave
Can't hideaway in dreams
I know it's gone
There's nowhere left for me
To outrun memory
Seven days on floor thirteen
Heaven or hell, somewhere in between (somewhere in between)
Break through to the city beneath
I'm stuck up here grindin' my teeth
The past will find me anywhere I breathe
Devil in her eyes but she is so sweet
I know it's gone
But it won't ever leave
Can't hideaway in dreams
I know it's gone
There's nowhere left for me
To outrun memory
