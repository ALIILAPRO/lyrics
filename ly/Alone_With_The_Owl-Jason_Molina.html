		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone with the owls howling "pain, pain, pain"
Alone with the owls howling "pain"
Alone with the owls howling "pain, pain, pain"
You don’t have to live this way

While I lived was I a stray black dog
While I lived was I a stray black dog
While I lived was I anything at all

Did I have to live this way
I stood beside the ocean not a single wave

Beside the ocean not a single wave 
Beside the ocean not a single wave 
Not a single left to say

With the owl howling “pain, pain, pain”
With the ocean howling the same
With my life howling the same
Did I have to live this way
