		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People keep on learnin' 
Soldiers keep on warrin' 
World keep on turnin' 
'Cause it won't be too long 

Powers keep on lyin' 
While your people keep on dyin' 
World keep on turnin' 
'Cause it won't be too long 

I'm so darn glad he let me try it again 
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
Gonna keep on tryin' 
Till I reach my highest ground 

Teachers keep on teachin' 
Preachers keep on preachin' 
World keep on turnin' 
'Cause it won't be too long, oh no 

Lovers keep on lovin' 
Believers keep on believin' 
Sleepers just stop sleepin' 
'Cause it won't be too long, oh no 

I'm so glad that he let me try it again 
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
Gonna keep on tryin' 
Till I reach my highest ground

An' Stevie knows that nobody's gonna bring me down
Till I reach the highest ground, 'cause me 'n' Stevie, see
We're gonna be a sailin' on the funky, funky sound (till I reach the highest ground)
Bustin' out and I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailin' on
(Till I reach the highest ground)
Just sailin' on, sailin' on the higher ground (till I reach the highest ground)
