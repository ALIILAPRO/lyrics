		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
Aw s***, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff to this and don't step
On a funky-a** track jump back
Strapped with a gat and a sack and a 7-8 flak
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
I hang with OG n****s don't set trip
Or you might get a slug in your f***in back
I don't slack when it come to street
I kick real g s*** to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a cool-a** tilt and a fly-a** Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow 
Givin' love to them n****s that I know is real g's

[Chorus]
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say ho if you makin' straight dough (ho!)
If you got love for them playas
let me hear you say oh, ladies we want you (oh!)
If you got love for them straight g's
Let me hear you motherf***ers just scream (hey!)

[Sample from Eazy-E's "N****z My Height Don't Fight"]
The Ruthless network, drive-by expert
Straight outta Compton, kickin' up dust
The Ruthless network, drive-by expert
Straight outta Compton...

[Verse 2]
Dump dump on a n**** with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?)
A real n**** named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk n****s payin' me
And broke groupie-a** b****es don't faze me
I take two step back and release myself
To put platinum-a** cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag, but i tell it like it straight-up is
Before you do a record, n****, handle your business
And don't get caught slippin' on the under
Or you might wonder (what's up with them ends, n****?)
I call a spade a spade and get paid
G's show the way, so i give love to 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
E-A-Z-why, must I
chase the cat and be a dog, a straight-up hog
I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat
So I can hear my s*** bumpin' on a Compton street
That OG, see-are-I-P and S, G and S
Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it come to me
Cause I'm the long dick bust-a-nut n**** named Eazy
B****es can't see me, hos say I'm crazy
But I don't think so, cause I'm just loco
I gives a f*** about a skanless b****
let me hit it one time if you suck this dick
I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, but I gives love to ya

(Chorus)
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say ho if you makin' straight dough (ho!)
If you got love for them playas
let me hear you say oh, ladies we want you (oh!)
If you got love for them straight g's
Let me hear you motherf***ers just scream (hey!) [x2]
