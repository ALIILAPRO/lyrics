		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I don't know where they come from, but they sure do come
I hope they're coming for me
And I don't know how they do it, but they do it real good
I hope they do it for free

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

First time that I got it I was thirteen years old!
Pussy cat livin' next door
And I went to see the doctor and he put me on hold
He said there wasn't no cure

He said it's cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

I'm not in danger, I'm not in pain, I'm moving like a train
You know you got it 'cause it makes you insane
It makes you want to do it, do it, wasting my brain

Well I make that kitten happy with the tongue and the hand
She wave her tail at me
She knows just where to come to find a sensitive man
I give it to her for free

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
