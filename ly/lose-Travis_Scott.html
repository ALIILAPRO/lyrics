		  My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous
I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dupes, can't let them come through
I got shit to lose
Hold the weight, more to gain, more at stake
I got shit to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you

Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them

My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous
I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dupes, can't let them come through
I got shit to lose
Hold the weight, more to gain, more at stake
I got shit to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you

Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And I never liked it, and I never liked them

You know what, we grew on
We go back like futons and coupons
We too bad, we too wild, we too young
Shake some, my niggas gon' shake some
Fall through and break somethin'
Broad day, and take somethin'
Backwards, I've been livin' backwards
On my mattress, orgies on my mattress
Flashes, dreamin', havin' flashes
Dashin', hopin' I don't crash it

My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous
I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dupes, can't let them come through
I got shit to lose
Hold the weight, more to gain, more at stake
I got shit to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you

Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And I never liked it, and I never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
