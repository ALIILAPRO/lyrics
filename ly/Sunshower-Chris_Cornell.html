		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark as roses and fine as sand
Fell your healing and your sting again
Hear you laughing and my soul is saved
On forgotten graves you cry

Crawl like ivy up my spine
Through my nerves and into my eyes
Cuts like anguish or recollections
Of better days gone by

But it's all right
When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh it's all right
When you find you way 
Then you see it disappear
Oh it's all right
Though your garden's gray
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Oh oh in a sweet sunshower
In a sweet sunshower

Eyes like oceans so far away
A feather trail to a better way
Worried mornings turn into days
Then into worried nights
But it's all right

When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh it's all right
When you find you way 
Then you see it disappear
It's all right
Though your garden's gray
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Oh oh in a sweet sunshower
Oh in a sweet sunshower

In the sweet sunshower
In the sweet 
Sweet 
Sweet 
Sunshower

Oh oh oh 
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In the sweet
In the sweet sunshower
And its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today
Its all right
All you'll be you are today
Are today
Are today
Are today
Are today
Are today
