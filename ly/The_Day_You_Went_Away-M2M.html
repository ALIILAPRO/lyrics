		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Uh-uh, mm)

Well, I wonder could it be
When I was dreaming 'bout you baby
You were dreaming of me
Call me crazy, call me blind
To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time

Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do?
I do, you know I really, really do

Well, hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

(Oh-oh, yeah, oh)

I remember date and time
September 22, Sunday
Twenty five after nine
In the doorway with your case
No longer shouting at each other
There were tears on our faces

And we were letting go of something special
Something we'll never have again
I know, I guess I really, really know

But, hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

The day you went away
The day you went away

(Oh-oh, yeah, oh-whoa-woah)

Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do?
I do, you know I really, really do

Well, hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

Why do we never know what we've got 'til it's gone
How could I carry on
The day you went away?
'Cause I've been missing you so much, I have to say
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

The day you went away
The day you went away

(Oh-oh, yeah, oh-whoa)
