My lady never lets me down
That's why I never let her go
She always there to lift me up
When I fall down and hit the floor

My baby's so amazing
Let me sit back and count the ways

When you see my miss you know my shorty's a dime
When she dolo with her peoples, they be skipping the line

But you know I love the way my chick be holdin' it down
Extremely thorough by the way she reppin' it hard
Travel anywhere my shorty come touch on the guard

Even if she had to get up and just lie on the stand

That's my chick, ?cause she could get it

My lady never lets me down
That's why I never let her go
