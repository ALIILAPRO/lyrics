		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God

Cover your ears and shut your eyes
Because what I'm about to say is gonna ruin your night

This is a call out
And I'm not scared to drop some names
You've dug your grave and you have no one but yourself to blame
I see the world in black and white
Because true colour always fades under the right lights

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you said

You've run out of luck and I'm calling your bluff
You stabbed me in the back but not deep enough
But not deep enough
I see through you

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you said
I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you said

You said I'd never make it
You said I'd fall on my face
But now I'm right where I belong and I put you in your place
You said I'd never make it
You said I'd make a mistake
But now I'm right where I belong and you've got nothing to say

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you said
I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you said

You stabbed me in the back but not deep enough
