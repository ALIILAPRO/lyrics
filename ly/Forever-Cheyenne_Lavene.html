		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea, yea I'm really falling
You got me all in love
I wasn't ready for it
But I'm so caught up
You got me caught up
Now I can't get enough
Get enough
You're what I been waiting for
Been waiting for
I ain't ever had another
Do it like you do
I wanna spend time with you
We ain't got a thing to lose
I want you forever
Forever my baby
Yea
I think it would be better
If we stopped all the waiting, yea
Boy you already know, know
I ain't goin' nowhere, yea
Cuz I want you forever
Forever my baby, yea
I try to fight the feeling
But I can't anymore, no
And I don't even wanna, wanna
I would rather be with you, oh
Now I can't get enough
Get enough
You're what I been waiting for
Been waiting for
I ain't ever had another
Do it like you do
I wanna spend time with you
We ain't got a thing to lose
I want you forever
Forever my baby
(Baby, baby)
I think it would be better
If we stopped all the waiting, yea
Boy you already know, know
I ain't goin' nowhere, yea
Cuz I want you forever
Forever my baby, yea
