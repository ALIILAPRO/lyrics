		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard to face all the feelings
Pretending that I'm not bleeding
(I'm out of my head)
(I'm leaving for dead)
Heart skips, pulse hits the ceiling
Cold sweats, the nightmare revealing
(It's all in my head)

(When it all goes down the darkness comes out)
The darkness comes out

When it all goes down
The savage comes out
Everyone's a wolf
Everyone's a wolf
When the walls at your back
You're under attack
E-e-everyone, everyone's a wolf

I'm tracking the moves that you're making
I sense you're not far from breaking
(In the unknown, I'm not alone)
Feeding on lies and betrayal
This coffin's on its final nail
It's all in my head

(When it all goes down the darkness comes out)
The darkness comes out

When it all goes down
The savage comes out
Everyone's a wolf
Everyone's a wolf
When the walls at your back
You're under attack
E-e-everyone's a wolf
We're biting, we're crawling
Never giving up, never giving up, yeah
We're killing, surviving
When's enough, enough?
Everyone, everyone's a wolf

When it all goes down
The savage comes out
Everyone's a wolf
Everyone's a wolf (everyone's a wolf)
When the walls at your back
You're under attack
E-e-everyone, everyone's a wolf
We're biting (we're biting)
We're crawling (we're crawling)
Never giving up, never giving up, yeah
We're killing (we're killing)
Surviving (surviving)
When's enough, enough?
Everyone, everyone's a wolf

Everyone, everyone's a wolf
