		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My man's 
Got a heart 
Like a rock 
Cast in the sea 

Well no one told me about her
The way she lies 
Well no one told me about her 
How many people cried

My man's 
Got a heart 
Like a rock 
Cast in the sea

Well no one told me about her 
The way she lies 
Well no one told me about her 
How many people cried 

But it's too late to say you're sorry 
How would I know? 
Why should I care? 
Please don't bother to find her 
She's not there 

My man's 
Got a heart 
Like a rock 
Cast in the sea
Cast in the sea

Well no one told me about her 
Well no one told me about her 
How many people cried 

But it's too late to say you're sorry 
How would I know? 
Why should I care? 
Please don't bother trying to find her 
She's not there 
She's not there
