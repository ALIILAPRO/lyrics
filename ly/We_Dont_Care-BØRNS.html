		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a case of the haunting
I got a taste of the madman in my mind
Well I used to sleep at night

Moving like everyones watching
Shake off the shadows freak out the phantoms love
You're more than just a dove

She's my light
She's my daredevil halo tonight
The world's on fire

But we don't care
We don't care
Touch me
Everyone's watching but we don't care

We're face to face without faces
Lined up from coastline to coast like static sky
Well maybe it's just goodbye

Who's playing the harlequin bass line
Dancing the dance like we're seasick dominos
There's only one way to go

She's my light
She's my daredevil halo tonight
The world's on fire

But we don't care
We don't care
Touch me
Everyone's watching but we don't

We don't care
We could go for days
We don't care
Go our separate ways

We don't care
We don't care
We don't care
