		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, whoa

I've been here lookin' dynamite
Alone against the wall
Girls like you give it all so cold
Talkin' cheap in a bathroom stall
And you look so smooth
Better tell me the truth
Would you trade me
Out for someone cool?
I know you better than you do
So put out your cigarette
And kiss me on
The lips tonight

Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
Nineteen-eighty-three is calling
I've been on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
Oh oh oh
Nineteen-eighty-three

I've got something that I've kept inside
And the blood is on the blade
You're there suckin' on a lollipop
Like you haven't aged a day
And it ain't so pretty when you're playin' cute
When your body's up against some fool
Does he feel it
'Cause I feel it

Me and you
Let's go back to
Nineteen-eighty-three is calling
I've been on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
Nineteen-eighty-three

The year I was born
I won't
Be ignored
So get your feet on the floor
I'm the only one
Are you afraid I still make you move

Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to
Nineteen-eighty-three
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to
Nineteen-eighty-three

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to
Nineteen-eighty-three is calling
I've been on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
Nineteen-eighty-three

Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to
Nineteen-eighty-three is calling
I've been on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
Nineteen-eighty-three

Oh, oh, oh
Nineteen-eighty-three
Oh, oh, oh
Nineteen-eighty-three
