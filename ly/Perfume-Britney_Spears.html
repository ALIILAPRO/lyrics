		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare
Is there still longing there?
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girl friend, ex girlfriend, I'm trying to be cool
Am I being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here baby

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her about me
And while I wait
I put on my perfume, yeah I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can tell but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can tell but I hope she smells my perfume

I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments
I know you got history

But I'm your girlfriend, now I'm your girlfriend
Trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here baby

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her, about me
And while I wait
I put on my perfume, yeah I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her, about me
And while I wait
I put on my perfume, yeah I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can tell but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can tell but I hope she smells my perfume
