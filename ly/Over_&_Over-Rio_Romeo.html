Aaaaaaaaaaa

Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over 

Over and over
I fuck myself over
And under and under
I do it again

Morning and evening
I felt I was grieving
Until I said fuck you
And never again

Daytime or night time I feel Iâ€™m on my time
But my time is fickle
Just like a friend

And with my departure
From the pain I harbor
I feel I am sinking
And sailing to swim

Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and

Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and

Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and

Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over 

Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and
Over and over and

And with my departure
From the pain I harbor
I feel I am sinking
And sailing to swim
