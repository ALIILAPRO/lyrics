		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream
Boom ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doodle-ay (sh-boom)

Life could be a dream
If I could take you up in paradise up above (sh-boom)
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream sweetheart
(Hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again)
Boom ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doodle-ay (sh-boom)
Boom ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doodle-ay (sh-boom)

Life could be a dream (sh-boom)
If only all my precious plans would come true (sh-boom)
If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you
Life could be a dream sweetheart

Every time I look at you
Something is on my mind (dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-duh)
If you do what I want you to
Baby, we'd be so fine

Life could be a dream (sh-boom)
If I could take you up in paradise up above (sh-boom)
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream sweetheart
(Hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again) boom sh-boom
Hey nonny ding dong, alang alang alang (sh-boom)
Ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doodle-ay
Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

(Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom)
(Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom)
(Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom)
(Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom)
(Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom)
(Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom)
(Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom)

Life could be a dream, sh-boom
If I could take you up in paradise up above
Sh-boom if you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream sweetheart
(Hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again) boom sh-boom
Hey nonny ding dong, alang alang alang (sh-boom)
Ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doodle-ay
Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream
Dee-oody-ooh, sh-boom, sh-boom
