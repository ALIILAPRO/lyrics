		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets
And little man, little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have
No regrets 
Recline yourself, resign yourself
You're through

I always get what I aim for
And your heart and soul is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win?
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool 
Give in

Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets

I always get what I aim for
And your heart and soul is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win?
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in

Give in, give in
