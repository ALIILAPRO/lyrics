		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe your thinking
Save everyone, inside you
Take everything
Fake everything
Save everything, about me

All of you, (all right)
Just, just because, I want to know 
Do you still (come last night with clear eyes peeled/pale)
You never got there (even though you say you will)
Sorry now that you've fallen from my eyes
That's the truth

Why tell me about (everything)
Why tell me about (anything)
You're just waiting for her to come apart
You're just waiting for her

Take everything
Fake everything
Save everything
