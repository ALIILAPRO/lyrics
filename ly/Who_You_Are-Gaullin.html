		<p>
		  Over there tomorrow when we are all right, (all right) 
That's when we forget just who we are, (are) 
They just come together and it's all right, (all right) 
That's when you remember who you are (are)

Over there tomorrow when we are all right, (all right) 
That's when we forget just who we are, (are) 
They just come together and it's all right, (all right) 
That's when you remember who you are (are)

Over there tomorrow when we are all right, (all right) 
That's when we forget just who we are, (are) 
They just come together and it's all right, (all right) 
That's when you remember who you are (are)

Over there tomorrow when we are all right, (all right) 
That's when we forget just who we are, (are) 
They just come together and it's all right, (all right) 
That's when you remember who you are (are)
