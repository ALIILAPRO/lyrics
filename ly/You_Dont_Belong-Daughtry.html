		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With time to kill and an empty tomb
I always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smoky rooms, I can hardly stand the fumes

Telling me that you mean no harm
You stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone have I been away too long

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Any given time or place I never will forget the disgrace on your face
So full of love, will it ever be enough?
Ten feet tall and bullet proof I never thought that I had a thing to lose
Well, it looks like after all, I'm gonna have to choose

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

You help pass the time, but I'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason why to live such a lie
Tell me have I been gone away too long?

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

You don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
With my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
You'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone
Long gone
