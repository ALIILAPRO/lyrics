		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Choke me like you hate me, but you love me
Lowkey wanna date me when you fuck me (uwu)
Touch me with the lights off and my chains on
Baby, I'm not the right one you should wait on

She a freak, lil' bad ho
Gaspare told me kill it
I said, "Let me grab my Death Note"
Huh, she pulled me in like a lasso
Sayin' that she know me, I don't even know her at though
Ain't no daddy issues, then I won't even bother
She say I kill her cat like I'm Luka Magnotta
Real bad bitch, pussy bald like Saitama
They used to hate me now they want me, bitch I feel like I'm Gaara
Uh, girl you fuckin' with a wrong one
Fuck his team, fuck your clique, bitch, I'm on one
Fuck your stream, fuck your clip, you ain't saw one
Got your bitch on my dick like she want one

Look and she got Death Note, dead souls, split dye, chain cold
Think I fell in love when she said, "Grab me by the neck though"
All through the night, colder than ice
Man, I swear these goth girls finna fuck up my life
Bat wing fly like the moon in the sky
She just look into my soul with them Shinigami eyes
Coke in my nose and a blade on her thigh
Man, I think this girl is really trying to plan my demise
It's the pumpkin patch king with the corpse with the ring
And she'd fuck my best friend if I die here today

Choke me like you hate me, but you love me
Lowkey wanna date me when you fuck me
Touch me with the lights off and my chains on
Baby I'm not the right one you should wait on
