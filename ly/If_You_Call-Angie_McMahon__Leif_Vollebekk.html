		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm putting down the habit
The habit of looking back on all of it 
And wishing I had done better
Oh I just wanna feel it
Feel that I like who I'm becoming
Feel it all in the quiet

I know the sun don't rise and set above me
I don't want you to compromise a lot to love me

But if you call
I'll turn on the light for you
If you call
I'm gonna be bright for you
If you call

I've been a little darker
And I've been wanting you to see though 
You've been coming 'round needing to be looked after
And I don't have an answer
Why I've been buried underneath some kind of mound that I made or some disaster

I know the sun don't rise and set above me
I don't want you to compromise a lot to love me

But if you call
I'll turn on the light for you
If you call
I'm gonna be bright for you
If you call

I'll tell you something that I've learned
As we've been watching people leaving
All the loving that we've earned
Is gonna keep us breathing

All the loving that we've earned
Is gonna keep us breathing
Is gonna keep us breathing

Is gonna keep us breathing
Is gonna keep us breathing
It's gonna keep us breathing
It's gonna keep us breathing
Keep us breathing
