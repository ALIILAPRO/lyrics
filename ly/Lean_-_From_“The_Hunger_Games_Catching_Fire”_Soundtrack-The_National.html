		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody needs a prayer and needs a friend
Everybody knows the world's about to end
Everybody wants to know what the end will be
Everybody wants to look before they leap
Everybody wants a sip of wine to drink
Everybody wants a little more time to think
Everybody needs a reason why they run
Everybody wants to know what they're running from

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us all to smithereens
Dying is easy, I believe my love, and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love, and my love relieves me
You said it was everything

Everybody takes forever to fall asleep,
Everybody's got a love they don't want to keep
Everybody needs a prayer, needs a friend
Everybody knows the world's about to end

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us to smithereens
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
You said it was everything
And I'm gonna let it in

And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us all to smithereens?
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
You said it was everything
And I'm gonna let it in
