		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I awoke you were biding your time
You show me ways to get lost
Burn all our names
Scratch them deep in the wood
Find all the places to hide
When you took your coat
And were fixing my tie
In the eave of the entryway
This home took us back
Took you in by surprise
Is that what you're trying to say?
When you awake in the room that you left
Wind at the door in the hall
Follow our name
Call it deep in the woods
Pass down a myth that will bind
Oh, what a time to be loved, to be lost
In the home that we grew on the hill
The hundred acres lose you now
The hymn of all things you doubt
Carried with you for the years you'd gone
And wandered out until you found our home
You will know
You were home
You were home
By the time we settled down
The sun had the reached the hill and fell
Wandered off until we found our home
