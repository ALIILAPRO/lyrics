		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back to the beat
Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back to the beat
Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back to the beat
Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back to the beat

Everybody, let's move to the beat
We can dance now, bassline under our feet
Everybody, dancing all along
Time to party, sing our happy song

We are dreamers, we are young
One, two, three, solo
M-O-V-N to the beat
Everyone get on your feet
We're the future superstars
That is who we are
Clap your hands now on the floor
Clap your hands, one, two, three, four
Girls and boys and everyone
Happy song, so fun
M-O-V-N to the beat
Don't forget your ABC's
We're the future superstars
That is who we are
Clap your hands now on the floor
Clap your hands, one, two, three, four

Everybody, let's move to the beat
We can dance now, bassline under our feet
Everybody, dancing all along
Time to party, sing our happy song

We are dreamers, we are young
One, two, three, solo
M-O-V-N to the beat
Everyone get on your feet
We're the future superstars
That is who we are
Clap your hands now on the floor
Clap your hands, one, two, three, four
Girls and boys and everyone
Happy song, so fun
M-O-V-N to the beat
Don't forget your ABC's
We're the future superstars
That is who we are
Clap your hands now on the floor
Clap your hands, one, two, three, four

Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back, to the beat
Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back, to the beat
Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back, to the beat
Clap your hands, move your feet
Two steps back, to the beat

Everybody, let's move to the beat
We can dance now, bassline under our feet
Everybody, dancing all along
Time to party, sing our happy song

We are dreamers, we are young
One, two, three, solo
M-O-V-N to the beat
Everyone get on your feet
We're the future superstars
That is who we are
Clap your hands now on the floor
Clap your hands, one, two, three, four
Girls and boys and everyone
Happy song, so fun
M-O-V-N to the beat
Don't forget your ABC's
We're the future superstars
That is who we are
Clap your hands now on the floor
Clap your hands, one, two, three, four
