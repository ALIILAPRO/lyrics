		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on. Check it out, ya'll   Come on, come on!  Come on, come on!   Check it out! 'The tribal dance!'    (Say that again?)     Feel the force, this is your chance  To get control and do the tribal dance   People started dancing a long time ago   The bass was fast, but then again it was slow  Soul, house, hip-hop and blues  It doesn't really matter which music you choose  Start up a dance this is your chance   To come with me and do the tribal dance!     You've got to move it feel the temperature  Into the rythym let the fire burn  So get into it-- get into the trance  This is the rhythm of the tribal dance  'The tribal dance!'     It started with a tribe who discovered the vibe  Who moved to the rhythm just the way they liked  You hear the treble, you hear the bass   The R-A-Y, yeah is on the case   Feel the fire, feel the flame   Do your thing now, don't be ashamed  I have to go now no offense   I've hooked you up into the tribal dance!     Get it into it!   Get into it!   Get into the trance!     You've got to move it feel the temperature  Into the rythym let the fire burn  So get into it-- get into the trance  This is the rhythm of the tribal dance  'The tribal dance!'     You've got to do the tribal dance!     Check it out! C'mon! Take your chance!  Check it out! C'mon! Take your chance!   Check it out! C'mon! Take your chance!    Tribal dance!   Tribal dance, tribal dance!   Yeah! Oh!    Tribal dance! Tribal dance!     You've got to move it feel the temperature  Into the rythym let the fire burn  So get into it-- get into the trance  This is the rhythm of the tribal dance  'The tribal dance!'     You've got to move it feel the temperature  Into the rythym let the fire burn  So get into it-- get into the trance  This is the rhythm of the tribal dance  'The tribal dance!'
