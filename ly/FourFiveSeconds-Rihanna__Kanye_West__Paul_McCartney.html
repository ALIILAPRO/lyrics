		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear, I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive (we can run, run)
Then I heard you was talkin' trash (I'm on a mystery)
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear, I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See, they wanna buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See, all of my kindness, mm-hm
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear, I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear, I wish somebody would tell me
'Cause that's all I want
