		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does your god come in a capsule,
To sedate you tear the walls down,
Headless prison cannibals chew,
To consume you bring the alien,

Halcium and morphine,
5-methoxy-n, n-dimethyltryptamine,
Psilocybin, mescaline, aspirin, histomine,
Brushite, darvaset, valium, caffeine, cannabis, and LSD,
Ayahuasca, harmine give it all to me I want it

These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things

Trisolam and zanex, serotonin, mdma, ibogaine, dopeamine,
Tetra-hydro-chloride, atenolol,
Amanita muscaria,
Boric oxide, arrabinitol, psilocin, and flamizine,
Cylotec and harmaline
Give it all to me I want it

Does your god come in a capsule to sedate you,
Tear the walls down, headless prison,
Cannibals chew to consume you,
Bring the alien

You can't kill me,
I'm already dead
Inside my hole,
Inside my head,
We just beg for any way to be sedated,
It's all about escaping,
Numb to me,
Numb body from this hell,

I can feel them pushing, I can feel them pulling
I can feel them holding, I can feel them moving,
I can feel them prying, I can feel them prodding,
I can feel them breathing, I can feel them digging
I can feel them stabbing, I can feel them scoping,
I can feel them living, I can feel it,
Consume, take in, plunging, plumbing,
Instruments prying, aliens inside me,
Tooling the machine,
Intoxicating,
Feel it unfolding, riddles in me

It's all about escaping, we just beg for any way to get away
Who do you bow down to, does your god come in a capsule or on a plate
They're trying to sedate you, swallow self and bring on the alien
You tried to kill me, I'm already dead to this world
I'm already dead to this world
