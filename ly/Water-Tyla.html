		  Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water

Normally
I can keep my cool, but tonight I'm wildin'
I'ma be
In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Mm
Telling me (yeah)
That you really 'bout it, why try hide it? Ooh
Talk is cheap, so show me
That you understand how I like it

Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
Whole body

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water

Hopefully
You can last all night, don't get too excited (ooh)
Oh, privacy
You ain't gotta go nowhere, you can stay inside it

Can you blow my mind? Oh
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time (give you my time)
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
Whole body

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water (make me sweat)
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat (make me sweat)
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
