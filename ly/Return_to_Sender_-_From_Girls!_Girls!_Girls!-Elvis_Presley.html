		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Return to sender
Return to sender

I gave a letter to the postman
He put it his sack
Bright and early next morning
He brought my letter back

(She wrote upon it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone

We had a quarrel
A lover's spat
I write I'm sorry, but my letter keeps coming back

So then I dropped it in the mailbox 
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning
It came right back to me

(She wrote upon it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone

This time I'm gonna take it myself
And put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day then I'll understand

(The writing on it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone

Ah, return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
