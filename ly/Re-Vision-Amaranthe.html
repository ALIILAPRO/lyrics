		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Critical)
(Demolition)
(Critical)

Shedding it down, letting it out, do it
Modificate, refashion autonomy
(I'm second to none, bringing my soul into it)
Embrace the innovations sublime
I upgrade my mind and realize the truth is
Enhance and magnify
(I am sick of the scar, it is time to remove it)

A new design, the true connection
I'll activate artificial and the mortal align

Maybe there's a light at the end of the line
Or just a concept, a vision to improve it
Let the night wash away from your eyes
It's your decision
Re-vision how to do it, do it

(A new era's begun, life on the run, face it)
Accelerate and escape the dependency
Disorder is on, a power undone, embrace it
Unplug and disconnect, re-align
(While morality is blind, I can see that)
Your thirst will surge inside
The sickening flaws is the system we combat

(You see the signs, a new direction)
(Just walk away, now bring it to the end of the line)

Maybe there's a light at the end of the line
Or just a concept, a vision to improve it
Let the night wash away from your eyes
It's your decision
Re-vision how to do it, do it

You strive for affirmation
Brings you closer day by day
Sense the insubordination
Contradicting what you crave
Fraught and disillusioned
Do you love what you betray?
Just an ordinary crucifixion
Ornaments upon your grave

Maybe there's a light at the end of the line
Or just a concept, a vision to improve it
Let the night wash away from your eyes
It's your decision
Re-vision how to do it, do it
