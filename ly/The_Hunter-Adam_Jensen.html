		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fame is in the front seat
Trouble with the curve
Fame is in the back seat
Singing like a bird, oh no
Take me to the good life

Stranger on the mountain
Hanging on your words
Walking in a nightmare
Everything is blurred, oh no
Take me to the good times

Don't forget what you told me
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing

Watching, waiting
My prey is praying
There's no escaping
My blood's pumping
I go one hundred
The hunter, the hunted

Bubba's in the spaceship
Crashing through the air
Devil's in the details
Lepers in your hair, oh no
I can see the future

Take another picture
Drop it on your tongue
Let your body burn down
Breathe it in your lungs, oh no
Take me to your leader

Don't forget what you told me
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing

Watching, waiting
My prey is praying
There's no escaping
My blood's pumping
I go one hundred
The hunter, the hunted

Take it to the red line
Bring you with the force
Buried deep in your mind
Soldier in the war, oh no
You can run but you can't hide

Watching, waiting
My prey is praying
There's no escaping
My blood's pumping
I go one hundred
The hunter, the hunted
