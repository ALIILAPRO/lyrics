		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move to the city with me
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
You're too pretty for me
Baby, I know, it's true, yeah
Even better when you first wake up
Than anybody else I've fucked
Baby, I got good luck with you
I didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start
Baby, you got me worried (hey)

Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here, oh
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here

Drivin' through the city with me
Just watching you glow
I'm in the passenger seat, you're in control
It's on you now
Even better every day, I swear
Maybe it's a little unfair
Baby, I'm starstruck by you
Didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start
Baby, you got me worried (hey)
 
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here
Whoa, your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooh, yeah, I need you here

If we fall apart
Maybe it wasn't meant to be
If we fall apart
It was our favorite dream
Ooh, ooh, hey

Your love is therapy
No drug can give me clarity
As much as you do, ooh (as you do, baby)
Yeah, I need you here (I need you here)
Your love is scaring me (no one)
No one has ever cared for me (ooh, baby)
As much as you do
Ooh, (hey, yeah) yeah, I need you here (oh, oh, oh, oh)
 
(Ooh, I need you, babe) ooh, ooh, ahh
Yeah (yeah, yeah, I need you, baby)
(Ooh, I need you)
