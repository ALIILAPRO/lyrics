		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like I'm losing my shit
If I leave I might get caught
I just wanna fuck on the sink
But my bitch's not that hot
Maybe I am losing my friends
But my friends are not that fun
I think I'm just losing my head
I feel like I'm losing my shit
If I leave I might get caught
I just think I'm losing my friends
But my friends are not that fun
People are so boring, shit (boring)
Stuck in that fucking city (damn city)
I feel like I'm dying, shit (yea yea yea)
Lonely with my black outfit (black)
What's up baby, yea I'm back (I'm back)
My goal is to break your back (yea yea yea)
My plan is to shut my mind off
And wait till your dark side shows
(And wait till your dark side shows)
(And wait till your dark side shows)
(And wait till your dark side shows)
I feel like I'm losing my shit
If I leave I might get caught
I just wanna fuck on the sink
But my bitch not that hot
I feel like I'm losing my shit
If I leave I might get caught
I just think I'm loosing my friends
But my friends are not that fun
I feel like I'm losing my shit
If I leave I might get caught
I just think I'm loosing my friends
But my friends are not that fun
