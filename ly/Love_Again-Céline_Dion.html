		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rising tides, tears you cry every night seem never ending
But that's just life
The last goodbye, high and dry it leaves you empty
You might think your world is ending but it won't
You might think you need to give up, but you don't

'Cause you don't have to move a mountain, just keep moving
Every move is a new emotion
And you don't have to find the answer, just keep trying
The sun will rise again, the storms subside again
This is not the end
And you will love again

Summer rain, day by day, sadness fades, the wound is healing
And time goes by, eyes will dry, and you will find someone to heal with
You might think your world is ending but it won't
You might think you need to give up, but you don't

'Cause you don't have to move a mountain, just keep moving
Every move is a new emotion
And you don't have to find the answer, just keep trying
The sun will rise again, storm subside again
This is not the end
And you will love again

You will love again, again, love again
You will love again, again, love again

'Cause you don't have to move a mountain, just keep moving
Every move is a new emotion
And you don't have to find the answer, just keep trying
The sun will rise again, the storms subside again
No, this is not the end
And you will love, you will love, you will love
Again
