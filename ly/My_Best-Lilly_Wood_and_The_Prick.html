		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my bags packed, my dresses ironed 
I got my shoes ready by the door I got my hands clean 
My lips red and my fingers done I've got my best clothes on 
My best hair done 

So would you call my name if I try my best? 
Would you remember my face if I try my best? 
I've got my hopes up for the man I dream of 
I got no tears in my serious eyes I got plenty of ideas my dear 
I got many things, many things in my head 

So would you call my name if I try my best?
Would you remember my face if I try my best? 
I have my secrets to share 
My arms are ready to wrap around your neck 
I have no fear of loosing this game I have my future all figured out 
So would you call my name if I try my best? 
Would you remember my face if I try my best?
