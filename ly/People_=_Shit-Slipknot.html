		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go again, motherfucker
Come on down, and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't feel anything
It isn't like I want to sift through the decay
I feel like a wound, like I got a fuckin'
Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead
One more time, motherfucker
Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands, and I
Don't know why, I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business

Whose life is it?
Get it? See it?
Feel it? Eat it?
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I want to leave without a trace
'Cause I don't want to die in this place
People equal shit, people equal shit
People equal shit, people equal shit
People equal shit (what cha gonna do?)
People equal shit ('cause I am not afraid of you)
People equal shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
People equal shit

It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion, I'm sittin' at the side of satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be
Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it
Stop your bitchin' and fight your way through it
I'm, not, like, you, i, just, fuck, up
C'mon motherfucker, everybody has to die
C'mon motherfucker, everybody has to die

People equal shit, people equal shit
People equal shit, people equal shit
People equal shit (what cha gonna do?)
People equal shit ('cause I am not afraid of you)
People equal shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
People equal shit
People equal shit, people equal shit
People equal shit, people equal shit
People equal shit (what cha gonna do?)
People equal shit ('cause I am not afraid of you)
People equal shit (I'm everything you'll never be) people equal shit
