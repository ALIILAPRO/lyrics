		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been tryna kick myself back in my body
And tell you sorry, mm
We've been tryna get us back to where we started
But it's half-hearted

Fight until the morning
Little bit in love, then a little bit over
Pushing you away when you're pulling me closer to you
Days are feeling longer
And I really hate that I'm starting to wonder
If it's really worth holding on any longer to you

But when you're sleeping, you look so pretty
When you touch me, I get all dizzy
And I remember why I'm so in it
I forget all of our flaws
I just want you close
When you look so pretty

I've been tryna keep my head above the water
But it gets harder
And I keep going back to that time
When we were sitting by the harbor late in August
Yeah, we made a promise

That we'd always be together
Never let it go, never take it for granted
If it's getting hard, try a little bit harder for you
(Try a little bit harder for you)
Days are feeling longer
And I really hate that I'm starting to wonder
If it's really worth holding on any longer to you

But when you're sleeping, you look so pretty
When you touch me, I get all dizzy
And I remember why I'm so in it
I forget all of our flaws
I just want you close
When you look so pretty

When you look so pretty

Looking at you looking at me
That's when I know that you belong with me (with me)
You belong with me

But when you're sleeping, you look so (so) pretty (pretty)
When you touch me, I get all dizzy
And I remember why I'm so in it
I forget all of our flaws
I just want you close
When you look so pretty
