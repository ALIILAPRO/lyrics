		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She says she's no good with words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too overdramatic
Tonight it's it can't get much worse
Versus no one should ever feel like

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Dance, dance
We're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up it's last call last resort
But only the first mistake and I

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them 
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love?

Dance, dance
We're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress? (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance
We're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead

Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance this is the way they'd love if they knew how misery loved me

Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
