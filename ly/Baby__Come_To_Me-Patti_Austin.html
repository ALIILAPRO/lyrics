		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinkin' back in time
When love was only in the mind
I realize,
Ain't no second chance
You got to hold on to romance
Don't let it slide
There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you

Spendin' every dime
To keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was
And all those walks together
Out in any kind of weather
Just because
There's a brand new way of looking at your life
When you know that love is standing by your side

The night can be cold
There's a chill to every evening when you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm

Baby come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you.

Baby come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you.

Baby come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you.
