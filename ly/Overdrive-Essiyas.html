		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too many games
Too many nights baby
All of the pain
Come with a price baby
You losing your patience
Tell me what you wanna find baby
It's getting late but I wanna give it all for tonight baby
So let's party till it's up
We can call it what you want
Know the night is young
And I wanna feel the rush
Dance until the sun
Till the sun is coming up
You might be the one
I was falling from the start
Times that we held it together
Was it love was it lust I can't tell
For now can we call it forever
Took my heart and you dance like the devil
You know that I do it better
I want the feeling to last forever
Forever and ever and ever
Blood rushing through my veins
Ain't no stopping it's too late
Don't want no one to take your place
Feel my touch around your waist
You mix the liquor with chase
I drink out the bottle give me a taste
Go all night and sleep all day
When we wake up is it gonna change?
Too many games
Too many nights baby
All of the pain
Come with a price baby
You losing your patience
Tell me what you wanna find baby
It's getting late but I wanna give it all for tonight baby
So let's party till it's up
We can call it what you want
Know the night is young
And I wanna feel the rush
Dance until the sun
Till the sun is coming up
You might be the one
I was falling from the start
Now I'm in overdrive
My heart is in overdrive
Let's do it one more time
Give me your all tonight
All night all night
All night all night all night
All night all night all night
Now I'm in overdrive
