		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look in a mirror, the cobweb of my soul
On my face, forever, seeking to be whole
Driven by passion, raging like a storm
With thunder and lightning, and this hubris I was born

Blood hot and vain, I risked to take it all
Blind to your pain, your wounds, my downfall

You can relight my fire
When our shame becomes the pale horse
The story's harbouring a liar
But you're the seer can break the curse
For in the twilight of my years
I am nothing but anger's remorse

You were my light, the spark inside my soul
Of venom and spite, tears would forever flow
I did you wrong, and I never set it right
And you played along, the grey from black and white

Waves of despair, an ocean of desolation
Fighting for air, my swan song be done

You can relight my fire…

Dive through the dark
To find the light on the other side
You will find him there
The piece you're missing
The man I drove away

You can relight the fire…
