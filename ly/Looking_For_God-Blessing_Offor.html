		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at these castles
Look at these walls around
Look as these shackles
Golden chains hold us down
And the party's so fun now, why would we leave?
The money don't run out but what does it mean?
Look at these questions, who's gonna answer me now?

I've been looking for God in the strangest places
Looking for God in the back streets
It's like we forgot who's friends with the wasted
Left behind in the alleys
I've been looking for God 'cause He's out there
Close to the pain and He's not scared
It's "hold back your hair" love
"Show you I care" love
It's everywhere that they said it's not
I've been looking for God

Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking

Look at our hearts break
Just trying to hide ourselves
It's a been a hard rain
And we're trying to dry ourselves
Everybody's so chic, shoes in style
Wonder if they've walked somebody else's mile
The answer's not far away, if we could only try ourselves

I've been looking for God in the strangest places
Looking for God in the back streets
It's like we forgot who's friends with the wasted
Left behind in the alleys
I've been looking for God 'cause He's out there
Close to the pain and He's not scared
It's "hold back your hair" love
"Show you I care" love
It's everywhere that they said it's not
I've been looking for God

Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
I've been looking for God
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking

(The party's so loud, everybody's so free)
(But you can't hear the sound of a soul scream)
A soul scream, a soul scream
You can't hear the sound of a soul scream

I've been looking for God in the strangest places
Looking for God in the back streets
It's like we forgot who's friends with the wasted
Left behind in the alleys
I've been looking for God 'cause He's out there
Close to the pain and He's not scared
It's "hold back your hair" love
"Show you I care" love
It's everywhere that they said it's not
I've been looking for God

Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
I've been looking for God
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
