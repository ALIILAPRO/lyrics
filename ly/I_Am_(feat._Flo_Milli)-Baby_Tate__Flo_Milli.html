		<p>
		  (Monsta's gon' tear it up) Yeah
Who that is, bitch?

I am healthy, I am wealthy
I am rich, I am that bitch (yeah)
I am gonna go get that bag
And I am not gonna take your shit (uh)
I am protected, well respected
I'm a queen, I'm a dream (yeah)
I do what I wanna do
And I'm who I wanna be
'Cause I am me

Bitch, that's YBT (yeah)
Yo man got his eye on me (uh)
But IDC 'cause I'm fly as bees
That's bzz, bzz, bzz
I hit streets, bitch, I drive, no keys
That's skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Don't lie on me, body right
Don't need no work, work, work

Ayy, I don't need no one, I'm independent on my own
I get that money and I can spend it 'cause it's long
Everything on me, no, it's not rented, bitch, I own
I know you see it, ain't gotta tell me 'cause I know

I am healthy, I am wealthy
I am rich, I am that bitch (I am, I am)
I am gonna go get that bag (I am)
And I am not gonna take your shit
I am protected, well respected
I'm a queen, I'm a dream (I am, I am)
I do what I wanna do
And I'm who I wanna be 'cause I am me

I am me
One on one, can't compete, mmh
I like green
Money stay high like trees, mmh
I can't see
Wanna be just like me, hmm?
Eye candy
But you better not think shit's sweet, mmh
Yeah, I got your bitch, yeah, yeah
I get them big bags, yeah
Count it and flip, that, yeah
Look how the whip mash, yeah
Convertible top do carthweels
Booty so soft, it's all real
'Cause I'm eating real good like Garfield
I ain't stunting, you dust, got long bills

I don't need no one, I'm independent on my own
I get that money and I can spend it 'cause it's long
Everything on me, no, it's not rented, bitch, I own
I know you see it, ain't gotta tell me 'cause I know

I am healthy, I am wealthy
I am rich, I am that bitch (I am, I am)
I am gonna go get that bag (I am)
And I am not gonna take your shit
I am protected, well respected
I'm a queen, I'm a dream (I am, I am)
I do what I wanna do
And I'm who I wanna be 'cause I am me (Flo Milli shit)

I am healthy, I am happy
Just be my man, you ain't my daddy (no)
If I want it, I make it happen (I do)
It's gon' get done, bitch, ain't no asking (no)
I get bands, but this ain't magic (yeah, ha)
I set trends, it's just a habit
Independent and I'm classy (yeah)
I got everything she lacking
I do what I wanna do, fuck your rules (yeah, what?)
Don't need the hate, my back's to you (yeah)
You can keep your man, I'm cool (Flo Milli shit)
I'm too focused to tell the truth (wow)
When I count up them hundreds, they blue (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm the shit on the internet too (ho)
Spooking these bitches like boo, oops (what?)
I manifested a new coupe (yeah)
I know I'm youn, but I get that money like I'm grown (money)
Look out for my mama and all my family back at home
Came up from napkins, now I get money from rapping
I get the front and the backend (hey)
My life is a caption (Haha)
My Beammer and Bentley is matching (um)
I write this shit off my taxes (yeah)

I am healthy, I am wealthy
I am rich, I am that bitch (I am, I am)
I am gonna go get that bag (I am)
And I am not gonna take your shit
I am protected, well respected
I'm a queen, I'm a dream (I am, I am)
I do what I wanna do
And I'm who I wanna be
'Cause I am me, yeah

Look in that mirror (look in that mirror)
Tell yourself everything that you wanna hear (what you wanna hear?)
Tell yourself that you that bitch and make that clear (make that shit clear)
Never stressing, never lacking, got no fears (ain't got no fears)
