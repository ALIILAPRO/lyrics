		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You terrify me
'Cause you're a man, you're not a boy
You got some power
And I can't treat you like a toy
You're the road less
Travelled by a little girl
You disregard the mess while I try to control the world
Don't leave me, stay here and frighten me
Don't leave me, come now enlighten me
Give me all you got
Give me your wallet and your watch
Give me your first-born
Give me the rainbow and the

So go and challenge me
Take the reins and see
Watch me squirm baby
But you are just what I need

And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Oh I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game

You terrify me
We've still not kissed and yet I've cried
You got too close and
I pushed and pushed hoping you'd bite
So I could run, run
And that I did but through the dust
You saw those teeth marks
They weren't all yours, you had been thrust into a history
That had not worked for me, into a history
From which I could not flee
So go on shake me
Shake until I give it up, wearing me down baby
I know that we could make some love

So go and challenge me
Take the reins and see
Watch me squirm baby
But you are just what I need

And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game

And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game

Oh I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game
