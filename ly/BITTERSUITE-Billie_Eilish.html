		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't fall in love with you

I've been overseas
I've been havin' dreams
You were in the foyer
I was on my knees
Outside of my body
Watchin' from above
I see the way you want me
I wanna be the one

But I gotta be careful
Gotta watch what I say
God, I hope it all goes away

'Cause I can't fall in love with you
No matter how bad I want to

I don't need to breathe when you look at me, all I see is green
And I think that we're in between everything I've seen
In my dream, have it once a week, can't land on my feet
Can't sleep, have you underneath all of my beliefs
Keep it brief
I'll wait in the suite
Keep me off my feet, mm

You seem so paranoid
I'm looking at the boys
I've never filled the void
Out of spite
You seem so paralyzed
It's so romanticized
If this is how I die
That's alright

I've been overseas
I don't need to breathe when you look at me
All I see is green (I've been overseas)
And I think that we're in between everything I've seen
In my dream, have it once a week, can't land on my feet (I've been overseas)
Can't sleep, have you underneath all of my beliefs
Keep it brief
I'll see you in the suite
We can be discrete

But I've been overseas
And I've been havin' dreams
L'amour de ma vie
Love so bittersweet, mm
Open up the door for me, for me
'Cause I'm still on my knees
I'm stayin' off my feet

(Will you come with me?)
(I just want you to tell the truth)
(Come on, ha)
(I know it seems to just be the beginning)
(Listen up, hm)
(I want you to keep on doing it)
(It's something I don't know)
(I've never paid this much attention to you, ever)
