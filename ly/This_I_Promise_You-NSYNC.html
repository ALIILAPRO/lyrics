		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, Ooh 
When the visions around you 
Bring tears to your eyes 
And all that surrounds you 
Are secrets and lies 
I'll be your strength 
I'll give you hope 
Keeping your faith when it's gone 
The one you should call 
When standing here all alone 

And I will take you in my arms 
And hold you right where you belong 
Til' the day my life is through 
This I promise you 
This I promise you 

I've loved you forever 
In lifetimes before 
And I promise you never 
Will you hurt anymore 
I give you my word 
I give you my heart 
This is a battle we've won 
And with this vow 
Forever has now begun 

Just close your eyes (close your eyes) 
Each loving day (each loving day) 
And know this feeling won't go away (no) 
Til' the day my life is through 
This I promise you 
This I promise you 

Over and over I thought 
When I hear you call 
Without you in my life, baby 
I just wouldn't be living at all 

And I will take you in my arms (I will take you in my arms) 
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong) 
Til' the day my life is through 
This I promise you, babe 

Just close your eyes each loving day (each loving day) 
And know this feeling won't go away (no) 
Every word I say is true 
This I promise you 

Every word I say is true 
This I promise you 
Ooh, I promise you
