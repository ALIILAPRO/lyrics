		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  네 입가를 스치는 그 말은
내게로 다가오지 않길
그저 지나가 주길

영원을 약속하던 널
널 바라는 나의 모습
이기적인 걸까 난

아직 못다 한 말이 너무나 많은데
이젠 알아
너를 아프게 했던 모든 순간들이 다

I was wrong, I was wrong
멀어져만 가는 너
I was wrong, I was wrong
곁에 남아주길
Ooh ooh
I was wrong, I was wrong
모든 순간들이

내 눈가에 비친 네 모습이
마지막 모습이진 않길
바래도 되는 걸까

네게 준거라곤 모두 상처뿐이었는데
이젠 알아
너를 힘들게 했던 모든 순간들이 다

I was wrong, I was wrong
멀어져만 가는 너
I was wrong, I was wrong
곁에 남아주길
Ooh ooh
I was wrong, I was wrong

눈물로 번져가는 네게
줄 수 있는 거라곤
미안한 맘뿐이라서
못된 내 맘은
이제서야 널 찾아

I was wrong, I was wrong
멀어져만 가는 너
I was wrong, I was wrong
곁에 남아주길
Ooh ooh
I was wrong, I was wrong
모든 순간들이
