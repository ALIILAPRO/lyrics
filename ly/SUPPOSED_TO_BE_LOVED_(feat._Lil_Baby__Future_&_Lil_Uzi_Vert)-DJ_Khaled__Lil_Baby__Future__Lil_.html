We The Best Music (P.Y.T.)

Yeah, we got Khaled, the billi', Mr. Billi', yeah
DJ Khaled

I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved)
She know I'm a thug, she don't treat me like no rapper
See you comin' up, I can make that shit faster
Smooth operator, I ain't tryna be no bastard (smooth operator)
Yeah, I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (tryna love you like you 'posed to be)
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
Tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved

Hangin' on my jersey 'til bitches come through dinner
I know she the one, I get that middle school feelin'
Did some wrong, but overall, you know I'm still the real one
So I'ma still be around when you get done hittin'
Bought a Birkin bag to butter her up
We had sex inside the Cullinan truck, it felt amazin'
Mainstream, I had in New York, we playin' it crazy
4 AM, but so many lights, it look like day time
If somebody happen to catch us, it's gon' bring headlines
I can't get caught on the side of the road
But it turns me on takin' chances, you bold
Here I go

I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved)
She know I'm a thug, she don't treat me like no rapper
See you comin' up, I can make that shit faster
Smooth operator, I ain't tryna be no bastard (smooth operator)
Yeah, I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (tryna love you like you 'posed to be)
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
Tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved

I try my best shit to put the bag up on you
I put Bulgari on you, I went and splashed on you
I try my all to put my all into you
I put my winnings on you, I put one call into you
Anytime she pop out, she poppin' her big one
It ain't no confusion, she fucked on a lit one (Pluto)
Anytime I got bored, I just turnt up and picked one (turn up)
I'm talkin' billions on islands like Gilligan (yeah, yeah, let's go)
I was treatin' you daily, for surely familiar (oh, yeah)
Custom your wardrobe, your crib, new interior (yeah, let's go)
I been thinkin' highly of you, that's imperial (yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Thought I wasn't fallin' for you, I'm delirious (Plutoski)

I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved)
She know I'm a thug, she don't treat me like no rapper
See you comin' up, I can make that shit faster
Smooth operator, I ain't tryna be no bastard (smooth operator)
Yeah, I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (tryna love you like you 'posed to be)
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
Tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved

See, even though I'm rich, I still sit back, just in my room (whoa)
Starin' at the stars, lookin' at the moon
She must think I'm sweet but I be movin' with the goons (yeah)
I went number one but you still make me feel like two (yeah, huh?)
See, I give it all (all)
Give it all back, even includin' my jewels (hey)
Know she think I'm rude, mama like my attitude (attitude)
Love you so much, got your name tattooed (yeah)
Talkin' 'bout my songs, on the chart, they climb (huh?)
But I never saw a girl really that fine (yeah)
How you even cute when you stressed out, cryin'? (Cryin')
Everything you do, it blows my mind (Lil Uzi)

I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved)
She know I'm a thug, she don't treat me like no rapper
See you comin' up, I can make that shit faster
Smooth operator, I ain't tryna be no bastard (smooth operator)
Yeah, I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved (tryna love you like you 'posed to be)
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
Tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved

Give it to me
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
Baby girl, just give it to me
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
Girl, give it to me
Woo, I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
Baby girl, just give it to me
I'm tryna love you like you 'posed to be loved
