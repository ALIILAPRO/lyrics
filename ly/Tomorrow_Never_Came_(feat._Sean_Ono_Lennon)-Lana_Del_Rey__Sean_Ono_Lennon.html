		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, what you doing?
Not a lot
Shaking and moving
At my local spot
Baby don't asky me why
Don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

Lay Lady Lay
On that side of paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way
You'd would always stay
And I'll be your tiny dancer, honey

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me out there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Hey, what you thinking?
Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinking
On that old jukebox
But don't ask me why
Just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

Stay, baby stay
On the side of paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way
You'd would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me out there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Roses are in your country house
We play guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like some day and I
I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio
To our favourite song
Lennon and Yoko
We will play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said
Now that I'm singing with Sean
Whoa-oh

I could keep waiting for you
In that spot we'd always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, in the pouring rain
Honey don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you loved me like no tomorrow
Guess tomorrow never came, no, no, no
Tomorrow never came, no, no
Tomorrow never came, no, no, no
Tomorrow never came
