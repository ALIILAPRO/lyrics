		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This could be a good night for good times
And you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?

This could be a good night for good times
And you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?

Do you think you're better off alone?
I think you better come along
Can you make me feel better?

This could be a good night for good times
And you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?

Do you think you're better off alone?
I think you better come along
So if you think you're better off alone
I think you better come along
Can you make me feel better?

This could be a good night for good times
And you look like a good time
We're dancing to Dancing in the Moonlight
Now I want you bad
Can you make me feel better?

Do you think you're better off alone? 
(Alone, alone, alone, alone?)
I think you better come along 
(Along, along, along, along)
