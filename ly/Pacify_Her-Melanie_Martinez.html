		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girl's hand
That basic bitch leaves finally
Now I can take her man

Someone told me stay away from things that aren't yours
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves 
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words 

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words 

I can't stand her whining
Where's her binky now?
And loving her seems tiring
So boy, just love me, down, down, down

Someone told me stay away from things that aren't yours
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words 

Words, words, words
Words, words, words, words, words
Words, words, words, words
Words, words
Words, words, words, words
Words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Words, words, words
Words, words, words, words, words
Words, words, words, words
Words, words
Words, words, words, words
