		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lucifer, whispering
Silently into your mind
Who walks behind
Who walks behind
Standing tall, invincible
But do not forget your knives
To save your lives
To save your lives

Don't you forget about dying
Don't you forget about your friend death
Don't you forget that you will die

Don't you vomit savage slurs
Spewed up wickedly
To hide from me
To hide from me
Navigate all alone
On this tempestuous sea
To ride with me
To ride with me

Don't you forget about dying
Don't you forget about your friend death
Don't you forget that you will die
Don't you forget about dying
Don't you forget about your friend death
Don't you forget that you will die

Lucifer, whispering
Silently into your mind
Who walks behind
Who walks behind
Had you had the chance today
You would've sold out too
Ain't that right
Sweet Saint Peter?

Don't you forget about dying
Don't you forget about your friend death
Don't you forget that you will die
Don't you forget about dying
Don't you forget about your friend death
Don't you forget that you will die

Don't you forget about dying
Don't you forget about your friend death
Don't you forget that you will die
Don't you forget about dying
Don't you forget about your friend death
Don't you forget that you will die
