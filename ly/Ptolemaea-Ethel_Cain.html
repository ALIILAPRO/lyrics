		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I followed you in
I was with you there
I invited you in
Twice, I did
You love blood too much
But not like I do
Not like I do

Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, love you, gave you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, felt you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

(You'd do well to say yes to me)

Suffer does the wolf, crawling to thee
Promising a big fire, any fire
Saying I'm the one, he's gonna take me
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Suffering is nigh, drawing to me
Calling me the one, I'm the white light
Beautiful, finite

Even the iron still fears the rot
Hiding from something I cannot stop
Walking on shadows, I can't lead him back
Buckled on the floor when night comes along
Daddy's left and mama won't come home

You poor thing
Sweet, mourning lamb
There's nothing you can do
It's already been done

What fear a man like you brings upon (show me your face)
A woman like me
Please don't look at me
I can see it in your eyes
He keeps looking at me
Tell me, what have you done?
Stop, stop, stop, make it stop, stop
Make it stop (make it stop)
Make it stop, I've had enough
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop

I am the face of love's rage
I am the face of love's rage

Blessed be the Daughters of Cain
Bound to suffering eternal through the sins of their fathers
Committed long before their conception
Blessed be their whore mothers
Tired and angry waiting with bated breath
In a ferry that will never move again
Blessed be the children, each and every one come to know their god
Through some senseless act of violence
Blessed be you, girl
Promised to me by a man
Who can only feel hatred and contempt towards you
I am no good nor evil, simply I am
And I have come to take what is mine
I was there in the dark when you spilled your first blood
I am here now as you run from me still
Run then, child
You can't hide from me forever
