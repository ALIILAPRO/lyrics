		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your face ignites a fuse to my patience
Whatever you do is gonna be wrong
There's no time to interrupt the detonation
Be good to me before you're gone
When I met you I was fine with my nothing
I grew with you and now I've changed
What I've become is something I can't be without your loving
Be good to me, it isn't a game

Now let me see, it's you and me, forgive a good God
How do you suppose that we've survived?
Come on, that's right, left, right
Make light of all the heavier
'Cause you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

When you resist me, hon, I cease to exist
Because I only like the way I look, when I look into your eyes
And when you come back
You command me like the penetration of the sun
Into the deep dark sky

Now let me see, it's you and me, forgive a good God
How do you suppose that we'll survive?
Come on, that's right, left, right
Make light of all the heavier
'Cause you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

Started, started off, started off
Started off, started off, started off, baby
Started off, started off, started off, now
Started off, started off, started off, baby
Started off, started off, started, started
Started, started

You and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

Started, started off, started off
Started off, started off, started off, baby
Started off, started off, started off, now
Started off, started off, started off, baby
Started off, started off, started, started
Started, started
Started off, started off, started off, baby
Started off, started off, started off, now
Started off, started off, started off, baby
Started off, started off, started, started
Started

And I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
