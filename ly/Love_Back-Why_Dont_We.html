		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still got your halo hanging on the corner of my bed
But when I looked closer, that shit was cracked, yeah
You still got your fingerprints left all over my heart
The same way you would leave your lipstick on my glass

Showed you what heaven could taste like
Put it on my tab
Gave you my money and my time
You can keep all that, all that

Baby, I just want my love back
I'd love to love someone new
But I gave it all to you
(My love, my love, my)
Honey, I just want my love back
If you're not gonna be the one
At least give me back my love

My love, my love, my love back
My love, my love, my love back

Took my favorite part of me
And held it so far out of reach
Nine months you've been gone, I'm still attached
Poured my heart out, filled your cup
Maybe I just cared too much
'Cause I know I'm the best you'll ever have

I showed you what heaven could taste like
Put it on my tab (put it on my tab)
Gave you my money and my time
You can keep all that

Baby, I just want my love back
I'd love to love someone new
But I gave it all to you
My love, my love, my (all to you, babe)
Honey, I just want my love back
If you're not gonna be the one
At least give me back my love
My love, my love, my love back

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na (oh-oh)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (uh)
My love, my love, my love back
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
If you're not gonna be the one
At least give me back my love
My love, my love, my love back

Give me my love back
I still got your halo hanging on the corner of my bed
But when I looked closer, that shit was cracked
Whoa

Baby, I just want my love back
I'd love to love someone new
But I gave it all to you (you)
My love, my love, my
Honey, I just want my love back (oh-ho)
If you're not gonna be the one
At least give me back my love
My love, my love, my love back

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (no)
Na-na, na-na-na-na (give me my love back, oh no)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
My love, my love, my love (give me, give me all my love)
Honey, I just want my love back
If you're not gonna be the one
At least give me back my love
My love, my love, my love back
