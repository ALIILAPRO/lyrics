		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

Damage
Lined up
Wreckage left behind us
How'd we get stuck?
Now I'm what you're bored of

Now you walk through me
With my heart heavy
Breaking my reverie
I could die early
With your arms 'round me
Habits go slowly
Would it not kill to say goodbye?

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

Pieces broken
All we left unspoken
Aimless hoping
Left my mouth wide open

It's kinda funny when it goes from all to nothing
You have to laugh before you start to cry
'Cause now I stop myself from holding onto something
That makes me feel a little less alive

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to
You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to
You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

Now you walk through me
With my heart heavy
Breaking my reverie
I could die early
With your arms 'round me
Habits go slowly
Would it not kill to say goodbye?

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?
When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

Will you cry if I let go?
Will you cry if I let go?
Will you cry if I let go?
Will you cry if I let go?
