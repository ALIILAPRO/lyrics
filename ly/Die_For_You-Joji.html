		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swear I couldn't sleep a wink last night
No point in turnin' off the lights
Not the same without your head on my shoulders
Growin' pains, but I don't wanna get older
Almost like we left it all on read
Couple feelings never laid to rest
Didn't know that the party was over
And it's true that I need you here closer

Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin (another skin)

I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true
(I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you

I hope you're getting everything you needed (needed)
Found the puzzle piece and feel completed (completed)
Just wanted you to know every reason
Hope you really know that I mean that
I couldn't see
The forest from the trees
Only time we speak
Is in my dreams

Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin (another skin)

I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true
(I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you
