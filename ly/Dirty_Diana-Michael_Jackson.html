		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh no)
(Oh no, no)

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She said, "That's okay
Hey baby do as you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back"
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She said, "That's okay
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star?

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana-iana-iana, c'mon

(No, no)

She said, "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
Now I hate sleppin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon

C'mon (hey baby, won't you? Hey baby, won't you?)
C'mon (hey baby, won't you? Hey baby, won't you?)
C'mon (hey baby, won't you? Hey baby, won't you?)
C'mon (hey baby, won't you?)

C'mon (ow)
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
