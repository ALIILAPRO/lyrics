		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another shooting in a supermarket
I spent my money on a bloody, soft target
Playing with my matches and I'm lighting Colorado
I got my scratcher and I'm gonna win the lotto

Congratulations best of luck and blessings
We're all together and we're living in the '20s
Salutations on another era
My condolences
Ain't that a kick in the head?

I got a buzz like a murder hornet
I drink my media and turn it into vomit
I got a robot and I'm fucking it senseless
It comes with batteries and only speaks in English

Congratulations best of luck and blessings
We're all together and we're living in the '20s
Salutations on another era
My condolences
Ain't that a kick in the head?

Ain't that a kick in the head?

Congratulations best of luck and blessings
We're all together and we're living in the '20s
Salutations on another era
My condolences
Ain't that a kick in the head?
Ain't that a kick in your head?
