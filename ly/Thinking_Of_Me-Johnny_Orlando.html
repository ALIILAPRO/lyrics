		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I couldn't tell you why
But I thought about you last night
First time in a long time
I really never cry
Over you and I
But I'm staring at the moon
Are you staring at it too?

I got a book of mental pictures
I look through sometimes but it hurts
Damn I miss the days when you were mine
Can't turn back time trust me I've tried

I know that we weren't meant to be
But you left finger prints on my memories
Yeah I hope you're living your dream
And this life has become what you thought it'd be
But now and then I hope
You're thinking of me

Swear wish that I was there
The day you turned 21
Did you split a bottle with someone
You said this is for the best
Maybe you were right about that
Or maybe you were wrong
And we'll find our way back

I got a book of mental pictures
I look through sometimes but it hurts
Damn I miss the days when you were mine
Can't turn back time trust me I've tried

I know that we weren't meant to be
But you left finger prints on my memories
Yeah I hope you're living your dream
And this life has become what you thought it'd be
But now and then I hope
You're thinking of me
