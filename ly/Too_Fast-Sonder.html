		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People say I drive too fast, move too fast, live too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast for me
People say I drive too fast, move too fast, live too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast for me

Living at the speed of light, like a bullet
I could be dead by the morning
I can't call it
So I ain't got no time to wait (wait) it out
I've been down and out for too long
And I ain't got too many options

People say I drive too fast, move too fast, live too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast for me
People say I drive too fast, move too fast, live too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast for me

Still alive but if my heart broke
I could be dead by tomorrow
He's got eyes on me
He'll take me soon
He's making room
Always hated lines
I ain't got much to lose

People say I drive too fast, move too fast, live too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast for me (too fast)
People say I drive too fast, move too fast, live too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast for me

Living at the speed of light
It's hard to follow
I could be dead by tomorrow
Trying to face it
So I ain't got time to wait it out
I've been down and out for too long
(No such thing as too fast for me)
(No such thing as too fast for me)

I called on you, you were needed
You went MIA today and I ain't see ya
I thought of you, while I was working
I'm too proud to look for you
I hope you're hurting

Tell me what I got to prove
(While I was working)
I don't mean nothing to you
(I hope you're hurting)
You ain't got nothing to say
(While I was working)
You're too good at walking away
(I hope you're hurting)
