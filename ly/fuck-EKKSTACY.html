		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aw, man
Aw, man, fuck
Aw, man
Aw, man, fuck

Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Yeah
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck

I'm burning buildings
Sharpen my knife
You hate your girlfriend
All you do is fight
Nobody wants her
That bitch is out all night
She wants to fuck
Do you want to cry?
I'm sick of everything
You hate your life
She's tired of breathing
He wants to die
And we all kill the same
You know I'm right
I'm sick of everything
You hate your life

You're fucking boring
I need to go
Sometimes I wonder
If you even know
That I hate myself too
Does it show?
He doesn't want you
If he takes it slow
Killing myself to make a scene
Empty the whole magazine
You made it hard for me
Now you can watch me bleed

Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Yeah
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
