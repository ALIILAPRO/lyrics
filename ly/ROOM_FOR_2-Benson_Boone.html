		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At your deepest lows
When you hit the ground again
And you feel alone
All you know is emptiness
When you're walking circles
And there's no end
And your feet are tied
Tryna catch your breath again

I'll be right there with you every step

When the world don't feel like home
I'm a place to call your own
You can stay forever through
When you're barely holding on
I'll be anything you want
Open up my heart for you
Baby, I got room for two

Every day, I fall
For another part of you
And the nights get cold
Whenever I'm too far from you
With every breath you take from my chest
Try to understand

I'm always right there with you every step

When the world don't feel like home
I'm a place to call your own
You can stay forever through, oh
When you're barely holding on
I'll be anything you want
Open up my heart for you
Baby, I got room for two

I can be all you need
Darling, you can take it
All of me, all of me

When you're barely holding on
I'll be anything you want
Open up my heart for you
Baby, I got room for two
