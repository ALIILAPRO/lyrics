		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah
Come on

You get the limo out front (oh-whoa)
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you, but no one ever discovers
In some ways, you're just like all your friends
But on stage, you're a star

You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds, yeah

You go to movie premiers (is that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on the radio (oh-whoa)
Livin' two lives is a little weird, yeah
But school's cool 'cause nobody knows
Yeah, you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar

You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best of both 
You know the best of both worlds

Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best part is that
You get to be whoever you wanna be

(Best, best) Yeah, the the best of both
(Best, best) You got the best of both
(Best, best) Come on, the best of both

Who would've thought that a girl like me
Would double as a super star?

You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best

You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere
You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together, oh yeah
It's so much better
'Cause you know you got
The best of both worlds
