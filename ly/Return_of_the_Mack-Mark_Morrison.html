		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh-oh, come on, oh yeah

Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again and show you that I'm real

(You lied to me) all those times I said that I loved you
(You lied to me) yes, I tried, yes, I tried
(You lied to me) even though you know I'd die for you
(You lied to me) yes, I cried, yes, I cried

(Return of the Mack) there it is
(Return of the Mack) come on
(Return of the Mack) oh my God
(You know that I'll be back) here I am
(Return of the Mack) once again
(Return of the Mack) top of the world
(Return of the Mack) watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) here I go

So I'm back up in the game (hustlin' snow)
Running things to keep my swing (all night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did, you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh, oh, oh)
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song

(You lied to me) 'cause she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) but you did, but you did
(You lied to me) all this pain you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) but I do, but I do, do, do

(Return of the Mack) there it is
(Return of the Mack) hold on
(Return of the Mack) don't you know?
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
(Return of the Mack) oh, little girl
(Return of the Mack) once my pearl
(Return of the Mack) up and down
(You know that I'll be back) round and round

Uh, Mark stop lying about your big break

(You lied to me) 'cause she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) but you did, but you did
(You lied to me) all this pain you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) but I do, but I do, do, do

(Return of the Mack) there it is
(Return of the Mack) come on
(Return of the Mack) oh my god
(You know that I'll be back) here I am
(Return of the Mack) once again
(Return of the Mack) top of the world
(Return of the Mack) watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) don't you know?

(Return of the Mack) there it is
(Return of the Mack) hold on
(Return of the Mack) be strong
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
(Return of the Mack) my little girl
(Return of the Mack) once my pearl
(Return of the Mack) up and down
