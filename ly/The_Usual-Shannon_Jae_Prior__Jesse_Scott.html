		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Footsteps through the back door
I can hear them run
This is not for everyone
But you asked for it
Flows like a golden shore
Yeah, I can feel the burn
You kill me with your words
Guess I asked for it
I don't deserve the blame
My heart don't work that way
The roads that we roll down don't slow down for no one
But you asked for it
I won't abuse the pain
My heart's intoxicated, my mind's frustrated
A storm like a hurricane, all we do is go
Up, going up, go down
Go around, this is us, the usual
Wanderlust running blind
Time is never on our side
The usual
When dark becomes light
The broken will rise
The usual
Up, up, going up, go down
Go around, this is us, the usual
Voices in the hallways
Silent whispers fill the room
Conversate with me and you
Guess we asked for it
Smoke building in our lungs
Yeah, we just let it burn
That's when all of our memories turn
Hey, we asked for it
I don't deserve the blame
My heart don't work that way
The roads that we roll down don't slow down for no one
But you asked for it
I won't abuse the pain
My heart's intoxicated, my mind's frustrated
A storm like a hurricane, all we do is go
Up, going up, go down
Go around, this is us, the usual
Wanderlust running blind
Time is never on our side
The usual
When dark becomes light
The broken will rise
The usual
Up, up, going up, go down
Go around, this is us, the usual
Running in circles, receiving no light
I don't wanna hurt you but this ain't no life
We walk a tight line, these tight ropes find our feet and we keep
Running, running, running
All we do is go
Up, going up, go down
Go around, this is us, the usual
Wanderlust running blind
Time is never on our side
The usual
When dark becomes light
The broken will rise
The usual
Up, up, going up, go down
Go around, this is us, the usual
But you asked for it
(The usual)
(The usual) up, up, going up, go down
Go around, this is us, the usual
