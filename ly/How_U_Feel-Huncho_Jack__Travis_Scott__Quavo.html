		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Feel how you feel (woo), feel how you feel (woo)
Fill up your cup (fill it) then tell me how you feel (yeah)
Pill after pill (pill), pill after pill (pill)
Wop after wop (wassup), pop after pop (pop)
Movie, make a film (movie), film after film (movie)
Got bills and they clean (clean), run through the machine ('chine)
Got drink and it's raw (drank), pints for the team (paints)
We don't have to talk (nah), they gon' go for me (go)

Pull at the bank (skrt) then fill up the backseat (woo)
Fill up the vault (vault) then fill it up with keys (hey)
Grip on the Glock (grip), control the block (grip)
Flood the whole box (flood) with nothin' but rocks (fuck)
Used to trap dem Knicks (trap), now I got them P's (P's!)
Stand on my two feet (woo), run from the police (twelve)
Nigga, this the streets (ayy), you know you can bleed (woo)
Gotta pay your dues (pay 'em) unless pay your fees (pay 'em)
Walk in my place (mansion), feel outer space (yeah)
International tastes (whoa), I like all races (yeah)
Click after click (click), bit and she slick (slip)
She gon' get this dick (dick), go back to choppin' a brick (choppin' a brick)
Swipin' Fours (swipe), this that squad goals though (swipe, swipe)
Trap in Volvos (woo) just to buy a Lambo' (skrrt, skrrt), call my bros up (hey)
Call my bros up, call my call my woes up (brr), whoa, whippin' the dope up (whip)
Dat way, Subway cold cut (dat way), yeah

Pill after pill (pill), pill after pill (pill)
Wop after wop (wassup), pop after pop (pop)
Movie, make a film (movie), film after film (seen it)

Got drink and it's raw (drank), pints for the team (team)
We don't have to talk (naw), they gon' go for me (go)

Pour one for P (yeah), lean, no Hennessy (it's lit)
Crib in the trees, trap-house of the bees (alright)
Tell me how you feel, Nike boys for real (yah)

Forrest Gump (ooo), yeah, run it up (ooo), yeah, mega trunks (yah)
Yeah, I'm whining, you look fine, yeah (lit)
Speed through the light, yeah, pop one while I drive, yah (alright) 
Cougar, 45, fuck her 'til she died (it's lit), my way outlandish (oh-oh)
We walk on marble, not granite (oh-oh), you see the stars and the planets (oh-oh)
Diamonds shining, give me damage (oh-oh), yeah, make it clap at will (alright)
That's how you feel (straight up), oh, for real (yeah)
Feel how you feel, yeah

Feel how you feel (ooo), feel how you feel (ooo)
Fill up your cup (fill it) then tell me how you feel (hey)

Wop after wop (wassup), pop after pop (pop)
Movie, make a film (movie), film after film (seen it)
Got bills and they clean (clean), run through the machine (machine)
Got drink and it's raw (drank), pints for the team (team)
We don't have to talk (naw), they gon' go for me (go)
