		  (Magic, moments)
(When two hearts are caring)
(Magic, moments)
(Memories we've been sharing)

I'm making a brick, I got me a chick, she drivin' me crazy
And now that I'm rich and now I'm the shit, she wanna have babies
I ain't gonna lie, I won't even try, I'm whippin' Mercedes
Or fuck it a Bentley, I'm with my ho, Wendy, yeah, that is my lady

Ayy, you all out of luck, I'm spitting my game, I think yo bitch want me
Yeah, come over to fuck and we run a train like we playing zombies
Ayy, she thinks I'm the best, I'ma flex on my ex
And these hoes lemme fuck 'cause I'm coming up next
I got coin in my chest, I finesse her for neck
And I count up a check, and a check, and a check
Cash go fast
Spend it on Wendy 'cause she throw it back, huh
I'm first, ayy, you last
I do the dash and I feel like The Flash
I got me a brand new bag
Bitch I ain't bluffing I stuff it with racks
Ayy, I make a wish like cancer kids
To get your bitch to kiss my dick (ayy)

I'm making a brick, I got me a chick, she drivin' me crazy
And now that I'm rich and now I'm the shit, she wanna have babies
I ain't gonna lie, I won't even try, I'm whippin' Mercedes
Or fuck it a Bentley, I'm with my ho, Wendy, yeah, that is my lady
I'm making a brick, I got me a chick, she drivin' me crazy
And now that I'm rich and now I'm the shit, she wanna have babies
I ain't gonna lie, I won't even try, I'm whippin' Mercedes
Or fuck it a Bentley, I'm with my ho, Wendy, yeah, that is my lady

There ain't nobody that is better than me
You can look if you need but there's nothing to see
If I want, I'ma cheat, I got hoes on their knees
And I fuck 'em for free while I count up these G's
And if she not a ho, she gon' count up my dough
She gon' grab on my dick like she rowing a boat
And my chick centerfold but the bitch getting old
So I kick it with Wendy and she get the gold
Ooh, I smashed
I'm 'boutta turn Wendy into a mama
I got her a brand new Jag'
I hit the gas and you can't see the bottom
These bitches they used to lag
Now I fuck hoes and I don't got a condom
My shirt got a brand new tag
'Cause now every check that I get got a comma (hey, yeah)

I'm making a brick, I got me a chick, she drivin' me crazy
And now that I'm rich and now I'm the shit, she wanna have babies
I ain't gonna lie, I won't even try, I'm whippin' Mercedes
Or fuck it a Bentley, I'm with my ho, Wendy, yeah, that is my lady
