		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Bout to catch another flight (yeah)
The apple bottom make 'em wanna bite (yeah)
I just wanna have a good night
I just wanna have a good night
If you don't know now you know
If he broke then you gotta let him go
You could have anybody, eeny, miny, moe
'Cause when you a boss, you could do what you want

Yeah
'Cause girls is players too, uh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girls is players too (hold up)
Yeah
'Cause girls is players too

I go, on and on and on again
He blowin' up my phone but I'm ignorin' him
He thinkin' he the one, I got like four of him
Yeah, I'm sittin' first class like valedictorian, uh
Came a long way from rag to riches
Five-star b-, yeah, I taste so delicious
Let him lick the plate, yeah, I make him do the dishes
Now he on news talk 'cause a b- went missin'

'Bout to catch another flight (yeah)
The apple bottom make 'em wanna bite (yeah)
I just wanna have a good night
I just wanna have a good night (keep it player, baby)
If you don't know now you know
If he broke then you gotta let him go
You could have anybody, eeny, miny, moe
'Cause when you a boss, you could do what you want (keep it player, baby)

Yeah
'Cause girls is players too, uh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girls is players too (keep it player, baby)
Yeah
'Cause girls is players too, uh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girls is players too

'Cause girls is players too (hold up)

Yeah
'Cause girls is players too (keep it player, baby)
