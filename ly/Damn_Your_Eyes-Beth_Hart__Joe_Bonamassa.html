		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can do what I want
I'm in complete control
That's what I tell myself
I got a mind of my own
I'll be alright alone
Don't need anybody else

I give myself a good talking to
No more being a fool for you
But when I see you, it's all I remember
How you made wanna surrender

Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes

It's always the same
You say that you'll change
Somehow you never do
I believe all your lies
That look in your eyes
You make it all seem true

I guess I see what I wanna see
I think it's my heart that's deceiving me
'Cause with that look I know so well
I fall completely under your spell

Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making fall in love again
Damn your eyes

You keep leaving me, deceiving me
Making me see what I wanna see
'Cause with that look I know so well
I fall completely under your spell

Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes

Damn your eyes
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
Damn your eyes, damn your eyes
Damn your eyes, eyes, eyes

Damn, damn your eyes
