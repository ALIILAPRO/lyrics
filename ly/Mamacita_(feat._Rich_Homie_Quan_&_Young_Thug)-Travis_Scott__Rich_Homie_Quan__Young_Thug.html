		  Mamacita, cita, cita (oh, oh oh)
Mamacita, cita, cita (oh, oh oh)

This the last days to the rodeo, last night
Had me down in the back, comatose, don't think
Sun shades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself, myself, myself
Mamacita, cita, cita
You know I really need yah
Need yah, need yah, right now
She get freaky when the, light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the night gown
Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town
Got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it
3-D money, no illusion
Pendant if I'm feelin' bougie
Might hit your line bitch

Had to cut my phone off, bitch
Got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado
Smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad
Call her ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her (Really wanna meet her, wanna meet her)
Hey and I ain't kin to Wayne but there my mamacita, hey (Mamacita mamacita wha' what)

Mamacita, mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my

Mothafuckin' girl, I love her
I'ma give her the world
Aye fuck her, I wanna fuck a mother
I just might give her my little girl
No, no I won't let go
Broke down oh
She love to dance with a fro
Natural, knat, that don't go down
Quan, turn on the stove
Whip it 'til I have a stroke
I do not fuck with America
I get it straight off the boat
Oh damn
The kush it'll never makeme choke
Slow down
I'm speedin' and I got a trunk full of wham
Now, 25 thousand on an old school pound
Assess me, the bitches wanna molest me
Damn don't sex me, she a lesbi'
She want chicken like sesame
And she tryin' to address me, test me
Give her hotel keys like Cassidy, ya dig

Had to cut my phone off, bitch
Got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado
Smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad
Call her ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her (Really wanna meet her, wanna meet her)
Hey and I ain't kin to Wayne but there my mamacita, hey (Mamacita mamacita wha' what)

Mamacita, mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita

That's my
Bad little college ho
That I got on the east skirts of Decatur
Best believe that she cover Rich Homie Quan like a blazer
I smoke a lot of weed, keep my music turned up for my neighbors
I fuck a nigga bitch then turn her like a table
I'm still praying to senior so you know I'm gettin' greater (I swear to God)
Still wearin' long soccer shorts like Fabio
He was hatin' at first, now he tryna make the payroll
Got a stupid bitch who do whatever I say so
Money on my head like a Jesus piece
Blunt, now I'm higher than Khalifa be
Bad bitch lookin' like a Philippine
Ohh, you're killin' me, ooh
Remember me, you
Finna be
Deceased if you keep callin' me
Therefore I had to cut my phone off bi'
Got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado
Smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad
Call her ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her (Really wanna meet her, wanna meet her)
Hey and I ain't kin to Wayne but there my mamacita, hey (Mamacita mamacita wha' what)

Mamacita, mama, mama my mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my that's my mama, mamacita, that's my that's my mama, mamacita
