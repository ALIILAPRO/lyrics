		  Novacandy
Anesthesia
Adenosine, uh
And that's my favorite girl

No, I never felt anything better than this
You can tell by the look on my face
Nothin' lasts forever, so I look at my wrist
Dopamine overdose
No, I never felt anything better than this
I would give up my tongue for a taste
Even though I know it's catch-and-release
Dopamine overdose

Put on my old coat, and I found new drugs
Wanna thank young me for gettin' me fucked up
And a distant relative just bit the dust
Somehow I'm in the will for a million bucks
And baby, I just won a free fuckin' trip to Disneyland
I just got a second blue check on Instagram
Oh, and it feels so good tonight
Let's act like we're never gonna get it back

No, I never felt anything better than this
You can tell by the look on my face
Nothin' lasts forever, so I look at my wrist
Dopamine overdose
No, I never felt anything better than this
I would give up my tongue for a taste
Even though I know it's catch-and-release
Dopamine overdose

Big sigh, ooh, what a ride
It's for life, then I changed my mind
Penthouse, but I lost my room key
'Nother minute, 'nother problem, 'nother brewski
Yeah, you know, it's funny how it goes
When everything is nothing 'cause all I ever wanted was more
And it feels so good tonight
Let's act like we're never gonna get it back

No, I never felt anything better than this
You can tell by the look on my face
Nothin' lasts forever, so I look at my wrist
Dopamine overdose
No, I never felt anything better than this
I would give up my tongue for a taste
Even though I know it's catch-and-release
Dopamine overdose

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, overdose, mm
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, overdose
