		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three, six, nine, girls wanna drink wine
Tell the man not to waste your time
If the man broke, the man he a joke
So you gotta get loose with the Henny and the Coke

Three, two, one, girls wanna have fun
If the man don't dance, he's done
Tell him move on, get the man gone
Now can I get a Coke with my rum?

Three, six, nine, girls wanna drink wine
Tell the man not to waste your time
If the man broke, the man he a joke
So you gotta get loose with the Henny and the Coke

Three, two, one, girls wanna have fun
If the man don't dance, he's done
Tell him move on, get the man gone
Now can I get a Coke with my rum?

Three, six, nine, girls wanna drink wine
Tell the man not to waste your time
If the man broke, the man he a joke
So you gotta get loose with the Henny and the Coke

Three, two, one, girls wanna have fun
If the man don't dance, he's done
Tell him move on, get the man gone
Now can I get a Coke with my rum?

Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID

Ooh

Two, two, four, eight, some boys wanna hate
But you can't even contemplate
We all down, the best in town
So you gotta get lit to the champion sound

One, two, three, chicka fake ID
Shit, you can't even drink with me
You can't hang, you got no plan
So you gotta make room now for the next man

Three, six, nine, girls wanna drink wine
Tell the man not to waste your time
If the man broke, the man he a joke
So you gotta get loose with the Henny and the Coke

Three, two, one, girls wanna have fun
If the man don't dance, he's done
Tell him move on, get the man gone
Now can I get a coke with my rum?

Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID

Gotta get that bar
Gotta work real hard
Streets are your catwalk
Make your body talk that talk

Not to waste my time
If you see a broke man sign
If the man can't whine
You gotta get next in line

Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
Chicka f, chicka fake ID
