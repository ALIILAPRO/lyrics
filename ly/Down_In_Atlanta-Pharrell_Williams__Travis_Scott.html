		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down in Atlanta
Stayed at the Centerfold
Downstairs, my Aventador
You should've seen it
Down in Atlanta
At the Graveyard Tavern
You thought you seen a ghost
It's just where the Phantoms are
Shawty thicker than Kevlar (yeah)
It's wall to wall
Feel the heat through my drawers
I told shawty to bring the wave
You know life's a beach
She said, "Life's a bitch"
Let's hit Magic City

Watch 'em fly from the sky
While we line up the wall
Like confetti, how it falls
Let 'em leave with it all
We ain't never been this high
The city big, feelin' small
Keep me wake, never off
404 when you-

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Down in Atlanta
Might just slide through the zone
Not talkin' LeBron home
When I say I'm in Cleveland
Drown in my Fanta
Coke factory is my store
I mix it up how I pour
Gotta see how I drink it
Woke up feelin' like Fabo (yeah)
Need a Georgia peach
Never run outta love
Or run outta weed
Daddy drivin' a tractor
Like a Hellcat or Demon
Hit two eighty-five, dashin'
'Cause I'm lovin' the speed

Watch 'em fly from the sky (sky)
While we line up the wall
Like confetti, how it falls
Let 'em leave with it all
We ain't never been this high (high)
The city big, feelin' small
Keep me wake, never off
404 when you-

Watch 'em, watch 'em, fly, fly from the, from the sky

Down in Atlanta
Just like Havana
And gotta get it on, gotta get it on
Gotta get it on, gotta get it on
Call up Miami
Atlantic, Atlantis
That's how we get it on, how we get it on
How we get it on, how we get it on

Watch 'em fly from the sky (sky)
While we line up the wall
Like confetti, how it falls
Let 'em leave with it all
We ain't never been this high (high)
The city big, feelin' small
Keep me wake, never off
404 when you-
