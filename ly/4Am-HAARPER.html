		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will not breathe in the sea and
Freeze with the weak don't speak
I don't really wanna hear
Words from the sand from dirt not a man
Stay six feet deep do I make myself clear

Indebted to the knife no more
I've found my way beyond the shore
The credit that you've claimed
Washed away by retribution
Torn, 4AM in the den where your friends
I'ma blend
I'ma mend with the silhouette again

I pull up with the strap they
Hands up "wait a minute"
This ain't no clock I'll break yo jaw
And shape yo fate with rickets
I'm takin yo life the fight is
Over might just take some digit's
She in my phone my home while you gon grow
In the face of fission below the mud
I dirty the floor and rug
With the slug on the run
I've become new man how could I be
How could I leave all of the things
All the rings and the riches on land

I've taken new form new life
Mistaken by some fo the light
Serrating all the birds up high
Interfacing with blight
