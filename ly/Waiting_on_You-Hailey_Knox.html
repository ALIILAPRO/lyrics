		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the part we're both avoiding
I thought we had it all until the morning
You lead me on then I'm left disappointed
I'm waiting on you
You're waiting on me
I've been so cold
Spaced out
Think of you
More than you know
Probably think of me
In your backseat
Still missing me
So don't
Act like you don't care
When feelings are still there
I can't keep waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on you
Caught one too many of those bad vibrations
Your insecurities turned on me
If you don't mean what you say
Don't say it
One too many times let you slide
Three too many times why do I
Keep waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on
We've been on a detour way too long
Even when I'm with you don't know where you are
Whenever you play it off
I say a lot
Then you're gone
Why you gotta play it off
Like you're never wrong
This is the part we're both avoiding
I thought we had it all until the morning
You lead me on then I'm left disappointed
I'm waiting on you
You're waiting on me
I've been so cold
Spaced out
Think of you
More than you know
Probably think of me
In your backseat
Still missing me
So don't
Act like you don't care
When feelings are still there
I can't keep waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on
Everyday you're with a new bitch
Do you really think I'm deaf, dumb, and clueless
You love your fancy cars
And boujee broads
You say you love me
Only when your feeling lonely
Left and you throw fits
Damn I'm glad I never took you up
And moved in
It's like your alter personality tagged in
And the other you I feel for vanished
We've been on a detour way too long
Even when I'm with you don't know where you are
Whenever you play it off
I say a lot
Then you're gone
Why you gotta play it off
Like you're never wrong
This is the part we're both avoiding
I thought we had it all until the morning
You lead me on then I'm left disappointed
I'm waiting on you
You're waiting on me
I've been so cold
Spaced out
Think of you
More than you know
Probably think of me
In your backseat
Still missing me
So don't
Act like you don't care
When feelings are still there
I can't keep waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on you
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
Waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on you
Waiting on you
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
Waiting on you
Waiting on you
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
