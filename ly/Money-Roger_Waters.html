		<p>
		  Money
Get away
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay
Money
It's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money
Get back
But I'm all right Jack
Keep your hands off of my stack
Money
It's a hit
But don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity, first class, travelling set
I think I need a Lear jet

Money
It's a crime
Share it fairly
But don't take a slice of my pie
Money
So they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a raise
It's no surprise that they're giving none away
