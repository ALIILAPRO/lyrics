		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will wear the sun,
Ancient light through these woods,
Woods that I walk through alone
I will take my rest
With all creatures who dwell,
Under the smallest of green
I'll remain no more than is required of me
Until the spirit is gone
I will long to see all that waits to be known
And all that will never be known

Enter the core of nature,
No earthly mind can enter,
But I will wear the sun,
Bound to others,
We see many things

I will train my feet to go on with the joy
A joy I have yet to reach
I will let the sound of these woods that I've known
Sink into blood and to bone
I'll remain no more than is required of me
Until the spirit is gone
I will long to see all that waits to be known
And all that will never be known

Enter the core of nature,
No earthly mind can enter,
But I will wear the sun,
Bound to others,
We see many things

I will wear the sun,
Ancient light through these woods,
Woods that I walk through alone
I will long to see all that waits to be known
And all that will never be known
All that will never be known
All that will never be known
All that will never be known
All that will never be known
All that will never be known
