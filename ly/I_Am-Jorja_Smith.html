		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try it if it feels right (try it if it feels)
If it feels right, yeah
When you try
Oh, oh

I'm tryin'
I'm just, I'm just
I been out here tryin' to see my homecomin'
And of course, somebody's always gonna say somethin'
Try and shoot me down for voicin' my own opinion
Triggerin' a part of me that's always been indifferent

And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame

When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free

Open up this letter, you ain't tryin' to be
You been blind to the subject but not blind to me
And I know that this margin ain't too small for me
Not too real, not too much anymore, not alone

And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame

When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free

If who I am offends you
Don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry
My loss is worth more than your wins
I'm satisfied if it starts to look in
That is everything, that is everything, that is everything
That is everything
That is everything
I try to make it stop
I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop
I pray it will stop
I, stop
I know what you are
I try to make it stop
I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop
I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop
I pray it will stop
I, stop
I am what you not
I try to make it stop
I pray it will stop
