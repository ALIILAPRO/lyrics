		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You used a fork once
It turns out forks are fuckin' everywhere
There's no hidin' from the thought of us
I got ways to find you anywhere

We sat on the roof once
Conversation took us everywhere
And we talked until the sun came up
I wish we stayed just like we were up there

I consider you, I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can't help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well established

I
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in between
I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about before
Before you get to me

Remember when you left once
That never made too much sense to me
Well, it hurt you so bad, hurting me
You really came to me for sympathy

Oh, I consider you, I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can't help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well established

I
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in between
And I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about before
Before you get to me

Am I'm not
Even a second thought?

I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in between
I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about before
Before you get to me

Wonder how many things
