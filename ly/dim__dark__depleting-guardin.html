		  Hahaha!
No, you're not crazy, Nick you're creative
You're so creative shut the fuck up!

I am quickly realizing
All the problems that I'm facing
All exist inside this hatred
For myself, my thoughts are racing
Is there anybody out there
Feeling dim, dark and depleting?
What is safe? 'Cause all I fear is near
And death I'll soon be greeting
I truly wish the flickering would stop
And I could catch my breath
But this film's left on repeat again
Somehow you soon forget
You've damn near downed your second bottle
Drunken words in full еffect
These sobеr thoughts have always lived here
Driving by until they wreck

I'm fucking numb, yeah
You don't know a thing about the terror
That I breathe into my lungs
And I don't know a thing about myself
Other than what is soon to come

I'm fucking numb i'm fucking numb
I'm fucking numb i'm fucking numb, yeah

I think the sky is falling
But it's my imagination
Overcasting on and off again
To form a new foundation
Hopefully I reconstruct myself
It might take quite a while
Obsolete upon comparison
These scars all stretch for miles
I'll never find the person I was then
He's buried deep below
Subterranean inhabitant
I hope he likes the snow
Did the soul inside his body
Ever find his way back home?
Am I talking in third person?
Yeah, I guess we'll never know

I'm fucking numb, yeah
You don't know a thing about the terror
That I breathe into my lungs
And I don't know a thing about myself
Other than what is soon to come
