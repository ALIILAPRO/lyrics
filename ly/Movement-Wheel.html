		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another eulogy
Testament to our inaction
Stoking the fire, building around us

Ever the advocate
Perpetuating our stagnation
It's always the same

You've got nothing to say
Synergise or get out of my way
It's time to mobilize heed this
You'll never redefine our cause
I will shut you out

Conflating every opposition
With all that you despise

No more empty words
No more false equivalence
Bear witness to the changing tide

If you've got nothing to say
Step aside, I'm done listening

It's time to mobilize heed this
You'll never redefine our cause
I will shut you out

You're daunted by the magnitude
Of this undertaking

(It's) so much easier to be
Strangling in apathy
Romanticising
All that would cease to be
But we know the price of silence
We all know the price of silence
