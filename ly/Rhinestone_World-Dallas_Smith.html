		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See the Sun
Coming up
From the front seat of a Greyhound bus
Felt the rain
On the faces
I was standing at the gates of Graceland
Searching for something
Searching for someone
Lost on the highway a little dazed and confused
But the haze of the road dust
Comes into focus
Every time I look at you

You're a little white church
On a corner in Mississippi
The front porch light that feels like home, girl
Look at you shine
Loving you is like finding
A diamond in a rhinestone world

You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane
Lighter in the air to a damn good song
Girl, can't believe you're mine
Loving you is like finding
A diamond in a rhinestone world

Oh, oh you're a diamond in a rhinestone world

Waking up
All alone
Means you might have just been chasing ghosts
And all the glitter fades fast
And a gold rush ain't made to last

You're a little white church
On a corner in Mississippi
A front porch light that feels like home, girl
Look at you shine
Loving you is like finding
A diamond in a rhinestone world

You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane
Lighter in the air to a damn good song
Girl, can't believe you're mine
Loving you is like finding
A diamond in a rhinestone world

Oh, oh you're a diamond in a rhinestone world

You're a little white church
On a corner in Mississippi
A front porch light that feels like home, girl
Look at you shine
Loving you is like finding
A diamond in a rhinestone world

You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane
Lighter in the air to a damn good song
Girl, can't believe you're mine
Loving you is like finding
A diamond in a rhinestone world

Oh, oh you're a diamond in a rhinestone world

Oh, oh you're a diamond in a rhinestone world
