		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that you are here with me
We got a world of our own
How can it be that we
Waited so long though we knew we belonged
I always felt I´d find someone
And I do believe that you´re the one

This moment when love finds the way
This moment will last
This moment of touch in my heart with your love

Life is a mystery
And no one knows whats to come
It is a blessing we
Now have become what was meant all along
I always felt I´d find someone
And I do believe, I do believe that you´re the one

This moment when love finds the way
This moment will last
This moment of touch in my heart forever in love
And I need you to know, I never let go
In this moment I'll stay forever more

Cause I need you to believe that faith
Will lead us through the night
And I wanna believe that the love we have will shine alone

This moment when love finds the way
This moment will last
This moment of touch in my heart forever in love
And I need you to know, I never let go
In this moment I'll stay forever more

Stay forever more
