		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't ever try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Hold me, feel me
Wound and heal me
Mend this broken heart
Though you're near me
You can't hear me
But you tear my soul apart
I can't beat you
Can't defeat you
You just make me cry inside
Don't even try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
My rage is growing stronger
And I can't wait no longer
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Never learning
Vengeance is burning
Deep inside your mind
Time will come to
When I'll make you
Stumbling like blind leading the blind
