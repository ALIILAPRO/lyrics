		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're really rockin' Boston
In Pittsburgh, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the 'Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen

Sweet Little Sixteen
She's just got to have
About half a million
Famed autographs
Her wallet filled with pictures
She gets 'em one by one
Becomes so excited
Watch her, look at her run, boy

Oh, mommy, mommy
Please, may I go?
It's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh, daddy, daddy
I beg of you
Whisper to mommy
It's all right with you

'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand
In Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the 'Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen

'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand
Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the 'Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with, ooh
Sweet Little Sixteen

Sweet Little Sixteen
She's got the grown up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's sportin' high heel shoes
Oh, but tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her trend
And be sweet sixteen
And back in class again

But they'll be rockin' in Boston
Pittsburgh, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the 'Frisco Bay
Way out in St. Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen
