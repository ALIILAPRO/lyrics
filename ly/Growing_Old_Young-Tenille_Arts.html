		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just another Sunday afternoon
Cryin', tryna drown out the sound
Of fightin' words comin' from the living room
Going shot-for-shot in another round
We just sweep it under the rug
Never talk about it at all
We just leave it all messed-up
Add another brick to the wall

Yeah, the thing about growing old young
You fast-forward through the innocent stuff
You cut straight to the fallin' out of love
And thinkin' maybe you'll never be enough
'Cause you've never kissed a boy, but your heart's in two
Never had a drink but you know what it can do
Never got to see the world before yours came undone
That's growing old young

A ten-year-old should be playin' house
Not holdin' theirs together
Or blamin' yourself or wonderin' how
The bad will ever get any better

Yeah, the thing about growing old young
You fast-forward through the innocent stuff
You cut straight to the fallin' out of love
And thinkin' maybe you'll never be enough
'Cause you've never kissed a boy, but your heart's in two
Never had a drink but you know what it can do
Never got to see the world before yours came undone
That's growing old young

Ooh

Growing old ain't a choice
But sometimes, growing up ain't either
When you get cut that young
Time's the only healer

But the thing about growing old young
You'll learn how to get through the tough stuff
You'll find a way to fall in love
Without your past messin' it up
I know you've never kissed a boy, but your heart's in two
Never had a drink but you know what it can do
Never got to see the world before yours came undone
I know you're growing old young (ooh, yeah)
I know you're growing old young (ooh)
That's thing about growing old young
