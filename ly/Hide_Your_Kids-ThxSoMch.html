		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Set fire to a plane
Hang me up on display
So I can watch you cry
You know what, nevermind
Fall back, to a grave
So while you cry, I wither and decay
And the hell inside your eyes
Burns you alive

Flesh peeling off my bones
Blood coming out my nose
Cops knocking at the door
Nails underneath the boards
Hell's opened up and I ain't playin'
So lock your doors, I'm outside and no one's safe
For God's sake

Hide your kids and wife
(Wife, wife, wife)
I can't wait to take (my) my (fuck) fuck (-ing) -ing life
(Life, life, life, life)
Hide your kids and wife
(Wife, wife, wife)
I can't wait to take (my) my (fuck) fuck (-ing) -ing life
(Life, life, life, life)

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight (tonight)

You wild lil' thang
If I die, you do the same
And together we'll expire
Just you and I (you and I)

Flesh peeling off our bones
Blood coming out our nose
Cops knocking at the door
Nails underneath the boards
Hell's opened up and I ain't playin'
So lock your doors, I'm outside and no one's safe
For God's sake

Hide your kids and wife
(Wife, wife, wife)
I can't wait to take (my) my (fuck) fuck (-ing) -ing life
(Life, life, life, life)
Hide your kids and wife
(Wife, wife, wife)
I can't wait to take (my) my (fuck) fuck (-ing) -ing life
(Life, life, life, life)

Tonight
