		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In your smile I find comfort
And in your eyes I find hope
With one look my heart shivered
You stole my heart from the start
Darling I'm in love with you
Everyday I'm drawn to you

You're full of wonder full of grace
You got me settled in your embrace
You're beautiful from the inside
And I am glad for you are mine
Darling I'm in love with you
Everyday I'm drawn to you

Although these words they don't deserve you
I say it 'cause I want to
So that you know that I love you

You belong to me just like I belong to you
I wanna love you better than I loved you yesterday
I I give my all to you because of what we have is true
Each time you say you love me
I love you too and more
Too and more

Don't you worry like I do
'Cause there is no way I'm leaving you
To the moon and back again
Until forever and then again
Darling I'm in love with you
Everyday I'm drawn to you

Although these words they don't deserve you
I say it 'cause I want to
So that you know that I love you

You belong to me just like I belong to you
I wanna love you better than I loved you yesterday
I I give my all to you because of what we have is true
Each time you say you love me
I love you too and more
You can count on me to make your life complete
I will love you better than I loved you yesterday
Love you have my heart you have my life
Each time you say you love me
I love you too and more
