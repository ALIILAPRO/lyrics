		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody move your body
Now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey, DJ, keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on

Everybody move your body
Now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey DJ keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)

It's Friday night and the weekend's here
I need to unwind, where's the party, Mr. DJ, DJ?
I am ready to call my friends
So we could all get down
Where's the party, hey, Mr. DJ

Hey, Mr. DJ
(You can get this started)
Everybody's ready to party
All night, all night (come on, all night)
All the girls are ready
(So we can all get to it)
So we can party 'til the break of dawn, oh

Everybody move your body
Now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey, DJ, keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)

Everybody move your body
Now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey, DJ, keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)

It's Friday night and the weekend's here
I need to unwind, where's the party, Mr. DJ?
I am ready to call my friends
So we could all get down
Where's the party, hey, Mr. DJ?

Hey, Mr. DJ
(You can get this started)
Everybody's ready to party
All night, all night (come on, all night)
All the girls are ready
(So we can all get to it)
So we can party 'til the break of dawn, oh (hey)

Once again, it's on, yo, Zhané, blow the horn
Let the DJ know to keep playing your song
Maybe I'll browse, snatch up the blouse
Rip the foul, huh, and get rub-a-dub style
'Cause your body won't move if it can't feel the groove
So K. Boogie had to show and prove
Hey, now we're feeling the vibe
Rolling wit' the flava, feeling alright
Ho, yo, there's a party over here
Yo, oh no, the party's over there
Call up your friends, let 'em know Fam's tagging along
Hey, DJ keep playing that song (come on)

Everybody move your body (come on)
Now do it (groovy)
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey, DJ, keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (DJ, keep it funky)
(On and on and on and on)

Everybody move your body (everybody, come on)
Now do it (groovy)
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove (groovy)
Hey, DJ, keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (DJ, keep it funky)
(On and on and on and on)

Do it, something, oh, yeah, oh
