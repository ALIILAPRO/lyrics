		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, darling
There's not much that you can say
To stop me from falling in
Like I am
Oh, darling
Even waves can't wash away
Our names in the sand
Never could, never can

You are my everything
I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow
Every kiss is whoa
They say you know when you know, well I know
I know you're the one

Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned it wasn't my turn
It wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But baby, you are a lifetime

Oh, darling
There's no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh, darling
I would walk that broken road
Time and time again
If it led me to your hello

You are my everything
I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow
Every kiss is whoa
They say you know when you know, well I know
I know you're the one

Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned it wasn't my turn
It wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But baby, you are a lifetime
Baby, you are a lifetime
