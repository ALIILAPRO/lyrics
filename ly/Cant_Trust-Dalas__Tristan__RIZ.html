		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't chase a girl that's only in it for the money
Need a ride or die, need a shotta
Need a shorty that's gon' be there when I holla
Through the tough times, I need a partner
Losing trust for all these girls, I can't trust none
She holding onto my money like a trust fund
She tryna play me like I'm stupid but I'm not dumb
I think she trippin', yeah, I really think she on one


Can't trust no girls, if she negative get her out of my vision
I'm never missin', this kid Riz and I'm on a mission, yeah
Can't trust no girls, if she negative get her out of my vision I'm never missin'
Through the tough times, I need a partner


Can't trust no girls, if she negative get her out of my vision
I'm never missin', I'm never missin'
Can't trust no girls, if she negative get her out of my vision I'm never missin'
Through the tough times, I need a partner


Can't trust no girls
Goin' out, givin' digits like
You need to listen
'Cause you ain't never been on the other side
Keep it real with a G like
You don't know how it feels when it feels right
No, you don't, you don't, you don't
You're hopeless, smokin' your problems away
You're broken, frozen, thawin' ain't safe
And you need closure, come closer away
Through the tough times, I need a partner


Can't trust no girls, if she negative get her out of my vision
I'm never missin', I'm never missin'
Can't trust no girls, if she negative get her out of my vision I'm never missin'
Through the tough times, I need a partner
