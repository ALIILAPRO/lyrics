		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pay attention, are you listening?
You're my favorite girl.
Excuse me for the moment.
I'm in another world.
(On a mountain,) by a fountain.
Flowers blooming everywhere.
With venus and cupid, the picture's very clear.
Hang the sign upon the door, say:
Don't disturb this groove.
Just a way to say that
I'm so into you, and the feelings so real.
So don't disturb this groove.
Erotic whispers for the listener.
Let the music fill the air.
Excuse me for a moment,
I'm at a loss for words.
By election, sheer perfection.
And as if these eyes would care.
Your heart is in the right place,
So don't you go and change.
Baby, over and over the passion starts again.
You're my lollipops and everything,
And a little taste of sin,
Causing fire and desire.
In this mortal soul to live,
Till the angels fall from heaven.
And the day the earth stands still,
Hang a sign upon the door.
Say don't disturb this groove.
Just a way to say that
I'm so into you and the feeling's so real.
So don't disturb this groove.
Just a way to tell you that
I'm so into you.
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the groove.
Lock the door and turn the phone off, it's time for me and you.
Hang the sign upon the door, say don't disturb this groove
