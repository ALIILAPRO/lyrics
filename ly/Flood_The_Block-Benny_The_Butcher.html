		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Griselda
Respect the scorpion, nigga
Ah
The butcher comin', nigga
Y'all know what it is, nigga
Black Soprano Family, nigga
Brrt

Gave niggas the benefit
Talked it out when I could've paid killers to finish it
Grave diggers that's generous (uh-huh)
From a corner store, now we made niggas with businesses
In courtrooms, I ate with them same niggas they mentionin'
My album, I wrote down cocaine dealin' definitive (okay)
You had to play the game to really spit that articulate
The word about my name is I paint them pictures meticulous
And rode with a brick on the train, feelin' adventurous
Brought 'em fifteen thousand and got it all back
The money slow, I hit the bottom, I was down to a stack
I thought about it, took a moment, then re-routed my map
And moved my family out of town, in a condo off rap
Fuck a diss song, I wanna hear the sound of y'all gats (shoot somethin')
Pound in y'all lap, ridin', dressed down in all black
And that gangster shit you warn don't come out 'til y'all rap
And that old work you put in don't count 'cause y'all rats, uh
Bimmer weavin' between cars, got me breathin' hard
Servin' clean, we dream large with uneven odds
It won't ever inconvenience me to leave a broad
Sometimes you sever ties even if it leave a scar (true shit)
It's gon' take a bank vault for that advance to suit me (ah)
And I'ma buy Versace since they bannin' Gucci
In interviews they ask me questions and I answer truthfully
Fiend cooked that half for a can of beer and a loosie

I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Get the cream with my team and I'm ghost
Only the real can relate, we get the money live
You know the rules to the game

I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Get the cream with my team and I'm ghost
Only the real can relate, we get the money live
