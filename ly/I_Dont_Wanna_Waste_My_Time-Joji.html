		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna waste my time if
I can't be by your side
You really shouldn't think about God if
She can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothing nice
If you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know

And if the stars collide
Will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I
Know she'll let me go when you read my lips
I know you feel all cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold

I don't wanna waste my time if
I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you
Do when the Sun goes down
'Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
'Cause I don't gotta know

And if the stars collide
Will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips
I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold
