		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt
Über Sternen muss er wohnen

Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary
Tell me, will you hold me?
When wrong will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me?

(Hold me) show me
(Lay your head lowly) told me
(Softly then boldly) yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human

(Lead me) hold me
(Love me and feed me) yeah, yeah
(Kiss me and free me) yeah
(I will feel blessed) I'm only human

(Carry) carry
(Carry me boldly) carry
(Lift me up slowly) yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human

(Save me) lead me
(Heal me and bathe me) lift me up, lift me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there) I will be there

(Lift me) told me, yah
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly) yeah
(Show me you care) you will be there

(Hold me) woo
(Lay your head lowly) get lonely sometimes
(Softly then boldly) I get lonely, yeah, yeah
(Carry me there) carry me there

(Lead me) woo
(Love me and feed me) lift me up, hold me up
(Kiss me and free me) lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
(I will feel blessed) yeah

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart
