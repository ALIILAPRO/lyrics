		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't breath I'm suffocating

It's a feeling I know
All my senses are heightened to the point where I can't move at all
I try to scream but there is no one here
I tell myself that's irrational.

Whatever I do it gets the best of me
I can feel the waves crashing down on me.

All these words are useless
I bet you won't understand
I'm just trying to hide my fears
'Cause I'm afraid to understand

I've been thinking way too much
I've been searching for a place to bury myself.

I'm lost in a wave
It controls my feelings and I can't help it
I'm falling away
If I control my fears, would I still feel the pain

I've been thinking too much
I see the rain pouring down the river

My brain is trying to trick me
I'm just talking to myself but I can't hear anything

My face is on the concrete
It's about to take control and I just cannot compete

See the face of misery
I try to scream but there is no one here

I'm lost in a wave
It controls my feelings and I can't help it
I'm falling away
If I control my fears, would I still feel the pain
