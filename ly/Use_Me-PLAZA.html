		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She likes it when I'm fucked up
She gonna use me
Take me down slow, control and abuse me
Oh, 'til the drugs all gone
'Til the early morn' 'Til the liquor gone
Oh no, baby, just use me

Told you you'd feel something
Tried out his love but it don't feel right
I'ma call a ride
I'm coming straight to you
Combing through the six
Gonna see what that body do
I like you more than these other girls
You got some shit to prove
I don't know why and you don't care when
It's 3AM you want it again
I know you got problems
I'm not here to solve them you can use me
Baby, just use me

Shе likes it when I'm fucked up
Shе gonna use me
Take me down slow, control and abuse me
Oh, 'til the drugs all gone
'Til the early morn' 'Til the liquor gone
Oh no, baby, just use me


With the gin, and the juice
And it's tight like a noose get me high

She likes it when I'm fucked up
She gonna use me
(Oh, she's gonna use me good)
Take me down slow, control and abuse me
Oh, 'til the drugs are gone
('til the drugs are gone)
'Til the early morn' 'Til the liquor gone
Oh no, baby, just-
