		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love my girl
She lookin' good, come on, one more

Five to one, baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive, now
You get yours, baby
I'll get mine
Gonna make it, baby
If we try

The old get old
And the young get stronger
May take a week
And it may take longer
They got the guns
Well, but we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah
We're takin' over
Come on!

Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening
Crawl across the years
Yeah, walk across the floor with a
Flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands

Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna' make it, baby, in our prime
Come together one more time
Get together one more time

Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together, gotta, get together
(Get together one more time)
(Get together one more time)

Hey, come on, honey
You go on along home and wait for me, baby
I'll be there in just a little while
You see, I gotta go out in this car
With these people and
(Get together one more time)

Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together, got to
Get together, got to

Get together, got to
Take you up into my room and
(Get together one more time)
Love my girl
She lookin' good, lookin' real good
Love ya, come on
