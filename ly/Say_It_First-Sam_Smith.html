		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never feel like this
I'm used to emptiness in my heart
And in my arms
You're not what I'm used to
You keep me guessing with things that you do
I hope that they're true

'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know, if I'm in this alone

Come on baby, say it first
I need to hear you, say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you, say it first
Come on baby
Do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on darling
If you love me, say it first

Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me

I know you're right for me
But I'm waiting for everything in your world
To align with my world
I think of you while I sleep
I dream of what we could be if we grow
Together unfold

'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know
If I'm in this alone

Come on baby, say it first
I need to hear you, say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you, say it first
Come on baby
Do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on darling
If you love me, say it first

Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me

Say it first
I need to hear you, say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you, say it first
Come on baby
Do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on darling
If you love me, say it first

Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me
