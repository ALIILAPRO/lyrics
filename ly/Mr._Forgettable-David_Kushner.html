		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you're waiting for me like a dog
But have some patience for the part of me that's lost
There's been a hundred times
When I don't recognize
Any of you that love me
I try to memorize and identify
But it's all getting foggy

My head is in the clouds right now
Just pray I come around, around

Hello, hello, are you lonely?
I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
I'm called Mr. Forgettable (oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable (oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable

The old me hides
While the new me fights
Look in my eyes
He's still in there, right?
Did the kitchen change?
What about your name?
You used to be my heart
And now you're just a face

My head is in the clouds right now
Just pray I come around, around

Hello, hello, are you lonely?
I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
I'm called Mr. Forgettable (oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable (oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable (oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable
(Mr. Forgettable)

Hello, hello, are you lonely?
I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
They call me Mr. Forgettable
