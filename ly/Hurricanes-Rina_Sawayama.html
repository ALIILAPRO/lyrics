		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  April showers finally making way for warmer weather
But yet I still feel the same
Doing yoga just to feel untethered, but my mind keeps
Ru-ru-ru-running away

Chasing hurricanes
'Cause I can't feel the rain
Second guess my pain
'Cause I've been walking 'round in chains

So won't you give me a sign if you're really there?
'Cause I've been lost inside waiting on a prayer
Until I find your door, until the wind blows north
I'm running, I'm running, running into hurricanes

Always wanted to be best at everything
Even when it brings out the worst in myself (worst in myself)
So I create a storm and bury it deep, hiding the key
In plain sight just in case I need help, help

Chasing hurricanes
'Cause I can't feel the rain

So won't you give me a sign if you're really there?
'Cause I've been lost inside waiting on a prayer
Until I find your door, until the wind blows north
I'm running, I'm running, running into hurricanes
So won't you give me a ride? Be my getaway
I'm not the girl I tried to be yesterday
Until I find your door, until the wind blows north
I'm running, I'm running, running into hurricanes

Ooh

Oh, I'm in a cyclone, I'm spinning
Crashed through the floor
Don't give me heaven, I'm flying
Tearing down the doors of the city
Ooh, you know I'm running, I'm running
Running into hurricanes

So won't you give me a sign if you're really there?
'Cause I've been lost inside waiting on a prayer
Until I find your door, until the wind blows north
I'm running, I'm running, running into hurricanes
So won't you give me a ride? Be my getaway
I'm not the girl I tried to be yesterday
Until I find your door, until the wind blows north
I'm running, I'm running, running into hurricanes
