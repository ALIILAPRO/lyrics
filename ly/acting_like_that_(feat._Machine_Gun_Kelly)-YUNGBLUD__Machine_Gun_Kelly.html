		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's that knocking at four in the morning? (Four in the morning)
'Cause it don't rain but tonight it's pourin' (tonight it's pourin')
Uh, you like it more when I ignore it (you like it, yeah)
And since I left, LA got boring (since I've been gone)

Ayy, I'm back on my bullshit
You're a Libra, I'm a Taurus
Heard you hooked back up with your ex
And now you're asleep on my doorstep

You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that
You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that
I don't wanna talk right now
You're asleep outside my house
You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that

(I love this bit)
I heard it today, you got on a plane to another state
I think I'm okay, never gonna change my mind
Never gonna change my mind
And I don't think today is the last time
That the bright lights hit the dark side
I can see that look in your eyes
I can see that look in your eyes, yeah

Now I can't sleep, I'm all alone
And what we reaped is what we've sown
So can we meet somewhere in the middle?
(Yeah)

You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that
You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that
I don't wanna talk right now (right now)
You're asleep outside my house (you're asleep outside my house)
You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that

I'm goin' out my head
I fell in love again
And I know that you'll regret me in the morning
When you are gone again
(Yeah)

You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that
You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that
I don't wanna talk right now (I don't want to talk right now)
You're asleep outside my house (you're asleep outside my house)
You're way too hot to be actin' like that
Actin' like that
Actin' like that
