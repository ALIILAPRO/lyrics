		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?
No and thank you, please Madam
I ain't lost, just wandering

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea

Doo delee da da da da da da
Doo deelee da da da da da da
Doo doo doo doo, oh, yeah
Are the wonders of my world
You are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world, yeah
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah
