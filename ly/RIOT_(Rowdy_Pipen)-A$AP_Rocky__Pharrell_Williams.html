		<p>
		  (Woo, woo, woo, woo) Mista
I might start a riot, mm (woo, woo, woo)
Opposite of quiet, yeah (woo, woo, woo)
On a pussy nigga tires (woo, woo, woo)
How 'bout you try it? Try it (woo, woo, woo, hey)

We grow, we learn, we live (woo, woo)
I might start a riot (woo, woo, woo)
We grow, we learn, we live (woo, woo, woo)
Opposite of quiet (woo, woo, woo)
We grow, we learn (woo, woo)
Pussy nigga tired (woo, woo, woo)
How 'bout you try it? (Woo, woo)
I don't buy it, yeah (woo, woo, woo)

I just call designers up, I free ninety-nine it, uh (uh, uh, uh)
Called your baby mama up, yep, I nighty-night it (uh, uh, uh, yeah)
I just bought designer kilts, yeah, I Roddy Pipe it (uh, uh)
I just put some BDs on my whip with lime green pipin' (woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)

My wife is erotic, I'm smokin' exotic (woo, woo)
My whip is exotic, my crib is a cottage (woo, woo, woo)
A whole lotta cheesy, we gettin' that cottage (woo, woo)
A whole lotta brains, 'cause I skipped out on college (woo, woo, woo)
They think I'm livin' that large, why? (Woo, woo)
That lil' nigga livin' too large, ayy (woo, woo, woo)
All my niggas do is play the ball (woo, woo)
You lil' niggas too afraid to ball (woo, woo, woo)
Why you gotta get the pigs involved?
I'm way more deadly when my pen involved
Business suits, we the men in charge (woo, woo)
Bottega suits on the business call (woo, woo)
Kidney niggas, I don't kill 'em soft (woo, woo)
You finna die, no 'Ana Ross (woo, woo)
Bought a Rolls Royce and a Porsche (woo, woo)
Buy the building, nigga in the Porsche (woo, woo)
If you scared, better get a dog (woo, woo)
Pussy nigga, that's your menopause, ayy

We grow, we learn, we live (woo, woo)
I might start a riot (woo, woo, woo)
We grow, we learn, we live (woo, woo, woo)
Opposite of quiet (woo, woo, woo)
We grow, we learn (woo, woo)
Pussy nigga tired (woo, woo, woo)
How 'bout you try it? (Woo, woo)
I don't buy it, yeah (woo, woo, woo)

I just call designers up, I free ninety-nine it, uh (uh, uh, uh)
Called your baby mama up, yep, I nighty-night it (uh, uh, uh, yeah)
I just bought designer kilts, yeah, I Roddy Pipe it (uh, uh)
I just put some BDs on my whip with lime green pipin' (woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)

The home of the E-V, G-M, C-C collab, 2023-D (woo, woo, woo, woo)
My belt not no B.B., Simon says, "VS and VV" (woo, woo)
Rag on my head like habibi (woo, woo)
Canary, my stones look like Tweety (woo, woo)
Pass on the sweetie, I got me a RiRi (woo, woo)
Blue magic she sniffin' that I dream of genie (woo, woo)
Designer the finest, I play that Brent Faiyaz and see if she freaky (woo, woo, woo)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (woo, woo)
I'ma ball (uh), I'ma ball hard (uh, woo, woo, woo)
Why they say he got the rental cars? (Uh, woo, woo)
Flossin' hard, this ain't dental floss (uh, woo, woo, woo)
Flossy, glossy (uh, woo, woo)
Nah, bitch, this ain't lip gloss (Uh, woo, woo, woo)
Luxe balm up in my palm (Uh, woo, woo)
New collab' with my baby mom (woo, woo, woo)

We grow, we learn, we live (woo, woo)
I might start a riot (woo, woo, woo)
We grow, we learn, we live (woo, woo, woo)
Opposite of quiet (woo, woo, woo)
We grow, we learn (woo, woo)
Pussy nigga tired (woo, woo, woo)
How 'bout you try it? (Woo, woo)
I don't buy it, yeah (woo, woo, woo)

I just call designers up, I free ninety-nine it, uh (uh, uh, uh)
Called your baby mama up, yep, I nighty-night it (uh, uh, uh, yeah)
I just bought designer kilts, yeah, I Roddy Pipe it (uh, uh)
I just put some BDs on my whip with lime green pipin' (woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
