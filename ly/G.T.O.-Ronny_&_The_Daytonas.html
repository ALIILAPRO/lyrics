		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little GTO
You're really lookin' fine
Three deuces and a four-speed
And a three-eighty-nine
Listen to her tachin' up now
Listen to her whine
C'mon and turn it on, wind it up, blow it out, GTO

Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Ah, little GTO

You oughta see her on a road course
Or a quarter mile
This little modified Pon-Pon
Has got plenty of style
She beats the gassers and the rail jobs
Really drives 'em wild
C'mon and turn it on, wind it up, blow it out, GTO

Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Ah, little GTO

Gonna save all my money (turnin' it on, blowin' it out)
And buy a GTO (turnin' it on, blowin' it out)
Get a helmet and a roll bar (turnin' it on, blowin' it out)
And I'll be ready to go (turnin' it on, blowin' it out)
Take it out to Pomona (turnin' it on, blowin' it out)
And let 'em know, yeah, yeah (turnin' it on, blowin' it out)
That I'm the coolest thing around
Little buddy, gonna shut you down
When I turn it on, wind it up, blow it out, GTO

Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Yeah, yeah, little GTO
Ah, little GTO
