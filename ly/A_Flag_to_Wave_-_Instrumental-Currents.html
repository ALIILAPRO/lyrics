		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I find myself lost again
In a world that doesn't know my name
This life I've worked for brings no substance to me
Why do I always feel like I'm going insane?
Determined to find my place
I seek the remnants of my fate

Forever loathing
Burdened by defeat
Your will is weak
You see yourselves

Walk out on the dream
To live a life of peace
But do you get the life you want
If you never feel free?

I long for something
That I can represent
A flag to wave
To find my foundation

I long for something
To carry to the end
A flag to wave
A flag to wave

Stepping out of form
And into emptiness, living a life devoid of passion
I'm here to show the world my face
Taking what you've abandoned
They will never know your name

Always in the dark
But still you hide your face
I just hope you're listening
As you walk out on the dream
Nothing to lose but nothing left to gain
I hope you get the things you want
While you wish that you were me

I long for something
That I can represent
A flag to wave
To find my foundation

I long for something
To carry to the end
A flag to wave (a flag to wave)

I'm dying to know
What it's like to be unafraid to drown
I'm dying to know
What it's like to live a life
Without the fear of being shut down

Abandoning your post, believing every lie
The flag you set down, I'll defend with my life
Sway as the puppets sway
Nothing left to lose, nothing left to gain
So trade a number for your name and drown in misery
Misery, misery
