		  (A$AP Rocky)

Mr. Frankenstein
Oh, Victor Frankenstein (ooh)
I'm Dr. Frankenstein
I'm out here saving lives
Igor by my side (ooh)
That's right, I made you, slime (ooh)
Tyler, create you guys
Never mind, "It's alive"

I bet you hate that line (woo)
That's death to everybody
In my class, no Columbine
Pay me in decimals (oh)
Comma signs, dollar signs
Baby, pay me no mind
'Cause I'm outta mine (A$AP Rocky)
This nigga's outta line
Iced out pendent, Jesus
Iced out cross, missed out on church last weekend
Ice to his chin, now them charges pending
Know that I'ma sin, Lord, forgive us
I'ma go to church next Christmas
I'm remember that-that Thank-Thanksgiving
When we was eatin' Church's Chicken
Now ain't that somethin'
It made me who am, I don't take back shit (bitch)

So ungrateful
Remember who raised you
Don't bite the hand that feed you
Be the same hand that pays you

So ungrateful
I'ma make these boys act thankful
Like they forget they that need you
Most of these hoes unfaithful

So ungrateful (A$AP Rocky)
Don't remember who raised you
Bite the hand that feeds you
Be the hand that pay you, bitch

So unfaithful
I'ma make these boys act thankful
It's like they forget that they need you
Most of these hoes unfaithful, uh, yeah
So ungrateful, uh

Boy, you forget who raised you
Don't bite the hand that feed you
Most of these hoes unfaithful
(What's going on?)

Where the fuck you been?
Where the fuck you been?
Came to fuck up shit in the club again

Where the fuck you been?
Where the fuck you been?
Shut the fuck up, nigga, way too talkative

Ayy, I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
In the mosh pit, I'm finna fuck up shit
Bloody nose, busted lip, boy, I love this shit (yeah)

Poof, got my boots
Got it laced, fuck up out my face
Who, lost? Got it, force
I'ma floss, Norway, Voss
Yeah, that's water, boy
Call me the water boy
Like Bobby Boucher, tax spray
Like what my ma-ma-ma-mama say
Flow, little boy, you'd better call the law
They got a Styrofoam cup, well, where ya soda, boy?
Now I'm in my bag, can't forget my past
Focus on my path, they gon' feel my wrath
Please don't touch my, please don't touch my
Kiss my ass, then collect my thoughts
Then collect my gat, oh, where the guns?
What I'm forced to resort to, fuck you expect?

I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
In the mosh pit, I'm finna fuck up shit
Bloody nose, busted lip, boy, I love this shit (bitch)

Where the fuck you been?
Where the fuck you been?
Came to fuck up shit in the club again

Where the fuck you been?
Where the fuck you been?
Shut the fuck up, nigga, way too talkative

Where the fuck you been?
Where the fuck you been?
Turn the fuck up, nigga, in the club again

Where the fuck you been?
Where the fuck you been?
Heard he talking shit, well, shut the fuck up then
