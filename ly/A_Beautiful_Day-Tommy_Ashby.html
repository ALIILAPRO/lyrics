		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Betty Thompson said she was with you,
Good morning, still in your red shoes 
Silver lining sits in a gold cloud,
My horizon's wide as your eyes now.

She'll come round like the sun in your bedroom,
Patience, be film in a dark room 
Take your time, say hi with a haiku
You're not mine, I just like you.

Oh, it's a beautiful day,
Oh, such a beautiful day,

First love, wild flowers and a split knee,
Fall fast, in the hope that you catch me,
Leading horses down to the river,
You go first, I'll always love her.

Oh, it's a beautiful day,
Oh, such a beautiful day,

Call the boys in,
Call the girls,
Call your friends,
We're diving for pearls.
Swim the waters,
Simmer down
When you find one,
Pass it round.

Freeze frame, on a glance at midnight,
Keep your eyes on me and hold tight,
Run the rain, through the concrete glistening,
Go against the grain, find out what you're missing.

Oh, it's a beautiful day,
Oh, such a beautiful day,
Oh, it's a beautiful day,
Oh, such a beautiful day, 
Oh, it's a beautiful day,
Oh, such a beautiful day,
