		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ditched all of our friends to hang out
We would play pretend like we're already famous
You had all the charm, I was young and stupid
Thought that it was normal getting treated like shit

Every time you had a bad week, you would block me
Miss me, then you added me back, saying, "Sorry"
If it was a part of your plan, then you got me
It's really quite incredible, gotta give you credit though

You always play the victim, used to be convincin'
You loved me when you needed, left when it was easy
Heard you're doing great now, journal and you work out
Into meditation, oh, congratulations
When you gonna call me, and give me that apology?
There I go again, back living in a fantasy

I'm tryna figure out, what's the real truth
Did you really change or do you just want to? (Fake it)
Oh, I don't miss the old you, and I don't like the brand new
Actin' like you care doesn't make you self aware

You always play the victim, used to be convincin'
You loved me when you needed, left when it was easy (oh)
Heard you're doing great now, journal and you work out
Into meditation, oh, congratulations
When you gonna call me, and give me that apology?
There I go again, back living in a fantasy

Funny how a fantasy can end up as a tragedy
All you ever had to be was someone who was nice to me
Gave you every part of me, you took it all so happily (ooh)

You always play the victim, used to be convincin'
You loved me when you needed, left when it was easy
Heard you're doing great now, journal and you work out
Into meditation, oh, congratulations
When you gonna call me, and give me that apology?
There I go again, back living in a fantasy

Fantasy, a fantasy
I'm living in a fantasy
Fantasy, a fantasy
I'm living in a
Living in a fantasy
