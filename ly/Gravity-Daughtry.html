		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Escape the noise to find a voice
What kind of sound that it'd be 
Life in a familiar place
What fills the void that we need

Breathing with no air
Can't hear my echoes
When I scream out, I'm craving gravity
I'm like a shipwreck
And stuck stranded with no land in sight 
I need an anchor, my gravity

Even though I'm not in the same sun when I fall
Don't have to be miles apart if you're here in, in my heart
I can feel your love from a different place, that's okay
Don't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart

Embrace the strange, close to sane 
I don't belong here anyway
I'm passing by or visiting 
And out the gate, you're soothing

Breathing with no air
Can't hear my echoes
When I scream out, I'm craving gravity

Even though I'm not in the same sun when I fall
Don't have to be miles apart 
If you're here in my heart
I can feel your love from a different place, that's okay
Don't have to be miles apart 
If you're here in my heart
Don't have to be miles apart 
If you're here in my heart

(I'm like a shipwreck and stuck stranded with no land in sight)
Don't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart
(I'm like a shipwreck and stuck stranded with no land in sight)
Don't have to be miles apart if you're here
