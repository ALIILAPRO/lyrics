		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know me at my weakest
Never seen me fall
I'm the darkness, I'm the shadows
Dancing on your wall
On your wall

I gave all I had, still turned out bad
The angel has gone and moved over
I can't go back, so now I have
The devil on both of my shoulders

I'm not saying I'm all evil, but I'm not all good
Fuck up way more than most people
Way more than I should

Way more than I should

I gave all I had, still turned out bad
The angel has gone and moved over
I can't go back, so now I have
The devil on both of my shoulders

I'm the darkness, I'm the shadows
Dancing on your wall

I gave all I had, still turned out bad
The angel has gone and moved over
I can't go back, so now I have
The devil on both of my shoulders
Ohh-oh-ohh

The devil on both of my shoulders
