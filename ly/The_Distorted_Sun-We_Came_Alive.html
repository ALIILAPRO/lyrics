		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "I can feel my heart
is ripping apart
following the voices in my head
lead me into the dark

lead me into the unknown

is this real?
or its just me dreaming of
the world I've always dream of

is this real?
or its just me pretending
to live under the shadow of your soul

I buried myself and let it die
living a lie for a thousand times
don't know where to go
don't know where to stay

I just wanted to be alive

Distorsi matahari

is this real?
or its just me dreaming of
the world I've always dream of
is this real?
or its just me pretending
to live under the shadow of your soul

I buried myself and let it die
living a lie for a thousand times
don't know where to go
don't know where to stay
I just wanted to be alive

I've been living a lie for a thousand times
don't know where to go
don't know where to stay
I just wanted to be alive"
