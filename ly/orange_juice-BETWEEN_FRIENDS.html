		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got too close, I'm on the edge
Citrus kisses down your neck
I won't fall, never stall
Bring it back, growing tall
Laid out on my balcony
Watch the sky move from the breeze
We won't stop, never not
Falling down, take the drop

When I picture you my mind goes, it happens all the time though
Making life divine on a field trip to the sky
Picture you, my mind goes, it happens all the time though
Making life divine on a field trip to the sky

And I know you're tired, ease your mind (mind)
Time flies, ending so soon

Waking up, orange juice
Let me sip on you then somebody new
Mix it up like orange juice
In a swimming pool made for you
Waking up, orange juice
Let me sip on you then somebody new
Mix it up like orange juice
In a swimming pool made for you

Fought the sun for time in bed
Like you best with words unsaid
Can we just watch the time
Slowly go? You know I'm
Hung on this reality
Sweeten up your honey bee
Take your mind, let it go
Bring it back, show me more

When I picture you my mind goes, it happens all the time though
Making life divine on a field trip to the sky
Picture you, my mind goes, it happens all the time though
Making life divine on a field trip to the sky

Waking up, orange juice
Let me sip on you then somebody new
Mix it up like orange juice
In a swimming pool made for you
Waking up, orange juice
Let me sip on you then somebody new
Mix it up like orange juice
In a swimming pool made for you
