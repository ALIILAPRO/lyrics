		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, 
I can't understand, 
How I'm so stuck.
We haven't had sex, 
All we do is touch.
I say some funny words, 
And all you do is blush.
Baby I'm the dealer, and you my royal flush.

I forgot about them, 
It's all about us.
And when you not around I feel sick to my guts
I take that back, that's a little too much, 
But I do think about you a little too much.

I ain't never been the turn to stable up
But when it's me and you, I don't give a fuck.
Like a two dollar bill, I won't give you up
And when you feelin empty, 
I'm here to fill you up

[Chorus] 
Baby I'm point like a thumbtack 
And every time she leave I only focus on her come back
Fuck these other bitches cause I already done that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that
We gotta run that
We gotta run that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that
We gotta run that
We gotta run that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that.

I got a text, 
Shawty ask me to come through
But she ain't that type of girl you just run through
She got a Benz on dubs with a sunroof 
That drives so fast the rims wanna come loose
She got a body like a model and I still turn it up
Blow trees and pop bottles
She a freak and don't care about them haters if they talkin'
Girl you runnin through my mind, 
Joggin' and walkin'.

You must be tired, 
Nawh I'm just playin'.
I want the best for you girl so I'll keep prayin'
And I'll keep sayin'
Babe that you're beautiful 
You killin these bitches without no funeral

[Chorus]

Damn lil lady
I really think I need ya
I used to live single without that gadeeza
Now I think about you, I'm wishin for anesthesia 
'Cause every time you here it's kinda a teasea 

Thick in the waist, coke bottle shape
Every time you come around I wanna climb in your jeans
Really can't talk, and my mind go blank
When the cash out just go to the bank

Girl you got swag, just throw it in the bag
But I ain't fabbin, Nyeen jean
Gettin kinda toasta, 
Money in the thing
There's nothing else to say, but let the 
Hook sing

[Chorus]
Baby I'm point like a thumbtack
And every time she leave I only focus on her comeback
Fuck these other bitches cause I already done that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that
We gotta run that
We gotta run that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that
We gotta run that
We gotta run that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that

Baby I'm point like a thumbtack
And every time she leave I only focus on her comeback
Fuck these other bitches cause I already done that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that
We gotta run that
We gotta run that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that
We gotta run that
We gotta run that
And when you come back, you know we gotta run that
