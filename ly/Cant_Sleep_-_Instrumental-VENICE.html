		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must have had it coming for a while now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
Just to let you know that I don't mind now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me (okay to bring me)

Silence
Echoes back and forth between our islands
Suffocating don't know who to call
Sewing our demise until our eyelids shut closed
Can't stop
Taking more than we deserve it's futile
Tearing up the past but it won't go
Picking at the pieces of what we once called home

So run now
I can feel the thunder break ground
Water rising up so high I drown
Save us from ourselves now

Watching our temple fall to the ground
We sip as the walls, walls come down
Cracked the foundations
Fucked by our greed
Crushed as it falls, falls
Can't breathe
Can't sleep

I must have had it coming for a while now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
Just to let you know that I don't mind now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down

Surface slippy and now we're slipping
Got that feeling that we're going under dripping like a drowning city
We sit and watch as venice braces
While the forest fires burning in a thousand places
Don't cover it up you know she's gonna find out
She's had enough of us bringing her down
We've been busy, looking busy
Now we're fucked

Watching our temple fall to the ground
We sip as the walls, walls come down
Cracked the foundations
Fucked by our greed
Crushed as it falls, falls
Can't breathe
Can't sleep

I must have had it coming for a while now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
I must have had it coming for a while now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
I must have had it coming for a while now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
Just to let you know that I don't mind now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
I must have had it coming for a while now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
Just to let you know that I don't mind now
Just to let you know that I don't
Just to let you know that I don't

Watching our temple fall to the ground
We sip as the walls, walls come down
Cracked the foundations
Fucked by our greed
Crushed as it falls, falls
Can't breathe
Can't sleep

I must have had it coming for a while now (can't breathe)
Just to let you know that I don't mind now (can't sleep)
Giving you impressions it's okay now (can't breathe)
Just to let you know that I don't mind now
Just to let you know that I don't
Just to let you know that I don't (can't sleep)
I must have had it coming for a while now (can't breathe)
Just to let you know that I don't mind now
Giving you impressions it's okay to bring me down
