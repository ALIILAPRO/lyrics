		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deprived of appearance
Inexplicably pervasive
I need it, I need it
Feeding my inner demons
So that they can feed of me
Addicted, addicted
Always questioning
Always wondering
The clock still keeps on ticking
Will it ever stop, will it ever break
Or simply lose its sealing?

Set me free
Free from my self-inflicted borders
Show me how
To reverse the curve and start all over

Let me out
From the torments
Cause I can’t gloss over
Fill me up
Just give me a moment
Let me see the bright side
Help me out
Cause I’m rotting inside
Hands and feet tied
Let me out
For a moment
Cause I need it right now

Trapped in my feelings
Unsure if i’ll ever fully heal
Deluded, I’m tainted
No perfume is gonna be strong enough
To mask the filth
Till the end, infected
Always questioning
Always wondering
The clock still keeps on ticking
Will it ever stop, will it ever break
Or simply lose its sealing?

No matter what it could have been
It is what it is
I wish I knew how to tame the disease
To finally breathe in

Let me out
From the torments
Cause I can’t gloss over
Fill me up
Just give me a moment
Let me see the bright side
Help me out
Cause I’m rotting inside
Hands and feet tied
Let me out
For a moment
Cause I need it right now

Still don’t know where I belong
There’s something about me
That still needs to be killed
But I’m scared of what I’d become

I don’t feel guilty anymore
Interlinked more than ever before
Embracing the dissonance
Cause it’s obvious
I’ll be forever yours

Let me out
From the torments
Cause I can’t gloss over
Fill me up
Just give me a moment
Let me see the bright side
Help me out
Cause I’m rotting inside
Hands and feet tied
Let me out
For a moment
Cause I need it right now
