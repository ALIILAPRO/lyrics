		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i want you around i want you around
when your mind is a square locked in a circle
i want you around i want you around
when your heart is a snare but its a beat out
i want you

ahhhh the new shapes of a generation
ooooo the new shapes of a generation

i want you around i want you around
when your love is a drive stuck in the wrong lane
i want you around i want you around
when that boy in your head lives with a girls pain
i want you

ahhhh the new shapes of a generation
ooooo 

i want you around i want you around
cause we live and we die but to the same sound
i want you around

the new shapes of a generation
the new shapes the new shapes
the new shapes of a generation
the new shapes the new shapes
