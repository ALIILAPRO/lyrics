		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause

I'm standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the morning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out with the thorn bush that ya
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the bright side, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day's a new learning curve as you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standin' at inferno and chant

I'm standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

You're so familiarized with
What having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
'Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you will survive
Although today you may weep 'cause you're weak and
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive 'em even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
You look down 'cause you're so over 'em 
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream

I'm standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

And I'm standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
