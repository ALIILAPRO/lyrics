		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't make me hide
I've been puttin' up a fight
What's the use of it now
When I get pulled down anyways?
I've been hidin' my expression
You can't blame the reflections
And the ripples on the ground
I might as well have drowned

So I'm keepin' busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
Said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait 'til we get far
And tell me that you'll be gone soon

Feels too late right now
I've been holding back
'Cause I'm afraid that I'm too loud
Six feet underground
I feel alone again
Stuck between my friends
I guess I'll figure my way through them
Not sure how I'd do it
But I'm sure now
The people would listen
As the water glistens
Then I see my reflection
So much clearer

So I'm keepin' busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
Said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait 'til we get far
And tell me that you'll be gone soon
