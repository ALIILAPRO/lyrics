		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I need you 'til the morning
I hear my body calling
So keep the party rocking all night
Baby, oh, we can skip the talking
You know there's only one thing tonight
So won't you come rock my body?

Baby, I need you 'til the morning
I hear my body calling
So keep the party rocking all night
Baby, oh, we can skip the talking
You know there's only one thing tonight
So won't you come rock my body?

Coming in, coming in, so, so hot
Loving it, loving it, non, non stop
Another round, round
We double down, down
Bittersweet, bittersweet, one more shot
Let me see, let me see what you got
I want it right now
Yeah

Baby, I want you
So won't you come rock my body?
Body, body
Won't you come rock my body?

Baby, I need you 'til the morning
I hear my body calling
So keep the party rocking all night
Baby, oh, we can skip the talking
You know there's only one thing tonight
So won't you come rock my body?

It's in the air, just breathe it in
Another rush, it's kicking in
Under the lights, I feel you near
I want you close, I want you here
It's in the air, it's in the air

Baby, I need you 'til the morning
I hear my body calling
So keep the party rocking all night
Baby, oh, we can skip the talking
You know there's only one thing tonight
So won't you come rock my body?

Baby, I need you 'til the morning
I hear my body calling
So keep the party rocking all night
Baby, oh, we can skip the talking
You know there's only one thing tonight
So won't you come rock my body?

Won't you come rock my body?
Won't you come rock my body?
