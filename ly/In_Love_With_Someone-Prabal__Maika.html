		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in love
With someone
Who's in love
With someone
And that "someone" will never be...
Me
So let me tell you about
How I love the way you smile
And that smile
Someday will be
Mine
I don't know how to describe my feelings
Blonde hair, brown eyes the way you see me
Hoodie, beanie, baggy jeans and cap
You just walked into the coffee shop
While I am standing watching you
Wondering if I can know your name?
That was my thought
When we first met
Its so eerie
But its also sweet
Cause I seem to fall in love
With you
I'm in love
With someone
Who's in love
With someone
And that "someone"
Someday will be
Me
