		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seven days I'm going to call the wild in me
Carrying me, 'cross the world
Seven days I'm yours, I live all I need
To carry me to the north

You know if I could find the way to spend my days with you
Oh you know I would
You know if I could find the way to work it out with you
Oh you know I would

Seven days that can be long, that you lit a fire in me
When you told me I could go
Seven days, that can be hard when you lose all you need
Hold your hand, and your heart

You know if I could find the way to spend my days with you
Oh you know I would
You know if I could find the way to work it out with you
Oh you know I would

You know if I could find the way to spend my days with you
Oh you know I would
You know if I could find the way to work it out with you
Oh you know I would

You know if I could find the way to spend my days with you
Oh you know I would
