		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make love to me
Come on, come on, come on
Keep fuckin' me 'til the mornin'
Come on, come on
Kiss it, suck it, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Lick it, taste it
Ooh, I know you love it, say you love it
Baby, don't you? Ooh, oh

You've been flourishin' ever since you got that v
This pussy nurturing', fuck you back to sleep
I know it's nourishin', every time you went to me
'Cause just when you're ready to leave, you

Try to fuck me one more time
Left stroke, right stroke, out your mind
Beat that pussy 'til you're high
Fly, baby, fly, I know you can't

Wait to fuck me one more time
On the top, or on the bottom
Lookin' for it, yeah, I got it
Layin' there, like who shot ya? (Who shot ya?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(come on, come on)

Make love to me (make love to me)
Come on (come on), come on, come on
Keep fuckin' me 'til the mornin'
Come on, come on (come on)
Kiss it, suck it, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Lick it, taste it
Ooh, I know you love it, say you love it
Baby, don't you? Ooh, ohh
