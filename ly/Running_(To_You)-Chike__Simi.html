		  Haaa ah

Anybody wey wan fight you
Make them come they already know
I'll be right beside you like the wall of Jericho
They don't know they don't know
They don't know what's going on
Muna gi so Muna gi so
Muna gi so my baby boo
I'll be a soldier for you
I'm getting better in Kung-fu
You should know I got you
And you don't need to get me too
I'll be right beside you
In anything that you do
If you ever need saving
I will be running to you

Running running running to you
I'll be running to you
Running running running to you
Anywhere that you go to
Running running running to you
I'll be running to you
Running running running to you
Anywhere that you go to

When am looking for trouble
Is because I know that I got you
Woni mo n be si everybody ooh oh oh
And is because of your Kung-fu
And any time that I'm out of control
You hold me down you never ever let go
Muna gi so Muna gi so
Muna gi so my baby boo
See all about you we'll be fighting and I will be right there with you
I may be small but I'm mighty and I go run am for you
And anybody wey e sabi say yes if no be who kole da bi ra ra
And if I ever need saving I will be running to you

Running running running to you I'll be running
I'll be running to you
Running running running to you I'll be running eh eh eh eh
Anywhere that you go to
Running running running to you
I'll be running to you
Running running running to you will you wait for me you go dey for me
Anywhere that you go to anywhere that you go

You don’t need to worry anything you want oh
Sunup to sundown loving no go run down
Anytime you call me baby I go answer you
Any other baga baby make dem run away
And if you want me coming to you I go come through
Or you better see me baby don’t tease me
Tell me what you want baby say and na im I go do
Just me and you baby and you baby

If they wanna be the Judas
If they wanna be the Pharaoh
Me I cannot lay low yoo
Me I cannot do that
