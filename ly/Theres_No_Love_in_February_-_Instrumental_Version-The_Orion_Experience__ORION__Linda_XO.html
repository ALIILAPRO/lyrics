		  There's No Love in February

Where's the life that was promised to me by my color T.V. 
Where did it all go wrong?
How could I be alone again on this day?
on this accursed day. 
So naïve, such a fool to believe, I could ever receive,
anything better than this.  
Where's the love that can make it all go away?
Where are you when I need to hear you say...

Turn around, I'm right behind you.
Don't be afraid, I'm here to remind you.
I'll be there to catch you when you fall.
Dry your eyes, it's not so bad at all...

Well it's all made up, it's imaginary.
There's no love in February.

From the start I was played for a fool, when I got out of school,
I was handed a great big lie.
Cause they said, “Just believe in a dream and try”
Oh yeah? Well thirteen years have gone by.
cnd I'm still just running in a circle, never getting any further.
Just a loser doomed to work until I die.
Where's the love that can make it all go away?
Where are you when I need to hear you say...

Turn around, I'm right behind you.
Don't be afraid, I'm here to remind you.
I'll be there to catch you when you fall.
Dry your eyes, it's not so bad at all...

Well I spend my days still searchin' for ya
You took my heart to California.
Stuck with the  winter in New York City.
There's no love in February.

Everyday I get further away the love that we had,
Where did it all go bad?
No don't think I'll get out of bed today,
‘cause the sky is a permanent shade of grey.
cnd it's not like I'm getting any younger, no those days are gone forever.
cnd I never even got a chance  to try. 
Where's the love that can make it all go away,
Where were you when I needed to hear you say...

Turn around, I'm right behind you.
Don't be afraid, I'm here to remind you.
I'll be there to catch you when you fall.
Dry your eyes, it's not so bad at all...

cll made up, it's imaginary.
There's no love in February.
