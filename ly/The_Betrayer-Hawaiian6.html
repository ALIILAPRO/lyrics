		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't Know
What should I just believe in
I guess Jesus Christ
doesn't exist
And no one will help me out
in anyway
They all wear same mask
with a smile behind
The bees are Thronging around
the honey of misery
And the wounded one
will be ripped
Lies, what they are saying
from behind the screen
Lies, what they are saying
under politics
All the love that you whispered
It must be all lies too
I lost a god to pray
So I covered my ears again
Lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lies
The world is full of lies
Please wake me up now
And save me from here
If it's all just a nightmare
Lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lies
The world is full of lies
I'm betrayed by this world

The lies I made 'coz I couldn't
stand all alone anymore
The lies
I made not to be hurt anymore
The lies to deceive
The real betrayer was myself
And I Knew it
But I made myself a lie
I betrayed this world
Lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lies
The world is full of lies
Please wake me up now
And save me from here
If it's all just a nightmare
Lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lies
The world is full of lies
I'm betrayed by this world
