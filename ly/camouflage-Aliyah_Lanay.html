		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been stayin' out the way total camouflage
You can't see this
I'm movin' too low key
It don't make sense you only know the old me
Let's not pretend this wasn't even worth it
Ain't no room to hesitate could never compromise
Sumn's tellin' me to find me like who am I
Couldn't recognize myself had a disguise
Had to it take it back this is what it look like
Why I gotta be okay?
Drowning in these sounds don't save me
But I gotta take a breath
Knowing that it's gonna take all of me
You kiddin' me? It's literally us
Can't sit around sittin' on this phone
This new life is literally calling you
Don't let all the pressure be hard on you
But it's all on you
I be in my head and I know it's no excuse
Down to the wire
It's all on you
Nothing to lose
I been stayin' out the way total camouflage
You can't see this
I'm movin' too low key
It don't make sense you only know the old me
Let's not pretend this wasn't even worth it
Ain't no room to hesitate could never compromise
Sumn's tellin' me to find me like who am I
Couldn't recognize myself had a disguise
Had to it take it back this is what it look like
Why I gotta be okay?
Drowning in these sounds don't save me
But I gotta take a breath
Knowing that it's gonna take all of me
