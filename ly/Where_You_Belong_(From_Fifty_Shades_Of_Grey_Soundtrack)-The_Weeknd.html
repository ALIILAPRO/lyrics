		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I feel the blood rushin' throughout ya body
You see the scars painted over my skin (mhm, mhm)
I'm always numb to the topic of loving (mhm, mhm)
I fell in love with the subject of sin, oh

I don't have to remind you, oh, oh (oh)
It's my need to confine you, oh, oh (na-na, na-na, na-na)
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? (Put your feelings behind you)
I don't have to remind you, oh, oh (I don't have to remind you)
Oh, whoa-ooh, woah, oh

Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong) (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong) (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Where you belong (where you belong) (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Where you belong (where you belong, long, long)

I'm in control, when you give me your body, yeah
I feel our souls burnin' up when I'm inside of you and I
And I'ma leave a mark, just to remind you
Where you belong, baby
Give me your all, scream as loud as you want

I don't have to remind you, oh, oh (oh, oh, yeah)
It's my need to confine you (to confine you), oh, oh (tell me now)
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? (Put your feelings behind you)
I don't have to remind you, oh (don't have to remind you) 
(I don't have to) Oh 
I don't

Where you belong
Where you belong
Where you belong
Where you belong
Where you belong (oh)
Where you belong (tell me)
Where you belong
Where you belong (oh)

Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (oh, where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong, tell me baby)
Where you belong (where you belong)
Where you belong (where you belong, long, long)

Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, yeah
Oh-ooh

Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, yeah
Oh-ooh

Mhm, mhm
