		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me say since, babe
Since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever
Is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue, oh baby

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue, oh baby

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, oh tell me, why do people break up
Oh, then turn around and make up?
I just came to see
You'd never do that to me, would you, baby?
'Cause being around you is all I see

So baby, let's, we oughta stay together ('gether)
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Let's, ooh (let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
