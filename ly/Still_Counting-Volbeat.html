		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Counting all the assholes in the room
Well, I'm definitely not alone, well, I'm not alone
You're a liar, you're a cheater, you're fool
Well, that's just like me, ooh-ooh, and I know you too
Mr. Perfect don't exist, my little friend
And I tell you that again, and I do it again
Counting all the assholes in the room
Well, I'm definitely not alone, well, I'm not alone, ah

Look deep into yourself before you blame
All others for betrayal, now for betrayal
I promise, so easy to say, and easy you failed
And you do it again

Well, the music seems to cover
And the light went through the colors
Well, I turn my back and go for
All the better things in order

Well, maybe you think your lie is safe
But I read you like a letter, yeah, like a letter
Your charms do not even the pain
It fills me with rage, and you do it again

Well, the music seems to cover
And the light went through the colors
Well, I turn my back and go for
All the better things in order

Well, the music seems to cover
And the light went through the colors
Well, I turn my back and go for
All the better things in order

And the gangster keep on telling
That he got a song that matters
So I flip a coin towards him
Thank you very much for listening
