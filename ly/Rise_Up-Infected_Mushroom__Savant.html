		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rise up rise up

You gotta rise up
You got a second chance to dance
You gotta rise up
Oh, revenge is sweet, it is in your feet
You gotta rise up
Show 'em how we roll, on the dance floor
You gotta rise up
Like a phoenix through the flames

You gotta rise up
That's how you get on top
That's how you stay on top
You gotta rise up
When they eliminate, you gotta levitate
You gotta rise up when they give you pain
You gotta up the gain you gotta rise up
Like a phoenix through
The motherfucking flames

Now take your things, come let's go
Where no one has gone before
I'll see you out there on the floor
And everyone wants some more

You gotta rise up
You got a second chance to dance
You gotta rise up
Oh, revenge is sweet, it is in your feet
You gotta rise up
Show 'em how we roll, on the dance floor
You gotta rise up
Like a phoenix through the flames

You gotta rise up
That's how you get on top
That's how you stay on top
You gotta rise up
When they eliminate, you gotta levitate
You gotta rise up when they give you pain
You gotta up the gain you gotta rise up
Like a phoenix through
The motherfucking flames

Now take your things, come let's go
Where no one has gone before
I'll see you out there on the floor
And everyone wants some more

(Aaah, aaah) (Aaah, aaah, ah)
