		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are coming home, are you still alone?
Are you not the same as you used to be?
As the sun grows high and you serve your time 
Does each day just feel like another lie?

Now you know, is it just for show?
Just a foolish game that you hide behind?
Don't forget the nights when it all felt right 
Are you not the same as you used to be?

Used to be
Used to be

In an endless night
Could you feel the fright of an age that was and could never be?
So we hold it close when we feel the most 
Like a love that we could not leave behind

Turn the wheel to each way we feel 
'Til I'm lost and I cannot find you there
Don't forget the nights when it all felt right 
Are you not the same as you used to be?

Used to be
Used to be

Coming home any day now
Any day now
Any day now

Coming home any day now
Any day now
Any day now

Coming home any day now
Any day now
Any day now
Any day now
