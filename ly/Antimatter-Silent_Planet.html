		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silhouette
Guilty conscience
Barely hanging by a breath
Cut the lights and make me your oblivion
And I will follow
Through the phosphorescent streets
I'd give anything to be in over my head

Aftermath
Broken promises collapse
Bodies lay like shattered glass
Hold the pieces, feel how nothing ever lasts
With tunnel vision fading in
How I've thirsted for the end
Pull me closer 'til I'm in over my head

We are broken bodies bound for each other
In the impact we become antimatter
The dust hasn't settled but we feel the decay
Torn limb from limb I am swearing your name
Our hands collide, we brace together
In the impact we become antimatter

We're waiting in the wreckage for the sun to rise
I'm staring at the fractures 
No one else can see they're so complete
When morning comes will there be anyone left to find?
My vision starts to surrender as colors subvert the night

Stolen by auroras, our bodies realign
Magnetic in the impulse show me the other side
Suspended in the ether 'til I felt you in my chest
I know we're not alone, but I'm in over my head

We are broken bodies bound for each other
In the impact we become antimatter
The dust hasn't settled but we feel the decay
Torn limb from limb I am swearing your name
Our hands collide, we brace together
In the impact we become antimatter
