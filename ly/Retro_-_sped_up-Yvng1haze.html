		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm feeling retro today
Lil bro know I ain't come to play
They know I came to slay
Girl I'm one drive away

I gotta stay with the team
That's why I'm shooting all green
I feel like Mr.Clean
Stay to fast just like a beam

I'm feeling retro today
Lil bro know I ain't come to play
They know I came to slay
Girl I'm one drive away

I gotta stay with the team
That's why I'm shooting all green
I feel like Mr.Clean
Stay to fast just like a beam

Yeah bro you ain't my og
In a way you cannot feel me
I know they cannot hear me
Yeah, they cannot treat me

When they see they say my my
You got no drip you is dry
Too much heat don't get fried
Packing that heat you might die

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I gotta stay ten toes
I got the right pose
He is short he's micro

I'm the best in the room
Y'all ain't seeing noon
Animals in the zoo
This ain't a legion but it gon boom

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm feeling retro today
Lil bro know I ain't come to play
They know I came to slay
Girl I'm one drive away

I gotta stay with the team
That's why I'm shooting all green
I feel like Mr.Clean
Stay to fast just like a beam

I'm feeling retro today
Lil bro know I ain't come to play
They know I came to slay
Girl I'm one drive away

I gotta stay with the team
That's why I'm shooting all green
I feel like Mr.Clean
Stay to fast just like a beam

I'm feeling retro today
Lil bro know I ain't come to play
They know I came to slay
Girl I'm one drive away

I gotta stay with the team
That's why I'm shooting all green
I feel like Mr.Clean
Stay to fast just like a beam

I'm feeling retro today
Lil bro know I ain't come to play
They know I came to slay
Girl I'm one drive away

I gotta stay with the team
That's why I'm shooting all green
I feel like Mr.Clean
Stay to fast just like a beam
