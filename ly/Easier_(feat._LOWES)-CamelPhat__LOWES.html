		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the sun never quite rises in London
As I cross over the bridge
I wanna drink and smoke and kiss
And be kids

Oh, just to be oblivious, what bliss
Such happiness is this
Embraced in the arms of our own consciousness

I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier

I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier

Well, I don't know how I feel, love
But I know that I can feel love
Can you see, can you see, can you see
What you've done to me?

Just check out for an hour or two
Let the devil tell me what to do
Oh, can you see, can you see, can you see
What you've done to me?

I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier

I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier

I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
