		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like the lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

Talk to me like lovers do
Walk with me like lovers do
Talk to me like lovers do
Ooh, oh

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like the lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

Talk to me like lovers do
Walk with me, like lovers do
Talk to me like lovers do
Yeah

So talk to me like lovers do
Walk with me, like lovers do
Talk to me like lovers do
Yeah

Here it comes again
Here it comes again now
Here it comes again

Here it comes
Here it comes again

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
Here it comes again
Here it comes again

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like the lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion
Here it comes again
Here it comes again

I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like the lovers do and
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
