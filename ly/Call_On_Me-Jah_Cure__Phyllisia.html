		  Hey oh
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah I
Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yeah I
All my ladies, all my ladies now
Cure again, yeah I

Anytime you need a lover call on me, I'll be waiting
Anytime you need a lover call on me, my heart is aching
Call on me, anytime you want to
Call on me baby girl I want you, ah huh

We grew together from way back when
She was nine and I was ten
She used to be, my next door neighbor
She even went to school with my sister Makayla yeah
Now were two grown folks, years gone by and we still keep close
Loving me, I'm loving her the same
I just want you to know that I love you so oh

Anytime you need a lover call on me, I'll be waiting
Anytime you need a lover call on me, my heart is aching
Call on me, anytime you want to
Call on me baby girl I want you, ah huh

Loving like they met the same
We were young and playing games
I fell in love the first time I saw you
And I don't ever worry cause I know can call you yeahh
Now were two grown folks, years gone by and we still keep close
He's lovin me, I'm lovin him the same as

Anytime you need a lover call on me, I'll be waiting
Anytime you need a lover call on me, my heart is aching
Call on me, anytime you want to
Call on me baby girl I want you, ah huh

Now we've reached so far (reached so far)
We won't turn back again (yeah I)
Love, lovin' you (lovin' you)
There is no end (no end, no end, no end, nooo)
Lovin' you, ah

Anytime you need a lover call on me, I'll be waiting
Anytime you need a lover call on me, my heart is aching
Call on me, anytime you want to
Call on me baby girl I want you, ah huh
