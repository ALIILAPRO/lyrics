		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What the fuck? Fuck you sayin'?
I'm back (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm back, bitch
I'm back, yeah

What's the plan? (What's the plan?)
We gon' slide (we gon' slide)
Dirty hands (dirty hands)
We doin' crimes (we doin' crimes)
Check your mans (check your mans)
He want beef (he want beef)
Okay, it's up (okay, it's up)
We leave him leakin' (we leave him leakin', yeah, yeah)

What's the plan? (What's the plan?)
We gon' slide (we gon' slide)
Dirty hands (yo' hands)
We doin' crimes (we do crimes)
Check your mans (check your mans)
He want beef (he want beef)
Okay, it's up (okay, it's up)
We leave him leakin' (we leave him leakin')
Let's go

Hope all of you broke-ass niggas good listeners (good listeners)
Welcome to my class, listen up (yeah)
I'ma kill all of you niggas (yeah, yeah)
Leave your fuckin' blood cold like Whistler
You niggas just some motherfuckin' visitors (uh, uh, uh)
I gets the hoes, I'm a low-key freak when I get drunk
Bitch, I'm gettin' what I want, mama didn't raise a punk (bitch)
Lately, I been in a funk, had to disappear from life
What would happen if I blew my fuckin' brains out with a rifle?
These are real thoughts, not a motherfuckin' haiku (I swear)
On a higher level, I ain't talkin' 'bout my IQ (yup)
Leave a nigga bloody, bloody like my name is Ryu (that sucks)
They say you got money, who the fuck did you lie to? (What? What? Yeah)
Give me all the motherfuckin' chips, and I'll stack it up (right)
You think that I'm lyin', I got proof just to back it up (right)
Line 'em up, I take niggas bitches and I clap 'em up (back it, back it, back it, back it)
If you don't abide by the rules, we gon' (brrap) you up
Bitches don't approach me, guess it's 'cause of my demeanor (scared bitch)
Menor niggas piss me off, spin the block like a ballerina (yeah)
Feel like gettin' my dick wet, callin' up Marisa, Gina (I call them)
Fuck it, I'll settle for Lisa 'cause she's the meanest eater
Tried and tried so many goddamn times
But still, I find myself up front center (center)
A blessin' and a curse (a curse), hope it don't get worse (it is)
You say you fucked him? Bitch, take your ass to church (yeah, ayy, ayy)
Roll call, roll call, callin' all the fuck boys
Finally, I can see you face to face, bitch, what's up, boy?
You think this a joke?
Tie them niggas up, throw them in the trunk
You know how the fuckin' story goes
