		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  May you come undone, so why don't you let your hair down?
Your voice is my fate
Your touch is my text 
I only wish to see nothing at all
Your master is my mind, you speak so loudly
I only wish I could want none at all

You so special so they told me so why still lie about yourself?
Your voice is my fate 
Your touch is my text
I only wish to see nothing at all
Your master is my mind, speak so loudly 
I only wish i could want nothing at all
Your master is my mind, speak softly
I only wish I could want every time
Your master is my mind you speak so loudly
I only wish I could want every time
