		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been outside all night long
Lookin' for some signs in the stars
I need some insight to your heart
I been outside all night
I been outside all night long
Lookin' for some signs in the stars
I need some insight to your heart
I been outside all night

Told me all the things I wanna hear
You been outside all night long
Told me all the things I wanna hear
You been outside all night long 

Yeah
Shit was lit from the jump, but ain't no fun when it end
Just don't go fuck my friend, just don't go fuck my friend
That's out of spite or revenge, she said, "Better call in advance"
When I pull up in a Benz, when I pull up in a Benz
We can sit, chew gum in the Benz, they call us Doublemint twins
They don't know my government name
They don't know that's a name we share
We don't do no ho, no sharin'
We don't do no pics, no starin'
And her ice all white like Karens
And we shine so bright like Paris
Got me singin' outside of your window, stereo and stones
Throwin' rocks up at your window out my comfort zone
Tell your folks, "Don't be alarmed," I hope your mama ain't home
This about the fifty-hunnid time you curved my call
Ain't no simp, nah, we ain't on simp
We on pimp, that's word to Brent
Ho, don't flip (ho, don't switch)
Block on my chip on my shoulder
Glock on my hip, I'm a soldier
I'm content off the rip
If you do dip, I'm a loner, uh (yeah)

I been outside all night long
Lookin' for some signs in the stars
I need some insight to your heart
I been outside all night
I been outside all night long
Lookin' for some signs in the stars
I need some insight to your heart
I been outside all night

Told me all the things I wanna hear
You been outside all night long

If I let you in
Can you promise you won't be outside doin' me wrong?
'Cause I can't be out here just fuckin' on anybody
Can you show me, and not just anybody?
But I'll treat you just like everybody

I been outside all night long
Lookin' for some signs in the stars
I need some insight to your heart
I been outside all night
I been outside all night long
Lookin' for some signs in the stars
I need some insight to your heart
I been outside all night
