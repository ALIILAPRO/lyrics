		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I sleep in your brain tonight, stranger?
Can I rest my bones in your head?
I won't make too much noise
While I stay here
I just need some kind of shelter

Anywhere I try to go
I'm still stuck in my own skull
And lately
That's no kind of place to call home
All the walls are falling down
Garbage lying all around
Is there maybe room
In your temporal lobe?

Can I sleep in your brain tonight, stranger?
Can I spend one night on your mind?
I can't live with this pain
With this anger
And I need someplace else to go

I wanna sleep in your brain
I wanna wake you up early
I wanna make you black coffee if
You like (yeah)

I'll do whatever's required of me
To have the roof of your brain
Above me, I've got nowhere else 
I can stay tonight

Can I sleep in your brain?
Can I sleep in your brain?

Can I sleep in your brain

Can I sleep in your brain
Can I sleep in your
Can I can I
Can I sleep I your brain?
Can I can I come over?
Can I sleep in your brain?
Can I come over?
Can I can I sleep
Can I come over?
Oh, sleep in your brain
Can I can I sleep
Can I come over?
Can I sleep in your brain?
