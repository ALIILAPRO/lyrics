		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Given all I can
For the last time
Find an easier branch
To hang your heart around
What are you standing there
Waiting for?
Given all your life plans
You should feel assured

In the balmy air
Everyone's around
Every young one that you've
Wrapped your arms around
In the fog on a ferry
Night ride to flee your shore
I wished not to you have known

Didn't it fail at the start line?
Don't we happen of the same kind?
Build your home on another fault line
And deal with your ashes there
And I'll here deal with mine
