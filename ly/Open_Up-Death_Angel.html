		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just can't believe what I'm seeing
It makes me sick inside
Condemned by the world around me
I'm not gonna run and hide
I'm gonna come alive
Ain't gonna take no jive
Open up your sewn shut eyes
Your disappearing eyes

When I'm walking down the street
People turn and stare at me
As if I couldn't feel their eyes
They're living in a world of fear and lies

Best loosen up and take it in stride
The world don't need egotistical pride

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
And see the light
Just do it

Must you choose to shut your mind
I look deep but nothing do I find
You're so tough hey put it on a shelf
You've got to come out of yourself

Knock knock knock but no one's home
Excuse me please but I'm sick of society
'Cause you are you and I am me
And if we don't agree
Just let it be

Open up your eyes
And see the light
Just do it
