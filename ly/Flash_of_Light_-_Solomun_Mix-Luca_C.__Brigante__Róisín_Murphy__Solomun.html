		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cm I just tripping?

No you won't be coming down
You'll fall asleep and never, be coming round
You say your last goodbye
No you won't be coming down

No we won't be late
Would you make me wait
When there's so little time?
Like a dying star, a fireball
Made the orange sky

Take me down to the edge of here
Take me now, I know what ready is
cnd I'm running to the sound

Counting down to the end of the end game
The sands of time are running out
Take me down I don't wanna live
With an ordinary, ordinary sky

One last flash of brilliance
One more blinding light
The last dead beat descendants
We're going into the night
The last time I held you
I held you so tight
That I want
One last flash of brilliance
One more night to thrill you
Well I ask, one last
Flash of light

I ask, one last
Flash of light

I know I was wrong
I know I was wrong

One last flash of brilliance
One more blinding light
The last dead beat descendants
cre going into the night
The last time I held you
I held you so tight
That I want
One last flash of brilliance
One more night to thrill you
Well I ask, one last
Flash of light

Loving you is easy
It's the leaving that scarred
Loving you is easy
It's the leaving that's hard
Time moves slow
When you're all alone
Time moves slow
When you're on your own 
Time moves slow
When you' miss a friend
Time moves slow
When you leave again 

One last flash of brilliance
One more blinding light
The last dead beat descendants
cre going into the night

Flash of light
Going into the night

cin't nobody 
Gonna give you
What we got
There aint nobody
Gonna give you
What it is 
that we got
Cos there aint nobody
cin't no one 
There aint nobody
cin't no one
Cos there aint nobody

Gonna give you
Gonna love you 
Like I do
There ain't no-one

cin't nobody
Flash of light 

One last flash of brilliance
One more blinding light
The last dead beat descendants
cre going in
cre going in
cre going in
cre going in
To the night 
To the night 

Running away is easy
It's the leaving that's hard
Running away is easy
It's the living that's hard

Loving you was easy
It's the leaving that scarred 
Loving you is easy
It's the leaving that's hard

Loving you
Easy
Leaving you
Hard
Leaving you
Hard
Time moves slow
Time moves slow
Time moves slow
Time moves 
So slowly
