		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
He wants to dance, he loves to dance, he's got to dance
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance

The minute the band begins to swing it
He's on his feet to dig it and dance the night away
Sundown, instead of going downtown
We'll stay at home and get down to what I'm tryin' to say

Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
He wants to dance, he loves to dance, he's got to dance
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
Oh, I love to love
But there's no time for our romance
No, no, no

The minute the band begins to swing it
He's on his feet to dig it and dance the night away
Stop, I'm spinning like a top
We'll dance until we drop, but if I had my way
Sundown, instead of going downtown
We'll stay at home and get down to what I'm tryin' to say

Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
He wants to dance, he loves to dance, he's got to dance
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
Oh, I love to love
But there's no time for our romance
No, no, no

I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance, yes, he does
I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance, yes, he does
