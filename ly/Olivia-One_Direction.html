		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Four to three (and then)
And then you gotta play, lost your part
Which means you rest for four bars"

"Right, three, stop, then three"

Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (hey hey)
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (hey hey)
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing you
The consequences of falling out
There's something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with you

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (hey hey)
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (hey hey)
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

When you go and I'm alone
You live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, it's all I do
I love you

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (hey hey)
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (hey hey)
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go (Olivia)

"No way"
