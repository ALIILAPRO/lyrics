		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew it was there
Though I tried to hide it
The feeling just kept on shining through
Haven't known you that long
So I try to deny it
But the feeling was much
Too much too strong

Could this be love
Deep down inside
Tearing me apart
I feel it in my heart

CHORUS:
Constantly, you're on my mind
Thinking about you all the time
I can't sleep no matter what I do
I just keep on thinking â€˜bout you

Why do I feel this way
When I know you have someone
That you're seeing in each and everyday
Should I play this game
Of just being your friend
When I know that's not where I want it to end

How could this be wrong
When the feeling so strong
Tearing me apart
I feel it in my heart

::Repeat Chorus 2x

No I don't want to start
No trouble
Between you and I and your lover
But I must tell you what I'm going through
Everytime you walk by
I see love in your eyes

::Repeat Chorus 2X
