(Mike Will Made-it)
We gon' always get money, man
Young Jeezy, Big Sean, Juicy J
(Ear Drummers)
Boss shit, nigga, let's get it

Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out (yeah)
Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out (ayy)
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out (that's right)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (mhm)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (mhm)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (yeah)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (we gettin' it)

Trippy niggas and a few hoes
One night, two shows
That's two mansions and a team expansion
Thumbin' through a check, got me sweatin' and pantin'
When you gettin' money chicks come around
Niggas start hatin', who's holdin' you down
All this ice, I'm just livin' the life
Bad bitches want me, give me head like lice (ho)
Hit club LIV in a rush
Pockets so swole I think they finna bust
Ace in my hand and a .45 tuck
Money comin' down codeine pourin' up
Smokin' on some dope, always on a float
Twenty years in niggas call me the G.O.A.T
Money addin', up you haters going broke (broke)
Still in the game while you niggas ridin' oak (the bench)
See me showin' out, they muggin, I don't give a fuck
How I start my morning off, a zip and a double cup
Hatin' ass niggas, y'all behind me
Ball so hard they want to fine me
Juicy J, Taylor Gang
I been rich since the 90's

Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (whoa)
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out (yeah, boi, boi)
Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out (ayy)
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out (yeah, freaky)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (freaky)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (God)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (Juicy, what up though?)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (let's go)

All these ratchets hoes say I ain't shit (yeah, ho)
Well, at least I ain't broke, ho (yeah, ho)
Stackin' paper like old folks (yeah, ho)
And you still stayin' with your old folks (yeah, ho)
She a fan, that's fantastic, poppin' Xannies, that's xantastic
Gettin' rich, band-tastic, white girls like Anne Hatha-
Way going, way out, they wait for my bandwagon (yeah)
She let me bang and I ain't got a bandana
Ooh (freaky), that's just how I move
Fast girls, fast money, no more fast food
Came up first class, my passport gettin' tattooed (boi, boi)
Young ass playa doing everythin' that I have to, so

Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out (yeah)
Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out (ayy)
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out (that's right)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (hey)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (yeah)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (huh)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (let's go)

I got some bad bitches with me
Say they like Rihanna, love Whitney
When she say how many bottles do you want, I told her fifty
She say anything else? Yeah, bitch a kidney
Every time I go out, you know I bring that dough out
Finesse is on a milli', it lookin' like a blowout
Hunnid bitches with me, look like I left the whore house
Hunnid racks with me, look like I left the blow house
Now we poppin' bottles, they came with the sparkles
Got my niggas with me, they came with them yoppers
Got a few ratchets, even a couple models
Twenty car caravan, I bet they gon' follow, ugh

Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out (yeah)
Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out (ayy)
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out (that's right)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (hey)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (yeah)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (hey)
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out (let's go)
