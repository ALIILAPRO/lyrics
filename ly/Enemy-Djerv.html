		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, no. It's coming back to me. 
All the images I never wanted to see again. 
Again, they keep on haunting me. 
No way to forget the nightmare that was to be.

This is my legacy. My greatest enemy is closing in. Look away.
This is my love affair. Forever my despair. Closing in. Look away.

Now Im in love with her. My dark friend.
Always a part of me. All that I can see. 
How bad can it be? Just play the game. 
No matter what I do it turns out the same.

Cause She will kick you down, and she'll tear you apart.
Youre worth nothing to me, bleed you out from the start. 

This is my legacy. My greatest enemy is closing in. Look away.
This is my love affair. Forever my despair. Closing in. 

I can't die in someone else's skin.
Just be myself, that's how I win.
This is my legacy. My greatest enemy is closing in. Look away.

You said you'd never gonna leave me.
My darkened heart, you wouldn't carry.
Don't you have any more to say?
So hard to let you creep away. 

This is my legacy. My greatest enemy is closing in. Look away.
This is my love affair. Forever my despair. Closing in. 

I can't die in someone else's skin. 
Just be myself, that's how I win.
This is my legacy. My greatest enemy is closing in. Look away.
