		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot ya

There ain't no looking back I'll never be the same
I'mma spend a cool 200 on a diamond chain
In the strip club 'til the sun up I'mma make it rain
I'm all about the money, never wanted fame
They let a brown boy in the game and I'mma fuck it up
Nobody fucking with you, you should know you fucking up
Remember I was feeling down, now things are looking up
My pockets was so empty now them Franklins fill 'em up
Used to have a manager that was a jank
Cash found me I put gas in my belly tank
They have Body locked up, holdin' down a shank
Now he cash out like he holding up the bank

I'm driving foreign whips, spent a hundred on my wrist
I might take your bitch, private flight, take a trip
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
Your bills be stacking up while I'm stacking up my chips
Your bitch on my dick, when she see me, want a flick
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich

I fucked around and got my bands up
He see XO in the club, can't stand us
You better have your stick, can't stab or fight us
My team is solid and they can't divide us
I heard another opp just died, roll one and light up
You say that's your girl, then why she standing beside us?
Smoking so much blunts that I ran out of lighters
Me and mama used to cut the coupons out the flyers
She thought that her man was fly but now I'm flyer
Say he got more money than me, he's a liar
His bitch isn't worth a penny, I could buy her
Doing burnouts in my 'Rari, spend this check on tires

I'm driving foreign whips, spent a hundred on my wrist
I might take your bitch, private flight, take a trip
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
Your bills be stacking up while I'm stacking up my chips
Your bitch on my dick, when she see me, want a flick
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich

I'm driving foreign whips, spent a hundred on my wrist
I might take your bitch, private flight, take a trip
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
Your bills be stacking up while I'm stacking up my chips
Your bitch on my dick, when she see me, want a flick
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
I used to be down, I fucked around and I got rich
