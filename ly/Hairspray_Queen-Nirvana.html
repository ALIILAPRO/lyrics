		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was young my an' you were mine. 
My enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was once. 
You ene... 

You rang 
Your ears rang 

I was young my an' you were mine. 
My enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was once. 
You ene... 

At night wishfull godess 
At night crystal locket 
At night mouth of almounds 
At sight a fish full of garbage 
At night disco god. 

I was young my an' you were mine. 
My enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was once. 
You ene... 

At night the wishfull godess 
At night crystal locket 
At night mouth of almounds 
At sight a fish full of garbage 
At night disco god. 

I was young my an' you were mine. 
My enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was young. 
Your enemy you were, my an' I was once. 
You ene... 

At night she was so modest 
At night crystal locket 
At night mouth of almounds 
At sight a fish full of garbage 
At night disco god. 

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
