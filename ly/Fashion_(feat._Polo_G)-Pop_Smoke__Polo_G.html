		  (Rico's going crazy again)
(CashMoneyAP) Yeah
I feel like makin' a hundred fifty K today
If they lock me, they lock me up
It don't matter, my mom still gon' love me
Look

Get straight (get straight)
To the cash (to the cash)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion
Get straight (get straight)
To the cash (to the cash)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion

All this aggression (all this aggression)
And all of this action (and all of this action)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion
All this aggression (all this aggression)
And all of this action (and all of this action)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion

Glock nine (Glock nine), thirty (thirty)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion
On my neck (on my neck), thirty (thirty)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion
Get away (get away), dirty (dirty)
You won't look good with this fashion
You won't look good with this fashion
Get away (get away), dirty (dirty)
You won't look good with this fashion
You won't look good with this fashion
My moves (my moves), sturdy (sturdy)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion
Let it ring (let it ring), birdie (birdie)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion

Get straight (get straight)
To the cash (to the cash)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion
Get straight (get straight)
To the cash (to the cash)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion

All this aggression (all this aggression)
And all of this action (and all of this action)
Looking good in all this fashion
It's looking good in all this fashion
All this aggression (all this aggression)
And all of this action (and all of this action)
Looking good in all this fashion
It's looking good in all this fashion (uh, uh)

Didn't I say not to mention us?
Fuck it, we slidin', 'cause I'm tired of tellin' you that
Fuck all the opps, why the fuck is they claimin' the block where them niggas don't ever be at?
Throwin' up L's for twin, I'm droppin' the rakes
And you know that I kept me a strap
Slept on the floor at my auntie crib
Under the pillow, that's where my little Wesson was at
I told my shawty "Stop woofin' with niggas on Facebook"
I taught you better than that
He say he ridin' with him 'til they switch
Start twitchin', that bitch got him pedalin' back, uh
Say he gon' do some, what?
Them hitters, I keep a few in the cut
Bro got the low on they party, we go end it early
Come through and start shootin' it up
Fonem keep eatin' them X pills like candy
He just keep chewin' them up
I signed a deal but still ride on the block
Yeah, everyday, I ain't been to the stu' in a month
Nah, we ain't Crips, but we lurkin' for blood
Tryna turn their whole crew into runts
So, bitch, when they shoot, better duck
If you lackin', then you out of luck, gang, gang

Get straight (get straight)
To the cash (to the cash)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion
Get straight (get straight)
To the cash (to the cash)
Looking good in all this fashion
Looking good in all this fashion

All this aggression (all this aggression)
And all of this action (and all of this action)
Looking good in all this fashion
It's looking good in all this fashion
All this aggression (all this aggression)
And all of this action (and all of this action)
Looking good in all this fashion
It's looking good in all this fashion
