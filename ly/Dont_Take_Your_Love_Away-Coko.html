		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darkchild ninety-nine, uh
You feel that?  I like that
Coko, uh-huh
Bigga, uh, uh, check it out, come on

[Chorus]
Don't take your love away
And make me lonely
'Cause I need you here with me
To make me happy
My heart belongs to you
You're my everything
And I love the joy you bring to me, baby

I think about all the times you're here with me
And when you come around; no one else can compete
'Cause I love you so much; you're all that I need
And without you there's no me, so don't you leave
Yeah

'Cause I need your love to stay
(Stay right here with me)
That's the way it's got to be
(I need it; I need it)
Never take your love away
(It belongs to me)
Promise you'll stay here with me
(Oh, whoa)

[Chorus]

I don't want to think of you not here with me
I cannot imagine what my life would be
So, baby, just stay right here with me, yeah, yeah
Yes, you and me, that's the way it got's to be, yeah


'Cause I need your love to stay
(Stay right here with me)
That's the way it's got to be
(I need it; I need it)
Never take your love away
(It belongs to me)
Promise you'll stay here with me
(Oh, whoa)

[Chorus]
