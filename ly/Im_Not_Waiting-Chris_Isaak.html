		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting.
I have pictures in my troubled past,
And their shaped like broken glass.
I have memories I kept of you,
I return them with goodbyes.
Cause I'm not waiting for you anymore,
I don't care what might have been.
I'm not waiting for you anymore,
I give up my love can't win.

[Chorus]
But in my heart, my heart, I know that though I go I'll love you still.
But in my heart, my heart, I know that though I go I always will.
I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting.

I still think about what used to be,
I have dreams that might have been.
Someone else will walk beside you soon,
Now I know my love can't win.
So I'm not waiting for you anymore,
I don't care what might have been.
I'm not waiting for you anymore,
I give up so why pretend?

[Chorus]
