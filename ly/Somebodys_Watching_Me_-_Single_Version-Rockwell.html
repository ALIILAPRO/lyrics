		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's watching?
Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight zone and?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (oh, oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (oh, oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

(Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching?)
Well, is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (who?) 
The IRS?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (oh, oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

I always feel like somebody's watching me (hee-hee-hee)
And I have no privacy (oh, oh, oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me (oh, oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Show me who can it be (hee-hee-hee)
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me (oh, oh, oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me

Who's playing tricks on me? (Who could it be?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Can I have my privacy? (oh, oh, oh-oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me? (Who could it be?)
