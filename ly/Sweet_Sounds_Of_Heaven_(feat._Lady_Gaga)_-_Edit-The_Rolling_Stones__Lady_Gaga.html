		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear the sweet, sweet sounds of Heaven
Fallin' down, fallin' down to this earth
I hear the sweet, sweetest sounds of Heaven
Driftin' down, driftin' down to this earth
Bless the Father, bless the Son, hear the sound of the drums
As it echoes through the valley, it bursts, yeah
Let no woman or child go hungry tonight
Please protect us from the pain and the hurt, yeah

I smell the sweet scents (sweet)
Sweet scents of Heaven (Heaven)
Tumblin' down (tumblin' down)
Tumblin' down to the earth (oh)
I hear the sweet sounds (sweet sounds)
The sweet sounds (ooh, the sweet sounds of children) of children
And they're praisin' (praisin')
The land of their birth 

(No) no, I'm not going to hell
In some dusty motel
And I'm not, not goin' down
In the dirt (yes, yes, yes)
I'm gonna laugh (I'm gonna laugh)
I'm gonna cry (I'm gonna cry)
Eat the bread, drink the wine
'Cause I'm finally, finally quenchin' my thirst, yeah

You can't have a light without a little shadow, yeah
Always need a target for your bow and arrow
I want to be drenched in the rain
Of your heavenly love, oh, yeah, c'mon

Let the music (let the music) play loud (play loud)
Let it burst (let it burst) through the clouds (through the clouds)
And we all feel the heat
Of the sun, yeah
Yeah, let us sing
Let us shout (let us shout)
Let us all stand up proud (all stand up proud)
Let the old still believe that they're young, yeah

Sweet, sweet sound
Sounds so sweet (oh, so sweet)
Sounds so sweet (so sweet)
(Heaven, Heaven)
Down, falling down (falling down) to this earth

(I hear the sweet sounds of Heaven)
Play me somethin', Stevie

I smell the sweet, sweet scents of Heaven
Comin' down (comin' down), comin' down (comin' down)
To the earth (from the earth)
(Oh yeah) oh yeah
(Oh yeah) oh yeah
(Oh yeah) oh yea-yeah
(Yes, c'mon)
Ooh (c'mon)
C'mon, ooh (c'mon)
Come, ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah, yeah)

Hear the Gods laughing from above
(Of Heaven)
Fallin' down, fallin' down
(To this earth) oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me lay down and sleep
Your, your Heaven (Heaven)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
