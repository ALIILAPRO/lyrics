		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Past the point of no return
No backward glances
The games we've played 'til now are at an end

Past all thought of if or when
No use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us

Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm, unspoken secrets will we learn
Beyond the point of no return?

You have brought me
To that moment where words run dry
To that moment where speech disappears into silence
Silence

I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined our bodies entwining, defenseless and silent
And now I am here with you, no second thoughts
I've decided, decided

Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud bursts into bloom?
When will the flames at last consume us?

Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return

Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude

Say you want me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go, too
Christine, that's all I ask of

Ah!

What is it? What has happened? Ubaldo!

Oh my God! My God!

We're ruined, Andr√©, ruined!

Monsieur le Vicomte, come with me

Oh, my darling, my darling
Who has done this?
You! Why did you let this happen?

Monsieur, I know where they are

But can I trust you?

You must, but remember, your hand at the level of your eyes

But why?

Why? The Punjab Lasso, monsieur
First Buquet, and now Piangi

Like this, monsieur
I'll come with you

No, Meg, no, you stay here 

Come with me, monsieur
Hurry, or we shall be too late
