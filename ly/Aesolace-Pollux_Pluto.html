		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted your solace when life would get overwhelming
I see what the cost is when I'm circling my failures
I don't do this often so I don't know what to tell you
Its better to be honest I would never want to scare you away
I know that you feel it to
Tell me that you see my point of view
You know imma always keep it true
Cause I don't wanna lose, lose, you
(Lose you, you yeah)
(Ooooooooooooo)
I wanted your solace when life would get overwhelming
I see what the cost is when I'm circling my failures
I don't do this often so I don't know what to tell you
Its better to be honest I would never want to scare you away
(I needed your solace)
(I needed your solace)
(I needed your solace)
(I)
Well maybe you don't understand
I don't know why I was thinking yeah that you did
I guess I got lost in my head
Now it got me thinking I should take back what I said
Or maybe I should just tell you again
And rethink all the words I told you with
I wanted your solace when life would get overwhelming
I see what the cost is when I'm circling my failures
I don't do this often so I don't know what to tell you
Its better to be honest I would never want to scare you away
