		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crawling down
From high hopes to the ground
While trouble sings along

Baby my heart and soul
A giant in the room
I left him long ago, following you

Wind heavy on the ground
A cloak before the moon
I guess I've never known
Someone like you

Falling down
From high hopes to the ground
There's no way out

Baby my heart and soul
A giant in the room
We took the walk alone
And now we are through

Wind heavy on the ground
A cloak before the moon
I guess I've never known
Someone like you

Nature will get her way
Though you took her for a fool
Walking on the lake
Frozen under you

Baby my heart and soul
There's nothing we couldn't do
Summer's blowing cold
And now we are through

I'm alright here in your arms, darling
I'm alright here in your arms, darling
I'm alright only in your arms, darling
I'm alright here in your arms, darling
