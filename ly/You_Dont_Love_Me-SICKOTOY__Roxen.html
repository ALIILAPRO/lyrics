		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you tell me something 'bout you
'Cause I played this heartless game
All this space that's in between us 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change

But I'm alright 
I ain't coming back to you, no
And I'm alright
I can't fake what is true, no

You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know

Could you tell me something 'bout you
'Cause I played this heartless game
All this space that's in between us 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change

But I'm alright 
I ain't coming back to you, no
And I'm alright
I can't fake what is true, no

You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know
You don't love me and I know

You don't love me and I know

You don't love me and I know
