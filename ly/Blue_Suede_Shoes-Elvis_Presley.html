		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go

But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place

Well, do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey
Lay off of them shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes

Let's go, cat
Ah, walk the dog

You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar

Well, do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey
Lay off of my shoes
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes

Ah, get
Yeah

Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, go, go

But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes, yeah
Blue, blue
Blue, suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue
Blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But stay off of my blue suede shoes
