		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, surf

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey

Said where are you goin'? Can I come too?
The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes

I dream of this moment, will it come true?
The whole world, they know it, they just waiting for me and you
And she, just like I, got her head in the clouds
Don't need to be lower, before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out

I ain't comin' down, why would I need to?
So much of this world is above us, baby
They might tell you that I went crazy
I'm just tryna read you
Ooh
Ooh, ooh

I know we try
And the days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow

Let it go, let it be
We're all we need today
Let it go, let it be
Mm, mm, mm, mm

Yeah, well, sometimes I get lonely, not when I'm alone
But it's more when I'm standin' in crowds that I'm feelin' the most on my own
And I know that somebody knows me, I know somewhere there's home
I'm starting to see that all I have to do is get up and go

Goin', goin', goin', before I'm gone
Gotta get goin', goin', goin', before I'm gone

Hey, and I know we try
Days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
