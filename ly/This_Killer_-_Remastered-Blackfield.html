		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't leave the door ajar and walk away
Don't leave me in the dark
You think you know me well
It makes me laugh
'Cause I don't know myself

This killer on the run
He steals from me the sun
He'll catch me off my guard
He likes me when I'm down and when I'm sad

Falling man
Falling man

It's always me alone that hears the noise
'Cause it's my inner voice
So stay inside your home and hide away
Before I lose control

This killer on the run
He steals from me the sun
He'll catch me off my guard
He likes me when I'm down and when I'm sad

Falling man
Falling man

This killer on the run
He steals from me the sun
And I can say I know him well
And so can he because it's me

He is me
He is me
