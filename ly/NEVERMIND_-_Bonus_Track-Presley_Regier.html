		  One, two, three, four

I hear something in the dark
It's telling me to go back to the start
It's keeping me from ever waking up
Oh, why is it so hard so say enough? (Feels so wrong)

I used to always fall asleep at night
Now I'm seeing pictures of a life I'll never find
It's not worth it, but I'm putting up a fight
'Cause these pictures got me thinking I'm making everything look alright

Never mind, can't you see you're in the way?
All the time I'm trying, but it's
Never mind, had enough of you today, today (I had enough of you today)
Everybody lies and says it's someone else
I saw the signs, but now I'm like
Never mind, I can see I'm in the way (why can't you see you're in the way?)
All the time I'm trying, but I
