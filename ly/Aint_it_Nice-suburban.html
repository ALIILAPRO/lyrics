		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spend it all, make it back in a day
Catch a flight, ain't it Nice? In my Balmains

Spend it all, make it back in a day
Catch a flight, ain't it Nice? In my Balmains
I been worried bout the bros
All black with my fit
Got the wife overseas
I ain't worried bout a cheque
Spend it all, make it back in a day
Catch a flight, ain't it Nice? In my Balmains
I been worried bout the bros
All black with my fit
Got the wife overseas
I ain't worried bout a cheque

Spend it all, made it back in a day
100k when I pull off in the Range
I ain't worried bout a thing
Lin Kuei how I stay with the chain
How it do?
On me, 100k got em acting brand new
Catch a flight, ain't it Nice? In my Balmains
Spent it all, made it back in a day

Spend it all, make it back in a day
Catch a flight, ain't it Nice? In my Balmains
I been worried bout the bros
All black with my fit
Got the wife overseas
I ain't worried bout a cheque
Spend it all, make it back in a day
Catch a flight, ain't it Nice? In my Balmains
I been worried bout the bros
All black with my fit
Got the wife overseas
I ain't worried bout a cheque
