		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look

I coach yutes from my city, I'm Jackson
And I make plays, just numero uno
Outside tryna step where you go with my young boy that shoots like Kukoč
Can't rate none of them they're actors, need BAFTAs for the roles they play (pow, pow)
Bare chat but I'm still okay, if I buck that yute, they don't make my day
Got work all white like a poodle (white)
Stop beef with the rats, I don't do those
Got a bag on me playing it cool though
100k looking small in them blue notes
Told the opps send shots 'til we get it
Got bags on your block, I'm petty (jump)
If you wanna stay alive better dead it (let's move)
Better chill 'fore we make you regret it

Look, I spit over beats, I ain't on the net
My set in the streets, just look at my neck
My shit is elite (bling, blaow), I don't wanna tweet
I do this for Smokey, I do it for Pop
I do it for Yas and this shit never stop
I came through the mud and went straight to the top
I'm cleaner than ever, we still got the mop
My block got the choppers like it's Vietnam (it's Vietnam)
Ring the alarm, I check with my killys
Make sure that they're calm
They lock off the beef like we're running a farm
The shit that you snap as a flex is a regular day
I swear I can make none of this up
You made 100, you feel like the man
But I made the Forbes and now bales pop
I hate when a yatties says, "What's in your cup?"
I never asked what your put in your ass
You can't start on me when your diamonds are glass
You didn't make the grade, you're not in my class
And this Cartier on my frames (on my frames)
Can't hang with her if she hang with the lames
My socks double G and my boxers are MAINS
Them niggas are scary, them niggas are stains

I coach yutes from my city, I'm Jackson
And I make plays, just numero uno
Outside tryna step where you go with my young boy that shoots like Kukoč
Can't rate none of them they're actors, need BAFTAs for the roles they play (pow, pow)
Bare chat but I'm still okay, if I buck that yute, they don't make my day
Got work all white like a poodle (white)
Stop beef with the rats, I don't do those
Got a bag on me playing it cool though
100k looking small in them blue notes
Told the opps send shots 'til we get it
Got bags on your block, I'm petty (jump)
If you wanna stay alive better dead it (let's move)
Better chill 'fore we make you regret it

I was sellin' grams before the 'Gram
Keep a 30, I'm 30, a grown man
I don't get cold feet or cold hands
I ain't ever dropped dope in a cold pan
Know Virgil got Off-White tan bricks
I was sending bitches Uber, can't stand Lyft
Everything that I do is gigantic
I'm a water boy, drown a Titanic
Big .45 kick like Judo
Got a Spanish girl with a big culo
Came a long way from Mr. Noodles
Got 4 killers hoppin' out a 2 door
If it's up, it's stuck, it's litty
Have you not feeling safe in your city
I knew from the jump he ain't with it
I just make one call, he get busy

I coach yutes from my city, I'm Jackson
And I make plays, just numero uno
Outside tryna step where you go with my young boy that shoots like Kukoč
Can't rate none of them they're actors, need BAFTAs for the roles they play (pow, pow)
Bare chat but I'm still okay, if I buck that yute, they don't make my day
Got work all white like a poodle (white)
Stop beef with the rats, I don't do those
Got a bag on me playing it cool though
100k looking small in them blue notes
Told the opps send shots 'til we get it
Got bags on your block, I'm petty (jump)
If you wanna stay alive better dead it (let's move)
Better chill 'fore we make you regret it (let's go, yeah)

(Pxcpyo killed this beat, bitch)
(Ayy, y'all swishin', roll up)
