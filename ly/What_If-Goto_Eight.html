		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter how fast you are, there's some things you can't outrun
And nothing can stop you from chasing all the money
Boy you're not the one who I talked to on the phone
Save your pity for the weak

What if I did kill her, Mother?
What if I just grabbed her and ran?
What if I were smiling and running into your arms?

What if I wanted you to stay?
What if I missed something obvious?
What if I
That will never happen

I'm sick o' talking to four walls
Whatever falls on us makes an impression
She'll beg me to stick it in, but hold off
It's not the same thing what you afraid of

Side angle, dim light, all night long
Today I'm be whoever I wanna be
Cloud of smoke, red wine, black clothes off
Today I'm be
Whoever

What if I did kill her, Mother?
What if I just grabbed her and ran?
What if I were smiling and running into your arms?

What if I wanted you to stay?
What if I missed something obvious?
What if I
That will never happen

What if I did kill her, Mother?
What if I just grabbed her and ran?
What if I were smiling and running into your arms?

What if I wanted you to stay?
What if I missed something obvious?
What if I
That will never happen
