		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ridin' in the drop-top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes, girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right
Come on, let me get your name, girl

Tell me where your from, what you do, what you like
Let me get your brain, girl
And tell me how they that got that pretty little face
On that pretty little frame girl

But let me show you 'round
Let me take you out
Betcha we can have some fun, girl
'Cause we can it do fast, fast, slow

Which ever way you wanna run, girl
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings
Do it how you want it done, girl
And who would of thought that you could be the one 'cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Come on, and let me show you 'round
Let me take you out
Betcha we can have some fun, girl
'Cause you could dress it up, we could dress it down

Any way you want it done, girl
Or we can stay home talkin' on the phone
Rappin' till we see the sun, girl
Do what I gotta do just gotta show you

That I'm the one, girl
Well, I'm a freak ya right each and every night
I know how to do it insane, girl
'Cause I can make ya hot, make ya stop

Make ya wanna say my name, girl
Come on, baby, please 'cause I'm on my knees
Can't get you off my brain, girl
But who woulda thought that you could be the one 'cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Summer's over for the both of us
(Summer's over)
But that doesn't mean we should give up on us
(Don't give up)
You're the one that I've been thinkin' of
(You're the one)
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
