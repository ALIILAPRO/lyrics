		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Check my pulse
Listen close to the evening grow
What's the perspective like?
I'm trying to control it

Staying wired, all set up
To be purged again
Oh, I'm the absconder
Searching for respite

I thought I had it all figured out
Spilled my cold heart onto the asphalt
Made sure my reasons for sorrow would remain
Did let the lack of serotonin define my name
When I all ever wanted was to make you smile again

Soaring words
To invoke the starless energy
But I'm long since gone
I'm wasted, baby

Constant need to depart
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure
Constant need to depart
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure
(I'm reaching for oblivion)

Constant need to depart
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure
Constant need to depart (I'm reaching for oblivion)
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure (let me rest my heart in the quiet of the dark)

I thought I had it all figured out
Spilled my cold heart onto the asphalt
Made sure my reasons for sorrow would remain
Did let the lack of serotonin define my name
When I all ever wanted was to make you smile again
