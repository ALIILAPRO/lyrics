		  Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Made a big mistake
Ever thinkin that you cared
When it's obvious you're actin like I'm not even here
Well I've got news for you
Better listen up right now
Gotta give to take no you can't pretend
Gotta think about
How you treat you freinds

You think you're so incredible
Completely unforgetable
You think the world spins just for you
You don't have a clue!
You act like I'm invisible
As if my life is miserable
One thing is undeniably true
Freindship is all about truth

I can see it now
I can read you like a book
All you care about is what you say
How it makes you look
Well this is serious
Time for you to make a change
Gotta stop right now yeah I'm tellin' you
Gotta lose that pose and you're attitude

You think you're so incredible
Completely unforgetable
You think the world spins just for you
You don't have a clue!
You act like I'm invisible
As if my life is miserable
One thing is undeniably true
Freindship is all about truth

Not gonna let you down
I'm gonna turn you round
You'll seee
Yeah, this is what real friends do
I still belive in you and me

You think you're so incredible
Completely unforgetable
You think the world spins just for you
You don't have a clue!
You act like I'm invisible
As if my life is miserable
One thing is undeniably true
Freindship is all about truth

Yeah!
Freindship is all about truth
You dont have a clue
You act like I'm invisible
As if my life is miserable
One thing is undeniably true
Freindship is all about truth.

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
