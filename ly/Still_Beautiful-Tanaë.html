		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can go, face the sun, ride a highway
Anytime I can feel you're still by my side
There's no doubt, when the clouds darken my days
Your caring presence softens my sleepless nights

Wherever I roam, you control my fears
You're my compass, my sun and my guiding star
As I think of you, I just want to sing it loud

Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me

There no time, there's no line and no pathway
Only faith brings me up as I see the sky
Where you blow, where you flow, where you just stay
There's no anger, no pain and no glory

I know where you are
You know I believe
All the lovely should find a place to shine
As I smile for you, I just want to sing it loud

Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me

I can feel your soul, you're not far from where I go
Far from where I go, far from where I go

Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
Whohohohoho, whohohohoho
You're still beautiful to me
