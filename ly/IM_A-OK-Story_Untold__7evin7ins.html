		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I write down every thought I have that might be good for a song
Seems like all I've got is me myself and no one I call home
I'm kinda shocked at how often I say I feel alone
And think a lot about my friends
And how they get along with strangers that turn into lovers
But it's ok I'll grow old all alone
'Cause I can't keep a girl around
My world's cold on my own
There's no way up once you go down with me
I don't wanna be the reason for another heartbreak
Know that there's no way to save me
I'm fine, yeah I'm A-OK
I used to be jealous of all the guys
That ended up with every girl I liked
But now that I'm older I've realized
It doesn't matter, yeah I'm just fine
I drink and get high all the time
There's nothing wrong with me and my mind
Can't you tell I'm doing great
I'm just so happy for those who get along with strangers
That end up becoming partners in crime
I don't think 'bout the future
'Cause I already know
I'll grow old all alone
'Cause I can't keep a girl around
My world's cold on my own
There's no way up once you go down with me
I don't wanna be the reason for another heartbreak
Know that there's no way to save me
I'm fine
I'll grow old all alone
'Cause I can't keep a girl around
My world's cold on my own
There's no way up once you go down with me
I don't wanna be the reason for another heartbreak
Know that there's no way to save me
I'm fine, yeah I'm A-OK
Hey, hey
Yeah I'm A-OK
Hey, hey
Yeah I'm A-OK
Hey, hey
Yeah I'm A-OK
Hey, hey
Yeah I'm A-OK
