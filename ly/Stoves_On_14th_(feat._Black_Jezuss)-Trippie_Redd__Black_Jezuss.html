		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye drop my top down
I feel good
Drop my top down
In yo hood
Steady, spending
On them drugs
Made it out the trenches nigga
Made it out the mud woah

I hope these young niggas learn
I hope these stupid bitches learn
I hope these stupid bitches burn
Better thank god that they learn
Better pray to god that they learn
Cause in my hood they on bad terms
So I'ma make these niggas hurt (woah)
Thank god for the stove
Thank Tom for a stove
Without Edison I wouldn't be here
So I thank god for the stove
Gotta thank time for the stove
Gotta thank my mom for the stove
Gotta thank the block for the stove (woah)

Drop my top down
I feel good
Drop my top down
In yo hood
Steady, spending
On them drugs
Made it out the trenches nigga
Made it out the mud woah

Made it out the trenches
I made it out the hood
They want me back in the hood
So I can't lack in my hood
Cause niggas hating on me
They want me resting for good
So I tote macs in my hood
To still make sure that I'm good
FN tote bullets just like it's a chopper
I see it I like it yo bitch I might swap her
Lil Trippie at glizzy's house so I might pop ya
Can't save me can't save me, too late for the doctor

Drop my top down
I feel good
Drop my top down
In yo hood
Steady, spending
On them drugs
Made it out the trenches nigga
Made it out the mud woah

Drop my top down
I feel good
Drop my top down
In yo hood
Steady, spending
On them drugs
Made it out the trenches nigga
Made it out the mud woah

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
