		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nosebleed
Woke up in a black dream 
Flying at warp speed in my mind
Oh my
Who's she, naked in the sweetgrass?
Got the dust in my sheets
Who am I?

Who are we living for?
Who are we living for?
Calling me crazy
Shake me to the core
Who are we living for?
Who are we living for?
Tell me who holds the key
Nobody seems to know
Why we're lost inside dark matter (dark matter, dark matter)
Lost inside dark matter (dark matter, dark matter)

No sleep
Oh oh, can you see me floating over my body
Looking out
Hold me
I wish someone would hold me 
Tell me that it's alright
Let it out

Who are we living for?
Who are we living for?
Driving me crazy
Shake me to the core
Who are we living for?
Who are we living for?
Tell me who holds the key
Nobody seems to know
Why we're lost inside dark matter, mmm mmm (dar matter)
Lost inside dark matter (lost inside dark matetr)

Pink matter, grey matter, purple sky
Love matter you matter, you and I
Dark matter, green matter get me high
Daydream about the future
Brighter than black diamonds in the sky

Who are we living for?
Who are we living for?
Tell me who holds the key
Nobody seems to know
Why we're lost inside dark matter (dark matter)
Lost inside dark matter (dark matter, dark matter, dark matter, dark matter)
(Dark matter, dark matter, dark matter, dark matter)
