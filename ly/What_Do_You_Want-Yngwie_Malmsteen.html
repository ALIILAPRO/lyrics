		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was carried to you
By the hands of my fate
Thought it was too late
I wasn't the type that believed in true love
At first sight
you changed it to the right
I know what I feel
This is real
I give you my body and soul
Let your resistance drop
Don't have to stop
Don't have to stop
By the siren's call
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I'm not the type to believe
in a second chance
Or in sweet romance
I'm no beginner been fooling around before
Still coming back for more
Today is different
It was meant
I've found a reason
I know what I feel
This is real
There's more than one season
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I cry I try tell me what do you want
Time to think it over
