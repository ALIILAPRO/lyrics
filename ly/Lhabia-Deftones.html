		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere, outside
There are tricks and evil
Holler downstairs while I drive

I make a plan just to get you back to what we're doing
I wanna burn you, wanna watch you
You'll think again, deep within, keep it deep inside
Yeah, while I serenade, buttercup, yeah, buttercup
And we can do it, suppose it again
Oh, slow it down and then we'll do it again and again
And make the best of a simple thing
To believe this, bound, coming through fire!

Dying of boredom
I'll try it all

Sixteen, olive
Bound by voice

I bleed again like a girl that can make 'em turn
Don't look, but I want it
Too much blood into my stomach, it's because it's sick
Pass through, break the bands between us
I can dare to go, but never what you can't do
What you get is never what you want to get
Now to pray your sigh is over like a doped drug
Like a voice, well, at least you fucking care

Dying of boredom
I'll try it all
Oh, I'll be faint
Like a crook

Let's quit
Look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, 'cause look at how it feels
Let's quit
Feels great but look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, 'cause look at how it feels
Feels great but look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, 'cause look at how it feels
Look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, 'cause look at how it feels

Burn God down, starts to stir again
Fucking heretic, I've opened up this for me
Lack of sterile, I'll stack the bricks down
Hurt you too much, I'm working 'round to
I can punch through it, make the hair stick
Don't wanna hurt you, just to fuck you
I'm out of time, so I tell her to rest and to
I'll rely on these two and be fine

Dying of boredom
I'll try it all
I'll be faint
Like a crook

Let's do it
Look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, 'cause look at how it feels
