		<p>
		  I've been outta sight
I've been worried 'bout you lately
Runnin' outta time
Wishin' you would come and save me

'Cause I don't wanna roll with it (yeah, yeah)
Tryna get control of it (yeah, yeah)
Why can't I let go of it? (Yeah, yeah)
Gotta find somebody quickly (mm, yeah)

I got a bad idea
How 'bout we take a little bit of time away?
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me
I got a bad idea
Yeah, I'ma call you over here to numb the pain
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me

Even though we shouldn't, baby boy, we will (you know we will)
Need somebody, gimme something I can feel (yeah)
But, boy, don't trip (don't trip), you know this isn't real
You should know I'm temporary

'Cause I don't wanna roll with it (yeah, yeah)
Tryna get control of it (yeah, yeah)
Why can't I let go of it? (Yeah, yeah)
Gotta find somebody quickly (yeah)

I got a bad idea
How 'bout we take a little bit of time away?
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me
I got a bad idea
Yeah, I'ma call you over here to numb the pain
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me

Gotta get control of it
Why can't I let go of it? (Ooh)
Wishin' you would come and save me
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

I got a bad idea (uh-huh)
How 'bout we take a little bit of time away? (Are you done?)
I got a bad idea (uh-huh)
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me (are you done?)
I got a bad idea (uh-huh)
Yeah, I'ma call you over here to numb the pain (are you done?)
I got a bad idea (uh-huh)
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me (are you done?)
Yeah (uh-huh)
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me (are you done?)
(Uh-huh)
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me

I got a bad idea
How 'bout we take a little bit of time away?
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me
