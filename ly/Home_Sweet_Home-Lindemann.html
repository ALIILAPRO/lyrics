		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born in a breath of a vicious sea
The beast came with the rain
Fallen upon your milky skin
A cunning drop crawled in your vein

Never ever got prepared
So shaken, helpless and so scared
Search the needle in your hair
Gone bald, there's nothing there

Home sweet home
Inside you, eating your bones
Home sweet home
Eyes on fire, lips in foam
And it's called the cold
It's caught inside you
And it eats, it eats and grows
Inside you and it never goes
And it never goes

Two more days, the end's in sight
(Home sweet home, the end's in sight)
Tumor days, so deep inside
(Home sweet home, so deep inside)
So distressing and very violent
And it kills, it kills so slow and silent

Never ever got prepared
So shaken, helpless and so scared
Search the needle in your hair
Gone bald, there's nothing there
There's nothing there

Home sweet home
Inside you, eating your bones
Home sweet home
Eyes on fire, lips in foam
And it's called the cold
It's caught inside you
And it eats, it eats and grows
Inside you, and it never goes

And it never goes
And it never goes
