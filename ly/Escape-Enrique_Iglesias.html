		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes
You and me
Up and down
But maybe this time
We'll get it right
Worth the fight
'Cause love isn't something you can shake

When it breaks all it takes is some trying

If you feel like leaving
I'm not going to make you stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

So if you go
You should know
It's hard to just forget the past
So fast

It was good
It was bad,
But it was real
And that's all you have
In the end our love mattered

If you feel like leaving
I'm not going to make you stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love
Here's how it goes
All it takes is some trying

If you feel like leaving
I'm not going to make you stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love
