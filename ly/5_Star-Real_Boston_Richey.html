		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

I might pull up with your boo
Then hit a five star restaurant, order me and her some soup
Don't matter how thick the bitch is, I won't put her before my loot
I'm fresh as fuck, fresh off a high speed chase like Polo Pooh
You will never catch me tellin' another nigga what I won't do
I be DMin' bitches too
I be likin' pictures too
If I like it I'ma shoot
If I strike it then you might see that bitch slidin' up my coupe
If I don't like it then I'ma refuse her calls and put that bitch on mute

If I don't like it then I'ma refuse her calls and put that bitch on snooze
Bitch, I make my calls, fuck these old niggas ain't payin' my dues
She gon' lick it all, that's the only way she come to my room
If you pay for a hit don't never call my phone, just check the news
I can't pay for a hit 'cause these niggas that I'm with they with the shits
I can't take a pic 'cause if my bitch see it she gon' think I hit
If we make a flick, bitch, we gotta use my phone, bitch, you ain't slick
Out here doin' wrong to make it right, that's why I'm trappin' bricks
You out here doin' wrong hatin' on the youngins like Uncle Ice
Ain't gotta use my phone I get on 'Yami time and go and swipe
Nigga want a feature, tell him to bring me fifty, that's just my price
If not it's, "Nice to meet you," I'm really lit for life, this ain't no hype

I might pull up with your boo
Then hit a five star restaurant, order me and her some soup
Don't matter how thick the bitch is, I won't put her before my loot
I'm fresh as fuck, fresh off a high speed chase like Polo Pooh
You will never catch me tellin' another nigga what I won't do
I be DMin' bitches too
I be likin' pictures too
If I like it I'ma shoot
If I strike it then you might see that bitch slidin' up in my coupe
If I don't like it then I'ma refuse her calls and put that bitch on mute

I might wake up blow some cheese
I might go to sleep off that lean
I might drip yo' bitch Celine
Twenty-three hundred, that's just on jeans
Yeah, new years with the stars
I be comin' out way to clean
I done ran it up off these trees
Now I run it up off these beats
I done ran it up out the streets
I done ran it up off these keys
I might bless a ho if she sneeze
Fuck you, bitch, no, you can leave
Back in the day these hoes ain't wanna fuck now they tryna meet
Real runner up thuggin' in these streets, nigga, just hand me my cleats

I'm way up out that nigga league
Trappin' bricks from Florida to Middle East
They say she gon' be a freak only in the sheets
But if she do then I'm go and buy that bitch a mink

And my bitches don't wear Pink
Ain't talkin' 'bout colors I'm talkin' 'bout that shit that be cheap
How the fuck you YIC and you got signed to FBG?

I can't take a pic 'cause if my bitch see it she gon' think I hit
If we make a flick, bitch, we gotta use my phone, bitch, you ain't slick

I might pull up with your boo
Then hit a five star restaurant, order me and her some soup
Don't matter how thick the bitch is, I won't put her before my loot
I'm fresh as fuck, fresh off a high speed chase like Polo Pooh
You'll never catch me tellin' another nigga what I won't do
I be DMin' bitches too
I be likin' pictures too
If I like it I'ma shoot
If I strike it then you might see that bitch slidin' up in my coupe
If I don't like it then I'ma refuse her calls and put that bitch on mute

I'm way up out that nigga league
Trappin' bricks from Florida to Middle East
They say she gon' be a freak only in the sheets
But if she do then I'm go and buy that bitch a mink
