		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama boy it's overkill
Don't be mad at me 'cause you been replaced,
Know your place

But if you woul'da manned up,
Put your hand up, stand up, tell me how you really felt
Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke I would've listened, but now I'm with somebody else
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering, where this thing could go, but

You will never know (oh oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (oh oh)
Your way back then
Boy you gotta (yep, yep)
Boy you shoulda (yep, yep) but you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know
You'll never know

Now it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands
Boy, but you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around

But if you woul'da manned up,
Put your hand up, stand up, tell me how you really felt
Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke I would've listened, but now I'm with somebody else
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering, where this thing could go, but

You will never know (oh oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown)
Your way back then
Boy you gotta (yep, yep)
Boy you shoulda (yep, yep) but you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know
You'll never know

You'll never know
Boy you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy you could've been there for me, but now you'll never know
You'll never know

It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times, but
None of that will change my mind boy
You had a chance you'll never get back (get back uh uh-uh)

You will never know (What we could have been)
If you would've shown (If you would've shown me)
Your way back then (way back then baby)
Boy you gotta (yep, yep)
Boy you shoulda (yep, yep) 'cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know
Oh baby

You'll never know
Boy you could've told me told me
You'll never know
Boy you could've let me know
You'll never know
Boy you could've been there for me, but now you'll never know

You'll never know (You'll never know)
No no no no you'll never know oh babe
(You'll never know)
No
(You'll never know) yeah
You'll never know
