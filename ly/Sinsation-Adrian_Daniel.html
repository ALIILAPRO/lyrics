		  Drowning in sinsation
Drowning in sinsation
My biggest weakness is the way you bend your body
Cause you the baddest so savage so fucking naughty
You took my heart that time we locked eyes at the party
You're like the highway to hell
All through the night
All through the day
I feel your poison it's driving me insane
But I'll risk it all
I'll give you my soul
Cause when I'm in you that's when I hear the call
So I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Yes I'll give all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Girl I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Yes I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation sinsation)
Tell me your darkest wish
Tell me that nasty shit
Don't hold back a thing from me baby
Yea
Maybe I'll grab your hips
Maybe I'll bite your lip
Tongue god, I got what you need
All through the night
All through the day
I feel your poison it's driving me insane
But I'll risk it all
I'll give you my soul
And when I'm in you that's when I hear the call
So I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Yes I'll give all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Girl I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Yes I'll give it all to ya ( Drowning in sinsation sinsation)
Show me all the ways you care for me
I promise girl I'll never leave
And Heaven not for me if there's no you
Guess Hell is where I'm headed to
To To To
To To To ( When you ever you need me baby)
To To To ( Just Call)
Oh Oh Oh Oh
So I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Yes I'll give all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Girl I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation)
Yes I'll give it all to ya (Drowning in sinsation sinsation)
Drowning in sinsation
Drowning in sinsation
Drowning in sinsation
Drowning in sinsation sinsation
