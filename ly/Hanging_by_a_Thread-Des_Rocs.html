		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been hating myself
You're the only one who sees me for somebody else
When I'm hanging by a thread, a thread, a thread
I'll remember what you said, you said, you said

And if I die, I wanna die in your arms
In paradise, I slipped when I said I'd hold on 
I wanna burn in your fire, fire of love
A heavy heart drinking wine in the park, while you shatter my life apart oh you look so
Yeah you look so cool, yeah you look so cool 

I've been hating myself
You're the only one who sees me for somebody else
When I'm hanging by a thread, a thread, a thread
I'll remember what you said, you said, you said
Cause it's all I've got

Sleepy head eyes, you're head is resting on my chest
These lonesome nights were living hell before we met 
And then you lift me up higher, higher love
In my mind you're sitting on the train with the ray bans and a half smile on your face 
'Cause you, cause you look so cool
Well you look so cool

I've been hating myself
You're the only one who sees me for somebody else
When I'm hanging by a thread, a thread, a thread
I'll remember what you said, you said, you said
'Cause it's all I've got

I can't do without you
I'm slipping now, through
Wrapped your finger now
Wouldn't have it another way cause you look so cool

I've been hating myself
You're the only one who sees me for somebody else
When I'm hanging by a thread, a thread, a thread
I'll remember what you said, you said, you said
Cause it's all I've got

Oh I've been hating myself
You're the only one who sees me for somebody else
When I'm hanging by a thread, a thread, a thread
I'll remember what you said, you said, you said

You're the only one who sees me for who I am
Can you pull me up? 'Cause I'm hanging by a thread
