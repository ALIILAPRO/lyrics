		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A heart made of stone callous and bone
Fracture and tear it out to let it go
And to think I called it my own
And I would have never though the pain could grow

So I'll break it knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it sadly you are so mistaken
I will take you with a grain and step into the changes
Throw away the empty heart

Right now
Never want to leave this place
And right now see it in a different way
So right now even if you take me on

I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely

It's harder to know just where to go
If only the stars aligned the sunsets glowed
I don't need a calm in a storm
Or something to scream about with empty lungs

So I'll break it knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it sadly you are so mistaken
I will take you with a grain and step into the changes
Throw away the empty heart

Right now
Never want to leave this place
And right now see it in a different way
So right now even if you take me on

I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely

Right now
Never want to leave this place
And right now see it in a different way
So right now even if you take me on

I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely

Right now
Never want to leave this place
And right now see it in a different way
So right now even if you take me on

I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely
