		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, huh
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Karma a bitch, wait, that was my bitch, wait
I didn't know it would end up like this, wait
She didn't know I'd end up in her ribs
Fuck on the ho, give a bad bitch a gift
Yeah, my location on, pull up when I'm home
You can call my phone, 1-800-stroke
I'ma pay the toll, I don't pay for pussy
I don't pay for hoes, I ain't goin' broke

Yeah, girl, don't play yourself
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Girl, don't play yourself

Girl, don't play yourself, give me mental health
You can't slay yourself, take off my Louis belt
Bringing up my past like that's gonna help
I could pay her cells, I got plenty wealth
Girl, don't play yourself, give me mental health
You can't slay yourself, take off my Louis belt
Bringing up my past like that's gonna help
I could pay her cells, I got plenty wealth

Touch down, bust down
My house, right now
And we're smoked out, iCloud (yeah)
Yeah, Gohan on my cloud
She be giving groupie love in the club, wait
It's too loud, you can't talk to her
Get you alone, we ain't makin' love
Hit my phone whenever you want some love

Girl, don't play yourself, give me mental health
You can't slay yourself, take off my Louis belt
Bringing up my past like that's gonna help
I could pay her cells, I got plenty wealth
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Girl, don't play yourself, give me mental health
You can't slay yourself, take off my Louis belt
Bringing up my past like that's gonna help
I could pay her cells, I got plenty wealth

Yeah, drop that girl off, yeah, to school, wait, wait
Hop out a whip like carpool, wait, wait, wait
Money, it talk, it argue, wait, wait, wait
She's giving me head, a smart move, wait, wait, wait
I got that network, cartoon, damn
Yeah, these hoes rushing, she first, she playing games too soon
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
She wear my shirt with me, then end up in the bedroom
Focused on her paper, she's like, "my assignment was due"
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Girl, don't play yourself, give me mental health
You can't slay yourself, take off my Louis belt
Bringing up my past like that's gonna help
I could pay her cells, I got plenty wealth
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Girl, don't play yourself, give me mental health
You can't slay yourself, take off my Louis belt
Bringing up my past like that's gonna help
I could pay her cells, I got plenty wealth

Girl, don't play yourself, girl, don't play yourself
Bringing up my past, like that's gonna help
I could pay her cells, I got plenty wealth
