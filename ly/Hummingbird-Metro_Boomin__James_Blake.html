		  Metro
(Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat)

Hummingbird, summer song, has it brought my life back?
Hangin' in the balance, have you brought the light back?
Pen pal on the night shift, she's who I get away with
Realizin' she might be all I need in this life

When I saw a cold snap, I wasn't with the season
Tag was on the ankle and outside there was a ceiling
In here, paper walls are pushin' back on you like
Eventually you push through, the moment that you realize

And hummingbird, I know that's our time (that's our time)
But stay on, stay on, stay on with me
And hummingbird, I can never unsee
What you've shown me, stay on, stay on with me

Hummingbird, summer song, has it brought my life back?
Hangin' in the balance, have you brought the light back?
Pen pal on the night shift, she's who I get away with
Realizin' she might be all I need in this life

The moment when you realize there's someone there that needs you
Lap band on the feelings, I tax them for no reason
I added love 'cause love is unconditional
I count on love, I count on love
'Cause love is unconditional within reason

And hummingbird (hummingbird) 
I know that's our time (I know that's our time)
But stay on (stay, stay on), stay on, stay on with me
And hummingbird (hummingbird), I can never unsee (never)
What you've shown me, stay on, stay on with me

Would I sign up again?
Would I sign up again?
End the night on a slow song
Forget the time like life is long
Wings beating a thousand strong
Would I sign up again?
Would I sign up again?
End the night on a slow song
Forget the time like life is long
Unconditional within reason

And hummingbird (hummingbird)
I know that's our time (I know that's our time)
But stay on (stay, stay on), stay on, stay on with me (stay on, stay on)
And hummingbird (hummingbird), I can never unsee (I can never)
What you've shown me (you), stay on, stay on with me
