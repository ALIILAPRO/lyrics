		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead, just making my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I'll need you
And I'll miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Oh 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead, just making my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you 
Tonight
