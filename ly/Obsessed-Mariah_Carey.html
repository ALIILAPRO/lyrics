		<p>
		  "And I was like, why you so obsessed with me?"

(So, oh, oh oh oh, so, oh, oh oh oh)
Will the real MC please step to the mic?
(So)
MC, MC, we need a MC (so, oh, oh oh oh)
Place to be (so, oh, oh oh oh)
MC the MC (so, oh, oh oh oh)

All up in the blogs, sayin' we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Sayin' we up in your house, sayin' I'm up at your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you're so so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be poppin' hood, you get it poppin'

Ah ooh oh oh
Why you so obsessed with me?
Boy, I wanna know, lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me
Oh oh oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up, with your Napoleon complex
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So, oh, oh oh oh, so, oh, oh oh oh
And all my ladies sing
So, oh, oh oh oh, so, oh, oh oh oh
And all my girls sing
(Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed)

You on your job, you hatin' hard
Ain't goin' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Graspin' for air, and I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'
Tellin' the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you trippin'?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you're a conversation

Ah ooh oh oh
Why you so obsessed with me?
And, boy, I wanna know, lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me
Oh oh oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind (mind)
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time? (time)
Got you all fired up, with your Napoleon complex
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So, oh, oh oh oh, so, oh, oh oh oh
And all my ladies sing
So, oh, oh oh oh, so, oh, oh oh oh
And all my girls sing
(Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed)

Ah oh
Why you so obsessed with me? (he's all up in George Foreman)
Boy, I wanna know, lyin' that you're sexin' me (lying that you're sexin' me)
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me (ay)
Oh oh oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress (oh)
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional (he's all up in my George Foreman)
Boy, you're losing your mind (mind)
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time? (mind)
Got you all fired up, with your Napoleon complex
