		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I seductive?
Call me back in an hour
If you wanna go back home
Oh, babe, at least leave the scent of your cologne
Leave the scent of your cologne

I'm not done yet
Please, kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

Am I attractive?
Tell me, am I good enough?
Lately, I've been on and off
I think I've hurt too much, my wrists are numb
(Hurt too much, my limbs are numb)

I'm not done yet
Please, kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

You're in my head
You're in my head (fuck)

I'm so attractive
Think I'm going to explode
Baby, I've been home alone
Won't you just drop your shift and pick up the phone?
(Drop your shift and pick up the phone)

I'm not done yet
Please, kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

Yeah
All the way
Yeah
