		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a lot of love for the docks, for the ocean
And I had a lot of love for the beach where I believed in something
And I had a car, and I went too far, and you took me there
And I had a lot of love for the cops
Before they got here

I'm headed home
I told you so
I told you so, so why are we not moving no more?
I'm headed home
Let them know
I said, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

'Cause I've had so much for so long
I don't know how to get back up
Yes, I've had so much for so long
That I don't know, I don't know
No more, no more, no more, no more
I said get back up, get back up, baby
No more, no more, no more
I said get back up, get back up, baby

I used to want you bad, now I've had what I wanted
With money on my mind, I'm doing time by the ocean
I still have my car, I go too far, you take me there
And if I give it up, will you pick me up?
But still take me there

I'm headed home
I told you so
I told you so, so why are we not moving no more?
I'm headed home
Let them know
I said, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

'Cause I've had so much for so long
I don't know how to get back up
Yes, I've had so much for so long
That I don't know, I don't know
No more, no more, no more, no more
I said get back up, get back up, baby
No more, no more, no more
I said get back up, get back up, baby

I used to want you bad
Look where I'm at
I used to want you bad

I used to want you bad
Look where I'm at
I use to want you bad

(We're going fast now)
I used to want you bad
Look where I'm at
(Going fast)
I used to want you bad

(We're going fast now)
I used to want you bad
Look where I'm at
(Going fast) (can you hear the silence?)

(We're going fast)
I used to want you bad
Look where I'm at
(Going fast)(can you hear the silence?)

(We're going fast)
I used to want you bad
Look where I'm at
(Going fast)(can you hear the silence?)
