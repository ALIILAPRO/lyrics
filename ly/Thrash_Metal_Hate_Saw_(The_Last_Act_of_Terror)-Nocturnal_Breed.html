		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this, liberation
Stand in eternal division

Is this, rebellion
Together separately divided

Hatesaw - Aggressor
The last act of terror
No sanctuary - Only hell to pay
You say you wanna play with fire

Hatesaw - Aggressor
The last act of terror
Cult of thrash - Pounding mercilessly
Insult to injury

Reap like a devil - Strike like a beast
Wear your scars like flesh-medals to this fight
Open the gates - Do it fully this time
Let the beast inside be at-one tonight

Are you feeling violated? 
Oh, you never fucking felt like this
Screaming - Face to face with the Devil

We will turn that cross around
Tare that temple to the ground
Burning worlds - Just to prove you wrong

Hatesaw - Aggressor
The last act of terror
Unbridled wrath - Shout of Rage
Can you carry your load?

Hatesaw - Aggressor
The last act of terror
Storm of glass - Soul-tearing loud and fast
Like voices from the bone

Unchain the Avenger
Pariah-dogs - Off war-machine born
Up north in Devils' country
Whipped with sledgehammers
We'll be all over you like a rotting rash
Upon the saw - Never lay down your horns
