		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, wake up to my heart beat, bum-bum-bum
New kicks for the kick on the drum, drum, drum
Sugar pop, I got some some, some (hoo)
Music in my head like a morning call
Uh, watch it go, like we puttin' on a show
Everyone about to know who bring the boom to radio
Dance the dance the dance, dance
That's when the radio's bumpin' to my jam (ooh)

Watch me, ooh, 24/7 I be doin' my thing
You want me, I can run it back put it on replay

Yeah, pull up to the spot turn it up (yeah, yeah)
Make a beatbox-box and it bump (yeah, yeah)
Rhythm with the flow is the 궁합
Everywhere I go, bring the beatbox
Yeah, hands up to the top, bring 'em up (yeah, yeah)
Make a beatbox-box and it bump (yeah, yeah)
Everywhere I go make the room hop
Everywhere I go bring the beatbox

Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-chicka
Boom-boom, chicka-boom, chicka
Everywhere I go bring the beatbox
Boom, chicka, chicka
Boom-boom, chicka-boom, chicka
(Everywhere I go, bring the beatbox)

Get low with the bass goin', boom, boom, boom
Fill it up with a cherry top, yum, yum, yum
Call your friends better, ring, ring, ring 'em up
Throw your worries in the air, gotta listen up
Let me hit you with the snap, got you flippin' on the track
Take your tongue and make it pop like soda
Yeah, make it pop like soda
Shout it out from the top new flavor

Watch me (ooh, just watch me)
'Cause I could do this all day (do this all day)
Make you feel that rhythm put it back on replay (ooh)
Yeah, pull up to the spot turn it up (yeah, yeah)
Make a beatbox-box and it bump (yeah yeah)
Rhythm with the flow is the 궁합 (궁합)
Everywhere I go bring the beatbox

Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-chicka
Boom-boom, chicka-boom, chicka
Everywhere I go bring the beatbox
Boom, chicka, chicka
Boom-boom, chicka-boom, chicka
(Everywhere I go, bring the beatbox)

I feel the music in my brain goin' crazy (ooh-ooh-ooh)
We know there's no stopping
So sing it loud, it's time to start
The roof to the floor
Nobody is stopping the flow
Spinning so loud round the globe
The whole world's gonna hear us right now

Dance the dance the dance, dance
Everywhere I go make the room hop (everywhere I, bring the beatbox)
Everywhere I go (everywhere I go, bring the beatbox

Yeah, pull up to the spot turn it up (yeah, yeah)
Make a beatbox box and it bump (yeah, yeah)
(Everywhere I go, yeah) rhythm with the flow is the 궁합
(People wanna know, yeah) Everywhere I go bring the beatbox

Keep it goin'
We're flowin' like the ocean
Let's celebrate the moment, uh-huh
(Everywhere I go, bring the beatbox)
Keep on hopin'
We're shining and we're golden
We won't stop for a moment, uh
(Everywhere I go, bring the beatbox)

Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-chicka
Boom-boom, chicka-boom, chicka
Everywhere I go bring the beatbox (yeah, yeah)
Boom, chicka, chicka-boom, boom chicka boom (get it on)
Everywhere I go, bring the beatbox
