		  (Gotcha)
Yo, mmh-mmh
Grr, brrah, yo

Good gracious, bumper looking persuasive (boom)
Said the Lambo Urus is spacious, fam (grr)
So much jail time on basic
Darling, slow it down when you shake it (ahh)
She wid it
You know I love my girls from Naij,she wid it
Got this white girl wan' ride, she wid it
More time broski's rollin' wid it (bup)

But I ain't ever roll with sticks
Just blonde girls, slim waist, big tits (hah)
Fake big lips, love Essex chicks
Eighteen, and I put eighteen on the whip (prrsh)
Nice little A-Class, I ain't even got no license (nope)
I ain't gotta do no violence, got two white boys
One Naij boy, one akh, that will fix up your face in silence (boom)
There's no time to be wastin' (nah)
She tried to put her cooch' on my face lips
I'm dirty, and I already been wavin'
Fuck it, come on then, darlin', take it (fuck it)
Take it (ah), break it (agh), brain was (agh), famous (gang)
Didn't even know what her name is
Got more followers then Imjustbait did (mmh-mmh, mad)

I got blonde girls comin' to my show (mmh-mmh)
Even though their dad is a racist (grr)
Ever since I made I Dunno (I Dunno)
The taxman on me for my statements (brrah)
Lack on the roads, exchange blows
We run from the feds, in plain clothes
They chat on my name, they stayed broke
The Lambo it roar, the Wraith, Rolls
But we ain't home, but her dad wants Phil Foden
They think the way I whip the G-Wags, it's stolen
Chauffeur with Adeola, when I tell her (when I tell her)
Baby, you my black Cinderella (ay)
I don't know why the Daily Mail's on a bredda (on a bredda)
I come a long way with my wetter (boom)
All I do make up line for the cheddar (bah)
Kylie, Kylie Jenner (bah, bah)

Good gracious, bumper looking persuasive (boom)
Said the Lambo Urus is spacious, fam (brrah)
So much jail time on basic
Darling, slow it down when you shake it (ahh)
She wid it
You know I love my girls from Naij, she wid it
Got this white girl wan' ride, she wid it
More time broski's rollin' wid it (bup)

From cuffs' to the Cuban, been upon the news stream
Young, was a nuisance
Come a long way, now the way that we do this
The girl give brain, but they all move clueless (yo)
It's not an illusion, bare confusion, gun conclusion
Big back movin', auto cruisin'
So freaky I might do somethin' stupid (mad)
Even when I go to the shop I'm wid it
Still up on the roads, 'cause the cut I'm wid it
Gyal getting wet, only time I'm dippin'
Can't OT bop 'cause I'm from there innit
Mmh-mmh, I got the girls all vibin' (hah-hah)
Even though it's violent (mmh-mmh)
We got black girls, white girls, Asian girls
And they all excited

Good gracious, bumper looking persuasive (boom)
Said the Lambo Urus is spacious, fam (brrah)
So much jail time on basic
Darling, slow it down when you shake it (ahh)
She wid it
You know I love my girls from Naij, she wid it
Got this white girl wan' ride, she wid it
More time broski's rollin' wid it (baow)

She wid it
You know I love my girls from Naij, she wid it
Got this white girl wan' ride, she wid it
More time broski's rollin' wid it (brrah)
She wid it
You know I love my girls from Naij, she wid it
Got this white girl wan' ride, she wid it
More time broski's rollin' wid it (brrah)

Good gracious, bumper looking persuasive (boom)
Said the Lambo Urus is spacious, fam (brrah)
So much jail time on basic (brrah, brrah)
Darling, slow it down when you shake it (ahh)
She wid it
You know I love my girls from Naij, she wid it
Got this white girl wan' ride, she wid it
More time broski's rollin' wid it (brrah)

(Gotcha)
