		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes love is pain
Yeah, it hurts for a little while
Some things you can't change
You're preaching to the choir

Knives in the back ready to attack
Knives in the back
(Hey)
Run it right back like a maniac
Run it right back

Check, check, run it right back
Run it right back
And the truth is

If it doesn't hurt at all
Then it doesn't mean a thing
I never knew that I
Could feel this way
If it doesn't hurt at all
There's nothing left to save
'Cause holding on to hope is
A different kind of pain

We all got vices
We all got choices to make
It's hard to stay and hard to walk away
You lied to me
Spinning in the dark
It took me years to see
That you had sucked the life out of me

If it doesn't hurt at all
Then it doesn't mean a thing
I never knew that I
Could feel this way
If it doesn't hurt at all
There's nothing left to save
'Cause holding on to hope is
A different kind of pain
(A different kind of pain)
A different kind of pain

Running right back
Get it
Knives in the back
Knives in the back
Knives in the back (sometimes love is pain)
Knives in the back
Knives in the back
Knives in the back

If it doesn't hurt at all
Then it doesn't mean a thing
I never knew that I
Could feel this way
If it doesn't hurt at all
There's nothing left to save
'Cause holding on to hope is
A different kind of pain

A different kind of pain
A different kind of-
Pain
