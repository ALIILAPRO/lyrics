		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Captivate me
Become my escape
I can't look away
You were my everything

If the past is just dust
Then the future could be our dream
If all we have is now, this eternity
Ignite my satisfaction, engulf me

We're dancing like flames, flickering in the night
We sway in time with the wind before melting away
You're far from my reach but not far out of sight
You know the way to my heart but you just play the strings again

Flicker like shadows dancing beyond the flame
Captivate, hypnotized by the fire in her eyes
You took me by surprise
And then you disappeared in the blink of an eye

Pull me into the pyre
Engulf me in flames
Captivate me, eidolon, gravity
Magnetic, pull me toward my ecstasy

We're dancing like flames, flickering in the night
We sway in time with the wind before melting away
You're far from my reach but not far out of sight
You know the way to my heart but you just play the strings again

Flicker like shadows dancing beyond the flames
Enchanting, mesmerized
Take what is left of my life
A wrinkle in time
Where did you go?

A wrinkle in time
Take what is left of my life
Before you go, show me what it's like to finally know
The face behind the silhouette
In this world I made to be infinite
But within the expanse, I finally see
A world without you isn't meant for me

Where do you go when I close my eyes?
What do you see looking back at me?
Am I just a ghost just like you, caught between the
Seams of two intertwining melodies?
