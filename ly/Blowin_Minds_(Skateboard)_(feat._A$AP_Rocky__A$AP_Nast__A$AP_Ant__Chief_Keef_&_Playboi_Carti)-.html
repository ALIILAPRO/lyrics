		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All new watch, that bitch blow minds
When we show up, you know it's showtime
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind
Hundred thousand, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind
When I was in the jungle, we was blowin' 9s
Just hit a nigga bitch for the second time
And you know I gotta cross the finish line
You can't stand me bitch?, sit it down

When we in the field, it's a touchdown
And you know your bitch is a bustdown
She gon turn around and get turnt out
Hopped up in a foreign car, then I burnt out

I don't waste time on the FaceTime
R.I.P the pussy, leave it face down
Two best friends at the same time
Two best friends at the same time
Flava Flav clock by my waist line
I find it funny how she blow time
For a lil mama, cause she hold it down
Nickname her Karma cause she go around
When she come around, and I fuck around
Write a couple bars, I bet I blow your mind
Deadly with the pins, I don't bowl around
Mercedes Benz, I roll around
Like 80 bands, when I walk around

All new watch, that bitch blow minds
When we show up, you know it's showtime
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind
Hundred thousands, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind
When I was in the jungle, we was blowing 9s
Just hit a nigga bitch for the second time
And you know I gotta cross the finish line
You can't stand me bitch, sit it down

In the Hellcat, yeah, burning out
Let the window down, yeah, air it out
Lay a nigga down, ooh, lay him down
I'ma hit that bitch with a hundred rounds!
All my bitches bad, and they poking out
Pull up with them knots, yeah, I'm Ashton now
Aston Martin coupe, yeah, cashing out
All black Rollie, yeah, bustdown

All new watch, that bitch blow minds
When we show up, you know it's showtime
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind
Hundred thousands, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind

What's the word
I just saw your hoe up on the strip, and she look thirsty
Gave that hoe my number, told her call me up for certain
Yeah
I know what's it's worth
Give that pussy up, and if it's wet?
I'll buy a purse (don't be trickin')
Ridin' in my murse
Seat way back, bumpin' new Lil Uzi Vert, aye
Diamonds dance like Carlton
You can see them through my shirt, aye
Flexin' on these niggas, know they see me and it hurt
(Flex) Flexin' on these niggas, I be with them geeks
But make one phone call, you get hit up (bow, bow, bow)

All new watch, that bitch blow minds
When we show up, you know it's showtime
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind
Hundred thousands, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind
When I was in the jungle, we was blowing 9's
Just hit a nigga bitch for the second time
And you know I gotta cross the finish line
You can't stand me bitch, sit it down
