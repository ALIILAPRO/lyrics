		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mercy like a gun when you’ve come undone
I’ve awoken in the hour that receives no one
The sound of a tribe will
Shake me out until sunrise
The heat of tomorrow released
As the wind blows
A beating stare from all the tribe
No sleep tonight

The howl from below
The wolf and the soaring crow
Am I losing control?
Am I losing all of control?
All spirit's entrance
I toss and turn in no romance
From six under the grass the
Prison breaks like glass

Stripped of all the air in my lungs now
Flee from the walls so alone
Stampede in the room like a buffalo
Raise me up in my throes

The howl from below
The wolf and the soaring crow
Am I losing control?
Am I losing all of control?
All spirit's entrance
I toss and turn in no romance
From six under the grass the
Prison breaks like glass

Upon the burial lie thieves of their past
Firewater tenacious
Upon the burial ground
Upon the burial ground

Between the living and the dead we move
Between the living and the dead we all move
Shift all placement, but they’re sifting you
Between the living and the dead we all move

The claim we stake a land within our wake
A garden in the bones
A headdress down in the soil we own
We build it on the bullshit or
Build it upon the burial
A garden in the bones
A headdress down in the soil we own, yeah

Stripped of all the air in my lungs now
Feeling so alone
Stampede in the room like a buffalo
Feeling so low
Pull out all the ground from below
You’ve given quite a show
Stampede in the room like a buffalo
Raise me up in my throes

The howl from below
The wolf and the soaring crow
Am I losing control?
Am I losing all of control?
All spirit's entrance
I toss and turn in no romance
From six under the grass the
Prison breaks like glass

Upon the burial lie thieves of their past
Firewater tenacious
Upon the burial ground
Upon the burial ground
Upon the burial ground
Between the living and the dead we move
(We move)

Mercy like a gun
