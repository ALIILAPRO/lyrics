		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pull off the road
East of Baldock and Ashford
Feeling for my cell
In the light from the dashboard

Hissing from the road
The smell of rain in the air con
Maybe check the news
Or just put a tape on

Lighting up a smoke
I've got this feeling inside me
Don't feel too good

If I close my eyes
And fell asleep in this layby
Would it all subside
The fever pushing the day by

Motor window wind
I could do with some fresh air
Can't breathe too well

(She waits) I guess I
(For me) should go now
(Home waits) she's waiting
(For me) to make up
(She waits) to tell me
(For me) she's sorry
(Home waits) and how much
(For me) she missed me
(She waits) I guess I
(For me) just burnt out
(Home waits) I really
(For me) should slow down
(She waits) I'm perfectly
(For me) fine but
(Home waits) I just need
(For me) to lie down

(She waits) we'll grow old
(For me) together
(She waits) we'll grow old
(For me) together
(She waits) we'll grow old
(For me) together
(She waits) we'll grow old
(For me) together
(She waits) we'll grow old
(For me) together
(She waits) we'll grow old
(For me) together
