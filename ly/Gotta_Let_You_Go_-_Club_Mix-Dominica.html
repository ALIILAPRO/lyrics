		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
No more sleepless nights
I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
I need a man who'll treat me right

I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
No more sleepless nights
I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
I need a man who'll treat me right

I want somebody
Who's always there
When I'm down to show you care
Searched the whole world over
For love that's true
Someone to tell me "I love you"
But it won't be my heart that's breaking
'Cause I won't be the one to cry
I've taken all that I am taking
Now the time has come for us to say good-bye

I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
No more sleepless nights
I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
I need a man who'll treat me right

I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
No more sleepless nights
I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
I need a man who'll treat me right

Go, go, gotta go, go go
You gotta go, you gotta go, go
Gotta go, gotta go, go
You gotta go, you gotta go, go
Go, go, gotta go, go go
You gotta go, you gotta go, go
Gotta go, gotta go, go
All my niggas say

I gotta let you go

I want somebody
That's here to stay
'Cause I need good lovin' not a day
Not a part-time lover
To treat me like you do
You wanna have your cake and eat it too
Just pack up all your lies
Get up and go
'Cause now it's much too late to care
I've taken all that I am taking
Oh don't look for me
This time I won't be there
Oh baby

I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
No more sleepless nights
I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
I need a man who'll treat me right

I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
No more sleepless nights
I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go
I need a man who'll treat me right
