		  Bye bye, good night, see you
Now if you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
And if you wouldn't care, I would like it lose
And if you wouldn't mind, I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't care, I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

And if you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
And if you wouldn't care, I would like it lose
And if you wouldn't mind, I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't care, I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame, ah

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame, ah

You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything

You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
