		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus: x2]
Ho (Ho)
You'sa Ho (Ho)
You'sa Ho (Ho)
I said that you'sa ho (Ho)

You doing ho activities
With ho tendencies
Hos are your friends, hoes are your enemies
With ho energy to do what ya do
Blew what ya blew
Screw what ya screw
Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pulling on my coat tail
An why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
Hotel everybody, even the mayor
Reach up in the sky for the ho-zone layer
Come on player once a ho always
And hos never close they open like hallways
An here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
An everybody wants some cause hoes gotta eat too

[Chorus: x2]

Cant turn a ho into a housewife
Hos don't act right
There's hos on a mission, an hoes on a crack-pipe
Hey ho how ya doing, where ya been?
Probably doing ho stuff cause there you ho again
Its a ho wide world, that we living in
Feline, feminine, fantastical, women
Not all, just some
You ho who you are
There's hoes in the room, there's hoes in the car
There's hoes on stage, there's hoes by the bar
Hos by near, an hos by far
Ho! (But can I get a ride?)
NO! (C'mon, nigga why?)
Cause you'sa

[Chorus]

You gotta run in your pantyhose
Even your daddy knows
That you sucking down chocolate like daddy-o's
You hos are horrible, horrendous
On taxes y'all writing off hos as dependents
I see the ho rising
It ain't surprising
Its just a ho-asis
With ugly chicks faces
But hos don't feel so sad and blue
Cause most of us niggas is hos too

[Chorus]

(Ho)
Motherfuckers I'm so tired of y'all niggas always talking
Bout hos this, hos that, you the motherfucking ho nigga
I wasn't no ho last night

(Pimp)
Ho, bring yo ass!

(Ho)
OK, hold on
