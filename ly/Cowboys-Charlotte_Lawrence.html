		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Razorblade fingertips
Name engraved on my lips
You're so mine
But I'm holding onto nothing
Where's your mind wandering?
Never stay, never leave
Justify that I always want the wrong thing

Take a piece of me with you my love
I'd like to think you gave me just enough
But it's different in the morning

Bottled up emotions
Whiskey by the pint
Tears could fill an ocean
Why you gotta be that guy?
You could be an angel
'Cause all you do is fly
Loving you is made up
I wonder where you are at night, ooh oh

Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?

Smoke ring stained silhouette
Sharing your cigarette
She's so fine
But I know that she means nothing

Take a piece of her with you my love
she'll probably think you gave her just enough
But it's different in the morning

Bottled up emotions
Whiskey by the pint
Tears could fill an ocean
Why you gotta be that guy?
You could be an angel
'Cause all you do is fly
Loving you is made up
I wonder where you are at night, ooh oh

Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?

If I could change you, I wouldn't change you
'Cause I don't want to love
You lost me
I hope you're safe in that lonely place
'Cause you don't know how to love
You don't, you don't, you don't

Bottled up emotions
Whiskey by the pint
Tears could fill an ocean
Why you gotta be that guy?
You could be an angel
'Cause all you do is fly
Loving you is made up
I wonder where you are at night, ooh oh

Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?
Where do all the cowboys run?
