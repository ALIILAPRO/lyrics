		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out on your own, cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted, baby?

Blame it on me, set your guilt free
Nothing can hold you back now

Now that you're gone, feel like myself again
Grieving the things I can't repair and willing

To let you blame it on me and set your guilt free
I don't want to hold you back now, love

I can't change who I am, not this time
I won't lie to keep you near me
And in this short life there's no time to waste on giving up
My love wasn't enough

And you can blame it on me, just set your guilt free, honey
I don't want to hold you back now, love
