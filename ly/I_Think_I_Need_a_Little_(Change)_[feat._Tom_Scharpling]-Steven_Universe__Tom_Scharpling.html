		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You
Look at everything you are
Look at everything you do
It's incredible, as incredible as you

And me
I guess I'm content to be
On the arm of someone who
Is as incredible as you

And it's a full-time job admiring
All the ways that you're inspiring
If I had my way, I'd do it all day
That's why it's really, really hard to say

I think I need a little cha-a-ange
I think I need a little cha-a-ange
I think I need a little cha-a-a-a-a-a-ange

Oh, I always did believe
That love is all you need
To be a happy man
Oh, that may have been naive
I guess I need to eat
That wasn't in the plan

And it's a full-time job admiring
All the ways that you're inspiring
If I had my way, I'd do it all day
The only problem is it doesn't pay

I think I need a little cha-a-ange
I think I need a little cha-a-ange
I think I need a little cha-a-a-a-a-a-ange
