		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I just like to sing
Forget everything and write of color and string
Talk of life in the sea
And none of that will ever be healthy for society
Mmm
Teacher tell us when, people hurt the people every now and then
What's that all about?
Hiding one another finding no way out
What a time, what a time
Mmm

Who am I, honey riddle me that
How can I say what's white and what's black?
Who am I, got some knuckles to crack
Everybody's riding on my back

She said, life is like this fruit
Wholesome, good and green at the root
But if it drops to the floor
What you get is bruises and a love of a rotten core-ore-ore-ore ah-ah-ah-ah-mm
Core-ore-ore-ore ah-ah-ah-ah-mm

Who am I, honey riddle me that
How can I say what's white and what's black?
Who am I, got some knuckles to crack
Everybody's riding on my back

Wearing animal skin
With no state to be in
Choosing good over sin
How sweet
Wearing animal skin
With no state to be in
Choosing good over sin
How sweet
