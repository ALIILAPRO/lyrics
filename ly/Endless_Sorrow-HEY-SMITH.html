		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is the factor behind the breaking outta war
Try to find the answer but never know the answer

Why'd they to know they filled with sorrow
We gotta find somebody tells me what is right

What is the factor behind the breaking outta war
Try to find the answer but never know the answer

Why'd they to know they filled with sorrow
We gotta find somebody tells me what is right

Rely on society, pray for the divine
Nobody saving me, nobody care for me
For my own protection, you gotta fight for your right

So people R U gonna ready to go, ready to go, ready to go to fight
I don't know I don't know 
You don't know You don't know 
I don't know You don't know We don't know

So people R U gonna ready to go, ready to go, ready to go to fight
I don't know I don't know 
You don't know You don't know 
I don't know You don't know We don't know


No more war!


So people R U gonna ready to go, ready to go, ready to go to fight 
I don't know I don't know 
You don't know You don't know
I don't know You don't know We don't know
So people R U gonna ready to go, ready to go, ready to go to fight
I don't know I don't know 
You don't know You don't know 
I don't know You don't know We don't know
