		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lions roaring in the morning sun
Searching for a longer day
People feeling like the light has just come
We must never stop the way
Birds are chirping and I hear my name
Grass is green and so alive
Life is happy, but it's so insane
We must merely make a strive

Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
Savannah, the beauty of the world
Savannah, let's all take a whirl
Savannah

The lions gone and come
The birds have just begun
We will always take a stand
For the people, for the land
Let's go back to when we were young
For the animals, we stand
Let's go back to when trees were swung
Kids across the land

Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
Savannah, the beauty of the world
Savannah, let's all take a whirl

Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
Savannah, the beauty of the world
Savannah, let's all take a whirl

Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
Savannah
