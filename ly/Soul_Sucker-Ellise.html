		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beautiful vixen, but nobody else knows
She's got an addiction to the
Powder in her nose
A touch from her lips will
Leave you turned to stone
You're better off alone
She's too high to listen, oh
Always stuck in the clouds
Painting a picture, but it's upside down
I bet that you wish that you never kissed
But it's too late now

Don't get too lost in her arms
All she wants is a bite of your heart

I don't wanna run, nowhere to hide
There's a devil in my room and I don't mind
Soul sucker, don't touch her
‘Cause you might just losе your life
Careful for the poison up hеr sleeve
Touch you in the morning
Haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they're never leaving alive

Swear that you love her little
Claws in your brain
Cannibal lover, feeding off your pain
You're just another stain on the sheets
Where she keeps them chained

Don't get wrapped up, wicked spells
All she wants is to drag you through hell

I don't wanna run, nowhere to hide
There's a devil in my room and I don't mind
Soul sucker, don't touch her
‘Cause you might just losе your life
Careful for the poison up hеr sleeve
Touch you in the morning
Haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they're never leaving alive

I don't wanna run, nowhere to hide
There's a devil in my room and I don't mind
Soul sucker, don't touch her
‘Cause you might just lose your life
Careful for the poison up her sleeve
Touch you in the morning
Haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they're never leaving alive

Soul sucker
Bet you didn't want to leave your lover
Never over ‘cause she pulled you under
Now you're laying in the grave you dug her
No wonder soul sucker
Bet you didn't want to leave your lover
Never over ‘cause she pulled you under
Now you're laying in the grave you dug her
No wonder

I don't wanna run, nowhere to hide
There's a devil in my room and I don't mind
Soul sucker, don't touch her
‘Cause you might just losе your life
Careful for the poison up hеr sleeve
Touch you in the morning
Haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they're never leaving alive

I don't wanna run, nowhere to hide
There's a devil in my room and I don't mind
Soul sucker, don't touch her
‘Cause you might just lose your life
Careful for the poison up her sleeve
Touch you in the morning
Haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they're never leaving alive
