		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The bridge holds back the sky
Can't hold back what's inside
And the train above me 
Sounds like the music in my head
My thoughts are undecided
I think it so I hide it
And the train rushes past
Like a day gone too fast

I wish that I was stronger
Could keep my head for longer 
I sit and watch my fear
But it won't disappear
I can dream myself away 
Lose myself for days 
And the train rushes past
Like a day gone too fast 

All I know is here and now

All I know is here and now

And the train rushes past
Like a day gone too fast
And the train rushes past 
Like a life gone too fast
