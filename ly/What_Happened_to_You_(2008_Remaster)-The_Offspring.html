		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What in the world happened to you?

Before you started tokin', you used to have a brain (hey)
But now you don't get even the simplest of things (hey)
I can draw a little picture or even use my hands (hey)
I try to explain but you just don't understand, oh

(Hey) man, you're really losin' it
(Hey) and you've really done a lot of junk now
(Hey) but you keep on abusin' it
What in the world happened to you?

It's bad enough you do it to yourself (hey)
But taking someone with you, well, you know that's something else (hey)
I say I'm not that kind of person, I'm not that kind of man (hey)
I try to explain but you just don't understand, oh

(Hey) oh man, you're really losin' it
(Hey) and you've really done a lot of junk now
(Hey) but you keep on abusin' it
What in the world happened to you?

(Hey) man, you're really losin' it
(Hey) and you've really done a lot of junk now
(Hey) but you keep on abusin' it
What in the world happened to you?

I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack (hey)
If I thought that you were willing to give a little back (hey)
But you do it in the morning, you do it in the night (hey)
You lie to refrain from just facing your life

So I'll see you man tomorrow, you'll be gackin' up again (hey)
I'll see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent (hey)
I think of all the times that I tried to lend a hand (hey)
I try to explain but you just don't understand, oh

(Hey) man, you're really losin' it
(Hey) and you've really done a lot of junk now
(Hey) but you keep on abusin' it
What in the world happened to
What in the world happened to
What in the world happened to you?
