		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sorry for when I called you so drunk that night
It must've been the muscle memory
And when I drove to your house after a long day
It must've been the muscle memory
It's sad to see our skies turn orange and pink
I tried to pull the world back in time
But I have to accept it
To think I could control the inevitable night
It's gonna take a while for you
To come out of my DNA
So bear with me
Woven so tightly, I
I can't unravel overnight
How could I
I feel a little lost but I know it's what I need (Know it's what I need)
I need to learn to lean on me (Need to learn to lean on me)
There's far too much to say but I know love's price is pain
So I need to learn to lean on me (Need to learn to lean on me)
It's sad to see our skies turn orange and pink
I tried to pull the world back in time
But I have to accept it
To think I could control the inevitable night
It's gonna take a while for you
To come out of my DNA
So bear with me
Woven so tightly, I
I can't unravel overnight
How could I
I, I won't forget
You were my best, my best friend
And maybe we will
Cross paths one day when I'm so full
But it's gonna take a while for you
To come out of my DNA (my DNA)
So bear with me (So bear with me)
Woven so tightly, I
I can't unravel overnight
How could I?
Ahh, muscle memory
Ahh, muscle memory
Ahh, muscle memory
Ahh, muscle memory
