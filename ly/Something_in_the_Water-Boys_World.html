		  I'm always lost in the lights
Don't gotta stop if the sun never comes
And I'm taking it all as a sign
I'm making it up as I go alone-one

Okay, alright
I don't know about forever but I know about tonight
Okay, alright
Can you tell me if it's real or if it's all just in my mind

I'm not dead but this right here is heaven 
Just a little hotter (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm feeling good
I'm thinking that there might be 
Something in the water (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So tell me do you feel it too?
It's almost like my heart's in my head
There's something in the water
Me and you
Yeah, we were catching sparks when we met (something in the water)

I'm always lost in the lights
Don't gotta stop if the sun never comes
And I'm taking it all as a sign
I'm making it up as I go alone-lone

Okay (okay, okay), alright (alright)
I don't know about forever but I know about tonight
Okay (okay), alright (alright)
Can you tell me if it's real or if it's all just in my mind, yeah

I'm not dead but this right here is heaven 
Just a little hotter (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm feeling good
I'm thinking that there might be 
Something in the water (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So tell me do you feel it too?
It's almost like my heart's in my head
There's something in the water
Me and you
Yeah, we were catching sparks when we met
Something in the water

Okay (okay, okay), alright (alright)
I don't know about forever but I know about tonight
Okay (okay), alright
Can you tell me if it's real or if it's all just in my mind

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm not dead but this right here is heaven 
Just a little hotter (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm feeling good (feeling good, yeah)
I'm thinking that there might be 
Something in the water (something) (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So tell me do you feel it too?
It's almost like my heart's in my head
There's something in the water
Me and you
Yeah, we were catching sparks when we met
Something in the water

I'm not there but this right here is heaven
