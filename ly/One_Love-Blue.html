		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, alright

It's kinda funny how life can change
Can flip 180 in a matter of days
Sometimes love works in mysterious ways
One day you wake up, gone without a trace

I refuse to give up
I refuse to give in (oh)
You're my everything
I don't wanna give up
I don't wanna give in
So everybody sing

One love, for the mother's pride
One love, for the times we cried
One love, gotta stay alive
I will survive
One love, for the city streets
One love, for the hip-hop beats
One love, oh, I do believe
One love is all we need

(Uh huh, come on)

Late at night I'm still wide awake
Feel this is one more than I can take
I thought my heart could never break (never break)
Now I know that's one big mistake

I refuse to give up
I refuse to give in (uh huh)
You're my everything (that's right, come on)
I don't want to give up
I don't want to give in (oh no)
Everybody sing

One love, for the mother's pride
One love, for the times we cried (times we've cried)
One love, gotta stay alive (oh)
I will survive
One love, for the city streets
One love, for the hip-hop beats
One love, oh, I do believe
One love is all we need (that's right)

Baby, just love me, love me, love me
Baby, just hold me, hold me, hold me
Oh, love me, love me, love me (oh yeah)
(One) One love
Baby, just love me, love me, love me (love me)
Baby, just hold me, hold me, hold me
Oh, love me, love me, love me (oh)

One love, for the mother's pride
One love, for the times we cried
One love, gotta stay alive (oh)
I will survive
One love, for the city streets
One love (one love), for the hip-hop beats
One love (one love), oh, I do believe
One love is all we need

One love, for the mother's pride
One love, for the times we cried
One love, gotta stay alive (ooh yeah)
I will survive
One love (one love), for the city streets
One love (one love), for the hip-hop beats
One love, oh, I do believe
One love is all we need
