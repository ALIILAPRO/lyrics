		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna go party, I wanna have fun
I wanna be happy, could you show me how it's done?
You look so pretty, pretty like the sun
I could watch forever while you shine on everyone

It's Black Friday, we're in a black taxi
You take my hand and hold it gently on the middle seat
It's all in my head, it's all in my mind
I'm so selfish, you're so kind
It's all in my head, baby, I can't breathe
I look in the mirror, what has happened to me?

I wanna better body, I want better skin
I wanna be perfect like all your other friends
You look so pretty, pretty like the wind
Every time you touch me, I feel adrenaline

It's Black Friday, the end of the week
You take my hand and hold it gently up against your cheek
It's all in my head, it's all in my mind
I see the darkness where you see the light
It's all in my head, who do I trust?
I thought that you loved me, what has happened to me?

What has happened to us?
What has happened to me?
