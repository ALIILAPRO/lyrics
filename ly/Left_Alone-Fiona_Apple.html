		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You made your, made your overtures
When you were a chauven'd over-toned mutt
And I was still a dewy petal
Rather than a moribund slut

My love wrecked you
You're back to twirl your skirt at the palace
It hurt more than it ought to hurt
I went to work to cultivate a callous

And now I'm hot, too hot and oh
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears go inside the bottle
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left alone

Oh and I tried to love
And I can love the same man and the same bed and the same city
But not in the same room it's a pity but oh
It never bothered me before
Not 'til this guy
What a guy
Oh, God, what a good guy
And I can't even enjoy him
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know

I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears go inside the bottle
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
Alone
Alone
Alone

My ills are articulate
My woes are granular
The ants weigh more than the elephants
Nothing, nothing is manageable
So couldn't we skip the valedictories
I can see your door there
Shut it and forget my number
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know

Oh I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears go inside the bottle
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left alone
