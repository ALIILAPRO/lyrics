		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our love was strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I

Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning
You and I (you and I)

We had the mixtape on every weekend (on every weekend)
Had it repeating (had it repeating)
Had it repeating (had it repeating)

You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly, when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me, we were only fifteen

Sometimes I think that I see her
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by (passing by)

I get a mild sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I (you and I)

We had the mixtape on every weekend (on every weekend)
Had it repeating (had it repeating)
Had it repeating (had it repeating)

You were my September song summer lasted too long
Ooh, time moves so slowly (so slowly) when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me, we were only fifteen

Thinking 'bout you and me, oh what a melody (oh what a melody)

And as the years go by, you will still be mine
You are my (September song)

You were my September song summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly (you remember) when you're only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me, we were only fifteen
