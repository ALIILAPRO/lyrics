		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know, I know
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
It's not warm when he's away
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And he's always gone too long
Anytime he goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Hey, I oughta leave the young thing alone
'Cause ain't no sunshine when he's gone

It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And he's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if he's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
