		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to the house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi
But sometimes girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bartender

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden
And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bartender, bartender
Ha, ha, ha, ha

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Head to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, keep love alive
Bartender
