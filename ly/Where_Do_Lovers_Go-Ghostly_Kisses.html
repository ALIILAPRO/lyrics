		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me where all wrongs turn to right
Meet me where the light greets dark
Where the lovers go when they are tired
 
Keep me where you hide your second sight
Deep inside where secrets start
Where the lovers go when they are tired
 
Let’s watch the last rays fading out
Entwine our bodies on common ground  

Will you hold on my love? 
Even in a time of trouble 
I want to hold on my love 
Even in times of trouble
Will you hold on my love? 
Even in a time of trouble 
I want to hold on my love 
Even in times of trouble
 
Meet me where you can break the silence
Meet me where the light greets dark
Where the lovers go when they are tired
 
Meet me in the gentle afterlight
Where your world falls apart
Where do lovers go when they are tired?
 
Let’s watch the last rays fading out
Entwine our bodies on common ground  
 
Will you hold on my love? 
Even in a time of trouble 
I want to hold on my love 
Even in times of trouble
Will you hold on my love? 
Even in a time of trouble 
I want to hold on my love 
Even in times of trouble
