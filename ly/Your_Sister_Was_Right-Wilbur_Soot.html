		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I couldn't love anymore
Turns out I can't, but not for the same reasons as before
I use everyone I ever meet, I can't find the perfect match
Abuse those I love while I ostracize the ones who love me
Back

On the path of least resistance I find myself salting the Earth
Every time that I miss you, I feel the way you hurt
And I don't deserve you, you deserve the world
Though it feels like we were built from the same dirt

I hate to say it, but your sister was right
Don't trust English boys with far too much free time
And I hate to say it, but your sister was right
I'm nothing but a problem, leave you crying overnight
And I hate to say it, but your sister was right
I can't focus on the future only my short sight
I hate to say it, but your sister was right
I'm a wanker, complete wanker
A fucking waste of time
