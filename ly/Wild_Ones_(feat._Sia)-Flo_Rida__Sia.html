		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I heard you were a wild one, ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones, ooh-ooh

Oh, I, I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it, glass to the roof
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it
I don't care tonight
She don't care we like
Almost there, the right vibe
Ready to get live
Ain't no surprise
Take me so high
Jump and don't stop
Surfing the crowd, ooh-ooh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band
Mic check, one, two
Shut 'em down in the club 
What a playboy does 'til they all get loose, loose
After bottle, we all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break rules, 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down, a hundred super models

Hey, I heard you were a wild one, ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones, ooh-ooh

P-p-party rocker, fo' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off then I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out, baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me hide pain
Tolerance, bottoms up when it's champagne
My life, call my homie, then we hit Spain
Hit Ibiza with the bail, we get insane

Hey, I heard you were a wild one, ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones, ooh-ooh

I am a wild one, break me in (yeah)
Saddle me up and let's begin (yeah)
I am a wild one, tame me now (now)
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body, dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff

Hey, I heard you were a wild one, ooh-ooh (ah)
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones, ooh-ooh

I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
