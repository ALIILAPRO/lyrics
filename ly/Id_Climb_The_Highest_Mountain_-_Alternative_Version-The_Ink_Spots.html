		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boys, I'm mellow as a honeydew, yeah

That cat is high
Look at that look in his eye
Oh man, he's high
Yes, higher than a kite

That cat is high
Look at that look in his eye
Man, I wouldn't lie
The cat's higher than a kite

Now when you see him stumblin'
Bubbed in and down the street
You know that cat's been drinkin'
Got no shoes upon his feet

Man he's high
I said that cat is high
Yes, he's high
Man, he's higher than a kite

That cat is high
Look at that look in his eye
Man, I wouldn't lie
That cat's higher than a kite

Boys, he's high
Just look at them two black eyes
You know I wouldn't lie
He's higher than the sky

When you see him tippin'
Round and round the block
Know that cat he's very beat
Hip clean down to his socks

That cat is high
Boys, I wouldn't lie
Oh my, oh my
He's higher than a kite, yeah

Shoot the liquor to me, John Boy

When you see him stumblin'
Up and down the street
You know that cat's been drinkin'
Got no shoes upon his feet

Man, he's high
Yes, he's high, my, oh my
I want the home cookin' mama with the fryin' pan
I know that cat's high, yeah
