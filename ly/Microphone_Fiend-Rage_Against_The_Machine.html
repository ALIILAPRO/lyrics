		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, " Yes y'all!"
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of, an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing

E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly

But back to the problem, I gotta habit
You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness? 
Beware, it's the reaniamator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone
'Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up

E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly

A smooth operator operating correctly

Uh!
