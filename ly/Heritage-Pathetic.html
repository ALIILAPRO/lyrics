		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who represents art in our lives?
Animals are those whom you admire
Reassure you that the only way
To salvation is complete decay

You are neurotic riddled with
Obsessive compulsions, pathetic dream
Damn neurotic riddled with
Obsessive compulsions, pathetic dream

Art is a blessing they can still ignore
I'm afraid to drown like them in rot
The great architect behind it all
Heritage… that’s what i called!

Wasn't I going to build a house?
You know, im kind of an architect without
Banal material cos the greatest
Created in the basement, misery and a mess

You are neurotic riddled with
Obsessive compulsions, pathetic dream
Damn neurotic riddled with
Obsessive compulsions, pathetic dream

Art is a blessing they can still ignore
I'm afraid to drown like them in rot
The great architect behind it all
Heritage… that’s what i called!

Art is a blessing they can still ignore
I'm afraid to drown like them in rot
The great architect behind it all
Heritage… that’s what i called!
