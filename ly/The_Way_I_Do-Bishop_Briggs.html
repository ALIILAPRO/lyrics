		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay my heart down
Laid it down for you
Laid it down for you, oh
Put my arms out
Put 'em out to you
Oh Lord I was reaching for ya
Reaching for ya

Oh child, reaching for ya
Reaching for ya
Oh, but you will never know this love
Will never know this pain
Never know the way I feel for you
You will never know this touch
Will never know this shame
Will never know the way I want you to

You will never know my love
You will never feel the way I do
You will never know my love
You will never feel the way I do

Prayed my heart out
But my hands get raised
And your soul got saved
Oh, still the devil, he don't know his name
Oh Lord, he don't know
He don't know his name

Oh child, reaching for ya
Reaching for ya
Oh, but you will never know this love
Will never know this pain
Never know the way I feel for you
You will never know this touch
Will never know this shame
Will never know the way I want you to

You will never know my love
You will never feel the way I do
You will never know my love
You will never feel the way I do

Feel the way I do
(Feel the, feel the)
(Feel the)
You will never feel the
Oh, the way I do
(Feel the)
You will never feel the
Feel the
Oh, the way I do
(Feel the)
You will never feel the
(Feel the)
Feel the way I do
