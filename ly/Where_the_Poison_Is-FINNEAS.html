		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It doesn't matter where you're goin' if you're gone
Nothing feels the same these days, it all went wrong
Now I just drive around and play the same sad songs
For so long

(Thanks very much, Mr. Trump)
(Aren't you two forgetting something?)

Where we were and where we are
Felt so close now they feel so far
They'll never know if they weren't here
When the month of March felt more like forty years

When all my friends get sick, it's on the president
When all my friends get sick, it's on his government

Take me to the place where the poison is
To put a face to what's poisonous
To give him a little taste of his medicine
There's a snake that thinks it's the president
To the place where the poison is
To put a face to what's poisonous
To give him a little taste of his medicine
There's a snake that thinks it's the president

Once we put this all behind us
We get to go right back to school shootings and a climate crisis
I wanna buy a house on the South Island
Can't say I'm proud to be American

When all my friends get sick, it's on the president
All my friends get sick, it's on his government

Take me to the place where the poison is
To put a face to what's poisonous
To give him a little taste of his medicine
There's a snake that thinks it's the president
To the place where the poison is
To put a face to what's poisonous
To give him a little taste of his medicine
There's a snake that thinks it's the president

I guess not everybody knows
The emperor was never wearin' any clothes
I guess not everybody knows
The emperor was never wearin' any clothes
