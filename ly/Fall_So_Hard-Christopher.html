		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ha ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard
I could fall so hard
Ha ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard

Well, I thought I was already home
'Til you came in like a wrecking ball

So where do we go, where do we go from here?
When all that we know is nothing at all, my dear

Never knew that I could fall so
Baby, when I met you, I never knew I could fall so hard
Oh, oh, oh
Made me wanna change for the better because of who you are
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I thought was about me, was always about you
Oh, oh, oh
Baby, when I met you, I never knew I could fall so hard
Never knew I could fall so ha ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard
I could fall so ha ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard

Now he creeps in all my fears for you
For the first time I got everything to lose

So where do we go, where do we go from here?
When all that we know is nothing at all, my dear

Never knew that I could fall so
Baby, when I met you, I never knew I could fall so hard
Oh, oh, oh
Made me wanna change for the better because of who you are
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I thought was about me, was always about you
Oh, oh, oh
Baby, when I met you, I never knew I could fall so hard
Never knew I could fall so ha ha, ha, haha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard
I could fall so ha ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard

Wherever you go, wherever you go, I'll be there
And all that I know is wherever you go, I'll be there
Never knew I could fall so ha ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard (I never that I could)
Never knew I could fall so ha ha, ha, ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hard

Never knew that I could fall so
Baby, when I met you, I never knew I could fall so hard
Oh, oh, oh
Made me wanna change for the better because of who you are
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I thought was about me, was always about you
Oh, oh, oh
Baby, when I met you, I never knew I could fall so hard
Never knew I could fall so
