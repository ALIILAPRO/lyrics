		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  March of the fakes, another fucker with a bullshit trend to feed
Lies and hype, we don't need another parasite choking the "scene"
All pretenders to the throne
Pawns and jesters to dispose
Devoid of all integrity
Minions of this mass mediocrity

When will the trend fucking end?
Give these maggots nothing but torment

Stomp their lifeless faces to the curb
Crush their heads and make them beg for more
As their trending feeds erupt with death
Reality comes crashing with a fist

Imposters, posing puppets, human waste to rot away
Swarming and conforming, their phones never leave their face

Drag them to the altar of punishment
Spill their guts and left to abandonment
Not one left to push their hypocrisy
Rat by rat, erase them from memory
Lifeless mimics lost in a fantasy
Slit their throats - it's selfie anatomy
One and all, they lie and prevaricate
Fashion fuckers, born to impersonate

Line them up and cut them down
Drive them from our sacred ground
Clear these roaches from the floor
From the pit right out the door

When will the trend fucking end?
Let's drive the herd right off the cliff
When will the trend fucking end?
We'll smash them all and make them beg for death
