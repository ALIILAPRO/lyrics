		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, we had lunch
We talked about love and shit
She looked me in my eyes
And said the next dick she take 
Would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak
She had the lobster
I say, "I want you on my team"
She say, "I don't join rosters"
Oh, believe dat
And then the drinks came
And then the mood changed
And then her answer switched
She let her hair down
And lit a cancer stick
She saw it turn me off
And said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room
And I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

Like, "girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?"
She say, "shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
"That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga"
And then she said, "if you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon'"

We had dinner, we talked about the future
She said I could have chose any bitch, I would beg to differ
But beggars can't be choosers, yeah, hm
And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She say she don't like rappers, we got something in common
And I said, "Especially that nigga Wayne"
We both laughed and then the wine came
And then her mind changed
She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles
It was a full moon when she turned around
She used my restroom, she say, you know, girl stuff
She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up

Like, "what you think?"
"Should I do it?"
She say, "shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
"That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga" (yeah)
And then she said, "If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon'"

We had breakfast, yeah
We fucked all night long and shit
We fell asleep naked
So when we woke up, she wanted that morning dick 
(I gave it to her too, hm, yeah)
I had the grits, she had the waffles
She say she drank too much last night, and I should have stopped her
I say, "Believe dat"
And then my phone rang
She saw my girl name
And then her world changed
She put her clothes on and said, "I'm going home, Wayne"
I said, "Lisa, chill"
And that was the wrong name
She hit her girl up and said, "I hate rappers"
And then her girl laughed and said, "bitch, what happened?"

And she said, "what you think?
Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck from "hi, how you doing?"
And then her friend on the phone say
"Girl, I was just trippin', I would have fucked that nigga
Girl, I was just trippin', I would have fucked that nigga" (yeah)
And then she said, "yes, I did, and I fucked him good
So I hope he tell his girl that I fucked him good"
