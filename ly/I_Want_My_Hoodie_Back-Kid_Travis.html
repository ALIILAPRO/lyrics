		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day, I think I'll forget your name
It's been years now, she's got nothing to say
I'm upside down, in my head your still around

And I want
Just what I wanted all those years ago
It feels like I'm haunted
Feeling haunted by you everywhere that I go
All on my own, doing the most
What did you do to the sweater I've owned
I should've known that you would be so cold
I woke up, missing you
You left me in the darkness
I hate you, like who's to blame
Losing you was the hardest, thing
And I've been waiting patiently
For some answers need some answers
Didn't want it to end that way

I swear I never meant to call you back
But girl, I want my hoodie back
Babe, I want my hoodie back (Woah)
I'll never show it that I'm really mad
But girl, I want my hoodie back
Babe, I want my hoodie back
How you gonna' do me like that?

And I've seen our old places
I've been so confused
I just want to be with you
How you gonna' do me like that?
And I've seen our old places
I've been so confused
Girl, I want my hoodie back
How you gonna' do me like that?

One day, I think I'll forget your name
It's been years now, she's got nothing to say
I'm upside down, in my head your still around
I woke up, missing you
You left me in the darkness
I hate you, like who's to blame
Losing you was the hardest, thing
And I've been waiting patiently
For some answers need some answers
Didn't want it to end that way

I swear I never meant to call you back
But girl, I want my hoodie back
Babe, I want my hoodie back (Woah)
I'll never show it that I'm really mad
But girl, I want my hoodie back
Babe, I want my hoodie back
How you gonna' do me like that?

How you gonna' do me like that?
How you gonna' do me like that?
How you gonna' do me like that?
