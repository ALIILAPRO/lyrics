		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think you're such a cool kid
And everybody likes you
Know you think I'm stupid
Say you know more than I do
But what you'll never understand
Is I used to be such a fan
But now you're such a cool kid
It's like I don't even know you, yeah

I'm getting really sick
Sick of how sorry sounds
Coming right out your mouth, oh
Don't get too comfortable
'Cause I might not be there
Next time you turn around

So
What would you do if I leave and don't come back?
I hope it breaks you in two
If I gave back all the pain that you put me through
What would you do?

I've always been a nice girl
I'm pretty understanding
But you mess with my head, boy
And you're taking me for granted
And you're probably gonna throw a fit (throw a fit)
When I call you out on all your shit (all your shit)
Yeah, I used to be a nice girl
I bet you wish it lasted
Oh

I'm getting really sick
Sick of how sorry sounds
Coming right out your mouth, oh
Don't get too comfortable
'Cause I might not be there
Next time you turn around

So
What would you do if I leave and don't come back?
I hope it breaks you in two
If I gave back all the pain that you put me through
What would you do?

We'll make plans and I won't show up
I won't listen, I'll interrupt
When your birthday comes won't answer ya
'Cause, so what? So what?
I'll go out and kiss your friends
Like, oh my god, get over it
Yeah, go get drunk so you forget
I'm gone

What would you do if I leave and don't come back?
I hope it breaks you in two
Breaks you in two
If I gave back all the pain that you put me through
What would you do?
Ooh ooh, what would you do?
Ooh ooh, what would you do?
