		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I light the fuse
And I watch it burn
And somewhere deep inside I know there's a lesson to be learned
It's not the crime but the way that we pay for
Feelings unmutual
And you go upstairs
And I hang my head
Somebody said I let myself down as I crawled into bed
I wandered why the hell I'd ever paid for
Feelings unmutual
I'm tired of living in the shadow
These paper walls I can't break through
I'm sick of standing by your window
Tracing silhouettes of you
But when it gets dark
You light the spark
And all the lies I tried to live by start falling apart
Whoever knew that it could be so painful
Feelings unmutual
Now I can't escape
These things I've done
But my anxieties have promised me the worst is to come
So give up living for the life that you paid for
Feelings unmutual have won
I'm tired of living in the shadows
These paper walls I can't break through
I'm sick of standing by your window
Tracing silhouettes of you
Tracing silhouettes of you
Tracing silhouettes of you
Tracing silhouettes of you
Tracing silhouettes of you
I light the fuse
And I watch it burn
And somewhere deep inside I know there's a lesson to be learned
It's not the crime but the way that we pay for
Feelings unmutual
