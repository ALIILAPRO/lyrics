		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been finding it hard to be in the moment
When I know pages are turning, chapter is closing (chapter is closing)
I've been stuck in a war with my heart and my head
Missing what are we losing now that it's ending?

So I'll hold you extra close
Knowing that I'm gonna have to let you go
Before you're someone that I used to know
Used to know, used to know, oh
I'm talking to a future ghost, ghost

I'm talking to a future ghost, ghost, ghost
(Ghost, ghost, ghost)

Finding little reminders in my apartment (apartment)
All the walls in my heart are already haunted (haunted, haunted)
You start making me jealous
I wanna call you but that would be selfish
Still gonna hurt when you're somebody else's
Even though I'm not the one

So I'll hold you extra close
Knowing that I'm gonna have to let you go
Before you're someone that I used to know
Used to know, used to know, oh
I'm talking to a future ghost, ghost

That's how the story goes
(That's how the story goes)
I'll just say that this is gonna hurt the most
(This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt)
You'll be someone that I used to know
Used to know, used to know, oh (ooh)
I'm talking to a future ghost, ghost

I'm talking to a future ghost, ghost, ghost
