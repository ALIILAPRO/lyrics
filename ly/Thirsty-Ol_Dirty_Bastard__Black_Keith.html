		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Black Keith] 
You don't even know me, you can't even see me 
Friendly of the daylight, now I'm back, now I'm back again 
Don't be scared baby, can't you see I'm thirsty? 
Friends of the daylight, let me drink, let me drink, my friend 
Don't be scared baby, don't be afraid 
Friends of the daylight, and I'm back, and I'm back again 

[Chorus] 
Never going nowhere, you can't run from me 
Day and night baby, can I drink, can I drink again 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, can we drink, can we drink, my friend? 
Don't be scared, baby. don't be scared, baby 
Can't you see I'm thirsty? And I'm back, and I'm back, again 

[Ol' Dirty Bastard] 
What, first things first, man, you can't fight the curse 
You can't call the doctor, you can't call the nurse 
You got that Louie Loco on the side of your purse 
And those tight mint sixties, about to make me burst 

I can't think, let me sink into your jugular 
Come have a drink, with the thirsty love guzzler 
From the darkside, baby, don't be afraid 
You can't fight the thirst, nor escape the Blade 

I'm been scopin' ya, hopin' you be open to 
Take a sip, of the potion 'cause it's overdue 
It's not your ordinary, it's a special brew 
In the heat of the night, I will rescue you 

[Chorus] 

[Drake] 
Allow me a parting gift, but remember this 
Sooner or later, the thirst always wins 

[Outro] 
Yeah, yeah, and I'm back, and I'm back again 
Live, live.... back again
