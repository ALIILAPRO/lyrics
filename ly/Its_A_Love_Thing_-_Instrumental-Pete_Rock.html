		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt
Here to protect thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you can trust me

You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble
Watch you jumpin' at the Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggaz cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' the steel
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love get made for a thug
Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

Tot game is crazy diamonds off the lettle
Travel through these ghettos drop to top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with came to win
How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not
But no-one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all fall, you C.L.'s wive
Cause all we got is eachother a bond for life
