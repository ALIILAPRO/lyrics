		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been feeling like
A waste of space, You know
I feel like a failure to all
My friends type of pain
Like all my friends would rather see
Me dead than alive
Cause I'm just that annoying, right

I wish I could die sometimes
I'm always trapped inside my head
I wish I could die sometimes
I'm just a failure to all my friends

I wish I could die sometimes
I'm always trapped inside my head
I wish I could die sometimes
I'm just a failure to all my friends

It's hard to get up if I fall again
Conceded in life so it always wins
I wanna know why I want to live
I wanna know why I want to
Cause everyone hates me, I'm always annoying
My music is trash
And my friends all avoid me
I'm empty inside, I can't fill up this void
And I wanna die, but I ain't got a choice
No yeah, yeah
Cause I gotta deal with this hardship
I'm working my hardest
My head and my chest, and my feet
Where my heart is
My heart is screaming to please
Please stop it

I wish I could die sometimes
I'm always trapped inside my head
I wish I could die sometimes
I'm just a failure to all my friends

I wish I could die sometimes
I'm always trapped inside my head
I wish I could die sometimes
I'm just a failure to all my friends

I don't think I'm scared of dying anymore
Not to be edgy, not to be weird
Not to even try to seem cool or anything
Not to- you know
I just genuinely feel like I'm
Not scared to die
