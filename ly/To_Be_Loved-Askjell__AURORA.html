		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up thinking of what it is to be loved
(To be loved, to be loved)

Should I know on my own on a road
What it is to be loved?
(To be loved, to be loved)
You touched my skin
So warm, but time is cold and
Trust me, I would know
In my heart, I'm the half of a whole
And it's making me feel so alone waking up
Thinking of what it is to be loved
(To be loved, to be loved)

I tell myself I have to build defenses
'Cause once you are in love
You are defenseless
Everything was easy when it meant less
But once you are in love, you are defenseless

Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
I'm never lonely until someone holds me
And lets go, just to show me
How it's like to be loved

How it's like to be loved
How it's like to be loved
I take flight, but you hold me
Is that how you show me
How it's like to be loved?
How it's like to be loved

Love, love, love love, love, love
Love, love, love love, love, love
'Cause nobody shows me nobody shows me

How it's like to be loved
How it's like to be loved
I take flight, but you hold me
Is that how you show me
How it's like to be loved?
How it's like to be loved

I tell myself I have to build defenses
'Cause once I am in love, I'll be
Once I am in love, I'll be defenseless
Defenseless
Once I am in love, I'll be defenseless
