		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't lie, I don't love you all the time, baby
I do sometimes but it's hard for me to fall in, baby

Put yourself down, have a little shame
Help me bring it back before we go away
We are all the same, we are all to blame
I don't need to say anybody's name
I'm a fucking heartache, I'm the alien
No, I'm not from Mars but I'm sure it's where I'll get
Our wars comin' first, Star Wars comin' next
It'll always be a mess, we were all forced to exist

I won't lie, I don't love you all the time, baby (I won't lie)
I do sometimes (yeah) but it's hard for me to fall in, baby (sometimes)

Yeah, look
24/7, I be planning shit
You call my line, I hit decline
You know I ain't shit and ancient
History told me "Play the game, shawty"
Cleopatra and Nefertiti, them titties have you left for dead
But when they see me gleaming on TV, I be in they head
Don't let me put my peenie on TV, that's a lot of head
Pornstar, pornstar, might as well be
'Cause my D, he a pornstar, say hi (hello)
I'm a stay fly (fellow)
I don't make time for hoes
Break her heart then I play my cello
Shalom, farewell, and chop
I'm in, I'm out, I hit, I'm out
I can't love with the doubt
We fight, we fuck, we fuck-fight
Fight, we fuck, I think it sucks, like
"Why we gotta talk so much?"
We switch it up, like we ain't gotta speak on none
We fuck, we fuck, we fuck, fuck, fuck and fuck!

Back in the day we would lay in the sun
Found out that I need a son, always had fun
Back in the day in the sun
Al—always had f—back in the

I don't feel the way that I used to (anymore)
I don't ever wanna confuse you (anymore)
We were never on the same page (never ever)
And it might be time for a change
But what do I do if I lose you?

Do you remember when we were friends?
Nothing more than that, had to last
Told me that you had my back
I said, "I've got yours back
No matter what you do, no matter where you go"
I'll be there to let you know, I'll be true
No matter what's at stake, I won't ever lie or fake
We both know something's off, it's so easy to see
We know it's obvious but don't wanna believe it
Di—didn't do the best but we got there first
Huddled up together when the weather got worse
There for each other for whatever like brothers so we gotta make it work

I don't feel the way that I used to (anymore)
I don't ever wanna confuse you (anymore)
We were never on the same page (never ever)
And it might be time for a change
But what do I do if I lose you?

Jesse, song for the bears, I swear, I'm sitting over here in the chairs
But I'm downstairs, I'm doing my hairs
Dude, your concert was off the chain, bro
I saw it in Brasil, it went freaking nuts
You are a freaking star
You know, dude, everybody in life has a place
And that's where your place is
In the—in the limelight, you know?
'Cause you're a freaking star, dude, let me tell ya
