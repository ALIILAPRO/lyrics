		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been alone for a while 
But only with you in my mind

Lost on empty pages, but the ink is already faded 
I've been alone for a while

You know I've tried, but I'm still so cold inside 

Bleed with me this time
I've been hurting to find, someone to make it right

I learn so much but lost it all 
And when I'm stuck with you I fall 

Bleed with me this time, till we bleed out.

Since you told me what you felt
I can't think of no one else 

Have you lost your way, is it time to say
That you're missing someone else 

you know I've tried, but I'm still so cold inside

Bleed with me this time
I've been hurting to find, someone to make it right

I learn so much but lost it all 
And when I'm stuck with you I fall 

Bleed with me this time, till we bleed out. 

oh oh oh oh till we bleed out
oh oh oh oh 

Bleed with me this time
I've been hurting to find, someone to make it right

I learn so much but lost it all 
and when I'm stuck with you I fall 

Bleed with me this time, till we bleed out.

oh oh oh oh till we bleed out
oh oh oh oh till we bleed out 

oooh till we bleed out.
