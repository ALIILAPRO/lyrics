		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet up at dusk
Out on the tracks
Quietly stare with poisoned eyes

There's nothing quite like time to tell how it is
We all tremble 'neath the unforgiver
Terrified but with no reason to show it yet

If we come to higher ground in the future
I will assure you that nothing was your fault
So take my chance and lose another battle
But feel nothing at all

Meet up at dusk
Out on the tracks
Quietly stare with poisoned eyes

And it's my turn
It's taking off again
It's time to find out what's on the back of my skin
Check your instinct, baby
I could have been yours

We are standing safe outside of knowledge
Where nothing ever can or will be taught
So take your right and throw it on the fire
It will change nothing at all

And it's my turn
It's taking off again
It's time to find out what's on the back of my skin
Check your instinct, baby
I could have been yours

You think it's summer but it's not
It's deceiving your eyes and paralyzing mine
You change the course
You're overlooking your defense
Our tattered flag
It's reaching for your hands

But you shut your mind to it
You fixed spikes around my heart

Meet up at dusk
Out on the tracks
Quietly stare with poisoned eyes

And it's my turn
It's taking off again
It's time to find out what's on the back of my skin
Check your instinct, baby
I could have been yours
