		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Di Genius)

Long time since I felt this way
Come by, baby, swing my way
And put your hands all around my waist
C'mon let me show you what it do, baby
A nice watch but I got no time
A couple yous that's been on my line
But it's you that I want this time
Hope you get the clue, baby

Spend the night, I'm your favorite
Now you wanna come around, spend the day with it
Simmer down, simmer down, let you lay with it
Right up 'til we done, gotta run, don't call my phone

With the ringa-ringa-ling, keep that ring
Sweet like a melon, make the bad boys cling
Cutting off ties 'cause I know no strings
Just a lil' fling, it's a one night thing
ringa-ringa-ling, keep that ring
Sweet like a melon, make the bad boys cling
Cutting off ties 'cause I know no strings
Just a lil' fling, it's a one night thing

Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night thing, yeah (it's a night thing, no)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night thing (just for one night)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night thing, yeah (just for one night)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night

I'm his pretty problem, give me this and give me that
Yeah, you got twenty-four hours to impress the putty cat
I can make that kitty purr, I can make the pussy pop
But if you shorter than eight inches, then your body do not count
I want a playboy
pull up with them diamonds and designers, make my day, boy
I love me a gangster with a dimple, that my playtoy
From the Phillipines, make it cream, make it soy, soy
Back to back years on the Forbes list
'Bout that quick cash, I ain't never seen no mortgage
Always overseas like a bitch got deported
Brand new Caddy and the guts look like oranges

Spend the night, I'm your favorite
Now you wanna come around, spend the day with it
Simmer down, simmer down, let you lay with it
Right up 'til we done, gotta run, don't call my phone

With the ringa-ringa-ling, keep that ring
Sweet like a melon, make the bad boys cling
Cutting off ties 'cause I know no strings
Just a lil' fling, it's a one night thing
ringa-ringa-ling, keep that ring
Sweet like a melon, make the bad boys cling
Cutting off ties 'cause I know no strings (no, no)
Just a lil' fling, it's a one night thing, yeah

Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night thing, yeah (it's a night thing, no)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night thing (just for one night)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night thing, yeah (just for one night)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, it's a one night
