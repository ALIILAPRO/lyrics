Rrrr

Transformer, I just popped a transformer
Lit the room up, all I did was hold my arm up
Went through Barney's, I spent 20k on Amiri's
Got my weight up, now I'm talkin' back to Siri
Smashin' foreigners, murder shit at the coroner
Jackie Joyner, racin' racks all summer
Woke the don up, all I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up, it look like I lit the sun up

Goin' bonkers, I fuck with her, I'm her sponsor
Go redundant, everything I do responsive
Off the continent, everything is out the country
No assumption, hit on the gas, start punchin'
Park my confidence, hit the gas, barely functionin'
Ain't no consciousness, I'm bout to spaz on this stallion
Fuck a casualty, everything we did was lavishly
Fuck a tragedy, all these sticks automatically

Transformer, I just popped a transformer
Lit the room up, all I did was hold my arm up
Went through Barney's, I spent 20k on Amiri's
Got my weight up, now I'm talkin' back to Siri
Smashin' foreigners, murder shit at the coroner
Jackie Joyner, racin' racks all summer
Woke the don up, all I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up, it look like I lit the sun up

What the fuck, I'm a have to pump brakes on these hoes
Real shooters, I don't ever pump fake on these hoes
Me-me-me and Pluto pull up in that new Ferrari drip
Always eatin' Japanese so I'ma need wasabi dip
Four-four four albums in, pull a milli' for a show
While these bitches is servin' Milli Vanilli on the low
Spent my money on some dope, where my money envelope?
Transform into a billi' 'cause I really am the goat (Really am the goat)
Transformer, I just popped a transformer
Master bathroom, two jacuzzis and a sauna
They ain't warn her
Now she out here facin' karma
Had a chance, but got at me now she's a goner
Where my bad bitches? Fuck these niggas, give them trauma
Coulda fixed his life but now that nigga need Iyanla
All his friends tryna kill it, eat it J.A. Dahmer
Niggas snakes but, stupid, I'm the snake charmer
This a different tax bracket, upper echelon
I'm still the bad guy, I am a Decepticon
Some call me Nicki but some call me Megatron
I'm stoppin' bags and I don't need a red octagon

Transformer, I just popped a transformer
Lit the room up, all I did was hold my arm up
Went through Barney's, I spent 20k on Amiri's
Got my weight up, now I'm talkin' back to Siri
Smashin' foreigners, murder shit at the coroner
Jackie Joyner, racin' racks all summer
Woke the don up, all I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up, it look like I lit the sun up

Thousand carats, ooh nigga Roger Rabbit
Where the towel, bitch? Ooh we just fucked a balance
Check my standings ooh, I just bought a palace
Shawty baddest, ooh, and she from a pageant
Fuck her daddy ooh, 'cause she call me "Zaddy"
'Cause she call, 'cause she call me "Zaddy"
