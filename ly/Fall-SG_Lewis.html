		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been guarded, I've been blind
We departed for some time
You made your mind up, I'm losing mine

But can we fall
All over again?
Can we fall
All over again?

If you let me, I'll be yours
I took for granted weight you bore
Now you're fading, I need you more

But can we fall
All over again?
Can we fall
All over again?

If you want it, come and get it
I'm already drowning again
If you feel it, tell me it truly
I can't wait for love to begin

But can we fall
All over again?
Can we fall
All over again?
But can we fall
All over again?
Can we fall
All over again?
