		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saucer of milk, table for 2
You wanna pet my kitty, your such a dirty doggy.
It's your lucky night, cause I'm in the mood, I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty.

Pick a part, you dream it up.
A dark vixen, a Lolita.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.

I can tell your obsessed, by your shortness of breath.
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test.
Be a good boy, and I'll show you the rest
My little voyeur wants to play explorer.

Pick a part, you dream it up.
librarian, dominatrix.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night.

Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5, Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
Saucer of milk, table for 2
You wanna pet my kitty, your such a dirty doggy.
It's your lucky night, cause I'm in the mood,
I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty.

Pick a part, you dream it up.
A dark vixen, a Lolita.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.

I can tell your obsessed, by your shortness of breath.
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test.
Be a good boy, and I'll show you the rest
My little voyeur wants to play explorer.

Pick a part, you dream it up.
librarian, dominatrix.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night.

Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5, Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5, Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
