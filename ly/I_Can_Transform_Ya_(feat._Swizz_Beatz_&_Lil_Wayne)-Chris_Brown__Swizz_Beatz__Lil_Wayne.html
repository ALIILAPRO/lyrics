		<p>
		  Go hey lil' mama
I can transform ya
No, I can't dance but I can dance on ya
Swizz on the beats, Chris move ya feet
And baby I can transform ya, him to a me
I can change you life, make it so new
Make you never want to go back to the old you
CÃ®roc and lime, give it lil' time
And she can transform like Optimus Prime

Need a ride ,I can Range you up
Money, I can change you up
You can ride your own, no longer be the passenger
Swag low, I build you up
Knees weak, I'll stand you up
Red lips, red dress, like 'em like a fire truck

What you need, you can have that
My black card, they don't decline that
See potential in ya
Let me mold that

I can transform, I can transform ya
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl, so you know I get it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes, you got it (got it)
Bags, you got it (got it)
Cars, you got it (got it)
Money, still got it (got it)
I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can (I can) get it for ya

See it in the video, you can have it really though
Iced out everything, freezing like an Eskimo
Wanna fly, we can go, anywhere you wanna go
Jimmy Choo's in Italy, Louis V in Tokyo
Somethin' like Pinocchio
If you lie down, I'm a grow
Wanna see me do it big
I can show you how it goes
Take you from an amateur to being professional
(I can have you swag surfin')

What you need, you can have that
My black card, they don't decline that
See potential in ya
Let me mold that

I can transform, I can transform ya (bounce)
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl, so you know I get it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes, you got it (got it)
Bags, you got it (got it)
Cars, you got it (got it)
Money, still got it (got it)
I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can (I can) get it for ya

Okay (Chris)
I can transform ya, like a Transformer
I can turn you from a human to a Carter
Take you off the bench, t-turn ya to a starter
Then take you home and put you on a charger
Th-then my cars transforms to a charter
And we can fly to wherever you ever thought of
Haha, I take you to wherever it's warmer
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm up
Haha, but I'm just gettin' warmed up
So tell your man he better get his voltron up
I transform her to a Ducati and then I transform me to a Bugatti
'Cause her form puts me in a trance
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants
Swizz on the Beat, Chris move ya feet
Weezy transform a good girl to a freak

I can transform ya
I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl, so you know I get it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes, you got it (got it)
Bags, you got it (got it)
Cars, you got it (got it)
Money, still got it (got it)
I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can (I can) get it for ya (Chris)
