		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the last rays of the setting sun
And the past days, yeah, that's where our memories run
And all of those times, still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
There's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till summer, you never understood
That I'll wait forever, for love that's only good
As the light starts to dim, the fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
There's no place to go
Oh, no, you won't be there tomorrow
Oh, no, say, it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh, can't you see my heart is broken in two?
Oh, say, it ain't so to fight
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
There's no place to go
