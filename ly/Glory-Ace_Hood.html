		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I done been rollin' down
Rollin', rollin'

I done been rollin' down by the deep
I done been washed up by the sea
I see through your fogginess and the debris
I see through your motive hidden underneath
I was under pressure, heavy under stress
Of meetin' the expectations, risin' higher levels
I will never settle, fold, I would never
Bold as a rebel, told, I would never
I done been rollin' down by the deep
I done been washed up by the sea
I see through your fogginess and the debris
I see through your motive hidden underneath
I was under pressure, heavy under stress
Of meetin' the expectations, risin' higher levels
I will never settle, fold, I would never
Bold as a rebel, told, I would never

I knew I was built for it from the start
Created my own light in the dark
I feel like I'm Mozart with the art
My Cubans are iced out, need a scarf
I feel like I'm Huey P. when in the march
I feel like I'm Malcolm X with the chop
By the window

Glory (glory)
You can't imagine the story (glory)
Hardest (glory)
Thought it when I was a shorty (glory)
Risin' (glory)
There were so many before me (glory)
Glory (glory)
You can't imagine the story (glory)

Madness, we been livin' in madness
Killin' each other instead of them suckers who really oppressin' the masses
'Nother one in the casket
Blacker the berry, you know ain't no sort of compassion
Had to study they tactics, we living gods
And they tryna bury our magic in their devilish action
Ain't no more doubtin' my greatness
Look adversity dead in they faces
Went through all them emotion, no phases
Hit the gym for some modifications
I've been broken before, I've been down bad
I'ma keep it three K, I'm an outcast
I been observin' the forecast
Still standin' whenever the storm pass
In that moment, you gotta believe it
Other side of that fear is your freedom
That's the difference in livin' and breathin'
Findin' your reason

I always knew that the possibilities would be endless
I did it my way

Glory (glory)
You can't imagine the story (glory)
Hardest (glory)
Thought it when I was a shorty (glory)
Risin' (glory)
There were so many before me (glory)
Glory (glory)
You can't imagine the story (glory)
