		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A Man can try to change
To wash away the stain
accustomed to the pain

Make something of today
Forget from whence you came
You'll never be the same 

Here comes the rain 
'Oh wont you bring it on down
And wash it all away

With all our bridges burned
There nowhere left to turn
Look inside to be purged 

Of sins and bad memories 
Who cares if I make enemies 
This is what I deserve

Here comes the rain 
'Oh wont you bring it on down
And wash it all away
Here Comes the Rain 
Won't you bring it on down 
Down 

Wash it all away
The grime right off soul
Ill see another day
With pain I pay the toll
So 

And when the flood has gone 
Ill stand beneath the sun
Ill be the only one

Here comes the rain 
'Oh wont you bring it on down
And wash it all away
