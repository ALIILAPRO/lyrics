		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, bye bye my life
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

Okay, let me my trace my steps
Pour a drink, let's recap the sequence
One minute, you're swigging on a green tea
Next minute, floating on a pillow in a den
From there it gets a little hazy
Like a camera out of focus, shaking
Slow motion in the club free-falling
Through my seat, hit the floor transforming
Undergoing complete metamorphous
From a moth caterpillar to a chrysalis
Spinning in a silken house like a spider spins a web
I'm a well known insect

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, bye bye my life
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright lights up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

Flying through the Yu garden to the People's Square
That's where you find your happiness
With a little too much Szechuan in the pot
Sending sensational content
Neck stuck from looking up
At the high rise buildings trying to caress
Enlightenment through an out of body experience
You're thriving in this environment
Come find me on almost every continent
Cold-blooded but I can't stand the Antarctic
Guess I've been born again overnight

Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye bye Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
