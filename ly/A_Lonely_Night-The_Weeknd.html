		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gangster, yeah, yeah
Hey, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey

Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us
There's nothin' between us, oh, ay
Why would you wanna use a life to keep us
To keep us together, uh, oh-oh

Better when we're both apart (oh), better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart (my baby), better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time 
And if I led you on then I apologize, oh (oh)

How can I make you rethink your decision?
Unruly decision, oh, hey
What's gonna make you rethink your position?
I know your intentions (I know your intentions)
Oh-oh (hey) hey

Better when we're both apart (oh), better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other (no good for each other)
Better when we're both apart (my baby), better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time 
And if I led you on then I apologize, oh
Yeah
Hey
Let's go (hey)

Better when we're both apart (oh, baby), better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart (oh, baby), better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, hey

Duh-ruh-doo-duh-duh
Duh-ruh-doo-duh-duh, oh

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh (hey)
It was the only time (it was the only time)
And if I led you on then I apologize, woah

A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh (woah)
It was the only time 
And if I led you on then I apologize, woah

Baby girl, I loved you
Know I loved you
Know I loved you
Hey
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, ay
