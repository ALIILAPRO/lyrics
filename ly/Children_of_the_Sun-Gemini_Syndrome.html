		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was taught to believe in my heart
That I could be anything that I could conceive
The truth, the truth shall set you free
Insofar as you can fit into the box that you perceive

It’s you and me
We’re family

Force fed and forgotten
Are the Children of the Sun
We refuse to believe in anything
Once again the writing’s on the wall you but can’t read
So believe in me and the Children of the Sun 

This place it must be a dream 
Never have I been so scared of anything I’ve ever seen
Embrace for your sake
The mistakes we all make

It’s you and me
We’re family

Force fed and forgotten are the Children of the Sun
We refuse to believe in anything
Once again the writing’s on the wall you but can’t read
So believe in me and the Children of the Sun

We are the Children of the Sun 
We see the light
We stand as one
We are the Children of the Sun 
We see the Light
We stand as one
We stand as one

Force fed and forgotten are the Children of the Sun
We refuse to believe in anything
Once again the writing’s on the wall you but can’t read
So believe in me and the Children of the Sun
