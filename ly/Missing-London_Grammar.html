		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I wish I was your favorite
Your creator is the all seeing alpha
The dogs who love the drama mama
She's in the kitchen, best believe in
That she's cooking up a real storm for you
Traditional mixture

Everybody's got their own idea
Of right and wrong with arms wide open
Everybody's got their own idea
Of right and wrong 
The ones who get broken

I worry that one day you'll go missing (missing)
And who will notice when you're gone?
I bet I'll call you farther from afar
And break the news that you have vanished
Like a star

On account of your behavior
As a savior, you're a real life giver
The one who pays a fiver lines are
In the kitchen, a real mister with a jacket on
The girls all cooking
The ones you've been provoking

Everybody's got their own idea
Of right and wrong with arms wide open
Everybody's got their own idea
Of right and wrong 
The ones who get broken

I worry that one day you'll go missing (missing)
And who will notice when you're gone?
I bet I'll call you farther from afar
And break the news that you have vanished
Like a star

(Everybody's got their own idea
Of right and wrong with arms wide open)

Love to see you happy again
With a love beside you
A house full of friends
But we are what we are
This life has no end
And we're breaking apart
It's a long road head

I worry that one day you'll go missing (missing)
And who will notice when you're gone?
I bet I'll call you farther from afar
And break the news that you have vanished
Like a star
