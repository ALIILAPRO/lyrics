		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Haha, yeah
Yeah

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

I apply pressure to pussies, they stunt and I pop (yeah)
Stand above 'em squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I got 'em (uh-huh)
Now Peter Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop 9s (brrt)
Tell niggas, get they money right, 'cause I got mine (uh-huh)
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine (woo)
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me nigga, that's what I'm about
Gangsta, you could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (yeah)

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth, so smack him (woo)
You holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him (yeah)
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for acting (come on)
'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking, "What happened?"
Oh no, look who crept 'em with the .44 (woo)
20 inch rims sitting on low pros (uh-huh)
Eastside, Westside niggas know, yo, I'm loco (yeah)
Even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit! (Yeah) We get it popping in the hood
G-Unit! (Yeah) Motherfucker what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act (uh-huh)
After sipping too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the MAC, thinking its all rap
'Til that ass get clapped and Doc say "It's a wrap"
(It's a wrap, nigga)

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop (uh-huh)
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go head, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner (ah)
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty, dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, you heard me? (Yeah)
When the streetlights come on, niggas blast the 9s (uh-huh)
Get locked up, then read books to pass the time (woo)
In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (uh-uh)
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so grandpa called me a nuisance
And grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it
Fuck it

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top (yeah)
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

Uh-huh
I'ma make it hot
Dr. Dre, Aftermath
Shady
Haha
