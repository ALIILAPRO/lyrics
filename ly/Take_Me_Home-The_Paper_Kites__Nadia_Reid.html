		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't go, I can't leave
I wear it like it's on my sleeve
I work at night 'til the working's done
Burn on down the highway one

People all around me now
I'm a stranger in a stranger town
I know just where you're gonna be
Take me home so I can see
Take me home so I can see

It's the light on the valley
It's the leaves when they change color like they do
It's the thunder rolling in
Take me home

It's the sound of the rain falling down
It's the slowing of the world going round
It's a light in the window that I've found
Take me home

I can't go, I can't leave
I wear it either way it seems
I work at night till the working's done
I know just where I'm coming from
Show me where I'm coming from

It's the light on the valley
It's the leaves when they change color like they do
It's the thunder rolling in
Take me home

It's the sound of the rain falling down
It's the slowing of the world going round
It's a light in the window that I've found
Take me home
Take me home
