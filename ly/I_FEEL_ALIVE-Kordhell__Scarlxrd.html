		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a couple enemies that used to be my friends
Stay subtle, motherfucker, if I find you then you're dead
I'ma treble all the trouble, aim the fire at your neck
This is King Scarlxrd, motherfucker, you scared
All these rich bitches wanna fuck me
You ain't got digits, you bluffin'
I been on a mission, still runnin'
I'll keep all your secrets if you're lucky
Nigga, when you see me say nothin'

All my life, I've wanted this
Now I've got it, I feel sick
So addicted, I can't rest
Bitch, I'm lost inside my head

(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
I fuckin' feel alive (go, go, go, go, go, go)
Name a motherfucker this bad, name a motherfucker this bad
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
I fuckin' feel alive (go, go, go, go, go, go)
Name a motherfucker this bad, name a motherfucker this bad (yeah)

I wanna vibe outside my mind, it's fuckin' crazy
I wanna let go of my flaws
And when I'm high, they think I'm way too fuckin' crazy
I wanna live inside my core

Risin' from the ashes like a phoenix
And I got the passion, yes, I need it
And I'm on these tracks again, I need it
I ain't comin' back until I feel it
Lay it on the track until they feel me again
Pussy, you know I'm built different, Young Scarlxrd too efficient
Know when I get in, I kill shit
Easy with the dub, I'm winnin'
Gettin' to the work for the digits, it's easy, it's done

All my life, I've wanted this
Now I've got it, I feel sick
So addicted, I can't rest
Bitch, I'm lost inside my head

(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
I fuckin' feel alive (go, go, go, go, go, go)
Name a motherfucker this bad, name a motherfucker this bad
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
I fuckin' feel alive (go, go, go, go, go, go)
Name a motherfucker this bad, name a motherfucker this bad (yeah)

I wanna vibe outside my mind, it's fuckin' crazy
I wanna let go of my flaws
And when I'm high, they think I'm way too fuckin' crazy
I wanna live inside my core
