		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ninety ninety motherfucking 1
NWA's back in this motherfucking yo
Takin' out all you commercialized ass niggas
And we're on this lay back track
And we're doin' this well kinda smooth
So what's you're gonna do Dre Kick it!

It's so on le the shit flow on
Because I need somethin' to go off on
The motherfucking D-R-E servin' a death wish
So I'm a hit you like this
Early in the morning hop into the Benz
I got 44 wayz of gettin' paid
Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To skoop up Ren I heard shots,
1 2 3, Then I see the nigga
Hop in the Benz and it was Ren on the motherfucking trigger
He got in the Benz and said
"Dre I was speakin' to de bitch O'shey"
And as we roll on I seen the patrol on crip
So we got ghost because they beat
Me and Ren in the black CE, yo,
Poppin' some funky shit by the D.O.C
I gotta get paid, paid in a hurry see
I gotta have it if I'm not paid fully
I start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'
A niggas always into something

I hear a dope beat
Somebody told me to buck dead
But if Dre didn't do it I can't fuck with it
NWA is like a mix a fix a trix
Real niggas with big dicks
You're takin' a chance when you think that
Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit and shit by the killin'
For a nigga labeled as bein' a motherfucking Villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
I was so afraid I'd be a motherfuckin' faliure
Real niggas got a hat-top breakin'
I hooked up with 3 more niggas and started makin' 
Funky-ass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you don't want the confrontation
Real niggas don't play,
Yella, Eazy, Me and the nigga nigga Dre
Yo, always makin' sure that my shit is steady bumpin'

Yeah, the world's most dangerous group
Definitely in this motherfucker
Sendin' a shout-out to all the niggas out there
Yo you can get in the pick up and suck the dick up 'till you hick-up
You know what I'm sayin'
Yo, cause I'm a nigga for life
And I realy don't give a fuck
I'm goin' for mine, every time
I see a fuckin' softy,
Punk strong as coffee
A nigga like that best to back up off me
Yo, cause these are the days and the times of the real nigga
False niggas, NWA's toss' niggas
And that's on de real cause I'm a nigga that kills
Again and again so tell 'em what's up Ren

If i'm not no nothin' I don't feel like
So I grab de 9 n' de clip and go to murder motherfuckers at night
Because I'm startin' to feel
I'm sittin' in a cell with a crimerz too tragic it couldn't make bail
So now they gotta hold me
And listen to rehabilitation's over and over
Sayin' they told me
But I don't give a fuck cause I know my shit is pumpin'
A niggas always into something
