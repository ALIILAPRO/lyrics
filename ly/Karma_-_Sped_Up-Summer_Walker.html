		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told you, you better stay prayed up
You never thought the universe be looking for revenge

You can't keep just doing them girls like that
Thinking that nobody finna bite back
Losing your mind, baby
Can't be sure, time's wasted

Nice to meet you, I'm sorry
I'm just here to do my job
Nice to meet you, no running
Please don't fear me, I'm just karma

Let me dance for you, I'm sorry
You'll wanna love me strong, then I'm gone
This feeling's just for you and your wrongs
I am just here to do my job

Devil in disguise (oh)
Dressed in all white, swear you so down
Think I'm supposed to ride (oh)
You done told me I should be only one around
Talkin' 'bout you'll make it my way
Made it my, made it my way
Think I gotta run, boy
You don't wanna be telling me
Take me to your mama house
I'm sorry if you never doubted me
But you should've doubted
('Cause I told you, yeah)

'Cause, don't you know you can't be doing them girls like that?
Thinkin' that nobody finna bite back
Losing your mind, baby
Can't be sure, time's wasting

Nice to meet you, I'm sorry
I'm just here to do my job
Nice to meet you, then sudden
I won't fear you, I'm just karma

Let me dance for you, I'm sorry
Do you wanna love me strong, then I'm gone
This feeling, what we have, then it stops
I am just here to do my job
Do my job, oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Do my job
