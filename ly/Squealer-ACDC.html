		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said she's never been, mmm
Never been touched before
She said she'd never been
This far before

She said she'd never liked
Mmm to be excited
She said she'd always had
Had to fight it (and she never won)

She said she'd never been
Never been balled before
And I don't think, he he
She'll ever ball no more (fixed her good)
Hey

Squealer, when I held her hand
Squealer, I made her understand
Squealer, when I kissed her lips
Squealer, and sucked her finger tips
Squealer, ooh started getting hot
Squealer, made it hard to stop
Squealer, got too much
Squealer, I think I've got a magic touch oh

Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squeaker
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
Squealer
