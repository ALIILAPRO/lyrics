		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you always doing that?
Breaking up with me then making up
Just to make me mad

I think that you taste like rock candy
Sweet like beaches, leave me all sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

Why you always doing that?
Playing guitar while I'm sleeping
Acting like a brat

I think that you're sweet like rock candy
Warm like beaches that leave me sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right
Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

Why you always doing that?
Breaking up with me then making up just to make me mad
Oh oh, hey hey, why?
That don't make it right
