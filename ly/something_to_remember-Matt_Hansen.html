		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The memories come but they don't go
I hear the echoes pounding in my head
As long as I keep my eyes closed
You're lying right back in my arms again

I moved out but I never moved on
So tell me now, where did we go so wrong?

I was your something once
The picture on your dresser
When did I become your something to remember?
All of my friends were wrong
They said that I'll forget her
But she's the kinda song
You could play forever

Ohh-oh-oh, I thought we had it all

I was your something once
Now you found something better
How did I become just something to remember?

Oh, do you think of me at all?
Or have I never crossed your mind again?
Do you not miss me anymore?
Or are you really good at hiding it?

I moved out but I never moved on
So tell me now, where did we go so wrong?

I was your something once
The picture on your dresser
When did I become your something to remember?
All of my friends were wrong
They said that I'll forget her
But she's the kinda song
You could play forever

Ohh-oh-oh, I thought we had it all

I was your something once
Now you found something better
How did I become just something to remember?

I was your something once
Now you found something better
How did I become just something to remember?
