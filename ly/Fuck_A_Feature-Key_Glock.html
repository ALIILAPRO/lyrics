Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Glizock
Yeah
Ahem
The fuck?
PRE 5L
Yeah, yeah (ayy)

Yeah, I might just pay myself for a feature
It's Glizock, I be fresh and I finesse just like a preacher
It's M-O-B, I heard that it's cheaper to keep her
But hell nah, I ain't stressin' 'bout no money or these bitches neither (uh-uh)

Ridin' with a hundred shots up in a two-seater
Say hello to my little friend, it's nice to meet you
My top down, my eyes low, I'm smokin' on some ether
My money long, my pockets fat, my pockets on Peter, nigga 
Yeah, my pockets on Peter Griffin
Yeah, yeah, bitch, I been gettin' it (yeah)
Nina on my side, I let it spit just like Nicki (fah)
Too much money, they think I'm illuminati, this shit wicked (what's up?)
Ayy, I'm too much for these niggas
Ayy, I'm three much for these bitches
Every day, I pour a four, codeine floatin' in my system
Yup, my cousin, he's a bishop
But, no, I ain't talkin' church, but we clappin' like we in one (bah)

Ayy, I might just pay myself for a feature (yeah)
It's Glizock, I be fresh and I finesse just like a preacher (yeah)
It's M-O-B, I heard that it's cheaper to keep her (what?)
But hell nah, I ain't stressin' 'bout no money or these bitches neither (the fuck?)

This money got me turnt up, yup, yup, I just broke the meter (yeah)
I'm flexin' on these niggas, shit, I had to drop a sequel (yeah)
You know I rep that five, bitch, I do this for my people (yeah)
I'm smokin' on some 'za, but my auntie call it reefer (that's dope)
I'm ballin' hard on all my opps (opps), them niggas in the bleachers
You know I call all the shots (all the shots), I hang with grim reapers
You know we standin' on top (on top), them niggas just beneath us
Ayy, fuck the rap game, just pay myself for a feature (yeah, Glizock)
Ayy, fuck the rap game, I'll pay myself for a feature
Ayy, fuck the rap game, I'll pay myself for a feature, yeah (on God)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (on God)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (on God)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah
