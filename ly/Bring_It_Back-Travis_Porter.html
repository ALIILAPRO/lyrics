		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run and hit that p**** like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes
Shake that a** for me
Bounce that a** on the flo’, bring it back up
Hit a split on the dick, shawty act up
Now bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
Act a fool, bring it back

Shawty goin' hard, concrete
She can shake her ass, one cheek, two cheeks
Both cheeks, both cheeks
I got a white girl freak she got no cheeks
Got a police b**** on a short leash
Got good mouth like she got no teeth
She a slut, she a dog, she a b**** with it
Man you see the way she work she super thick with it
Have them hoes throwin' salt
Tell the b**** get it
Started playin' with her pussy
Tell the b**** split it
Pop that p****, I just wanna fuck you
If you ain’t with it, you cute but shawty f*** you

Run and hit that p**** like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes
Shake that a** for me
Bounce that a** on the flo’, bring it back up
Hit a split on the dick, shawty act up
Now bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
Act a fool, bring it back

Back that a** up like a dump truck
If you havin' fun in the club, throw ya pumps up
All my ballas in the building throw ya ones up
If you ain’t throwin' no money then get ya funds up
I asked her what her name is and she said her name Nicki
Got a real big booty and some real big titties
Say she don’t really come out to the city
'Cause she a country girl and she like to get busy
She got a good job and she say she twenty-four
I said OK then shawty hit the flo’
And I was like whoa
Then I threw some ones just to let shawty know
Just to let shawty that I'ma

Run and hit that p**** like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes
Shake that a** for me
Bounce that a** on the flo’, bring it back up
Hit a split on the dick, shawty act up
Now bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
Act a fool, bring it back

Bring that a** back like you left some
Shawty so hot she can melt some
Feel like I wanna smack her with a belt or some
So I told her come here so I can tell her some
I wanna see ya big booty on my upper leg
And I’ll throw a couple dollars at ya upper head
How bout you and ya friends just give me double head
At breakfast time she gave me supper head
And that’s a great feeling
And I f*** with her because she so willing
Watch her I do whatever that I tell her
So I broke her down and this is what I tell her

Run and hit that p**** like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes
Shake that a** for me
Bounce that a** on the flo’, bring it back up
Hit a split on the dick, shawty act up
Now bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
Bring it back
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
She can act
Act a fool, bring it back
