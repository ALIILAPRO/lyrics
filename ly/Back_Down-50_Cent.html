		  Woo
Yeah
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (G-Unit)
Haha

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin' hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

Any livin' thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existin', little nigga, now listen (yeah)
Your mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty ass kids, I'll fuckin' erase 'em
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard (yeah)
Knowin' that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard (ah)
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle (hahaha)
I eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful 'cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history (uh-huh)
Never poked nothin', never popped nothin', nigga stop frontin'
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you runnin' 'round like you some big shot (haha)
Ha, pussy

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin' hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

"The rap game is all fucked up now, what we gon' do now?
How we gonna eat, man? 50 back around"
That's Ja's little punk ass thinkin' out loud
Southside 'til I die, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the Cookie Monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child
Them niggas dead, they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back better than ever on top of my game
Even them country boys sayin', "50 we feeling you, mane"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy (bad guy)

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin' hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

I ain't gon' tell nobody you pussy
I ain't gon' tell nobody you gettin' extorted, nah (it ain't over) (G-Unit)
I've been patently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "The 50 Cent Show" (woo)
This is my life, my pain, my night, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down 'cause you fear for your life
But you heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't goin' nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfuckin' soldier, nigga
(They not gon' like you)
I know, I know, hahaha (G-Unit)

Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja
Okay? Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffrey
Okay, first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pink belt
Okay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery
Okay, 'cause see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?
Okay, I thought so
'Cause you know that I know karate, and I will see him
And I will Jet Li his ass, wu-ta
