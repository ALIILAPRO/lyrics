		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Alright, Brendan gimmie me a beat
And I was thinkin' something more Reggae, you know?
Maybe
Getting closer
Can you slow it down a bit?
Yeah
That's what I'm talkin' about
Now check out my wo-wo, come on give me some effects

(Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow)
(Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow)

I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat
Yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do
When it comes to you
I see only the good
Selective memory
The way you makes me feel, yeah
Gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different

Oh here we go
You're part of me now
You're a a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you

I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm tryna say 
Is not to forget
I see only the good
Selective memory

The way you makes me feel, yeah
Gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different

Oh here we go
You're a part of me now
You're a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you

Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
