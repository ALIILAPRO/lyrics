		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I held it all in with blood on my face
Built it up, man, so bad you can taste

I don't slag no one, I don't even judge
Don't give me shit 'cause I'm not gonna budge
I just want to be who I want to be
Guess that's hard for others to see

I'm not a trendy asshole, I do what I want
I do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole, I don't give a fuck
If it's good enough for you
'Cause I'm alive

Smash is the way you feel all alone
Like an outcast you're out on your own
Smash is the way you deal with your life
Like an outcast you're smashing your strife

Head over heels I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I just want to be who I want to be
Guess that's hard for others to see

I'm not a trendy asshole, I do what I want
I do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole, I don't give a fuck
If it's good enough for you
'Cause I'm alive

Head over heels I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I just want to be who I want to be
Guess that's hard for others to see

I'm not a trendy asshole, I do what I want
I do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole, I don't give a fuck
If it's good enough for you
I'm not a trendy asshole, I do what I want
I do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole, I don't give a fuck
If it's good enough for you
'Cause I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

There, I hope you enjoyed our time together today
You know, it seems harder and harder
To just sit back and enjoy the finer things in life
Well, till next time
Ta-ta
