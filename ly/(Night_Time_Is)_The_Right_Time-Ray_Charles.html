		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know the night time, darling (night and day)
Is the right time (night and day)
To be (night and day)
With the one you love, now (night and day)

Say now, oh baby (night and day)
When I come home baby, now (night and day)
I wanna be with the one I love, now (night and day)
You know what I'm thinking of (night and day)

I know the night time (night and day, oh)
Whoa, is the right time (night and day, oh)
To be with the one you love, now (night and day)
I said to be with the one you love (night and day)

You know my mother, now (night and day)
Had to die, now (night and day)
Umm, and my father (night and day)
Well he broke down and cry (night and day)

Whoah, whoa baby (night and day)
When I come home baby now (night and day)
I want you to hold my hand (night and day)
Yeah, tight as you can (night and day)

I know the night time (night and day, oh)
Whoah is the right time (night and day, oh)
To be with the one you love (night and day)
You know what I'm thinking of (night and day)

Whoah, sing your song, Margie

Baby (night and day)
Baby (night and day)
Baby (night and day)
Oh, Baby (night and day)

Do I love you? (night and day)
No one above you (night and day)
Hold me tight (night and day)
And make everything all right (night and day)

Because the night time (night and day)
Oh, is the right time (night and day)
To be with the one you love now (night and day)
Oh yeah (night and day)

Tease me (night and day)
Squeeze me (night and day)
Leave me (night and day)
Ah, don't leave me (night and day)

Lawdy baby (night and day)
Take my hand, now (night and day)
I don't need (night and day)
No other man (night and day)

Because the night time (night and day)
Ow, is the right time (night and day)

To be with the one you love (night and day)
Oh yeah (night and day)

I said baby (night and day)
Baby (night and day)
Baby (night and day)
Baby (night and day)
Whoah, baby now (night and day)

Oh come on baby (night and day)
You know I want you by my side (night and day)
I want you to keep (night and day)
Oh keep me satisfied (night and day)

I know the night time (night and day)
Everyday is the right time (night and day)
Yeah to be with the one you love now (night and day)

Well, you know it's all right
