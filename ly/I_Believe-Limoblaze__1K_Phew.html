		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe in me
I believe in you oh I

Oh I got a couple little things I wanna know I
Is there any who can battle the Most High
Is there any who can go against His bloodline
They wanna try but they don't know why
So Your love gon overtake me like a sunrise
Or when I get up in the morning you're the one I'll
Steady giving all my worship in the good times
And the bad times they cannot stress me
Nothing whatever you do gon impress me
I know the world came really hot they won't finesse me
Should know that Eledumare to guide me
There to guide me

So I
I believe it (I believe in you)
Oh I believe it (Oh I believe it)
Oh oh I (I believe in you)
So I
I believe it (I believe in you)
Oh I believe it (Oh I believe it)
Oh oh I (I believe in you)

Got a smile on my face when it's raining (Yeah yeah)
Made it right here today no complaining (Yeah yeah)
I done did some bad tings I'm so sorry (Yeah yeah)
But I still had your love when you salty (Salty)
When they see me on TV you got me (Yeah yeah)
Even running from fed time and hiding (Fed time)
Tried to keep it together but fell apart (Yeah yeah)
When I'm not close God you're not too far (Yeah)
Hands in the sky just to remind ya (Yeah)
Don't need police to lift my arms up (Lift)
Can't leave the house without my armor
Bible on me to show I

I believe it (I believe in you)
Oh I believe it (Oh I believe it)
Oh oh I (I do believe in you)
So I
I believe it (I believe in you)
Oh I believe it (Oh I believe it)
Oh oh I (I do believe in you)

I believe in you
Yes I believe in you
Oh oh oh oh
I believe in you
I believe in you
Yeah yeah yeah
