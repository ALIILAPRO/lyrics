		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't just let you guard down and fall for someone anymore
That's what stupid girls do
Yeah, I been a stupid girl

Four days away in his arms, I invest
He won't take my heart
But he'll take off my dress
Excuses rehearsed
I am blue, I am red
Fuck looking for love
I'ma stay doing what us bitches do best

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sipping Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he calling me
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch, 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm dead, if he calling me

You're a very silly man, block, block, mute chat
New Addy in the sat, new dicks on tap
Got a best case, worse case plan of attack
Got bitches, if they see you in the street
You're getting slapped
Don't threaten me or talk to me ever like that
I got bruddas in the ends that would pull up right now
You don't even want to see the way I pull up right now
With my little black dress and my neck, buss down
Now I, mm-hmm

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sipping Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he calling me
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch, 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm dead, if he calling me

Block you off, too swift
Hit a ting I used to link who always texts back fast
And I would tell you, "Kiss my ass"
I know you wish that you could
Since the fuckery from my past, I tend to move on quick
I tend to move on good

Seasoned the speed, now I'm over the man
Who was sleeping underneath me
Said, "I couldn't live without you," when I loved you
Well, I lied and you shouldn't have believed me
Twenty-four hours in the bed and believe me it's 'bout to get freaky
Only get to see me when you see me on a phone screen, G
You no longer know me, I no longer want you
You may never hold me

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sipping Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he calling me (ooh)
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch, 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm dead, if he calling me

Ooh, oh no, oh no, no, no
Ooh, oh no, ooh, ooh (oh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ah)
Only because I was in love, I opened up
Now I'll open up to your best friend
Which one? Bitch like me
I just had to flip the switch on you (ooh)

Flip a switch on a prick, then I (then I)
Come alive in the nighttime (in the nighttime)
In the club, sipping Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he calling me (baby)
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch, 'til you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy (that my energy)
Tell him I'm dead, if he calling me, oh, oh, oh (me, yeah, yeah)

Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ah
Only because I was in love, I opened up
Now I'll open up to your best friend
Which one? Bitch like me
I just had to flip the switch on you
