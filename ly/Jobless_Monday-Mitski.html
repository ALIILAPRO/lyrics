		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a windy afternoon 
Can't afford to buy my food 
Or the drive I need to go 
Further than they said I'd go 

He only loves me when 
There's a means he means to end 
Oh I miss when we first met 
He didn't know me yet 

So take me out baby 
Makes no difference where we'll be 
As long as we're out in the sun 
Take me out baby 

Take me out baby 
Doesn't matter where we'll be 
But please under the light of day 
Take me out 
Take me out 
Take me out baby
