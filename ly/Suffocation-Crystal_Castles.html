		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We ignore refused consent
Animals do not repent
Courtesy to intervene
Weathered down my selfish needs

I suffocate
And promise me you won't resuscitate
And when I change my mind it's far too late
I'm wasting my days as I've wasted my nights and I've wasted my youth
You're waiting for something you've waited in vain because there's nothing for you

Suffocation

Humility yet to be seen
Models made of plasticine
Morality disgrace us now
Entertain and take a bow

I suffocate
And promise me you won't resuscitate
And when I change my mind it's far too late
I'm wasting my days as I've wasted my nights and I've wasted my youth
You're waiting for something you've waited in vain because there's nothing for you

Suffocation
