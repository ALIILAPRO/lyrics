		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got like 30 missed calls
Staying in another night
And I've been talking to the walls
Feel a bit out of my mind

You don't even know, you don't even know
What is going on, what is going on
I could try to smile, done it for a while
But nobody knows it like I

I wish, I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's sunny all the time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why
I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's sunny all the time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why

I've been trying to drink away
All the nights I can't forget
And the voices screaming in my head
'Bout the days I most regret

You don't even know, you don't even know
Nobody knows it like I

I wish, I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's sunny all the time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why
I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's sunny all the time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why

Oooh
Oooh (wish I wish I was)
Oooh (nah nah nah nah)
Oooh

I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's sunny all the time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why
