		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my friends are movin' on
Getting hitched and then they're gone
And I'm alone, all alone
I'm in the same room as before
With mom and dad right next door
And I'm scared I might be here forever
I love them but some ties need to be severed

And I said I'd move out last year
So why the hell am I still here?

Oh, it's easy to say I'm ok
But this smile I'm wearing is fake
I'm suffocating
Living Groundhog Day
Day after day, day after day
I think I'm gonna break

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

My friend's baby's on the way
Just 22 but should I do the same?
But I'm broke and unemployed
Another night staring straight into the void and

I just wanna drive away
But I don't have a car so I guess I gotta stay

And it's easy to say I'm ok
Up and down these emotional waves
I'm sick and tired of living Groundhog Day
Day after day, day after day
And I think I'm gonna break

Day after day
Day after day
Day after day
Day after day
Day after day
Day after day

And it's easy to say I'm ok
But this smile I'm wearing is fake
I'm sick and tired of
Living Groundhog Day
Day after day, day after day
And I think I'm gonna break
I think I'm gonna break
And I think I'm gonna break
I-I-I-I-I-I
