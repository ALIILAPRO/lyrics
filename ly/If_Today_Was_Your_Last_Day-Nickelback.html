		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My best friend gave me the best advice
He said, "Each day's a gift and not a given right"
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if? What if?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (Would you? Would you?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (Would you? Would you?)
If today was your last day
(What if? What if?)
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live it like you're never livin' twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
(What if? What if?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (Would you? Would you?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (Would you? Would you?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (Could you? Could you?)
And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love? (Finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark
By mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time
Are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (Would you? Would you?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (Could you? Could you?)
And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love? (What if? What if?)
If today was your last day
