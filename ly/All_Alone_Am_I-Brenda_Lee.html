		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All alone am I ever since your goodbye 
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound 
Just the lonely beating of my heart

No use in holding other hands 
For I'd be holding only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips
For I'd be thinking just of your caress

All alone am I ever since your goodbye 
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound 
Just the lonely beating of my heart

No other voice can say the words
My heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low
No other love can ever bring again

All alone am I ever since your goodbye 
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound 
Just the lonely beating of my heart
