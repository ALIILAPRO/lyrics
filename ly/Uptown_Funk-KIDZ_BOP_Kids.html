		  This hit, that ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one for them good girls
Them good girls straight masterpieces
Stylin', whilen, livin' it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Got kiss myself, I'm so pretty
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Called a police and a fireman
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Make a dragon wanna retire man
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Say my name you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Am I bad 'bout that money, break it down

Hey, hey, hey, oh

Stop, wait a minute
Fill my cup, put some water in it
Take a sip, sign a check
Julio, get the stretch
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood
Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon' show out
Smoother than a fresh dry skippy
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Called a police and a fireman
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Make a dragon wanna retire man
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Yeah, say my name you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot yeah)
Am I bad 'bout that money
Break it down

Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)
Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)
