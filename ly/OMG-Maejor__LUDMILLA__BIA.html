		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can celebrate and live the good life
We can make the moment unforgettable
We keep goin' up we on a good vibe
Really all the blessings unbelievable

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God (Brasil)

Eu tô na vibe
Vem, tá suave
Solta no baile, solta na pista
Chega chegando
Vai embrazando
Traz a galera, traz a bebida
Mais uma dose
Chega e se envolve
Vai, traz a garrafa que pisca
Mexa essa raba, senta e não para
Vem com a danada da Ludmilla
A gente quica, senta e sobe
Pega e não se envolve
Se ficar de marra, a gente pega e dá um sacode
A gente quica, senta e sobe
Pega e não se envolve
Se ficar de marra, a gente pega e dá um, hm

We can celebrate and live a good life
We can make the moment unforgettable
We keep goin' up we on a good vibe
Really all the blessings unbelievable

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God

Tú no conoces a mi amigas
Me gusta tequila, no Chivas
He want a new señorita
I might just give 'em a piece
A piece of this work, oye mamita
Dame cabeza inside of your Beemer
He want a baby because I'm Boricua
Yo soy loca, livin' mi vida
I'm in the UK no Visa
Serving, I look like Serena (serve)
I cut him off for no reason
'Cause I want him don't mean I'ma need him
I know the reason they like me
Eso picante, I'm spicy
New nigga going hyphy
We break up, you still wanna wife me

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh my God

I wasn't faithful, she wasn't neither
I was just playful, she was a cheater
I was a razor, she was a bleeder
I was an angel, she was a demon
I am the best, she ain't believe it
I took a jet, went out to Sweden
I been so blessed, cut out the schemin'
I was a mess, now I got meanin', uh

We can celebrate and live a good life
We can make the moment unforgettable
We keep goin' up we on a good vibe
Really all the blessings unbelievable

Oh, oh, oh, oh
