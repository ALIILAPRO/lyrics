		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got nipples on my titties
Big as the end of my thumb
I got somethin' between my legs'll
Make a dead man cum, oh, daddy

Baby, won't you shave 'em dry?
Now, draw it out
Want you to grind me, baby
Grind me until I cry

Say, I fucked all night
And all the night before, baby
And I feel just like I wanna fuck some more
Oh, great God, daddy, grind me, honey, and shave me dry

And when you hear me holler, baby
Want you to shave dry

I got nipples on my titties
Big as the end of my thumb
Daddy, you say that's the kind of woman you want
And you can make 'em cum
Oh, daddy, shave me dry
And I'll give you something, baby
Swear it'll make you cry

I'm gonna turn back my mattress
And let you oil my springs
I want you to grind me, daddy
'Til the bells do ring, oh daddy
Want you to shave 'em dry
Oh, great God, daddy, if you can't shave 'em, baby, won't you try?

Now if fuckin' was the thing that would take me to heaven
I'd be fuckin' in the studio 'til the clock strike eleven
Oh daddy, daddy, shave 'em dry
I would fuck you, baby, honey, I'd make you cry

Now your nuts hang down like a damn bell sapper
And your dick stands up like a steeple
Your goddam asshole stands open like a church door
And the crab walks in like people, ow, shit
Shucks, ooh
Baby, won't you shave 'em dry?

A big sow gets fat from eatin' corn
And a pig gets fat from suckin'
When you see this whore, fat like I am
Great God, I got fat from fuckin'
Eeh, shave 'em dry (with pleasure

My back is made of whalebone
And my cock is made of brass
And my fuckin' is made for workin' men's two dollars
Great God, 'round to kiss my ass

Woo, daddy, shave 'em dry
