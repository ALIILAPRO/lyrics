		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go up there
Feel the melody that's in the air
I'm down to look around
What's going down

Ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
What's going on
Steady are you ready
What's going on

Go up
Go up
Go up
Go up
Go up
Go up
Go up
Go up

Go up there
Feel the melody that's in the air
I'm down to look around
What's going down

However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want

Go up there
Feel the melody
Go up there
Feel the melody
Go up there
Feel the melody
Go up there
Feel the melody
Go up there
Feel the melody
Go up there
Feel the melody
Go up there
Feel the melody
Go up there
Feel the melody that's in the air
