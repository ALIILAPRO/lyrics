		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My lover left at eight at night
The dark was heavier than life
Set the scene
But could've sworn that I was fine
You left the window wide open
Lying places I can't stand
Put my foot down, but you kept the upper hand

Moving fast until it breaks
You left me weak and in a daze
Feelin' low on the highway

Cut me open, steal my clothes
Told me yes, but god only knows
Couldn't come
But that's just how the way life goes
Give me the boot, now I can't hear
Give me gifts, then to turn to steel
Made your bed, cooked all day
And I can't deal

Felt like seconds but they were hours
A fallen rose is just a flower
Hand on my hip, it's just a waist
Felt so right, I can't erase
Feelin' low on the highway

I'm feelin' low on the highway
I'm feelin' low on the highway
Iâ€™m feelin' low on the highway
