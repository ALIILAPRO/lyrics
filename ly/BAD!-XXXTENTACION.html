		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Shawty, heard you bad, word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad, word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love the way you movin' now

I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in the brain, yeah-ahh
Realize she just want me hit it right
'Cause I get 'em goin' right

Shawty, heard you bad, word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad, word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love the way you movin' now
