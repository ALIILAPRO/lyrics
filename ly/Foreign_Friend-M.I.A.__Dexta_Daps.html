		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah!

There ain't nothing to it
With the friend I keep it cool with
Love it, we been through it
Sticking like glue, now chew it
Bad girls, hands up
Ride or die and we feel it
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
If you can't then screw it

Gonna be your best friend
Gonna make that shit trend
I'm gonna be your foreign friend
All the way to the end

I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma need you like your best bless dem
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh
(Go best friend, go best friend)
I'ma squeeze you like my best friend

You can be my best friend
You know too much to be a foe
You were there from before
In the days when I had no doe
Break bread, watch Breaking Bad
Always there when I breakup bad
In bed, feeling so sad
You were always there as a comrade
I know you think like me
Life ain't easy for the people like we
Say life's a box of chocolates
We say who packed it, do you feel me?
What you do's none of my business
But I want you to make me a witness
Wanna witness the greatness?
Cause we best friends through health and sickness

Gonna be your best friend
Gonna make that shit trend
I'm gonna be your foreign friend
All the way to the end

I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh oh

(You can be my foreing friend yea yea
You can be my foreign friend)
I said as a refugee, you know
Where we come from, we get out our tent
Then we climb over the fence
We don't wanna cause an offence
Then we get a Benz, flat screen tv, and we pay rent
Then we think we made it
Then we be your foreign friend

Best friend, can't condemn
If you give her you are banned
Partner defend till the end
All people depend on a friend
There's nothing to it
With the friend I keep it cool with
Fuck it, we been through it
We sticking like glue, now chew it
Bad girls, hands up
Ride or die and we feel it
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
If you can't then screw it

Gonna be your best friend
Gonna make that shit trend
I'm gonna be your foreign friend
All the way to the end

I'ma treat you like my best friend
Oh oh oh oh
I'ma need you like your best bless dem
I'm gonna
Gonna be your best friend
Then I'm gonna
Gonna make that shit trend
Gonna gonna
When you live in your hands
Cause me and you hanging
It could be gasping, yea
I'ma treat you like my best friend
(Go best friend, go best friend)
(Go best friend, go best friend)
Yea
You can be my foreign friend yea yea
You can be my foreign friend
Come down to my if you condone, again
