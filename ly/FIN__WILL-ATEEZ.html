		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What does emotion mean to you?

Aren't you still tormented by the pain from the past?
Have you ever panicked and felt broken by sadness?
Have you ever lost yourself in overwhelming fear?
Have you ever felt so down that you wanted to be alone in this world?

(Eh)
What does emotion mean to you? (Is it who you are?)
(Ooh-eh-oh)

(Is it who you are?)
(Eh)
(Is it who you are?)
(Ooh-eh-oh)
(Eh)

Have memories of happiness ever lifted you up?
Have you ever been inspired by a dream that felt both far and clear? (Eh)
Have you ever found comfort in the laughter of children?
Have you ever fallen in love?

(Eh)
(Ooh-eh-oh)

What does emotion mean to you? (Eh)
(Ooh-eh-oh)

(Eh)
(Ooh-eh-oh)

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Is it who you are?
Is it who you are?
