		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell
I can tell, baby, I can tell
Ooh, I can tell, baby, I can tell
You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales
Yeah, gone out of your way, you know we can tell
Yeah, I can tell, baby, I can tell
I can tell, baby, I can tell
I can tell, baby, I can tell
I can tell

I can tell 'bout the night tales and the dry spells
All the wrong ones and the right things to stay away from
And how we took off and how we on top
And how we won't fall, how we going up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic but we called that shit the basement
Bass to break all my momma's vases
Unc' shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn't eight then
Always hit the gas like I broke wind
They said my way of making dollars never made sense
Come take a dive a waterfall in the deep end
I can tell you 'bout the nights out in Fort Bend

I can tell, baby, I can tell
I can tell, baby, I can tell
Yeah, you ain't told no tales, you don't—mhm
I can tell, baby, I can tell
I can tell, baby, I can tell
I can tell, baby, I can tell
I can tell, baby, I can tell (yeah)
No, you don't tell, yeah-ah-ah (yeah)

Yeah, I can tell 'bout the night tales
And all the dry wells, and all the long roads
And all my ideas before the cornrows (straight up)
How we came up and how we came down
Going donuts, coffee couldn't help now (La Flame)
How we zoned out, made it out the wood now
And what it do when they wanna be your friend now (oh, no)
How to get it, how to live and get it in now
How to go from scraping pockets, making his demand now
I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble 'bout it (yeah)
Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle (yeah)
Five-o-four hot boys
Minus the bad rap like Silkk the Shocker (yeah)
But I'ma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk
Nigga, you know I been a rocker, dripping milk and knockers
Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher 
I top a, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about ya
I'll bumbaclot you, bumba—bumba—blocka shot ya 
Bling and bang, a bang a rapper
Bangarang, I brought my money back
Orangutan diamonds hangin' on my neng-a-lang 
Bitches hanging on my dang-a-lang (straight up)

I can tell, baby, I can tell (yeah-ayy-ah)
I can tell, baby, I can tell (yeah-ayy-ah)
Yeah, you ain't got no tales, you ain't—mhmm
I can tell, baby (woo), I can tell (hoo, hoo)
I can tell, baby, I can tell (how 'bout I come over there)
I can tell, baby, I can tell (all of them bitches can tell)
I can tell, baby, I can tell (all of them bitches can tell)
No, you don't tell, yeah-ahh
