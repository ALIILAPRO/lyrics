		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a million fucking reasons that you got it bad
But everybody's leaving in a body bag, go
Save your problems for somebody else who gives a damn
'Cause you won't find me waiting on your promised land, no
Oh, you think you've got it bad?

I'm telling you to bite down and face it
You're never gonna do much or change shit
When all you say is "Fuck that and fuck this"
Don't let them save you from yourself
Lights out, embrace it
Your heart is beating faster, it's racing
So you go on and on and on and on
Oh my god, just shut your fucking mouth

Bring it down
Only one of us gets through
Two in, one out, and it's not you
Run for your life
There's nothing you can do
Necks snap when I show up
I say one word and it blows up
Run for your life
I'm taking what's mine and your time has come

I'm telling you to bite down and face it
You're never gonna do much or change shit
When all you say is "Fuck that and fuck this"
Don't let them save you from yourself
Lights out, embrace it
Your heart is beating faster, it's racing
So you go on and on and on and on
Oh my god, just shut your fucking mouth

There'll be no second coming
There'll be no lessons learned
All hail the king of nothing
Behold your empire of dirt, fuck
Behold your empire of dirt

So tell me what it's like at the bottom
Bodies stackin' up and you're soon to be forgotten
I gave you what you wanted, got the whole world watching
Just to see me drive the last nail in the coffin, yeah (all hail)
There'll be no second coming (all hail)
All hail the king of nothing

You think you've got it bad?
Well, you're leaving in a body bag

I'm telling you to bite down and face it
You're never gonna do much or change shit
When all you say is "Fuck that and fuck this"
Don't let them save you from yourself
Lights out, embrace it
Your heart is beating faster, it's racing
So you go on and on and on and on
Oh my god, just shut your fucking mouth

There's a million fucking reasons that you got it bad
But everybody's leaving in a body bag
