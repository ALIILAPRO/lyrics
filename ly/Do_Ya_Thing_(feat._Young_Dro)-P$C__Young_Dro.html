		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People, do you understand me now?
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When things go wrong, I seem a little sad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
I don't mean it

People, don't you know I'm only human?
Don't you know I have thoughts like any one?
But sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little thing, some foolish thing
That I have done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood

I'm just someone whose intentions are good
Don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood
