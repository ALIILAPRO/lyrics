		<p>
		  The Aphelliates, nigga (pay attention)
(Trapaholics)
We makin' it easy
Uh-huh (Holiday Season)
Uh-huh, yo 

Ayo, I was on the plane with Dwayne
You can call me Whitley I go to Hillman 
Listen, I'm the baddest in the school, the baddest in the game 
Excuse me honey, but nobody's in my lane 
When you was in New York you was fuckin' the Yankee 
I was fuckin' with base, I was pitchin' to Frankie 
These bitches so cranky, get 'em a hanky 
M-mommy, I'm cold, gimme my blankie

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Okay, okay, whoa, whoa Holiday, wait hold on, hold on Holiday 
You can't give it to 'em dry like that 
You gotta get that shit wet first, nigga, like c'mon now
You gotta prep them for shit like that (I got you)
They can't just get that shit right off the top
Like you gotta bring that shit back, bring that shit the fuck back (let's get 'em)

Holiday Season, ayy
I think we got your attention by now, right?
(Holiday Season)
Nicki Minaj, DJ Holiday (Holiday Season, nigga)
Mister Entertainment
Shouts out Trapaholics (Trapaholics, bitch)
We workin'
Uh-huh 
Let's go Nicki
Uh-huh, yo (like you ain't know)

Ayo, I was on the plane with Dwayne 
You can call me Whitley I go to Hillman 
Listen, I'm the baddest in the school, the baddest in the game 
Excuse me honey, but nobody's in my lane 
When you was in New York you was fuckin' the Yankee 
I was fuckin' with base, I was pitchin' to Frankie 
These bitches so cranky, get 'em a hanky
M-mommy, I'm cold, gimme my blankie
Flyer than a kite, I get higher than Rapunzel 
Keep the Snow White, I can buy it by the bundle 
Step ya cookies up, 'fore they crumble 
Don't be actin' like the Cardinals and gon' fumble (fumble)
'Cause I'm a Steeler, fresh up out the dealer 
All the dope boys gon' feel her 
Flow so sick I need a healer 
Fuck is my MAC concealer? 
I be out in Queens in the back of 
Four whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-wheelers, I'm a big deal 
That's why I get more head than a pigtail
Pour some ranch, I'm gettin' the munchies
I think I'll have a rap bitch for my entree
'Cause they be thinkin' they can spit, spit-shine my shoes
You know I keep a bad bitch, let me sign your boobs
I'm the only thing hoppin' like a kangaroo
I mean the only thing poppin' like a can of brew
Listen you should buy a sixteen 'cause I write it good
That 808, woof, woof 'cause I ride it good
And bitches can't find they man 'cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf where is Little Red-a Riding Hood?

Now if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and the car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck wit pigs like As-salamu alaykum 
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Myer bake 'em
Now if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and the car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck wit pigs like As-salamu alaykum 
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Myer bake 'em (Holiday Season)

Wow
It's like I just single-handedly annihilated 
You know, every rap bitch in the building 
Like, like I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinski, Nicki the Ninja
Nicki the Boss, Nicki The Harajuku Barbie
Like, I mean I don't even know why you girls bother at this point
Like give it up, it's me, I win, you lose 
Hahahahahaha, oh shit
Haha, yo

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
Now, I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch 
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch

Hahahahahaha
I told you, I told you before 
I told you, y'all was gon' have to pick my fruit out 
Now listen, in addition to pickin' my fruit out
I want y'all to start goin' to the boutiques
You know I'm sayin'? 
Get some, get some, get some crazy shit for me
I want, I want you know leopard skin and you know
I want, I want all that crazy lizard skin, shit 
Like, you know make sure you
You can be my personal shopper 
Ayo
Woo
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
