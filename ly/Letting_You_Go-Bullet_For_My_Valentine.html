		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't understand
Just why you wanna keep my guessing?
What I've done or what I've said to make
Make you feel this way
I get the feeling this is never getting any better
Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake
Before it washes us away

First you wanna hate me
Then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feelin' 
I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feelin' 
Now I'm letting you go
Truth is how I'd never know
Now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me
Then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feelin' 
Now I'm letting you, letting you go

So I know this hasn't gone the way that we expected
You had to try to make a fool of me and live a better days
I tried to compromise with open arms but we're disconnected
Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake
Before it washes us away

(First you wanna hate me)
First you wanna hate me
Then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feelin'
I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feelin'
Now I'm letting you go
Truth is how I'd never know
Now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me
Then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feelin' 
Now I'm letting you, letting you go

Letting you, letting you go
Now I'm letting you, letting you go

First you wanna hate me
Then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feelin'
I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feelin'
Now I'm letting you go
Truth is how I'd never know
Now what matter what we've known
First you wanna love me
Then you wanna hate me
This is what I'm feelin' now

First you wanna hate me
Then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feelin'
I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feelin'
Now I'm letting you go

Truth is how I'd never know
Now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me
Then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feelin'
Now I'm letting you, letting you go
