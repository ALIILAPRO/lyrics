		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna crush you in my jaws, I wanna
I wanna put you in my mouth, I wanna
I wanna put you in my mouth, I wanna
I wanna put you in my mouth, I wanna
I wanna put you in my mouth, I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna (In my mouth)

I don't feel like I can
Be anything more than this (I'm gonna)
I don't really want to be
Anything more than this (I'm gonna)
I just wanna be whatever you want me to be
(I'm gonna)
I don't wanna have a soul (I've gotta)
I don't know what I am
But I want you to show me (I've gotta)
I don't want to have the
Capacity to feel lonely (I've gotta)
I want you to destroy me so I'll feel better
(I've gotta) i don't wanna leave this
Moment ever, ever, ever, ever (I've gotta)

I wanna leave this world with you
I wanna become something better with you
I wanna fuck our bodies into broken shells
I wanna lose ourselves forever

I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna crush you in my jaws, I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna
(In my mouth) I wanna put you in my mouth
I wanna

(In my mouth) Right in my mouth
(In my mouth) Right in my head
(In my mouth) I'll never let you out
(In my mouth) Never let you
(In my mouth) In my mouth
(In my mouth) In my head
(In my mouth) In my soul
(In my mouth) I want you there

I wanna leave this world with you
I wanna become something better with you
I wanna fuck our bodies into broken shells
I wanna go to hell together

I wanna put you in my mouth
