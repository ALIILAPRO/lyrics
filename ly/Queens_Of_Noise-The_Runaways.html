		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With a pinch of rock and a dose of roll
I can warm you up if you get too cold
I can bring you up when you're going down
I can smash your head all over this town

You gave me the answer
Now I got the answer, oh yeah

'Cause we're the queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise

I remember you at our second show
You were holding on and you wouldn't let go
And I bet you'll always be that way
Whenever you see us start to play

You gave me the answer
Now I got the answer, oh yeah

'Cause we're the queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise

Queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise
Come and get it boys
Queens of noise
Not just one of your toys
Queens of noise
