		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good golly Miss Molly, sure like a ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call

From the early, early mornin' 'till the early, early night
You can see Miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue lights
Well, good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call

Yeah, momma, poppa told me "Son, you better watch your step"
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my pop myself
And good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call

I'm going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me a kissin' and a ting-a-ling-a-ling?
Well good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call, ahh

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call
