		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My cold feet walk the tiles I know that you walked on before
Every second you get further away and I know I've got nothing no more
Well I don't wanna think about where you've been falling asleep
I don't wanna go to bed unless you're there next to me
If you open up your eyes tell me what do you see
'Cause I don't see you
Well maybe one day we might fall back in
Maybe I'll be too late and you'll have nothing to give
Maybe I won't understand where it all went wrong
Maybe I'll miss you
I've been thinking that I'm seeing your
Face all around when I see nothing at all
And every night I keep checking on my phone til it rings
But how come you never call
Well lately I can't come to grips with where you're falling asleep
How come I can't get to bed unless you're there next to me
Well have you opened up your eyes
Tell me what did you see
'Cause I don't see you
Well maybe one day we might fall back in
Maybe I'll be too late and you'll have nothing to give
Maybe I Wont understand where it all went wrong
Maybe I'll miss you
And maybe we're not meant to be but maybe we'll never know
And maybe if you took a chance this time you won't let me go
And maybe if I never changed then there'll be nothing to show
Oh that Maybe I'll miss you
Well maybe one day we might fall back in
Maybe I'll be too late and you'll have nothing to give
Maybe I'll understand where it all went wrong
Maybe I'll miss you
