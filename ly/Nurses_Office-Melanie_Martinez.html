		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't cut me, punch me, just let me go
Into the nurse's office where I float away
I'm pale as the loose-leaf paper they grow
From hollowing out all my lungs in the snow

Yeah, I'm coughing
I'm bleeding, Band-Aids won't heal it
'Cause they hate me, so I'm fakin'
All, all, all this so they take, take me

Take me home
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Teacher, can I sit right there?
This bitch behind me is cutting my hair
"No, just sit your ass down at the chalkboard and stare"
I faked up a seizure and left outta there

Yeah, I'm coughing
I'm bleeding, Band-Aids won't heal it
'Cause they hate me, so I'm fakin'
All, all, all this so they take, take me

Take me home
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Take me home
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
Home
Old
