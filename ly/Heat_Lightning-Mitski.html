		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heat lightning
Running outside the window
I've laid awake since one
And now it's four o'clock
Though I've held on
Can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing 
Are the things all come and gone

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
So, I give it up to you
I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender

Heat lightning
Watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky
Flutters in a dream
Well, I've held on
But feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
Can I give it up to you?
Would that be okay?
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender

There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender
