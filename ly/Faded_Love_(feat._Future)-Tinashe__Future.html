		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love,

No, don't give me your name
No, I don't need your number saved in my phone
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home
Wanna take off my rings in my California King
Let me get you alone
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home

Let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this feelin'
High up as the ceilin'
Let's just, let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this moment
We can make it last
Let's just feel this feelin'
Right now, right now

You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
You on that faded love

I can feel every breath on the edge of my neck
Cigarettes and cologne
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home
No, I don't know the time and I don't know what's next
But I know that it's on
Just follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me home

Let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this feelin'
Try our best to seal it
Let's just, let's just feel this feelin'
Let's just feel this moment
We can make it last
Let's just feel this feelin'
Right now, right now

You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
You on that faded love

Before I give my white cup up
Before I give my white girl up
Before I give my half-Dominican girl up, I need real love
I'm on my fourth stripper of the day
I keep a full thoroughbred Jamaican
I'ma find your G-spot like you dropped your location
Man I'ma give all this shit up one day
Get some love from a video vixen on the runway
You can't hold it against a king, baby
You shoulda made me better, what I need
You shoulda upgraded me already
You shoulda made love to me already
I done spent a million on you already
I done bought diamonds for you already
If you love, you can teach me, wanna learn
Take you farther than Jerusalem when it's my turn
We so spiritually connected
We goin' in the right direction

You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
Love
You on that faded love, love
Luh-luh-luh-luh-love
You on that faded love
