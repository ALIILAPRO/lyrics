		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late night cruising
Playing my song its boomin
Shorty on the right, stay choosing
Hand on her thigh she oozing
Yeahhh
K
Dazee
Gotta fuck with me both ways
I know whats on yo mind
Wanna get nasty
All the time
She love green dazee so we ran up the bands
She said
I love how you put in that work ok dazee you one hella of a man
I feel all the passion its deeper than rapping they never see where it began
I told her I'm driven im different determined i came out the womb with a plan
Yeah
Uh
I'm just tryna make history
Know you feeling underrated you won't say it play it humble
Cause you know there's magic in the mystery
Thinking imma put you out your misery
Couldnt judge me you not in jury
Ball like B Roy before the injury
Hard to even trust when you look beyond the beauty
So introspective I dont do projecting
Figure out what's wrong before I let it out
Heart on the court hard for you to beat
I rest my case, never settle out
Late night cruising
Playing my song its boomin
Shorty on the right stay choosing
Hand on her thigh she oozing
Yeahhh
K
Dazee
Gotta fuck with me both ways
I know whats on yo mind
Wanna get nasty
All the time
Late night cruising
Playing my song its boomin
Shorty on the right stay choosing
Hand on her thigh she oozing
Yeahhh
K
Dazee
Gotta fuck with me both ways
I know whats on yo mind
Wanna get nasty
All the time
Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah
