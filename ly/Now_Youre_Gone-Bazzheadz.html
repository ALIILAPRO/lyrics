		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you're gone, I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Now you're gone, I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me...
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

There's an empty place in my heart
Without our love it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I will think about you every day

Are you ready?

Ready for take off!

Now you're gone, I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me...
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

Now you're gone, I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me...
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

There's an empty place in my heart
Without our love it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I will think about you every day
