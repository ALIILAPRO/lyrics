		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep or stare in your eyes
You're right by my side
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise
It's right by your side

Top off
When I'm not with you I feel awful
She likes my ideas, she say I'm thoughtful
Look, look, I was zonin' in the whip
It's because of you I can exist, I swear
I just don't want to get my heart broke
This path is mine, I know (this path is mine)
I'm asking for your love

Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes, we'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise, it's right by your side

I hop out, ooh
I don't wanna go home
I hop out, ooh
I don't wanna go home (so come on over)

Summertime is meant to fall in love
Why won't you confess to all of us?
Drip-drop on my neck, that's octopus
SYRE get those tags, you know
Sorry, honest, you need to hear my side of the story
Let's talk
Get low to highs, let 'em off
Sit at home reading Vogue with a centerfold
Love is simple, it's all good 'til the crescendo
'Til they wake up and switch, we ain't playin' Nintendo
That's why when the sun sets I just stare at the window

Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes, we'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise, it's right by your side

Only you, only you, only you
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Only you, only you, only you
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Keep me from my dark place, yeah, from my dark place
Now I got my own place
Yeah, we were in love but we just
Yeah, we were in love but we just homies
We just homies
Only you, only you, only you
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Keep me from my dark place, yeah, from my dark place
Now I got my own place, yeah

Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes, we'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise, it's right by your side
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes, we'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise, it's right by your side

And it's summertime
