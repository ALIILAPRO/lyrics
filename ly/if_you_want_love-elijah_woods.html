		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why do you look familiar
I've never reached out like this before
I sit and I pray to god this better work
Cause I don't want nobody but her
Then after 3 days and 2 nights who could have guessed
I'd be falling for my best friend
Saying if you want love
It'll always be easy for me
Forever 'til the end
When there's nothing left
I got you and you got me
So if you want love
I just wanna grow old here with you
And when we're 85 with your hand in mine
I'll still love you like you're new
So if you want love
So if you want love
A couple weeks in I'm on a flight to you
A couple months later you move in
And now you're wearing my clothes as if they're yours
And we're talking 'bout kids on our front porch
And we laugh and live in the moment
Cause nothing could be as important
After 3 years and 6 months I'm on a knee
Would you spend your whole life with me?
Saying if you want love
It'll always be easy for me
Forever 'til the end
When there's nothing left
I got you and you got me
So if you want love
I just wanna grow old here with you
And when we're 85 with your hand in mine
I'll still love you like you're new
If you want love
If you want love
If you want love
If you want love
Saying if you want love
It'll always be easy for me
Forever 'til the end
When there's nothing left
I got you and you got me
