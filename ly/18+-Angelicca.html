		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll strip it down for you
Then I'll pick it up
It was just for show honey
Don't get off

Go and roll the tapes for the 18+
I can't get down with you if you're just running off

Strip tease, knees deep
Let me in your fantasy
Call me when you're ready for me
Baby I'll go crazy

When you look I'm Mary Sue
I'll drop down that ass for you
Hit you with that deja vu
Bruises on my vavavoom, yeah

Oh baby
I'm here
I'm ready, oh yeah

I'll dance on the pole for you
Get on the floor
Eyes on me no touch baby
If you want, pay up
And I'll go even lower to
Get that money rain
Get that body working, work it for a higher raise

Knees sink, deep in
Pupils dilate as we
Hover as we workout on eachother
Feel the sweat dripping

Tell me that you need I'll give it
Serve it up for free oh baby
Come to me it's all for you
I'll know just the things to do, yeah

Oh baby
I'm here
I'm ready

Meet me in the avenue
I'll bend down my spine for you
Lately I've been waiting
Baby I'm still waiting

Meet me in the afternoon
I'll bend down my blinds for you
Lately I've been waiting
Baby I'm still waiting

On you yeah

Chained to the bed baby
Tie me up again
My innocence exploited by you, my only man
So baby what's the problem with
Giving me a chance?
I'll be waiting for it, for you right until you're here

Dominate my psychic
Tell me who I am
You're above my every need
Tell me how to make you pleased
Tell me about discipline
Show me things you'd like me in
Move me into positions
I'll do anything for this, yeah

Oh baby

Meet me in the avenue
I'll bend down my spine for you
Lately I've been waiting
Baby I'm still waiting

Meet me in the afternoon
I'll bend down my blinds for you
Lately I've been waiting
Baby I'm still waiting on

Meet me in the avenue
I'll bend down my spine for you
Lately I've been waiting
Baby I'm still waiting

Meet me in the afternoon
I'll bend down my blinds for you
Lately I've been waiting
Baby I'm still waiting

On you yeah
