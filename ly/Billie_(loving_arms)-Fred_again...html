		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out, out
Reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out (out, out, out)

My baby, then you put your loving arms around me
My baby, then you put your loving arms around me
My baby, then you put your loving arms around me
And, and, and then you put your loving arms around me
Around me, around me, around me

Then you, you, you, then you
My, my, my baby
Then you, you, you, then you

My baby, then you put your loving arms around me, around me
My baby, then you put your loving arms around me, around me

That's all you gotta do, and
That's all you gotta do, and

And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out

My baby, then you put your loving arms around me, around me
My baby, then you put your loving arms around me
(Burning inside, yeah, I'm burning inside)
Baby, then you put your loving arms around me, around me
My baby, then you put your loving arms around me
(Burning inside, yeah, I'm burning inside)

That's all you gotta do
And it feels like shelter when you
And it feels like shelter when you
And it feels like shelter when you
And it feels like shelter when you
And it feels like shelter when you
And it feels like shelter when you
And it feels like shelter when
We'll make it through

And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out (play that shit for no reason)
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out, out
And I reach out, out, out, out, out

My baby, then you put your loving arms around me
My baby, then you put your loving arms around me
