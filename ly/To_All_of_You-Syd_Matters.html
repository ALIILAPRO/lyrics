		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To all of you
American girls, it's sad to
Imagine a world without you
American girls I'd like to
Be part of the world around you
Driving a car by the seaside
Watching the world from the bright side, yeah

To all of you, American girls in the movies
No one can tell where your heart is
American girls like dollies
With shiny smiles and plastic bodies
I wish I had an American girlfriend

I cry sometimes walking around my own place
Wondering why she cries sometimes
Talking about her own place
Somewhere around the mountains
No one could dry her fountain
Till she got tired to complain
That's when I fly to the wildland, to your land
