		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come to me
In the night hours
I will wait for you
And I can't sleep
'Cause thoughts devour
Thoughts of you consume

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I can't help but love you
Even though I try not to
I can't help but want you
I know that I'd die without you

Stay with me a little longer
I will wait for you
Shadows creep
And want grows stronger
Deeper than the truth

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I can't help but love you
Even though I try not to
I can't help but want you
I know that I'd die without you

I can't help but be wrong in the dark
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts
I can't help but want oceans to part
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts

I can't help but love you
Even though I try not to
I can't help but want you
I know that I'd die without you

I can't help but be wrong in the dark
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts
I can't help but want oceans to part
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
