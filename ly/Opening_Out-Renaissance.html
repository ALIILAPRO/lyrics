		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fading mist you swirl and dance before my eyes
To realise
The feelings that have lay within my heart
Life in dreams is so much kinder
Just a moment's memory
To fade away, in distance lies your home

Broken city, take you with me
Soon to be harmonised
There before your eyes
Only to exist
Time has held tomorrow yearning while apart
Now the longing has begun for you

Suns will never set
And shall not forget
Promises we made
Somewhere there's a harbour
Though we pass her by
Where our ship can be and safely lie
In the warmth of her arms
Inside a perfect day

And with each passing moment
We wait to sail away
