		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know this time is all I have and it's leaving so fast  
Makes it hard for me to find things to believe in and things that last 

  I didn't want to fall apart but I have  I really don't wanna loose you but I think I am   

 So can we lighten up and dry the rain  
Can we ever really start again  

I wanna hold you at the break of everyday  
And I've never been so scared to say  

Please don't turn away from me, turn away from me 
 Hey, cause I don't wanna loose you   

turn away from me, turn away from me  
Hey, cause I can't live without you   

 You said it's not the things I do it's what I didn't do and you mean that  
You say you can't buy me affection like a possession and then steal it back and I know   

But little by little all these things start building up  
Is it to late now to change it, to late to keep your love  

I can brighten up and dry the rain  
Can we pick it up and start again 

I wanna hold you at the break of everyday 
 And I've never been so scared to say  

Please don't turn away from me, turn away from me  
Hey, cause I don't wanna loose you   

turn away from me, turn away from me  
Hey, cause I can't live without you 

It's hard to explain why I'm distant again  
But I need you to trust me I'll change   

There'll be fireworks and bon fires and walks in the rain  
and we'll shelter each other from pain 
 ooh from the pain 

I can brighten up and dry the rain  
Can we pick it up and start again 

If I can brighten up and dry the rain  
Can we pick it up and start again 

I wanna hold you at the break of everyday 
 And I've never been so scared to say  

Please don't turn away from me, turn away from me  
Hey, cause I don't wanna loose you  

turn away from me, turn away from me  
Hey, cause I can't live without you 

Hey, cause I can't live without you 
Hey, cause I can't live without you  
Hey, cause I can't live without you  
Hey
