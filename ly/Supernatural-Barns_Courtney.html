		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One last time
Let you back into my head
Yeah, black-black black and blue beat-up
High off everything you said
Oh, Chelsea morning with the devil in my eyes
Where it's not so bad
I can't be mad at white, white lies

If you want me, let me know
You flip me like a domino
Got your hands all over my body
But you're actin' like you don't want me
Yeah, if you want me, let me know
You're terrifin', beautiful
Like a thunderbolt through my body
It's enough to make me feel supernatural
Yeah, baby I feel supernatural

Oh, what a shame
Your spirit never left
Possessed me like a demon
Made the worship at your bed
Oh, yeah, I must be outta my mind
Any cause to watch you crash
Just one last line

If you want me, let me know
You flip me like a domino
Got your hands all over my body
But you're actin' like you don't want me
Yeah, if you want me let me know
You're terrifin', beautiful
Like a thunderbolt through my body
It's enough to make me feel supernatural

Supernatural, I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable (yeah baby, I feel supernatural)
I'm supernatural, hey
Supernatural, I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable (yeah baby, I feel supernatural)
I'm supernatural, hey

I do believe (I do believe)
That's the old me (that's the old me)
I'd never leave (I'm gonna be), yeah
I do believe (I do believe)
That's the old me (that's the old me)
I'd never leave (I'm gonna be), hey

Supernatural, I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable (yeah baby I feel supernatural)
I'm supernatural, hey
Supernatural, I feel untouchable
I'm unstoppable
I'm supernatural
