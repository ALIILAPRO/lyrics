		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only losers go to school
I taught myself how to move
I'm not the type to count on you, uh
'Cause stupid's next to "I love you"

No, so what can you show me
That my heart don't know already
We make our own sense
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already
We make our own sense
And you're qualified (to me)
Yeah (me)
Yeah
And you're qualified (to me)
Yeah (me)
Yeah
And you're qualified (to me)

Only losers go to school
They can't teach what they can't prove
Come put this inside a test-tube
'Cause stupid's next to "I love you"

So what can you show me
That my heart don't know already
We make our own sins
You're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already
We make our own sins
You're qualified (to me)
Yeah (me)
Yeah
And you're qualified (to me)
Yeah (me)
Yeah
And you're qualified (to me)

And now that we're all grown up
Who do we owe it to?
And now that we've gone this far
Who do we owe it all to
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
And now that we all came up
Do we lose, do we lose?

So what can you show
That my heart don't know already
Because we make our own sins
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already
'Cause we make our own sins
And you're qualified to me
Yeah (me)
Yeah
(Me) ooh
Yeah
(Me) yeah, yeah
Yeah
And you're qualified (to me)
