		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Metro Boomin
Heroes & Villains, bruh
Somebody gotta be bad, somebody gotta be good, you feel me?
Ayy

Own a label, I gotta get smarter (spider)
I don't trust women, so I thank God that I had some daughters
I'm the youngest but yet I'm richer than every one of my brothers
I took flawless baguettes and put it on my mama and father
Lately, I get my pills from a doctor
Pimpin' a couple of bitches, they copper
I done liked that pic, don't crop it
You talkin' about a check, now stop it
Water slip off my wrist, it's droppin' now
I got a couple baguettes in my pocket
Big B, I been rockin' Chanel, just throwin' up Cs and that's for Charlie, ha
Point it out, you know I'ma buy it, ha
Yeah, I was livin' my life on a yacht
I ain't takin' my chain off thot
Like the way that she suckin' my cock (woo-woo)
Got some Act', then let's go get a pop (let's go)
Took the ledge off and went to the stop (let's go)
Niggas tried to say I wasn't hot
Now they say I don't belong in this spot

Metro, Metro, Metro bought me a pink-front bezel
I put two-tone on my bezel, Baccarat the candles
Maybach, gettin' me some top, meanwhile I flip the channels
Bigger than the president, now my whole life a scandal, yeah
Spider, spider, spider, please dismiss these riders, yeah
Caught up with your wifey, and one night her, ayy
I put that shit on, I'm a fuckin' striker
Yeah, little, little on little, look like a fuckin' biker (drop)

Yeah, drop me the top on a Lambo', know that's a 'mando, yeah-yeah
Whole life still a gamble, mob life feel like Sopranos
Yeah, Gallery Department, no sandals, and this camo'
My wrist is a chandelier, no beer over here
Rock hard without sandals all year
Better have manners right here, my family right here, nigga
Both of my parents right here
Droppin' my album this year, nobody can spray a nigga
Both of my bando's right there
Know you see the fish-bowl tint and the motor geeked up
That's motherfuckin' cam right there
Know you see the blunt right there
Now you playin' right there, then pull up and just stand right there
Hunnid bands sittin' right there, you ain't gettin' no smoke
You arrivin' for a band right there
All yo' opps be facin', you ran around his place, we ain't gettin' yo man right there
I put the Rolls-Rolls, diamonds to put up my muhfuckin' nose
She my sex slave, but she still don't let me pay though

Metro, Metro, Metro bought me a pink-front bezel (Metro)
I put two-tone on my bezel, Baccarat the candles
Maybach, gettin' me some top, meanwhile I flip the channels
Bigger than the president, now my whole life a scandal, yeah
Spider, spider, spider, please dismiss these riders, yeah
Caught up with your wifey, and one night her, ayy
I put that shit on, I'm a fuckin' striker
Yeah, little, little on little, look like a fuckin' biker

I been fresh as hell every time you see me, on sight
Anything happen, my kids got M's, so everything alright
I done got used takin' pills and bein' up all night
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
