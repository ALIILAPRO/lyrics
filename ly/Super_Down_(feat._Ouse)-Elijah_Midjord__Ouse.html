		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wasting away
In the same town, is it too good for you?
Laying awake
Breaking my change, changing up the euphoria
It's easy to say
That everything I did, I did it for you
When you were late
The only thing I felt was paranoia

And I can't take no, yeah
I'm filled with nausea
Baby, don't come closer 'Cause right now I'm

I'm super Down i'm super down, oh
I'm super down
This time felt just like the last
And I'm still living in the past
I'm super down
I forgave all the moments that we had
But I'm still putting on a mask
I'm super down (I'm super down, oh)

I know you're fucked up 'cause of me
I was too afraid to see
All the hurt and pain that I bring
Doing okay
Not the same thing, but It's kind of similar
I wish it was me, tho
But I really don't think I'm
Fit to be with you

And I can't take no, yeah
I'm filled with nausea
Baby, don't come closer 'Cause right now I'm

I'm super Down i'm super down, oh
I'm super down
This time felt just like the last
And I'm still living in the past
I'm super down
I forgave all the moments that we had
But I'm still putting on a mask
I'm super down (I'm super down, oh)

I don't see the faces
Of the people around me right now
I'm so zoned out
And I wish you were here in the crowd
When it all goes down making my way
To the spotlight, just to tell you I love you
When I see your face, no
I feel like I could do anything for you

And I can't take no, yeah
I'm filled with nausea
Baby, don't come closer 'Cause right now I'm
