		  Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all 

When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain

Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can't create, that we can't create, that we can't
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can't create, that we can't create

When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want 
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know
