		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, just us two
I say fuck you, I hate you
I move out in a heart beat
When I leave out, and you call me
And you tell me that you sorry

You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, just us two
I say fuck you, I hate you
I move out in a heart beat
When I leave out, and you call me
And you tell me that you sorry

You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, just us two
I say fuck you, I hate you
I move out in a heart beat
When I leave out, and you call me
And you tell me that you sorry
