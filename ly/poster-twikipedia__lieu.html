		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me some, yeah, tho, perfect
I don't know what to say

Birds when I'm looking out the window
A-And I see your face, but I can't let go
E-Everybody tryna be a hero
Stop playing games, you can't save me now
House to house and wall to wall
I can't do it anymore
And I tried so hard not to think 'bout it
I fold onto the floor

Heard she fucking with me, she
Go everywhere I go, yeah
And it's a cold world
But I know my heart gets colder
I put on a mask and leave
The house like it's October
Does it feel good when you
Know you getting older?
I don't-I don't wanna talk
I'd rather put down the controller
And my new fan back then used to be a troller
My old bitch, forgot everything I told her
Not no T-shirt
We gon' put him on a poster-er

(Go) Talk tough, and it's reload
Posted up with Delta
Or I'm posted with the C-4
Jugg his shit, don't think he need more
Twenty bands, PayPal, the shit I love to see
Boy thought he made it out the gutter
It's a decoy
Running with the burner, step up to me
You get destroyed he said he want smoke
But I know he 'bout to fold
Opposition getting sold, I'm not for it
Your fault i'm the one who's getting calls
I don't answer
'cause I'm not the one to stall
T T Tell lil' bro, "Come get involved"
And it's gonna be the last time he talks
But we not talking at all
Thought I couldn't do it
But I love to prove them wrong
Nobody wanna ask you, get him, get him gone
Don't try, take the fall (Go)

But I'm used to it
I saw-I saw way too much, it made me sick
I say I don't give a fuck, but it still hit's
I don't know if I can live life like this
But I grow up in the fast lane
You gon' see me doing donuts
I got two lives like I hit a fucking bonus
Tarantino movie, when I pull up, do the most
Bruh i don't know them
Why they acting like they know us?

Heard she fucking with me, she
Go everywhere I go, yeah
And it's a cold world
But I know my heart gets colder
I put on a mask and leave
The house like it's October
Does it feel good when you
Know you getting older?
I don't-I don't wanna talk
I'd rather put down the controller
And my new fan back then used to be a troller
My old bitch, forgot everything I told her
Not no T-shirt
We gon' put him on a post-post-post

Picture from picture, all up in my wall, and
I'm a winner, but maybe not at all, because
Hold onto the act up until it falls
Eighteen, still mad when they call my
(Stop trying to fucking be me)
