		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything until now had an order, everything up to this point resolved
Find myself I’m thrashing underwater, and I’m overcome, I’m overcome
Maybe I was waiting for a saviour, and maybe I’d imagined something more
If only, If only I
Suddenly I am floating, I am weightless, and slowly it all unwinds
And slowly I’m losing light
Help me find the pieces, tell me I’ll be fine
Help me cover weakness, or can I, just rewind, feel myself and ease my mind
I’ve been pulled apart, I can’t seem to settle in
If only I knew why I’m lost and what I’m caught in
Help me find the pieces, tell me I’ll be fine
Help me cover weakness, or can I, just rewind, feel myself and ease my mind
