		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I already know what I would do
The day the world decides to end
Where the stars collide and I’m down to my last breath

You won’t find me praying to no God
begging him for any help
In my final moment my heart would lead my head
And I’d run to you instead

So darling let me crash into your arms
Just before the sunlight swallows us
I got no fear, as the light in the darkness
Has it’s way tonight
Cuz with you here
We’ll be crashing together
Into whatever is on the other side

Crash into me that’s all I need
Crash into me that’s all I need
Crash into me that’s all I need
Crash into me

So darling let me crash into your arms
Just before the sunlight swallows us
I got no fear, as the light in the darkness
Has it’s way tonight
Cuz with you here
We’ll be crashing together
Into whatever is on the other side
