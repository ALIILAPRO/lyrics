		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little girl sleeping in dreams of peace
Mommy's been gone a long time
Daddy comes home and she still sleeps
Waiting for the world's worst crime

And he comes up the stairs like he always does
And he never turns on the light
And she's wide awake, scared to death
She smells his lust and she smells his sweat

Curled in a ball, she holds her breath
Praying to a God that she's never met
Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight

Little girl lies by her Daddy's side
And she listens to him breathe
She knows there's something awful wrong
That she's far too young to see

And she knows she can't tell anyone
She's so full of guilt and shame
And if she tells she'll be all alone
They'd steal her Daddy and they'd steal her home

And it's not so bad when Daddy leaves her alone
Praying to her God with his heart of stone
Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight

Why
Tell me why
The worst crime
In the world

And Daddy lies by his daughter's side
And he sleeps both deep and well
No nightmares come to him tonight
Though his daughter lives in hell

For his seed is sown where it should not be
And the beast in his mind don't care
And the only sounds are tears that fall
Little girl turns her face to the wall

She knows that no-one hears her call
But it seems that God hears nothing at all
Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me
Don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
