		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I'm gonna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine, oh-way-oh
Girl, you can make me suffer, do whatever
'Cause I know you're one of a kind, oh-way-oh

Tell me who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

Who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I'mma spin you around, push your buttons
Oh, I ain't planning to stop, oh-way-oh
Let me take you down, to the bottom
Work you all the way to the top, oh-way-oh

Tell me who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

Who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I'm on top of my love game and you gonna get it tonight
I'm focused, I'm ready, girl, I'm gonna give it to you right

I'm gonna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine
Girl, you can make me suffer, do whatever
'Cause I know you're one of a kind, way-oh

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

I wanna boom bang bang with your body, yo
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)
