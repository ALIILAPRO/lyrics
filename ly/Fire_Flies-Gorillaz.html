		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you see me floatin' too many times
My face will be painted in these white brick lines

'Cause all my fear's invading
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Livin' on the limits

And if you say goodbye too many times
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time

'Cause all my fear's invading
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Livin' on the limits

All you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the falling men
Every calling cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies

Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I'm love drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?
Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I got drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?

All you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the falling men
(Into the night)
Every calling cost made to your heart
(I'm sorry, am I losing you?)
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
(It takes me into the night)
I was ever chasing fireflies
