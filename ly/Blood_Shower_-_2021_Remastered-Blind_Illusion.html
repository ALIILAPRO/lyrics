		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When Politicians Refuse
To open their eyes
The World is Blind
The Future will Cry
The Mud will Turn Red
and the Living are Dead
When Madmen Rule the Land
They're carrying out the plan
              Bloodbath - Death Trap

Walking down the Sandmans path
Turning your head from side to side
No place to run - No place to hide
The Middle East will ride the Beast
They're preparing now - For the Feast
We watch them as we sleep
Their menu is prepared
It's you they want to Eat
          The main course - for their Holy War
Bloodshower - Poison Flower

Madmen Sitting in the top of their towers
Rape the innocent until the Final Hour
When they're the only ones left
To be Devoured
