		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember once I told you 'bout
How before I heard it from your mouth
My name would always hit my ears
As such an awful sound
And the soul, if that's what you'd call it
Uneasy ally of the body
It felt nameless as a river undiscovered underground

And the first time that you kissed me
I drank dry the River Lethe
The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same
But you spoke some quick new music
That went so far to soothe this soul
As it was and ever shall be
Unearth without a name

Some part of me must have died
The first time that you called me baby
And some part of me came alive
The first time that you called me baby

These days I think I owe my life 
To flowers that were left here by my mother
Ain't that like them, gifting life to you again
This life lived mostly underground
Unknowing either sight nor sound
'Til reaching up for sunlight
Just to be ripped out by the stem

Sensing only now it's dying
Drying out then drowning blindly
Blooming forth its every colour
In the moments it has left
To share the space with simple living things
Infinitely suffering
But fighting off like all creation
The absence of itself
Anyway

Some part of me must have died
Each time that you called me baby
But some part of me stayed alive
Each time that you called
Each time that you called

C'mere, ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around
It keeps you around
Ooh-la-la
C'mere, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around
It keeps you around

The last time it was heard out loud
The perfect genius of our hands and mouths were shocked
To resignation as the arguing declined
When I was young I used to guess
Are there limits to any emptiness?
When was the last time?
C'mere to me, when was the last time?

Some part of me must have died
The final time you called me baby
But some part of me came alive
The final time you called me baby
