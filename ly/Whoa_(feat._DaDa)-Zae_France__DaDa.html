Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (woah-woah)
Girl, I need it
I'm tryna pull up, give me a reason
You got me like
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (woah-woah)
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
I ain't gon' lie, girl, I need it
I'm tryna pull up, give me a reason

Uh, I gotta taste it (ayy)
You know I'm runnin' out of patience (uh-oh)
Give me that lovin', don't you waste it (give me that lovin', don't you waste it)
I need your body, where your waist is? (I need your body, where your waist is?)
Mm, I'm ready to bite down (bite, bite, bite)
She don't want it, she need it right now (right, right, right)
You can save that lil' sexy lingerie, I'll hit it with the bonnet and the nightgown 
(Ayy, you know) off the liquor you know that's a cheat code 
(I be) I be wildin' when I'm off the 'Migos 
(We could) make a movie, I ain't talkin' Regal
You want it again and again, no sequel

Woah-woah-woah 
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah 
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (woah, oh, ooh-woah)
Girl, I need it
I'm tryna pull up, give me a reason
You got me like
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (woah-woah)
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
I ain't gon' lie, girl, I need it
I'm tryna pull up, give me a reason

I was tryna take it back and get it in somethin'
And she ain't really need a dollar, she gon' spend somethin'
And if a nigga try to play, then we gon' bend somethin'
.40 to his brain and we gon' bang it, let end him
1-4-3, she tryna lock me up
Shorty tired of gangster love, I had to soften up
Real members in the clan, this the mafia
Free them members and the guys who had to body somethin'
Lil' mama give my phone a text when she comin' home (woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah)
Grown woman, handle business but she takin' long (woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah)
And now I'm gettin' anxious, please, don't forget the thong
D'uss√© in the freezer, just slide, we gon' get it on

Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (woah-woah)
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (woah-woah)
Girl, I need it
I'm tryna pull up, give me a reason
You got me like
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah (woah-woah)
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
I ain't gon' lie, girl, I need it
I'm tryna pull up, give me a reason
