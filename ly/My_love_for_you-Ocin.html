		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some things don't wanna be said
Get into my head
Come closer and make me smile
Right?
I never wanted a fight
You would never find someone like me
That's not a good or a bad thing
Hold me like ooo
I don't wanna fall again
I told her this is not the end
Girl you are my best friend
And if you think

I
Don't wanna talk with you
I'll tell you that's just not true babe
The light is never far away from you
And I
Do wanna walk with you
I do wanna walk with you
Baby that's the truth

Can't lie again
I know I'm meant
To be your friend
And in the end
Can't hide myself
I know I'm not what you want me
To be

Some things don't wanna be said
Get into my head
Come closer and make me smile
Right?
I never wanted a fight
You would never find someone like me
That's not a good or a bad thing
Hold me like
(bad bad bad bad bad, thing)

Some things don't wanna be said
