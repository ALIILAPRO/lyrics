		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  BONES
The Juice mane
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, uh
Yeah
Lets get it
Fuck a 8th, where the O's?
Let me buy, buy, buy
Timberlake with the K
Say bye bye bye
Got my hand on ya bitch
Yeah she mine, mine, mine
Anytime I get low
I get high, high, high
.45 on my side
Come and try, try, try
Put your hands in the sky
Or you'll die, die, die
Now it's time to unwind
Windows down in the ride
Phone off, seat back, don't try and hit my line
Flow aged like wine, sip it now she fine
Negative mind, baby BONES not kind
Poison in my lungs, dopin' till I'm done
Bury me alive with a 150 blunts
Lit, I'ma split
Like a kid thrown a Bic
Always yappin' how you stacking
Spendin' bands on your bitch
Get ran for your shit, get robbed for your life
Set fire to your ice, watch you melt in the light
Ba-caw-caw
I got two bad bitches sucking at the same time (yeah)
The way they have my toes curled up should be a crime (yeah)
Roll me up some killer, bitch, I smoke that homicide
Doctor did a CAT scan, he said "Boy ya brain's fried" (yeah)
I sent goons out to meet ya, it won't be no drive-by (yeah)
Put a ticket on ya head, now that's money on ya mind (yeah)
Nine figure nigga, yeah, multimillionaire (yeah)
All my ice hittin', I feel like a Frigidaire (yeah)
Tony Montana with the gold silverware
And I come from North Memphis, lions, tigers, grizzly bears (yeah)
All these niggas hatin' cause I'm winnin' and they ain't
All these quarters in my lungs, I feel like a piggy bank (yeah)
I feel like a piggy bank (yeah)
I feel like a piggy bank (yeah)
All these quarters in my lungs
I feel like a piggy bank 
What you hoes think?
(Yeah)

Fuck a 8th, where the O's?
Let me buy, buy, buy 
Timberlake with the K
Say bye bye bye
Got my hand on ya bitch
Yeah she mine, mine, mine
Anytime I get low
I get high, high, high
