		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't remember me, but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream?
And dream I do

I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
You're taking over me

Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had?
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then

I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
You're taking over me

I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over

I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
You're taking over me

I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
You're taking over me
You're taking over me

Taking over me
