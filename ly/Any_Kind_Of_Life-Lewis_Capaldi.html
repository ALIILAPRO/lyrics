		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were the raging storm that wrecked
A beautiful mind I can't forget
Knew from the moment that we met I'd take you home
But now that the future's so unclear
Have all of your feelings disappeared?
'Cause I'm in no kind of frame of mind to let you go

Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
'Cause I've been so low
And the weight of all the world's a heavy load
Keep me going 'til tomorrow
'Cause I just don't know
If I can face another day alone

Well, my lungs don't breathe
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

Are there any words that I could say?
I'm feeling our moment fade away
In a matter of hours, we'll be drowning in the waves
And all of the memories that we shaped
We're leaving behind here in my wake
If we can save the good we gave, we shouldn't wait

Hope, have you some that I can borrow?
'Cause I just don't know
If I can face another day alone

Well, my lungs don't breathe
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear

Now you're not here, I can't explain
The carousel of my constant pain
I'm not sure that I can hold on anymore
Became a victim of circumstance
Should have said when I had the chance
I don't want any kind of life without you here
