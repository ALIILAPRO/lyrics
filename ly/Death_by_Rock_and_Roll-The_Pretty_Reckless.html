		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jenny died of suicide
With a candle burning in her eye
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll"

John forgot what he was on
But he broke the needle, dead and gone
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll"

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a woman on her back
I wanna go with balls, I won't pray
I wanna go with this bottle in my veins
I wanna go, I wanna go
I wanna go out my way

Amy shot and killed a man
With a gun too heavy in her hand
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll"

Janey had steel in her bones
But she burned away blood into stone
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll"

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a woman on her back
I wanna go with the sickness in my throat
I wanna go, killed by rock and roll
I wanna, I wanna go
I wanna go out my way, yeah

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go in a motorcycle crash
Out on my own, I don't need to be saved
I wanna go out my way

But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll"
