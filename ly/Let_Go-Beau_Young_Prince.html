		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I don't really know myself
Devil on my back, pray for me, need help
Angel in the front tryna guide my steps
Who do you call when you need some help?
Who do you call when you by yourself?
Who do you call when you feel down low?
I just wanna scream, I just wanna explode
I, I just wanna let go, I

I just wanna let go, yeah (I, yeah)
I just wanna let go (I, yeah)
I just wanna let go, yeah (I, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna let go (I, I just wanna let go)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Got a devil on my left and a angel on my right
I'm just tryna live my life, I'm just hangin' in the fight (yuh)
Swingin' off the web of life, glidin' through the breeze (Breeze)
My uncle always told me that it never would be easy (nah)
Now I'm lookin' to the sky hoping that he rest in peace
Violence in the streets, I just wanna calm the beast
All these problems I'm just fightin' with myself are enemies
Looking for my peace while I'm (Looking for my peace while I'm)

I just wanna swing and fly away (fly away)
I just wanna see a better day (yeah)
I just wanna soar and never drown (never drown)
I'm looking for my happiness now (now)
I just wanna swing and fly away (fly away)
I just wanna see a better day (a better day)
I just wanna soar and never drown (drown)
I'm looking for my happiness now, yeah

Sometimes I don't really know myself
Devil on my back, pray for me, need help
Angel in the front tryna guide my steps (my steps)
Who do you call when you need some help? (Some help)
Who do you call when you by yourself? (Yourself)
Who do you call when you feel down low? (down low)
I just wanna scream, I just wanna explode (explode)
I, I just wanna let go (let go), I

I just wanna let go, yeah (I, yeah)
I just wanna let go (I, yeah)
I just wanna let go, yeah (I, I just wanna let go)
I just wanna let go (I, I just wanna let go)
