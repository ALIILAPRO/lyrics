		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you remember
Would you still think of me the same
Every December
I've been reminded of things I should say

To you but I'm silent
Give it a moment of silence
In a moment I wasted our time
I'm here if you've think I've stopped trying 'cause

Half of my heart is still there
I do what I can but I'm scared
Would you still remember I swear
It's been too long now
Even if I'm gone now

Half of my heart is still there
I do what I can but I'm scared
Would you still remember I swear
It's been too long now
Even if I'm gone now
Half of my heart is still

Darling, how could I forget
Autumn of the year we met
Know you still have things to say
It's different since I broke us apart
The difference is the same as it was
'Cause it's too

Silent
And it's been killing me in silence
In a moment I wasted our time
I'm here if you've think I've stopped trying 'cause

Half of my heart is still there
I do what I can but I'm scared
Would you still remember I swear
It's been too long now
Even if I'm gone now

Half of my heart is still there
I do what I can but I'm scared
Would you still remember I swear
It's been too long now
Even if I'm gone now

Half of my heart is still
There
There for you
There
