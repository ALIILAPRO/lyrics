		  Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh (yeah)
Uh, uh, uh

I'm in London, got my beat from London

I whip the dope out the bowl, I'ma go get me some money
I got no clouds in my stones, you should've went to Eliantte
I went in quiet in the mornin', then I got in it with the stormin'
Bonnie and Clyde with my ho, niggas know I'm up to something

Put the racks behind my riches I'm on
I put a few carats inside of a rich man's maw
Yeah, my shit came in red, my nigga man know shit is black
Yeah, I put up a Patek right on the head of a rat
I'm getting full of these millions and I done ran a few racks up
Had to take me some Ritalin 'cause this money is dangerous
All my niggas relentless, yeah, niggas might end up missing, yeah
Man, I hope she ain't your missus, on my dick was just kissin'
If you ever, ever come around me, you might end up with bitches
Told the kids I never cooked that key, but they can't get the dishes
You told the bitch 'bout the Dropbox, nigga, you gotta be kidding
I put my nut on a thot-thot and her friendses

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh (yeah)
Uh, uh, uh, uh 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought these niggas was killers
They was just sellin' us lies, how could he turn out a rat?
Niggas was never this live, told y'all that my record real
Gettin' money, fuck a record deal, first nigga in my whole city
With a rose gold Richard Mille, how could you see what my day is like?
If you can't feel what my pain like, diamonds is gleamin' like daylight
You can just tell what I'm made like, I'm so connected to Zone One
Treat a new bitch like a old one, one car full of Young Thugs
Oh, God, all those guns, yeah, told him I'm ready to ride
Your enemy gotta be mine, that's real nigga energy, slime
They should've known we was the vibes, we are the fire, so put it on God
I am that guy, look in my eyes, none of you niggas was ever this light

Ayy, I whip the dope out the bowl, I'ma go get me some money
I got no clouds in my stones, you should've went to Eliantte
I went in quiet in the mornin', then I got in it with the stormin'
Bonnie and Clyde with my ho, niggas know I'm up to something

I left this shit on the dashboard, I got to see where this cash goin'
Uh, money and cash flow, I got a big old jet where my legs can't fold
Longer time take when I'm full, I ain't lettin' 'Lluminati inject my soul
Need no boundaries, ho, man, shut the fuck up, bitch, fold my clothes
I can spread this shit out, come in cold, just like a kid, stackin' up these Legos
These niggas talkin' like hoes, shut the fuck up while we wipin' your nose
Ooh, rollin' the Presi', dropped out of school, but I wasn't a bastard
I put a baddie on a jet out of Minneapolis
Parked out the cabin, I'm an old school nigga on Radleys
Left a Mercedes Benz and chalice on factories
I copped the Maybach coupe, me and Wizard, and Steve Harvey
Somebody, raise all my walls, I put Chanel on my daughter

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

I whip the dope out the bowl, I'ma go get me some money
I got no clouds in my stones, you should've went to Eliantte
I went in quiet in the mornin', then I got in it with the stormin'
Bonnie and Clyde with my ho, niggas know I'm up to something

Put the racks behind my riches I'm on
I put a few carats inside of a rich man's maw
Yeah, my shit came in red, my nigga man know shit is black
Yeah, I put up a Patek right on the head of a rat
I'm getting full of these millions and I done ran a few racks up
Had to take me some Ritalin 'cause this money is dangerous
All my niggas relentless, yeah, niggas might end up missing, yeah
Man, I hope she ain't your missus, on my dick was just kissin'
If you ever, ever come around me, you might end up with bitches
Told the kids I never cooked that key, but they can't get the dishes
You told the bitch about the Dropbox, nigga, you gotta be kidding
I put my nut on a thot-thot and her friendses

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh 
Uh, uh, uh, uh
