		  (Jump, jump)
You should know, you should know that, ah
Kris Kross is not having anything today
As we stand there totally crossed out
We commence to make you (jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)

Don't try to compare us (yeah) to another bad little fad
I'm the Mac and I'm bad, give you something that you never had
I'll make you bump bump, wiggle and shake your rump
'Cause I be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna jump
How high? Real high, 'cause I'm just so fly
A young lovable, hugable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside out is wiggida, wiggida, wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'
R&B, rappin' bull crap is what I'm dumpin'
Ain't nothin' sucker 'bout Kris Kross, we all that
So when they ask, "Do they rock?" Say, "Believe that"

(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)

I like my stuff knockin' (knockin')
I love it when a girlies be like jockin' (jockin')
The D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
Yeah, you know me
I got you jumpin' and bumpin' and pumpin', movin' all around, G
In the mix, I made MC's step back
They try to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear, is that coincidental?
Act like you know it, don't be claiming that it's mental
Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And nothin' fake, you can understand every word (word, hahaha)
As you listen to my cool, smooth melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P

(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)

Now, the formalities of this and that
Is that Kris Kross ain't comin' off wack
And for all y'all suckers that don't know
Check it out

Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (bo, bo)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (bo, bo)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (go go)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't (bo, bo)
'Cause I'm the miggida, miggida, miggida, miggida Mac Daddy (bo, bo)
The miggida, miggida, miggida, miggida Mac (bo, bo)
'Cause I'm the miggida, miggida, miggida, miggida Mac Daddy (bo, bo)
The miggida, miggida, miggida, miggida Mac (bo, bo)
I make you wanna

(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)
Uh huh, uh huh
(Jump, jump)
The Mac Dad'll make you (jump, jump)
Daddy Mac'll make you (jump, jump)
Kris Kross'll make you (jump, jump)

Believe that
