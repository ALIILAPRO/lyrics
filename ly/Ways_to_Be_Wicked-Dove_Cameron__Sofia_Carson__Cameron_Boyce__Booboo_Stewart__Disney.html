		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got all the ways to be
W-I-C-K-E-D
We got all the ways to be
W-I-C-K-E-D
Come on
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey (haha)
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Crashin' the party, guess they lost my invitation (boo-hoo)
Friendly reminder, got my own kind of persuasion
Looks like this place could use a bit of misbehavior
"Happily ever after" with a little flavor
Bad to the bone, with even worse intentions
We're gonna steal the show and leave 'em all defenseless
A fairy tale life can be oh-so overrated
So raise your voices and let's get it activated (ayy)

Long live having some fun
We take what we want
There's so many ways to be wicked
With us, evil lives on the right side of wrong
There's so many ways to be wicked

Apple, apple
Dip, dip
Wanna try it?
Tick, tick
Take a bite, come on, be bold
Change the way the story's told

This time the dark is finally getting your attention
We're wicked by the book, and class is back in session
You like it, steal it
Gotta beat 'em to the treasure
A right of passage
Bad just doesn't get much better

Long live having some fun
We take what we want
There's so many ways to be wicked
With us, evil lives on the right side of wrong
There's so many ways to be wicked

Mother always knows best
Show her, pass every test
Hear her voice in my head
Evil is the only real way to live

We got all the ways to be (ha)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
W-I-C-K-E-D
Let's go
We got all the ways to be
Hey, hey, hey, hey
W-I-C-K-E-D
(Yeah)

Long live having some fun (having some fun)
We take what we want
There's so many ways to be wicked
With us, evil lives on (evil lives on)
The right side of wrong
There's so many ways to be wicked
Cruel and unusual
We're taking control
There's so many ways to be wicked
With us (come on), evil lives on the right side of wrong
There's so many ways to be wicked

Hey, hey, hey, hey
We got all the ways to be
W-I-C-K-E-D
We got all the ways to be
W-I-C-K-E-D
We got all the ways to be
W-I-C-K-E-D
We got all the ways to be
So many ways to be wicked
