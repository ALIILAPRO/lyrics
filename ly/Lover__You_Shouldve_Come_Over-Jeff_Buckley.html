		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking out the door
I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so
You'll never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Well, sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
But much too blind to see the damage he's done
Yeah, sometimes a man must awake to find that, really
He has no one

So I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh oh oh, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late

Mm

Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep
That won't ever come

It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
Yeah, it's never over, all my riches for her smiles
When I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She is a tear that hangs inside my soul forever (mm)
Ah, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh lover, you should've come over, yeah yeah, yes, yes

I feel too young to hold on
I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind
To see the damage I've done
The sweet lover, you, you should've come over
Oh, love, well I've waited for you
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, love, lover
Love, love, love, love, love
Lover, you should've come over
If it's not too late
