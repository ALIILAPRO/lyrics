		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A love game, a love game

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds isn't enough
For my heart to quit it

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game

I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest, I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A love game, a love game

Hold me and love me
Just want touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds isn't enough
For my heart to quit it

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game

I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your huh!
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a huh and a game
And a game, and a game, and a game, a love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Let's have some fun, this beat is sick)
Doin' the love game (I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
(Don't think too much just bust that kick)
Doin' the love game (I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)
Doin' the love game
