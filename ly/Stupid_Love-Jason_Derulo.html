		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking the dog in my neighborhood
Said I never would, for you for you
I got drunk on a Monday night
Hope it looks alright
Tattoo of you, uh
I'm a yes man on the loose, yeah
Maxed out all my credit cards
Bought your favorite car, times two

I'm crazy for you
Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need
I'm down on my knees
I guess that means
I guess that means
I'm dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
I'm stupid in love
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid
I'm stupid in love,
Stupid

Re-decorate my crib
Can't believe I did
It's true, it's true
I'm ashamed but I said ok
To share a Facebook page
With you, with you
'Cause I'm a yes man on the loose, ooh, yeah
And I'll do anything for you, baby

I'm crazy for you
Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need
I'm down on my knees
I guess that means
I guess that means
I'm dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
I'm stupid in love
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid
I'm stupid in love,
Stupid

And they can all call me crazy (crazy)
I'm a fool for you, baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, naked
They can all call me crazy
I'm a fool for you baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, naked

I'm crazy for you
Lord knows what I'd do
I'd even die for you (I'd die for you, baby)
Whatever you need
I'm down on my knees
I guess that means
I guess that means
I'm dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
I'm stupid in love

Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
I'm stupid in love
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam

Yeah, yeah
I'm stupid in love,
Yeah, yeah
Stupid
