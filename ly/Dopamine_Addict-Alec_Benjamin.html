		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Six months clean off the dopamine
Threw my phone through the wall
My friends can't get a hold of me
Just a dial tone when they call
Chills and sweats comin' over me
And I'm aching from the withdrawal
This chemistry has got a hold of me
Got a hold of me, got a hold of me

I'm a dopamine addict, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, psychosomatic
Stare in the mirror, hide in the attic
Cry in my bed, I'm a dopamine addict
And I feel like I'm out of touch, keep thinkin' I need that crutch
Keep thinkin' I need that rush
I just can't break the habit, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, dopamine addict

I have these dreams where I'm me again
And they almost feel like they're real
It's as if I have self-esteem again
It's as if I'm starting to heal
The chills and sweats grab a hold of me
And they pull me out of my dream
They just won't seem to let go of me
To let go of me, to let go of me

I'm a dopamine addict, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, psychosomatic
Stare in the mirror, hide in the attic
Cry in my bed, I'm a dopamine addict
And I feel like I'm out of touch, keep thinkin' I need that crutch
Keep thinkin' I need that rush
I just can't break the habit, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, dopamine addict

The cycle is doomed, recycle, reuse
And then up the potency
The cycle is doomed, recycle, reuse
It just won't let go of me
Won't let go of me, got a hold of me

I'm a dopamine addict, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, psychosomatic
Stare in the mirror, hide in the attic
Cry in my bed, I'm a dopamine addict
And I feel like I'm out of touch, keep thinkin' I need that crutch
Keep thinkin' I need that rush
I just can't break the habit, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, dopamine addict
