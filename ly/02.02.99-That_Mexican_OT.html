		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Skelez, oh my God)

Can't nobody tell me shit 'cause I got cutters, motherfucker
Bitch, I'm Virgil 'til I die, no, I can't be nobody other
Told my chopper that the only thing we got is just each other
I'm the type that need the walls up when they bowlin' 'cause I'm gutter (uh-huh, uh-huh)

I ain't fucked your sister, bitch, I'm just a motherfucker
Nah, I'm lyin', I knocked her ass down too and we got in lots of trouble, ugh
"Fuck Mexican OT and fuck his raps, he's just a bitch"
Ho, I'm Virgil 'til I die, and, oh, yes, sir, I'm with the shits (fah, fah, fah, fah)
On 288, swingin' elbows like I'm in the UFC
My chopper got a mind of its own, so if it shoot, it ain't on me
I stay after F because I'm a G
Bad bitch with me, she stay on fleek
Miami Heat, up and shoot, shoot a three
Call my chopper "Kick" because it knock out a knee
Yes, bitch, I'm cut throat, no love, ho
We gon' get 'em done, foe
Hop out with these sticks, I told my tio, "Let that mug blow"
Mismatch my designer, got me feelin' like I'm Lud Foe
If the bitch can't afford my watch, then I ain't got time for a itty-bitty broke ho (uh-huh, uh-huh)

Ayo, is that that Mexican OT?

Can't nobody tell me shit 'cause I got cutters, motherfucker
Bitch, I'm Virgil 'til I die, no, I can't be nobody other
Told my chopper that the only thing we got is just each other
I'm the type that need the walls up when they bowlin' 'cause I'm gutter (uh-huh, uh-huh)

I was deep in that water, swimmin' with them fishes
Them crash dummy missions, I was jumpin' fences
I came out of the mud like a victim of ditches
Everywhere I go, got a Glock in my britches
Cut 'em up, now the doctor givin' 'em some stitches
A beam on the yopper, I ain't never missin'
Double Ds on the cutter, Nina got extensions
In the Southside of Texas, double cup, we sippin'
Southside steppin', I'm player made
I pour up a four, mix it with Minute Maid
If it's drama you want, we pull up where you stay
I ain't callin' 'em 'cause I want deep hitter stains
Ready for war, I'm strapped up like a soldier
The tooley gon' knock his head right off his shoulder
I'm actin' a fooley while pushin' a stolo
My grandma make cookies, they got me on slow-mo

Virgil, you have everything under control
It is all in your mind
The world is now in your hands
Finish him

Can't nobody tell me shit 'cause I got cutters, motherfucker
Bitch, I'm Virgil 'til I die, no, I can't be nobody other
Told my chopper that the only thing we got is just each other
I'm the type that need the walls up when they bowlin' 'cause I'm gutter (uh-huh, uh-huh)
