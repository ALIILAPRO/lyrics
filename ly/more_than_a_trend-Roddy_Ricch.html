		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

I can't give you more than I got left to give
I don't know if I could show you more than them
Maybe after this life, we could make more than amends
Maybe after this life, we could be more than a trend

You always gon' chase the nigga lace you down in the latest
Why you always chasin' the perfect picture you painted?
Everything come with a price, that's just how it's made
Why you always doin' the shit you do when you faded?
And I tell you 'bout your wrongs 'cause I'm never gon' fake it
But you never complacent, always find replacement
Wanna take you outside, Houstatlantavegas
Go Beverly Hills and cash out at Jason
Shawty, we ain't tryna put you in no trouble
I ain't comin' off as no cuff
I just wanna put it deep down inside your spot
Shawty, I done walked around in your brain
And I promise I can tame everything that these lame niggas cannot

I can't give you more than I got left to give
I don't know if I could show you more than them
Maybe after this life, we could make more than amends
Maybe after this life, we could be more than a trend
