		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't tell me anything
Its not a dream
Its not a big lie

You're not going anywhere
You don't care
You think that's fine

You don't owe me anything
The offering
Is already mine

Your best friend is everywhere
They don't care
They think you're slime

You don't even know
What it means to
Take your own advice and then
Expect me to look surprised

After a while you know the style and that's enough to kno you suck
And when you know to stop the show because you know they know
I know its sad but don't feel bad they knew they had it coming
After a while it hurts to smile and if you laugh its just a typical miracle
