		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Senpai, I saw you at school today
Took your picture then I snuck away
I want you to notice me
But I'm just someone you don't notice, still, I think I've got a rival I have to kill

Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Or others will have to die!

Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Or others will have to die!

My heart beats faster when I'm near you
I get so nervous I don't know what to do
I don't mean to seem aloof I've got to push
Another student off the roof
Then I drag their bodies to the furnace
To destroy all the proof
Why won't you?!

Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Or others will have to die!

Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Or others will have to die!

Everyone must die!
Only you and I will be left standing
There's blood on my knife
And I don't know why
But, please why won't you notice me senpai

Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Or others will have to die!

Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai
Or others will have to die!
