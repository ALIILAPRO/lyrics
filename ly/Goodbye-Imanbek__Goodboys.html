		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why
I can't say goodbye?
No, I can't say goodbye
Bye
No, I can't say goodbye
Bye

Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why
I can't say goodbye?
Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why
I can't say goodbye?
No, I can't say goodbye

Don't know if I should love you or leave you
Why won't my head or my heart align?
Don't think I understand what I'm feeling
Can you tell me?

Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why
I can't say goodbye?
No, I can't say goodbye
Bye
No, I can't say goodbye
Bye

Is it wrong or right? Wrong or right?
You're still on my mind, on my mind
Tell me why
I can't say goodbye
No, I can't say good
