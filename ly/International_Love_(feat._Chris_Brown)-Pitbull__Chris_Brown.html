		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Went from Mr. 305 (Dade County)
To Mr. Worldwide (all around the word), ayy, ayy
Now we're international, so international (oh, yeah)
International (woo) so international

You can't catch me boy (can't catch me boy)
I am overseas at about a hundred Gs for sure
Don't test me boy (don't test me boy) 'cause I rap with the best
Fo' sho 305 to the death of me
Cremate my body let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby you're the referee

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep 
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Chris Brown)
Hotter than Miami, I feel the heat (oh, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (girl it's), it's international love (international)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah), it's international love

I don't play football
But I've touched down everywhere (everywhere?) everywhere
I don't play baseball
But I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side
And told me "Pit you can have me and my sister"
In Lebanon, yeah, the women the bomb
And in Greece you guessed it the women are sweet
Been all around the world
But I ain't gonna lie there's nothing like Miami's heat (dale)

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep 
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (ah-ha)
Hotter than Miami, I feel the heat (oh, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (girl it's), it's international love (we're international)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah), it's international love

Down in D.R. they're looking for visa's
I ain't talking credit cards, if you know what I mean
En Cuba, la cosa est√° dura
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean
En Colombia the women got everything done
But they're some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil they're freaky with big ol' boobs
And their thongs, blue yellow and green
En L.A. tengo la mexicana, en New York tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujere' en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo cualquiera

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep 
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (oh, whoa)
Hotter than Miami, I feel the heat (you're hotter than Miami)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (all around the world), it's international love (we're international)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah), it's international love

There's not a place that your love don't affect me baby
So don't ever change
I cross the globe when I'm with you baby
Hey (Chris Brown)
Oh, whoa (this is for the women worldwide)
Let's ride, woo

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (212)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (310)
Hotter than Miami (you're hotter than Miami), I feel the heat (305)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (girl it's), it's international love (we're international)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah), it's international love

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (212)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (310)
Hotter than Miami, I feel the heat (305)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's international love (we're international)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's international love

Oh (you're international, so international)
Oh (you're international, so international)
Oh (you're international, so international)
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh, international love (surrounded by beautiful girls)
Whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh, international love
