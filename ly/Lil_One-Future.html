		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one
Lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one
That's some real shit (FBG)
The Wizrd, play with 'em (woo, woo)
Don't make me, don't make me
Yeah (that's how we rock)
Rebel, like a motherfuckin' rebel, nigga

See, my lil' nigga keep that mask on, I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma keep that cash on him, I'ma do the dash
Don't make me drop a bird on you, I'm gon' drop a bag on you
I'm gon' drop that bag on you, don't make me drop that bag on you
Ayy, my lil' nigga keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil' nig' keep that MAC on him, gotta keep that MAC on him
Gotta keep that MAC on, they pla-pla-pla-pla-plack on you

Solitaires on me, no cards
Niggas gon' pull up and spray in broad
Got the yopper on him right now
And he ready to pull up right now
Choppa hit a nigga with the scope
Fuck this pussy shit, we sellin' dope
Turn the hood into Iraq
On the corner, flippin' that pack
AK-47s and lortabs
Drugged up on them fuckin' Percocets
Fell asleep and woke up with that yopper
And he playin' with it right now

See, my lil' nigga keep that mask on, I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma keep that cash on him, I'ma do the dash
Don't make me drop a bird on you, I'm gon' drop a bag on you
I'm gon' drop that bag on you, don't make me drop that bag on you
Ayy, my lil' nigga keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil' nig' keep that MAC on him, gotta keep that MAC on him
Gotta keep that MAC on, they pla-pla-pla-pla-plack on you

Trap with that .44 camouflage
The AR and TEC, that's a real menage
Jump out the side of a Caravan
Flippin' that work, you the middleman
Got that penthouse with the dogs off it
You take them Roxies with some alcohol
You rob in the daytime, nigga, my trap is a gold mine, nigga
Pour the four then cut the four
You play with that dog food, you play with that, play with that
These niggas are runnin' a gun store, they comin' to kick in your front door
The goonies got hoodies and money, Frank Lucas a role model
Hit 'em and hit 'em and lick 'em up and go get your own bottle

See, my lil' nigga keep that mask on, I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma keep that cash on him, I'ma do the dash
Don't make me drop a bird on you, I'm gon' drop a bag on you
I'm gon' drop that bag on you, don't make me drop that bag on you
Ayy, my lil' nigga keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil' nigga keep that MAC on him, gotta keep that MAC on him
Gotta keep that MAC on, they pla-pla-pla-pla-plack on you
