		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah it's summer summertime
Baby let's go down to the beach tonight
Cause it's summer summertime
We can throw our clothes up
And dance all night feels like
We can live it up, go crazy feels like
The sun will never set, no baby

I got summer summer summer summertime
Summer summer summer you and I
I got summer summer in my mind
Summer summer when you're in my life girl

Yeah it's summer summertime
Why don't we go wide and go see the world
You're like summer in my life
And I don't wanna live without you girl
Feels like we can live it up, go crazy
Feels like the sun will never set, no baby

I got summer summer summer summertime
Summer summer summer you and I
I got summer summer in my mind
Summer summer when you're in my life girl

Cause I got, I got

I got summer summer summer summertime
Summer summer summer you and I
I got summer summer in my mind
Summer summer when you're in my life girl

Summer summer in my mind
Summer summer when you're in my life
