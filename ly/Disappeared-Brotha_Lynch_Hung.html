		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They disappeared, no * * *
Don't trust nobody, this shit is weird
This shit is real, I have to own it
At any moment, they could be on me
They have to die, at least in my eyes
I'm so surprised, I open my eyes
I seen it all, they think I ball
I'll never fall, not * * *

Them bodies gon' disappear
I'mma rip 'em in half, gettin' the last word in
I'mma sit in the back of the car at her job
When she get in car, I'mma attack her jaw
I'mma cut up the face and put her on the face and
Walk out the house with a machete like Jason
Kill her whole family, botox facelift
Nobody, no case, nobody, no face
Barbecue, * *, I'mma rape your taste
I mean, I'mma rape your mouth, bitch! I'mma take guts out
And I'mma put 'em in the oven, yeah, I'mma heat that 
And * * * *, I'mma hold up the plate like, bitch, you late

They disappeared, no * * *
Don't trust nobody, this shit is weird
This shit is real, I have to own it
At any moment, they could be on me
They have to die, at least in my eyes
I'm so surprised, I open my eyes
I seen it all, they think I ball
I'll never fall, not * * *

We own neighborhoods like speed bumps, nigga
And I got that bloody face, sippin' on that *, nigga
And you want that season, nigga, where is that season, nigga?
I'm a misfit and I spit shit like I just got the fever, nigga
And I stay lit like Michael 
Plus, I smoke like a chimney, enemies get
Fuck all the hatred
Even if these niggas is steadily
These niggas is
They don't wanna get in the ring with Ali
I might be leavin' 'em bleedin', no I.D.

Nigga, I

They disappeared, no * * *
Don't trust nobody, this shit is weird
This shit is real, I have to own it
At any moment, they could be on me
They have to die, at least in my eyes
I'm so surprised, I open my eyes
I seen it all, they think I ball
I'll never fall, not * * *
