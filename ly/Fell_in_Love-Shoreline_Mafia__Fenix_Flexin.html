		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  AceTheFace

I fell in love with the money, fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drank, guess I'm stuck in the mud
She a freak and she know it, that bitch stuck in the club
If this rap don't work, I'm running off on the plug
I can't see you pussy niggas through these Cartis, ay
We done brought the pistols in the party
We done brought the choppers like a Harley
I been eating steak and calamari
I been with these hoes in these hotels
Weighin' up some molly on a dope scale
We don't pour no fours, we need the whole seal
I don't trust these bitches 'cause they gon' tell
Tell my nigga Frankie bring the blues in
She gon' pop a thirty, bring the mood in
I ain't trippin' 'bout no niggas, I be coolin'
Glock on my hip, leave the toughest nigga droolin'

I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the plug
I fell in love with the mud

I put a bitch in some Fendi, make her beg for me
She ain't got a thing except some head for me
I don't fuck with other niggas 'less it's bread for me
Play with us, we gon' give your ass a dead homie
I take her home, beat her down, make her spread for me
And she supposed to be your bitch, nigga
I don't diss niggas, I'm a rich nigga
But you the type to go and cry about a bitch, nigga
Go ahead and touch me, that's a bad move
We'll go and shoot your partner out his tattoos
Spent eight bands on the 'fit like it's regular
The only thing I got is money on my schedule
I'ma turn a broke bitch to a rich bitch
I'ma turn a college girl to a freak ho
I get money even when I'm in my sleep, nigga
Cross that line, I'ma shoot it like a free throw

I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the plug
I fell in love with the mud
