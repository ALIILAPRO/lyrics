I like that
Darkchild

I'm a groundbreaking woman
I get loud when I wanna
Put me down, I'll go harder
Promise that I give you life
Promise I know what you like
Uh, uh

100, 100, 100, 100 rounds
I know how to keep you chasing
Leave my handprint, make my mark
100, 100, 100, 100 rounds
Trust me boy, it's worth the waiting
Ain't no stopping when I start

I'ma hit you with a dose
I'ma get a little closer
I'ma give a little more
Put your body in motion
I'ma hit you with a dose
Can you keep your composure?
Have you singing like "oh"
You'll be feeling like oh

When you fall, fall
Just get back up again
When you fall, fall
Just get back up again
When you fall, fall, fall
Just get back up again
Just get back up again
Just get back up again when you fall

Give you the most when the moment's amazing
I know what you want
What you want, it ain't basic
Baby got the goodies
Got the game you should play it
I know what you like, uh, uh

100, 100, 100, 100 rounds
I know how to keep you chasing
Leave my handprint, make my mark
100, 100, 100, 100 rounds
Trust me boy, it's worth the waiting
Ain't no stopping when I start

I'ma hit you with a dose
I'ma get a little closer
I'ma give a little more
Put your body in motion
I'ma hit you with a dose
Can you keep your composure?
Have you singing like "oh"
You'll be feeling like oh

When you fall, fall
Just get back up again
When you fall, fall
Just get back up again
When you fall, fall, fall
Just get back up again
Just get back up again
Just get back up again when you fall

Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh let me if you think you're ready
Ooh baby, ooh baby
(Then come and put your hands on this)
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh let me if you think you're ready
Ooh baby, ooh baby
(Tell me if you can handle this)

I'ma hit you with a dose
I'ma hit you with a dose
Have you singing like "oh"
You'll be feeling like oh

I'ma hit you with a dose
I'ma get a little closer
I'ma give a little more
Put your body in motion
I'ma hit you with a dose
Can you keep your composure?
Have you singing like "oh"
You'll be feeling like oh

When you fall, fall
Just get back up again
When you fall, fall
Just get back up again
When you fall, fall, fall
Just get back up again
Just get back up again
Just get back up again when you fall
