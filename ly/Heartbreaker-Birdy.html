		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel like I've been reading you wrong
And we've tilted from where we started
If someone's gonna let go
It's me that's gotta let go
I'm damned if I do, gonna be damned if I don't, oh

You say one more dance and I always give in
(I don't know what I'm doing)
(I don't know what I'm doing)
I'm falling in your arms trying to save everything
(I don't know what I'm doing)
(I don't know what I'm doing)

Heartbreaker
It was over right from the start
Heartbreaker
And nothing's ever gonna be enough
Heartbreaker
I wanted you to be but you're not

Been too long, too long holding on
To this blindfold hoping and praying
We both know the truth is, we're already losing
Damned if I do, gonna be damned if I don't, oh

You say one more dance and I always give in
(I don't know what I'm doing)
(I don't know what I'm doing)
I'm falling in your arms trying to save everything
(I don't know what I'm doing)
(I don't know what I'm doing)

Heartbreaker
It was over right from the start
Heartbreaker
And nothing's ever gonna be enough
Heartbreaker
I wanted you to be but you're not

Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker (illusions only last for so long)
Heartbreaker (I wanted you to be but you're not, but you're not)
