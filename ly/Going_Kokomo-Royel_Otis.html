		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At first I saw you at the store
You looking cold and keepin' warm
I wrote my number on the stall
I never figured you would call

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Aw, don't leave me, baby
Baby, baby, only lately maybe
I've been dreamin' of ya
Aw, don't leave me, mama

Going Kokomo
Our life's a beach so let's let go
Don't stress yourself
Might even play this on the radio
Going Kokomo
Our life's a beach so let's let go
Don't stress yourself
Might even play this on the radio

So unaware I heard it ring
To pick it up you surprised me
Your many voices sound so sweet
I wanna pick you 'til you bleed

Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Aw, don't leave me, baby
Oh, baby, baby, only lately maybe
I've been dreamin' of ya
Aw, don't leave me mama

Going Kokomo
Our life's a beach so let's let go
Don't stress yourself
Might even play this on the radio
Going Kokomo
Our life's a beach so let's let go
Don't stress yourself
Might even play this on the radio

Going Kokomo
Our life's a beach so let's let go
Don't stress yourself
Don't stress yourself
