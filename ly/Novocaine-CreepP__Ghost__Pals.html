		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The doctor will see you now

How are you today?
What seems to be the problem?
Well, I don't think that's the case
Something is wrong, and it's all your fault

How are you today?
I've found a diagnosis
And I have just what you need
Something is wrong and it's all your fault

Don't be afraid
You're making things worse!
I should know 'cus I'm the doctor here
Don't run away
I'll throw the treatment in reverse!
Everything you need is prescribed by me

First of all, let's establish one thing:
A kind heart like me really doesn't have to do this
You don't deserve it

So pay your fees with appreciation
You're in my debt for as long as you need medication
For a chronic condition

And everybody's watching
Everybody wants to know
"What the hell is wrong with you, there!"
"Over there!"

Everybody noticed 
The abomination inside your mouth

Now don't make this harder than it has to be
You're the one pulling teeth for an eternity
(Pull 'em out and, and, and wash 'em off, the memories)
Take this once-in-a-lifetime chance
(Tear 'em out and, and, and make up for forgotten years)
Your infection shall have its final dance

With a small pinch, let's administer the novocaine
It's not that painful, so why the hell are you crying?

I gave you treatment
You didn't even feel a thing in the first place
Oh, how fucking sad
You made excuses to dissociate
You're bleeding now 'cus you never floss
And I'm the one who deals with your loss

So open your mouth 
And say "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!"
Say ""AH!" "AH!" AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "Ah-!"

Don't make this harder than it has to be
You're the one pulling teeth for an eternity
Take this once-in-a-lifetime chance
Your infection shall have its final dance

Don't be afraid
You're making things worse!
I should know 'cus I'm the doctor here
Don't run away
I'll throw the treatment in reverse!
Everything you need is prescribed by me

Say "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" "AH!" 

Now all of your memories
Memories, memories
Must be side effects
Side effects of the anesthesia
I never did
Never did anything
To warrant your hate
Your hate
Your hatred towards me

Anyway, let's try again

The doctor will see you now

Say "ah"!

Don't pull away
You're making things worse!
I should know 'cus I'm the surgeon here
Don't be afraid
I've given you everything!
All the teeth that I pull are mine to keep

I tried to help you
You chose to refuse
If you want it that way
I'm gonna operate
Forever and a day
You never had a say

I know exactly what's best for you
I've done exactly what's best for you
