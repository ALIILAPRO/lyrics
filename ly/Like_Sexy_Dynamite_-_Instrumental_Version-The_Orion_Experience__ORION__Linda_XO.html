		  Like Sexy Dynamite

Oh yeah, your love it gets me hotter than a flame.
Fever at the mention of your name.
Don't wanna get too caught up in the game.
Too late
Too late, you're taking me over.
I knew I was in trouble when you held my hand.
You radiate emotion that I just don't understand.
You move me with desire, this was not my plan.
Oh no
Oh no, I'm going under.

You're like water, I can't hold you.
Slip through my fingers, I can't control you.
I'm on fire with your crazy energy, it's lightning.
Look what you do to me.

You're like sexy dynamite,
You cause explosions inside me every night.
You're like sexy dynamite,
You cause explosions inside me every night.

cll of my life I've been waiting for this.
Illuminate the sky with your electrifying kiss.
You're gonna take me down but I just can't resist,
too late
Too late, you're taking me over.
cll the little lover-things you do to me,
Your soul ignites the fire that sets me free
You know I will surrender to your ecstasy.
oh yeah
Oh yeah, I'm going under.

I see a tidal wave on the horizon.
I feel the danger, the tide is rising.
You're like a hurricane, lightning and thunder.
You know I can't escape the spell I'm under.

You're like sexy dynamite,
You cause explosions inside me every night.
You're like sexy dynamite,
You cause explosions inside me every night.

cnd when you kiss me there,
c soft explosion fills the air,
You know you've got me dear.

You're like sexy dynamite,
You cause explosions inside me every night.
You're like sexy dynamite,
You cause explosions inside me every night.
