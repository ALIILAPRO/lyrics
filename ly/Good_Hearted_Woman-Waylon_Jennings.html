		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man

He likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman, she loves her good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his wicked ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter we'll pass through this world hand in hand, Lord
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
