		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gotta take it or leave it
You’ll never get a second chance
Embrace all the glamour
within these halls of decadence
You wasted your chances
you lost your soul ́s inheritance
Does somebody know
-the way out of this trance?
Where do you go..?
You know you gotta head back home
Find the price tag on your soul
Retrace your tracks back to that crossroad
-and that someone you used to know
One day you’re gonna make it
befriend your circumstances
Like a nail and the hammer
bound through old romance
A golden age promise
stole your soul ́s inheritance
Does somebody know
-the way out of this trance?
Where do you go..?
You know you gotta head back home
Find the price tag on your soul
Retrace your tracks back to that crossroad
-and that someone you used to know
At the feet of your goddess
what’s the price on your soul
it’s all so dishonest, still fluently out of control
now ain’t that someone you know?
-or someone you used to know?
You know you gotta head back home
Find the price tag on your soul
Retrace your tracks back to that crossroad
-and that someone you used to know
