		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought you'd be looking for the next in line to love then ignore
Put out and put away
And so you'd soon be leaving me alone like I'm supposed to be tonight
Tomorrow and everyday
There's nothing here that you'll miss
I can guarantee you this is a cloud of smoke
Trying to occupy space
What a fucking joke
What a fucking joke
I waited for a bus to separate the both of us and take me off far away
From you 'cause my feelings never change a bit I always feel like shit I
Don't know why I guess that I \"just do\"
You once talked to me about love and you painted pictures of
A never-neverland and I could've gone to that place
But I didn't understand
I didn't understand
I didn't understand
