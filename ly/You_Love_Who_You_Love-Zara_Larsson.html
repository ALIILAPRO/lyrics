		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so in love with him, it's tragic
You just wanna have him all to yourself (ah)
And to your family, he's perfect
But behind the curtains, he's someone else (ah)

When will you use your common sense?
He drags you down instead of compliments
You know he ain't Heaven-sent
No, he ain't Heaven-sent, look at the evidence

Girl, give him up
I'm tellin' you as a friend
What he's putting you through is too much
I told you enough
But you don't wanna listen
You just tell me, "You love who you love"
Won't be long, it's a matter of time
'Til you call me 'cause he made you cry
Enough is enough
'Cause you don't wanna listen
You just tell me, "You love who you love"

It's like we goin' 'round in circles
He does this on purpose to keep you near (ah)
This toxic love makin' you feel like you're insane
He promised you he's gonna change, but he's the same

When will you use your common sense? (When will you use)
He drags you down instead of compliments
You know he ain't Heaven-sent
No, he ain't Heaven-sent, look at the evidence (oh, no, no, no)

Girl, give him up
I'm tellin' you as a friend
What he's putting you through is too much
I told you enough
But you don't wanna listen
You just tell me, "You love who you love"
Won't be long, it's a matter of time
'Til you call me 'cause he made you cry
Enough is enough
'Cause you don't wanna listen
You just tell me, "You love who you love"

Maybe one day, you will finally understand
That if you're lookin' for love, he isn't the man
I sound like a broken record
But you need to figure it out

Girl, give him up (give him up)
I'm tellin' you as a friend
What he's putting you through is too much
I told you enough
But you don't wanna listen
You just tell me, "You love who you love"
Won't be long, it's a matter of time (matter of time)
'Til you call me 'cause he made you cry
Enough is enough (is enough, is enough)
'Cause you don't wanna listen
You just tell me, "You love who you love"
