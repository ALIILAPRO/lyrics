		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I close my eyes

Will my fears fall out of sight

Forced to fake a smile

Will you promise

Will you promise



Stay with me through it all

We’ve shared more than years

You know how to heal me

Stay with me through it all

​

Waiting in these crowds

I’m shaking, shaking now

Learning to breathe in and out

Will you promise

Will you promise



Stay with me through it all

We’ve shared more than years

You know how to heal me

Stay with me through it all

​

We’ve shared more than years

And you know how to heal this

We’ve shared more than years babe

And you know how to heal this

We’ve shared more than years

And you know how to heal this

We’ve shared more than years

You know how to heal this

You know how to heal me

You know how to heal me



Stay with me through it all

We’ve shared more than years

You know how to heal me

Stay with me through it all
