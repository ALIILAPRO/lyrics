		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Finn loves Ellis, but a skin-tight hope
A thin sequella come amicable
A pinch won't dwell about the brittle-boned
My fingers swelling and nothing had awoke

And now I wonder what a silk worn sheet
Amounts to comfort I would kill for sleep
And bet nobody knew you think of we
'Cause as I'm yawning you would turn your cheek

Away from me
Away from me

Finn loves Ellis, but a skin tight-rope
A limp umbrella heading in the storm
A pinch won't dwell how about I rid them all
My fingers swelling here the grit to fall

And now I wonder what a silk worn sheet
Amounts to comfort I would kill for sleep
And bet nobody knew you think of we
'Cause as I'm yawning you would turn your cheek

Away from me
Away from me
Away from me
Away from me

It's only but a fence
What boundary lives so profoundly
I can't hide the doubt since you found me
It's all sound but it's always sounding wrong

Away from me
Away from me
Away from me
Away from me
