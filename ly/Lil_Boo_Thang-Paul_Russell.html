		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you
Girl

You my lil' boo thang
So, I don't give a hoot what your dude say
Girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shooting that shot like 2K
Girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' something too fresh
I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' something too fresh
I know

Put a lil' gold in the teeth
And the fit good, so I took the doors off the Jeep, okay
I see a brother holding your seat, no beef
But I'm trying to get to know you at least
Don't take my talkin' to you wrong
I can keep it chill like a sauvignon blanc
I'ma keep it real when your man long gone
If you're looking for a friend then you got the wrong song

Baby girl, what's good, what's with ya?
If you book tonight, that's fiction
I'm outside, not with ya
You want me, go figure
To the back, to the front
You a ten baby girl, but I'm the one (hey)
To the back (to the back), to the front (to the front)
You a ten baby girl, but I'm the one, one

You my lil' boo thang
So, I don't give a hoot what your dude say
Girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shooting that shot like 2K
Girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' something too fresh
I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' something too fresh
I know

Hey
Girl, you got me
I'm singing
It's like
Oh, ooh-oh, you got the best of my love
Oh, ooh-oh, you got the best of my, my
Oh, ooh-oh, you got the best of my love
Oh, ooh-oh, and in that dress, I'm like (whoa)

You my lil' boo thang (yeah)
So, I don't give a hoot what your dude say
Girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shooting that shot like 2K
Girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' something too fresh
I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' something too fresh
I know
