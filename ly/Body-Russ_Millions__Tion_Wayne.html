		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bah 
Mm-mm, yo
 
E-E-English girl named Fiona (Gotcha)
Big batty gyal named Abiola (mm-mm)
Body-ody shaped like Cola (bah)
Back up, back up, bring it to the owner

Man, I'm still up on the roads, could've left (bah, bah)
Still chatting to my bros on the tech (mm-mm)
Fuck that, man, I don't give a F (ooh, ooh)
What you wanna get, smoked? Cigarette (bah, bah, bah)
English, English girl named Fiona
African girl, Adeola
Body-ody shaped like Cola
Back up, back up, ayy, come closer

Vida loca (bullet)
High as a kite, never sober (shotta)
Python, hit him with a Cobra
Free up my bro Casanova (free him up)
Badman persona
Badman alone can control her ('trol her)
Sorry, sorry, your sis got bent over
Push in my hood, take anaconda
Throw back like Ed Hardy
Stay fly, I'm high like Jeff Hardy
Wet, wet, like the tsunami (wet, wet, wet)
Big Russ fuck up the punani
Pum pum turn up, I hit that raw
Fuck with this tip and she ball out, "Lord"
Buss my- in your gyal like crud
Pum pum bruk up, everything mad (mhm)

Yo, yo, I got more than a mil' in savings (mhm)
But you can still get a shaven (bah)
If I ever get caught by the paigons (uh, uh)
Badman I ain't just waving (boom)
Live my best like like I'm One Acen (Acen)
In my face, love the altercation (oii, oii, oii)
But with my shank, that's abomination (oii, oii)
Gyal with a big back's my weakness (weakness)
But when I punch man, it's grievous (boom)
They'll play back the CCTV
When I banged him my defense said, "Jesus"
All my brothers gotta ball like the Lakers (oii)
Every time I see her arse, "What the fuck?" (What the fuck?)
Every time I see that arch, it's amazing (mhm)
Me and Russ like Freddy and Jason (yo)
(Bah, bah, bah, bah) (mhm) 

Man, I'm still up on the roads, could've left (mm-mm)
Still chatting to my bros on the tech (bah, bah)
Fuck that, man, I don't give a F (brrt)
What you wanna get, smoked? Cigarette
English, English girl named Fiona
African girl, Adeola
Body-ody shaped like Cola
Back up, back up, ayy, come closer

My man, he's too innocent
Free Big A, he's too militant
They mention us just to get relevant
Russ, T-Wayne come by millions
Wizzy, Wizzy, Wizzy get drilly pon any (ay)
She know us already from 'Keisha & Becky' (mhm)
Head, chest, neck, back, I don't mind belly
Armed and ready, green light, get shelly

Littiest citizen, hittin' 'em, diligent
Vigilant, stickin' 'em, none of my niggas are innocent
On-on-on sight, man are just chingin' 'em
Come-come-come far but I still finish 'em
Body-ody like Megan Thee Stallion
Russ and Wizzy, that's another platinum
Copy, copy, opps copy the mandem (yo)
Pull up on who man, buss off my hand ting

Man, I'm still up on the roads, could've left (ooh)
Still chatting to my bros on the tech (bah, bah)
Fuck that, man, I don't give a F (brrt)
What you wanna get, smoked? Cigarette (oii, oii)
English, English girl named Fiona
African girl, Adeola
Body-ody shaped like Cola
Back up, back up, ayy, come closer

English girl named Fiona
Big batty gyal named Abiola
Body-ody shaped like Cola
Back up, back up, bring it to the owner
E-E-English girl named Fiona
Big batty gyal named Abiola
Body-ody shaped like Cola
Back up, back up, bring it to the owner

Man, I'm still up on the roads, couldn've left (mm-mm)
Still chatting to my bros on the tech (bah, bah)
Fuck that, man, I don't give a F (brrt)
What you wanna get, smoked? Cigarette
English, English girl named Fiona
African girl, Adeola (ahh)
Body-ody shaped like Cola (uh-oh)
Back up, back up, ayy, come closer
