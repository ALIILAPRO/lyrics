		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When your alone
Does the sun kiss your skin just like me ?
Cause if its 3000 miles through the rain storm and all
Ill be there
Ill be there
No question
Every time that you need someone just call on me
Im serious
Girl there's no where else id rather be
Im curious
When your flying out of town
And somewhere laying by the beach
Gon' and tell me when when when when
Tell me
When your alone
Does the sun kiss your skin just like me ?
Cause if its 3000 miles through the rain storm and all
Ill be there
Ill be there
A little one on one
Just us two
You want familiar
Not something new
All of me
All of you
All on me baby
All on you shawty
We don't need no distractions
All eyes on me
Cause Your the apple of my eye
Like Stevie Wonder
I Wonder if I can hit your spot just tell me when
Tell me when I hit it
Gon' and tell me when when when
Tell me
When your alone
Does the sun kiss your skin just like me ?
Cause if its 3000 miles through the rain storm and all
Ill be there
Ill be there
