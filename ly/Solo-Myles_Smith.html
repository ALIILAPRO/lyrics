		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You promised a lifetime, but left in a moment
I wonder if you even think about me
Throw me a lifeline cause I'm barely floating
Stranded and broken

You know you got me
Lost in the dark is it too late
Is it too late for us
You know you got me
Lost in my heart
Is it too late
Is it too late for us

Oh why'd you get me so high
To leave me so low
To leave me solo
Oh I was wasting my time
Hoping you'd call
But damn you're so cold
Oh why'd you make me feel safe
Just to walk away
Just to let me go
Oh why'd you get me so high
To leave me so low
To leave me solo

You looked like an angel
Thought I was in heaven
But now I'm just falling
Without you with me
I thought I was able
To learn from my lessons
Was trying my best but

You know you got me
Lost in the dark is it too late
Is it too late for us
You know you got me
Lost in my heart
Is it too late
Is it too late for us

Oh why'd you get me so high
To leave me so low
To leave me solo
Oh I was wasting my time
Hoping you'd call
But damn you're so cold
Oh why'd you make me feel safe
Just to walk away
Just to let me go
Oh why'd you get me so high
To leave me so low
To leave me solo

Oh-oh-oh (I'll never love again, I'll never love again)
Oh-oh-oh (I'll never love again, I'll never love again)

Oh why'd you get me so high
To leave me so low
To leave me solo
Oh I was wasting my time
Hoping you'd call
But damn you're so cold
Oh why'd you make me feel safe
Just to walk away
Just to let me go
Oh why'd you get me so high
To leave me so low
To leave me solo
