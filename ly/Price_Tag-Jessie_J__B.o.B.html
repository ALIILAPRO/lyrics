		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, Coconut man, Moonheads, and Pea
You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that? Yeah
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

Okay
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only the one getting tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee you we'll be feeling alright

Everybody look to their left (to their left)
Everybody look to their right (to their right)
Can you feel that? Yeah
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

Yeah, yeah, well, keep the price tag (yeah)
And take the cash back
Just give me six strings (six strings)
And a half stack (half stack)
And you can, can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what? In thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on the life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
Waiting to see this in a sign of defeat, uh-uh
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat, and then everyone sing

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag (hey, hey)

It's not about the money, money, money (we don't need it)
We don't need your money, money, money (no I don't, we don't need it)
We just wanna make the world dance (dance, dance your ass of)
Forget about the price tag (ah, ah)
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling (it ain't about)
Wanna make the world dance (yeah, yeah)
Forget about the price tag

Forget about the price tag
Yeah, yeah, ooh
Forget about the price tag
