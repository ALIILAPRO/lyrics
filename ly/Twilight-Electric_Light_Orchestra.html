		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The visions dancing in my mind 
The early dawn, the shades of time 
Twilight crawling through my windowpane 

Am I awake or do I dream
The strangest pictures I have seen 
Night is day and twilight's gone away

With your head held high and your scarlet lies 
You came down to me from the open skies 
It's either real or it's a dream 
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile 
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind 
Away from me

Across the night I saw your face 
You disappeared without a trace 
You brought me here, but can you take me back

Inside the image of your light 
That now is day and once was night 
You lead me here and then you go away

It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind 
Away from me

You brought me here, but can you take me back again?

With your head held high and your scarlet lies 
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile 
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile 
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile

Twilight, twilight
Twilight, twilight
