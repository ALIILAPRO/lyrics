		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness, lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gonna have to excuse my mess

She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'm gon' have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet
If she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'm gon' have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
And she gon' have to tell dudes to step nigga to the left, nigga to the left
Messy messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggies that's my Herbal Essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra
'Cause I'm workin extra, I just heard her lecture
But I swerve the questions, and reserve a section
With a bunch a bitches that prefer to pleasure
It's quarter to 7, I just heard the shower water running in the morning
Dirty devil, I'm a mess
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I could hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes, but you gotta tip toe 'cause

My days is a mess
My nights is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness, lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones
My bae is a mess, my side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gonna have to excuse my mess, yes

No pressure, it's a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord I know she got bills
But I'm make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talkin' about staying over
And she asked could she call her clan over
I said "that's the shit" now we assholin'
Now fast forward to the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes
Make up and lashes, out of place mattress
Shit happens, 'cause my days is a mess
I'm sorry baby but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I could hear teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into petrol
Put yourself in my shoes, but you gotta tip toe 'cause

My days is a mess
My nights is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness, lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones
My bae is a mess, my side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gonna have to excuse my mess, yes
Fuck it, more ones
Fuck it, more ones
Fuck it, more ones
Fuck it, more ones
I'm making a mess, with all of these ones
Fuck it, more ones
Fuck it, more ones
My life is a mess of happiness, lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones
