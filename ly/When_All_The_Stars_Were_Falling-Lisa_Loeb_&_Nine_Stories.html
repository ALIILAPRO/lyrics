		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  when all the stars were falling
i reached up like you said
all the stars were falling
one hit me in the head
and i fell down down down
i fell down down

when all the stars were falling
they fell from above and i thought of hate
and i thought of hate and then i thought of love
i fell down down down
i fell down down

and i've learned how to dance 
from a vincent van gough
and the knights were wrapped 
in a white sheet
and now no one even says hello
'cause i couldn't stand on my two feet
i fell down 
i fell down
down down down down down down

now the piece you will find on your own
you've found 
lights in the city are the stars on the ground
i may not be acquainted 
with living in a speed zone
but i could be restfull
i could be someone's home if i fell down
and i fell down down
now all the stars have fallen
