		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark
It's getting hard to breathe
Suffocating, something's wrong
I feel so incomplete

They stop and stare
And try to drag us down
Light the fuse, flip the switch
Baby, hold your ground

You and me
They wanna break us
Let's shake it up
'Cause they will never take us

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
'Cause they don't know who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
They can give us all they've got
You're all I want

All their fears
Watch them all come true
All their words are well offered
And tell us what to do

Hit and run
There's nothing left to lose
Break their hold, slip away
Forever me and you

You and me
They wanna break us
Let's shake it up
'Cause they will never take us

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
'Cause they don't know who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
They can give us all they've got
You're all I want

Let's burn their eyes
And wave goodbye
Let's start the fire

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
'Cause they don't know who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
'Cause they don't know who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
They can give us all they've got
You're all I want, you're all I want
