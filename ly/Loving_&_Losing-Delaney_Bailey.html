		  Loving & Losing Lyrics

You said you never cried
But you sobbed in my shoulder saying goodbye
And I got lost on most days
But counting your freckles, never lost my place

And I wonder if you still think of me the same way

I didn't want to die 'cause I had something to lose
I was riding a high 'cause every song was about you
I wanted happy ever after, but ever isn't happy after you

You found comfort in my snoring
Like how home is in the floorboard creaks in the morning
And you changed silence for me
Used to make me anxious, now it helps me sleep

And I wonder if you hold your pillow now instead of me

I didn't want to die 'cause I had something to lose
I was riding a high 'cause every song was about you
I wanted happy ever after, but ever isn't happy after you

Can I keep fallin'?
I think I'm still fallin'
But I

I don't want die, I want something to lose
I want to ride a high 'cause every song is about you
I want happy ever after, but ever isn't happy after you
