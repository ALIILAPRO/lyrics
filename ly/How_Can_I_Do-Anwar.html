		  VERSE

It has been a million times, that I'VE TRIED to explain to you 
to show you that i feel something strong and special too 
and if I'M ALIVE today its only and exclusively for you 
'CAUSE i got nothing more precious and THERE'S no one more beautiful 

I'm your man, i'm your fan 
without you i'm struggling 
i'm your boy, i'm your toy 
i'm A slave to your loving 
without you i am nothing ,LESS than a rock ,a stone, weightlessness, 
inert and lost in  THE universe 

CHORUS

WHAT 
can i do 
SO you believe 
that i love you 

How 
can i do without you 
can't you see 
that i'm crazy about you 

VERSE 2

i spent days trying to find the way to apologize 
i spent nights awake waiting for the mornings to meet you 
i'm still KEEPING your picture on my wall 
And I'm obssesed about how  i  CAN bring you back 
you're my girl, you're my doll 
next to you i feel so fortunate, 
you're my heart you're my light 
you are my everything 
baby i changed can you forgive me 
cause i'm nothing, not even a little thing without you 

CHORUS

WHAT 
can i do 
SO you believe 
that i love you 

How 
can i do without you 
can't you see 
that i'm crazy about you
