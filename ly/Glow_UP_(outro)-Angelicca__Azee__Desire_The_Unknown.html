		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I've come to an end
I've played, pretended, now the games have changed
I want you to see me with somebody else yeah
See the way he makes me phase yeah
I want you next to the bed
Here's what you've been missing
Now you're the one who'll listen up
Now I'm taking me out for a ride yeah
I'll be making me feel like I'm flying
Colors through the sky baby
You wont cloud my mind anymore yeah
Ohh anymore
Ohh
Now I'm with somebody else yeah
Baby I know you're upset yeah
But you know I don't give a damn anymore
Oh no
Ohh oh
Now I'm with somebody else yeah
You know I don't give a damn yeah
Eden
Down on your knees
I'm a heathen
You can keep praying for healing
But your sins are on fire
Break ups
Everyone knows that's a glow up
You were just holding me back I'm
Doing so good now you're gone
Another body lays on your side of the bed
And there aint no sign of regret
Good girls turn bad in a sec
With the right influence
You may be good for the songs
But you're bad for the heart
You may think I'm bluffing but I'm not
I don't need her baby
I don't need you baby
I fuck with her baby
Just to fuck with you maybe
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna make you miss me
I know you need me baby
Even when you say you hate me
The girls are always changing
The motive stays the same and
It's got me feeling dangerous
Baby, why did you betray me?
Those feelings left me jaded
Becoming who I hated
Not giving love, I take it
I'm the demon you created
Watch me feel
Watch me love, watch me love, watch me love
Without you
Look what you've done, what you've done, what you've done to me baby
