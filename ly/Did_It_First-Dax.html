		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Dax the first, did first
I fucking warned you man
I told you I was gonna do this (yeah)
Still laughing? (ready) it's Dax (Chea)

Where I'm from they never did it
I did it first
Rap game wasn't shit, I gave it birth
I told 'em niggas I would make
It 'cause I wasn't stopping
Yeah they was laughing now I'm laughing
'cause I know they watchin'
See where I'm from they never did it
I did it first
Rap game wasn't shit, I gave it birth
I told 'em niggas I would make
It 'cause I wasn't stopping
Yeah they was laughing now I'm laughing
'cause I know they watchin'
I know you watchin'

I know they watchin' me
In and out of poverty hit me tryna get it
The only reason they calling me
Saying I got lucky, a guppy
I hit the lottery
Pottery, how I'm molding the game
My gift is an artistry follow me nigga
That's what I told them to do
You started laughing
Now it's funny 'cause the joke is on you
Nothin' funny, now I'm winning
I was talking the truth nothin' less
Nothin' more when I step in the booth
It's a prediction, you just a witness
I tried to tell them I was different
They wouldn't listen
What they started, I'mma finish
I got a vision
You can stay or you can follow
You leave this prison
When I had no pot to piss in
Your ass was missin'
Now you asking how I did it, it's repetition
Hope, belief, without an ending
It's a religion
I told your ass that I would do it
I fucking did it

Where I'm from they never did it
I did it first
Rap game wasn't shit, I gave it birth
I told 'em niggas I would make
It 'cause I wasn't stopping
Yeah they was laughing now I'm laughing
'cause I know they watchin'
See where I'm from they never did it
I did it first
Rap game wasn't shit, I gave it birth
I told 'em niggas I would make
It cause I wasn't stopping
Yeah they was laughing now I'm laughing
Cause I know they watchin'
I know you watchin'

This is a story nigga
How I manage in Kansas to do the damage
Now niggas can't even afford me nigga
These rappers bore me nigga
Local rappers and trappers be tryna shoot me
They be testing me like it's Maury nigga
Pouring up a 40 nigga, I'm getting drunk
Speeding, bobbing and weaving
I'm blasting it from the trunk
Who'da thunk it be me, D-A-X on the TV
Not you used to tell me I wouldn't make
It and now I got it
I predicted it would happen
I told you I was a prophet
I knew it was out a pocket and
I knew I needed to work
The fact that you picked me last
The reason you felt it first
Know it hurts nigga
You wanna know what's fucking worse nigga?
That I gave your ass a chance
Tried to tell you in advance
Tried to give your ass a hand
Now you tryna be my man fuck a fake nigga
Uhh, fuck a fake nigga
Moving out the state nigga
Rappers want a feature
They ain't even tryna pay niggas
Day to day they play nigga
Shoot and try to slay niggas
Had to make a way
California I fucking made nigga
Yeah, they be hating, I done heard it a lot
Same ones talking shit
Wishin' they had a spot
I ain't even fucking phased 'cause
I know what it's worth
They just mad 'cause your boy did it first

Where I'm from they never did it
I did it first
Rap game wasn't shit, I gave it birth
I told 'em niggas I would make
It 'cause I wasn't stopping
Yeah they was laughing now I'm laughing
'cause I know they watchin'
See where I'm from they never did it
I did it first
Rap game wasn't shit, I gave it birth
I told 'em niggas I would make
It 'cause I wasn't stopping
Yeah they was laughing now I'm laughing
'cause I know they watchin'
I know you watchin'

What doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger
We can't be beat we can't be stopped
You can't beat someone who never quit's
It's Dax (yeah)
