		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're both throwin' smoke into the night
It's rainin', I suppose that you need a ride
She said, "I've got nothin' to do and neither do you
There's a place down the road where we can waste the whole afternoon"

I overheard that she was nineteen
She's got a fake ID and a nose ring
Those kind of girls tend to know things
Better than I do
And I'm dying
To figure out what she's hiding
She's playing it cool but she's lying
Better than I do

Feels like a night to carry a tune
I've been carrying yours since you wrecked my room
And I've got nothin' to do and neither do you
So we'll chase Jack with love and waste away the whole afternoon

I overheard that she was nineteen
Got a fake ID and a nose ring
Those kind of girls tend to know things
Better than I do
And I'm dying
To figure out what she's hiding
She's playing it cool but she's lying
Better than I do
