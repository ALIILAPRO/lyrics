		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you be my ba ba-by (You make me
Sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick) , ooh
If-if had more money, love?
Would you be my ba ba-by, ooh
If-if had more money, love?
Fuck you-fuck you-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck
You, shady

Would you be my baby if I said it? (Said it)
I want you, so, please, don't dead it
(Don't dead it)
Hoes tryin' to interfere us, don't let it
Walk with a smile
And I'm giving you the credit
Like, uh, tell me your feelings
I'll tell you mine (Mine)
Twin flames, no thots, and no other lines
(Lines)
You can't trust, and I get it, girl
That's alright
You divine, take the shade from my moonlight
Would you be my baby if I said it?
(Don't dead it)

I want you, so, please, don't dead it
Hoes tryin' to interfere us, don't let it
Walk with a smile
And I'm giving you the credit
Like, uh, tell me your feelings
I'll tell you mine (Mine)
Twin flames, no thots, and no other lines
(Lines)
You can't trust, and I get it, girl
That's alright
You divine, take the shade from my moonlight

Take my hand, let's fly to the moon
(I'll be there for you)
My heart's cold, but warm around you
(Forever) feel the vibe
It gets right when it's me and you
If you leave, girl
I know I'll be missing you
Shootin' shots left and right, girl
I'm needin' you (Girl, I need you)
Take your clue
'cause you so what I'm seein' through
(Ha)
Promise you I won't dip if you feelin' blue
(Uh, uh) i know I could be crazy, but

Girl, you got me spinning round and round
I don't understand why you never talk it out
I don't want to get away from
You 'cause it hurts me too
(You never cared about me, hello?)
Girl, you got me spinning round and round
I don't understand why you never talk it out
I don't want to get away from
You 'cause it hurts me too
(Bitch, probably not, but one, two, three)

Could I call you mine
And can you call me yours?
I never felt this way, but
If the time's not right
Then I'll wait for you
But if you can't, then I don't blame you
Of course
It's gonna hurt, but that's life
And I need to move on 'cause
I can't be stuck on you
It won't help my mental
It's just goin' to make me miss you more
Why the fuck I got to text first
Just to get a text back?
You don't put the same
Energy into our convos
I'm the only one puttin' in work
But I'm still attached
And it's hard to leave the ones you
Love when you know it won't last
And you'll never stop lovin' someone
Even if it's way in the past
And you can never keep
Chasin' the person you
Love if they don't love you back

Would you be my ba ba-by
(Fuck you, Shady) , ooh
If-if had more money, love?
Would you be my ba ba-by (You make me
Sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick) , ooh
If-if had more money, love?
