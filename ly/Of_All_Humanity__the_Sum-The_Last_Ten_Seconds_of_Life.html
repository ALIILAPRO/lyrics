		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One stitch undone
And the cosmos gave way
Flashing visions of the unseen
Today is the day
Ashes to anguish
Now this is your punishment
Ashes to anguish
Struck down
Now this is your punishment
Dust to dying and back to dust
Time's up
Laugh at existence and take a bow
Just containers of souls
Ate up and spit out
Ancient truths have been sung through the trees
But not for me
Modern day son
Modern day scum
Only solution's blood for blood
That's a fuckin' fact
Now that it's opened up yeah there's no goin' back
Sick sad gospel created by man
Ate up
Spit out
To be
Struck down
This is your punishment
Bite the bullet
Ate up to be spit out
Ashes to anguish and dust to dust
Fuck it
Now this is your punishment
Ashes to anguish
Struck down
Now this your punishment

From dust to dying and back to dust
Time's up
One stitch undone
And the cosmos opened up
The truth will set you free
Of all humanity, the sum
Of all humanity, the sum
For all humanity death will be
Seraphim denied
Archaic disconnect
Confined to mortal flesh
Beyond the veil
Soul disemboweled
Upon godhead spat
Eviscerated rebirth
All will be revealed now
This is your punishment
Now this is your punishment
Ate up to be spit out
