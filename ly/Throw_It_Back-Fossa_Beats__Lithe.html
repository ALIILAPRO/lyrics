		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know it's been a while, baby
You know you been looking fine lately
Runnin' through my mind all day, yeah
Memories fading, mmm
I know you've been moving too cautious
Blame it on me, I'm honest
I ain't really tryna cut corners

Way you throw it back, it remind me of
All them other times that we never made up
Know I fucked around, I just want your love

Shorty wanna change, change
Change, yeah, yeah, Mmm
Shorty wanna change, change, change, I know

Mmm, she don't want the same thing
Cut deep, hit a nerve, now she nursin'
Long nights, hit the road, now I'm swervin'
I've been down, I've been out
I've been hurtin'
I know you'vе been hurt, yeah
Know I did you wrong, but I'ma learn, yeah
Know you need somе time, get
Out the dirt, yeah, Yeah
Yeah, know you need some time
Get out the dirt

Way you throw it back, it remind me of
All them other times that we never made up
Know I fucked around, I just want your love

Shorty wanna change, change
Change, yeah, yeah, Mmm
Shorty wanna change, change, change, I know

(M-m-m) You don't owe me nothing
(M-m-m) You don't owe me nothing, oh yeah
(M-m-m) Can you just let me try?
Can you just let me slide? Yeah
(M-m-m) Give me just one more time
Or we're finna lose all this time

Way you throw it back, it remind me of
All them other times that we never made up
Know I fucked around, I just want your love

Shorty wanna change, change
Change, yeah, yeah, Mmm
Shorty wanna change, change, change, I know

Shorty wanna change, change
Change, yeah, yeah, Mmm
Shorty wanna change, change, change, I know
