		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days I'm lonely
And some days I'm not
Some days I am only
A little bit sad, not a lot

How do you?
How do you make a home?
What to do?
Cause I never stay too long

Every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been running 'round trying to find a place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

Some days feel empty
And some days feel whole
Some day we can be in the same city
Some day we'll be grown and I'll be

Fine with packing up
Cardboard boxes filled and sad farewells
And I'll be fine with that goodbye
As long as I don't say goodbye to you as well

Cause every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been running 'round trying to find a place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

Let's rent a place
Two rooms and a window facing
Buildings and fire escapes
Might be no AC
A little bit cramped, but see if
I'm with you it's okay

Me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight
