		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Blanco Brown)
I let that sunshine shine on me
I'm in my tackle box, I brought my favorite Yeti
I got that new shine on me
Just take a little sip and do that Broadway dip

These are the sounds of a '85 Chevy with old 12's in the back
Rollin' on them twenties, drunk alone
I got my Nike Spurs and red Solo
Saw this pretty thing, she caught my eye
Used to wait up by the phone all night
She used to live in a country bar
What's better than a country star? The jingle in her eye

I got that sunshine shine on me
I'm in my tackle box, I brought my favorite Yeti
I got that new shine on me
Just take a little sip and do your Broadway dip

Body built like a guitar, I love her curves
She does it though, I do-si-do, we out the door
Baby, I'm hers, hers
And my heart beats like a heavy Chevy

Little miss pretty thing, she caught my eye
Won't have to wait up by the phone that night
She used to live in a country bar
But now she sittin' in my truck
Still got that fire in her eyes

I got that sunshine shine on me
I'm in my tackle box, I brought my favorite Yeti
I got that new shine on me
Just take a little sip, do your Broadway dip

I got that sunshine shine on me
I'm in my tackle box, brought my favorite Yeti
I got that new shine on me, yeah
Just take a little sip and do that Broadway dip

To the left, to the left, uh uh
To the right, to the right, now stop
To the left, to the left, uh uh
To the right, to the right, now hop
Take that sip, Broadway dip, do-si-do out the door

I love that sunshine shine on me
I'm in my tackle box, brought my favorite Yeti
I got that new shine on me
Just take a little sip and do that Broadway dip
