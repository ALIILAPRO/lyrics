		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma hit the club, throw it, throw it, throw it back
When I look this good, I just wanna be bad
I know you probably heard this but you never heard that
Did they tell you?

I might be out my mind
Or I might be the reason you came in here tonight
It ain't no fun if you don't cross the line
Come and get adic-dic-dic-dic-dicted one more time
Show me how your body feels on mine

(I might be out my mind)
(Or I might be the reason you came in here tonight)
(It ain't no fun if you don't cross the line)
(Come and get adic-dic-dic-dic-dicted one more time)
(Show me how your body feels on mine)

I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
I'ma hit the club, throw it back, throw it back, back, back
I'ma hit the club, I'ma, I'ma hit the club
Throw it back, back, back, back, back
I'ma hit the club, I, I'ma hit the club
Throw it back, back, back, back, back
I'ma hit the club, I'ma hit the club
Baby, show you how

I'ma hit the club, throw it back, back, back
Drinking skinny margaritas but that ass still fat
Don't stand on the wall, motherfucker, work that back, back
Did they tell you?

I might be out my mind
Or I might be the reason you came in here tonight
It ain't no fun if you don't cross the line
Come and get adic-dic-dic-dic-dicted one more time
Show me how your body feels on mine, on mine, on mine

(I might be out my mind)
(Or I might be the reason you came in here tonight)
(It ain't no fun if you don't cross the line)
(Come and get adic-dic-dic-dic-dicted one more time)
(Show me how your body feels on mine)

I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
I'ma hit the club, throw it back, throw it back, back, back
I'ma hit the club, I'ma, I'ma hit the club
Throw it back, back, back, back, back
I'ma hit the club, I, I'ma hit the club
Throw it back, back, back, back, back
I'ma hit the club, I'ma hit the club
Baby, show you how
