		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't we take it to another level
We're just stuck here in the middle
We promised we would never settle
I need more than half of your heart

Take our love to
Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level
Take it to another level

Why don't we take it to another level
It feels like we're just stuck here in the middle
Remember how we promised we would never settle
I need more than half of your heart

Take our love to
Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level
Take it to another level, yeah

Always knew that we had something
Now it feels like we're just stalling
I don't want us to fade to nothing
I need more than half of your heart, oh

No one said this would be easy
Let's not make it harder than we need it to be
Uh, I'm telling you just what I'm feelin'
I need you by my side
So why don't we take our love to

Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level
Take it to another level

Why don't we take it to another level
It feels like we're just stuck here in the middle
Remember how we promised we would never settle
I need more than half of your heart

Take our love to
Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level oh-oh
Another level, another level
Take it to another level
Why don't we take it to another level
