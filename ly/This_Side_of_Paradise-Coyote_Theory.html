		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask me why my heart's inside my throat
I've never been in love, I've been alone
Feel like I've been living life asleep
Love so strong it makes me feel so weak

Are you lonely?
(Are you lonely?)
Our fingers dancing when they meet
You seem so lonely
(Are you lonely?)
I'll be the only dream you seek
So if you're lonely, no need to show me
If you're lonely come be lonely with me

Lonely 
(Are you lonely?)
Passion is crashing as we speak
You seem so lonely
(Are you lonely?)
You're the ground my feet won't reach
So if you're lonely, darling you're glowing
If you're lonely come be lonely with me

Underneath the pale moonlight
Dreaming of a circus life
Carousels and Ferris heights
I'll be yours if you'll be mine

'Cause I'm lonely, I'm so lonely
If you hold me, I'll be your only

Are you lonely?
(Are you lonely?)
Our fingers dancing when they meet
You seem so lonely
(Are you lonely?)
I'll be the only dream you seek
So if you're lonely, no need to show me
If you're lonely, come be lonely with me

Are you lonely?
Passion is crashing as we speak
You seem so lonely
You're the ground my feet won't reach
So if you're lonely
Darling you're glowing
If you're lonely come be lonely with me
