		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wear the burden
World on your shoulders, babe
So let me hold the weight
I know you're hurting
Deep as the coldest pain
But this is the order sayin'

I'm gonna show you everything's alright
End of the tunnel, there is always light
You're in the middle of the darkest night
I know you're hurting, babe
Whenever you look at me with those

Those sad eyes
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes
I'll make it right, so don't cry
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes
I'll make it right

Under the streetlights
You turned and said to me
That you're no good for me
That was the first lie
You've ever said to me
Oh baby, honestly

I'm gonna show you everything's alright
End of the tunnel, there is always light
You're in the middle of the darkest night
I know you're hurting, babe
Whenever you look at me with those

Those sad eyes
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes
I'll make it right, so don't cry
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes

And baby, even when your troubled tears are falling
Darling, you should know you still look beautiful
Sad eyes
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes
I'll make it right

Mm
Everything will be alright, I swear
Everything will be alright, I swear
Everything will be alright, I swear
Oh

Those sad eyes
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes
I'll make it right, so don't cry (so don't cry, baby)
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes

And baby, even when your troubled tears are falling
Darling, you should know you still look beautiful (you still look beautiful)
Sad eyes (oh, sad eyes)
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes
I'll make it right

I'll make it, I'll make it right
I'll make it right, I'll make it right
I'll make it right
