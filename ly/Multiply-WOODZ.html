		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna be by your side 
Let the world know you're mine 
I love you a million times 
Lovin' you multiplied

I saw a star fly the sky today 
Wonder if you seen it, too
You feel so close but so far away
I'm missin' you 

Call me selfish
I don't mind 
I want all your time tonight 

L.A., where you be at
Night time in Korea
But you brighten up my sky 

Me and you 
One on one 
Wanna spend time with you, girl
I will fly 
Cross the sky
To be next to you, yea

Wanna be by your side 
Let the world know you're mine 
I love you a million times
Lovin' you multiplied

Baby, it's you 
That makes me wanna, wanna settle down
It's you that makes my feet lift off the ground
I love you a million times 
Lovin' you multiplied

Baby I apologize and girl, I get it, yea 
Lemme catch a flight 

Baby I sympathize 
Ooh girl, I get it, yea

Need me closer by your side
Not just on the line 
I don't want no other girl, I put that on my life 
You're a real one, sho nuff
You deserve the world and more 
I can give you that for sure 

Me and you 
One on one 
Wanna spend time with you, girl
I will fly 
Cross the sky
To be next to you, wanna baby

Wanna be by your side 
Let the world know you're mine 
I love you a million times
Lovin' you multiplied

Baby, it's you 
That makes me wanna, wanna settle down
It's you that makes my feet lift off the ground
I love you a million times 
Lovin' you multiplied

Baby, when the stars align 
It will be just you and I
We'll do whatever we do
Do whatever we do 

Wanna be by your side 
Let the world know you're mine 
I love you a million times (million times)
Lovin' you multiplied (multiplied)

Baby it's you 
That makes me wanna, wanna settle down (baby, wanna settle down)
It's you that makes my feet lift off the ground
I love you a million times 

Lovin' you multiplied (multiplied, baby)
