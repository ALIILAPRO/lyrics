		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was cold outside of Tiffanys
I was shivering in the storm
I walked in and asked a gentleman
Could I plea-ease keep warm

He asked me how come a baby doll
Has no comfy place to go
So I told that kindly gentleman
My tale of woe

Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
To keep her worry free
Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
But where's the one for me

Rich or poor I don't care who
If he hasn't got a million then a half will do
Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
Could my da-daddy be you

Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
With silver in his hair
Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
Who has some gold to spare
Some sweet softy who enjoys
Bringin' home his baby little diamond toys, oh ho!
Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
Could my da-daddy be you

Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
In case she runs aground
Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
To keep her safe and sound
Yes we feel just like Red Ridin' Hood
Cause the wolves are awful hungry in our neighbourhood
Oh every baby needs a da-da-daddy
Could my da-daddy be you
Could my da-daddy be you
