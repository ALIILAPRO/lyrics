		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (You gotta be someone)
(You gotta be someone)
(You gotta be someone)
(You gotta be someone)
(You gotta be someone)
(You gotta be someone)
(You gotta be someone)

I seen you in the same place
I seen you in the rat race
Running in and out of this maze
I seen you with the same mates
When you gonna let shit change?
When you gonna use that brain?
I wanna see the shit made
Before all the lights fade
See I work 'til my back break
Shovel dirt in the back lane
Oh, it hurt with the black pain
What's the price of the small change?
I tell them that I'm okay
And I really am okay
But I need to leave this space
If they're gonna say I'm great
Questions I need to be asking, I need you here right now
Blessings I need to be answered I figured it right out
Oh, what have I learned
It pays to be there first, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna

I don't wanna see you 'round
'Cause I know you're gonna be a someone, gonna be a someone
Gonna
Still it hurts to say
Yeah, still hurts to say
I need you
I need you

I need you

I walk along this earth
Living life in reverse
I walk as it all turns
I watch as the shit burns
Oh, what have I learned?
It pays to be there first
So I'm waiting for my turn
To reach what we deserve

Oh, no, no, no
I won't go back there no more
No, no, no, no
You'll see my clothes on the floor
Oh, no, no, no
You'll see I'm ready for war
Oh, no, no, no
You know what I am here for

Take a chance at a plan
I'll be man made 'til a made man
I take a chance at a plan
I'll be man made 'til a made man
Oh, whoa, whoa-oh, whoa

Questions I have to be asking
I need you here right now
I don't wanna be around
(I don't want to be around, I don't want to be around)
If you don't tell me something
And I don't wanna see you 'round
(I don't want to see you 'round, I don't want to see you 'round)
'Cause I know you're gonna be a someone, gonna be a someone
Gonna (you're gonna be someone, you're gonna be someone)
Still it hurts to say
(You're gonna be someone, you're gonna be someone)
Yeah, still hurts to say
I need you
I need you

I need you
(I need you)
(I need you)
(I need you)
(I need you)
