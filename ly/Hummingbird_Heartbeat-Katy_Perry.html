		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time, every time when you touchin' me
I make you bloom like the flower that you never seen
Under the sun we are one buzzin' energy

Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science (science)
We call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that
Hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower, with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You gave me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

Even when seasons change
I'm still stay the same

You give me that
Hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me never love me not (no, no)
Not (no, no) oh no
When we're in perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony

Oh your wings could make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh, spread my wings and make me fly (fly)
The taste of your honey is so sweet (oh)
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat (hey)
Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat (hey yeah)
Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat (hey, hey yeah)
Ah, ah, hummingbird heartbeat
