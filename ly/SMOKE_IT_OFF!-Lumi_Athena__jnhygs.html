		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm throwin' up, watch it all fall down
I can turn a smile into a frown
Smoke it up, roll it up, let's go
Life is way easier when I'm on a roll
Talk to me, baby, I can't let go
You done stole me, stole my soul
You done stole me, stole my soul
You done stole me, stole my soul
Bye-bye

I said stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Bye-bye

Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah

Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
I see you tryna' hang with the gang, yeah
Bad lil' bitch, she like the glises on my chain, yeah
I heard you was talking, right? This, here and there, right?
I heard you was talking, right? I heard you was talking, right?
Let's party, let's party
You're tardy to the party
Let's smoke it up, let's roll it up
We party 'til we die, yeah
Bye-bye

I like hanging with crazy fans
Screamin, they like takin' off their pants
That lean got me like, oh
They singing my song like, oh
I said stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold

Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Bye-bye
