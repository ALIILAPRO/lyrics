		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I brush these shackles off the wind
with a drunken insomniac frown
A never-ending repetition
to melt the frozen sun

And there is no victory
There is no loss
The ones that I love are safe
from the horrors I keep
There is no victory
There is no loss
No joy but the dawn of peace

My courage is crashing
on the breeze
and dark is the moon
through the trees
In perfect silence,
in hopeless defeat
I'll own my pain
and put down my feet

And there is no victory
There is no loss
The ones that I love are safe
from the horrors I keep
There is no victory
There is no loss
No joy but the dawn of peace
