		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast
I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree

Sing!
Dap-dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dap-didili-da

I'm sittin' here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder

Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree

I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder, wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree
