		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm

You saying baby, "I'll take you for a ride"
Let's get together, work it all night
I'll be your lover, your sexy little thing
I'll make you feel like heaven is near

Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm, rrrak!

Come on girl believe me I'll make you see
That I am the true way to ecstasy
Touch me, feel me, then you will find
That we are meant to be and I ain't lying

Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm, rrrak!
(Let me think about it)
(Let me think about it)

Can I get with you, baby?
Blow your mind or whatever your like?
(Mmm mmm mmm, m-m-m)
(Let me think about it)
Think about it

You don't have to think no more
Baby, come on
Cute as the sun, cute as the sun
Cute as the sun, let's go

Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it, rrrak!

You say you want me, you say you need me
You say you love me, I can't believe it, oh!

Let me think about it
(M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm)
Baby think about it
Let me think about it
(M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm)
Baby think about it

Let me think about it
(M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm)
Baby think about it
Let me think about it
(M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm)
Baby think about it

Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it

Let me think about it
