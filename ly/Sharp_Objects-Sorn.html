		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama always said their love's a crazy game
Watched it drive her wild
Till she went insane (oh do-do-do)
Walking on the broken glass from picture frames
Guess I didn't learn my lesson from the pain (oh well)

Been told this all my life
The heart cuts deeper than a knife
It's dangerous
But I play with sharp objects
There ain't no guarantee
That loving you won't make me bleed
It's dangerous
But I play with sharp objects

Sh-sh-sharp
Sh-sh-sharp
Yeah I play with sharp objects
I'm not afraid of sh-sh-sharp
I'm not afraid of sh-sh-sharp
I'm not afraid
Yeah I play with sharp objects

Maybe it's because my tongue's a razor blade
But I can take a papercut with no Band-Aid (oh do-do-do)
If there ain't any difference (oh oh oh)
Between loving and running with scissors (oh oh oh)
Then I'm a-okay (a-okay)
'Cause that's the type of the rush I'm craving

Been told this all my life
The heart cuts deeper than a knife
It's dangerous (it's dangerous)
But I play with sharp objects
There ain't no guarantee (uh huh)
That loving you won't make me bleed (huh huh huh)
It's dangerous (it's dangerous)
But I play with sharp objects

Sh-sh-sharp (oh oh oh oh)
Sh-sh-sharp (oh oh oh oh oh)
Yeah I play with sharp objects
I'm not afraid of sh-sh-sharp
I'm not afraid of sh-sh-sharp
I'm not afraid
Yeah I play with sharp objects

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah, nah, nah, nah
I'm playing with sharp objects
Playing with them (nah nah nah, nah nah playing with sharp objects)
Playing with them (nah nah nah, nah nah playing, woah oh )
Nah nah nah nah nah
I'm playing with sharp objects
