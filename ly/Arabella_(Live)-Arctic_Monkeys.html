		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Arabella's got some interstellar gator-skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
Arabella
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a seventies head
But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the color of a constellation fallin' into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
As Arabella
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah-print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Askin' if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips 'round a Mexican Coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like
Woo!

I just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

I'd like to play for you now, ladies and gentleman 
The uh, title track from our new LP
Entitled, "Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino", get down
