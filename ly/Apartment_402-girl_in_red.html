		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a pain
There's no doubt
I've been through hell
But on my way out

And all the ways I've been torn
Stripped my heart to the core
All of my fears combined
Walking the thinnest of lines

When the sunlight hits the dust
And I can't get up
When the noise is way too much
I close the void and burn it off
But there's a crack in every wall
Is there a way out after all?
If I lose my grip and fall will I?

There's a place
With no hate
Touched by grace
Quiet as faith

Emptied my heart
Laid down my cards
Played my best part
Wanting a new start
All of my fears combined
Taught me to run and hide

When the sunlight hits the dust
And I can't get up
When the noise is way too much
I close the void and burn it off
But there's a crack in every wall
Is there a way out after all?
If I lose my grip and fall will I?

There's a dissonance in all that I do
Yeah, nothing feels right or true
Black out on the floor just once more

The place I call my home
Yeah, I could die here and nobody would know
Die here and nobody would know

When the sunlight hits the dust
And I can't get up
When the noise is just too much
I close the void and burn it off
But there's a crack in every wall
Is there a way out after all?
If I lose my grip and fall
Will I die?
