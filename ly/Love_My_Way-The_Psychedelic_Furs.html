		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's an army on the dance floor
It's a fashion with a gun, my love
In a room without a door
A kiss is not enough in

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes, they'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay for laughing in their faces and making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes, there's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and take us all apart, but not in

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes, so swallow all your tears, my love
And put on your new face
You can never win or lose, if you don't run the race

Yeahhh, yeahhh, yeahhh
Aw ooh, aw ooh, aw ooh, aw ooh
