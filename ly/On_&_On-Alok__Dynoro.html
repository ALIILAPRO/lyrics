		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Body to body with you in the dark
Say that you want me
Say that you want me
Over and over

All they way up to the tip of my tongue
You're touchin' me slowly
Touchin' me slowly

I can feel your love, love
Your love, love, love breathin' inside of me
And I can feel your heartbeat
Your heart, heartbeat, beatin' inside of me

The night goes on and on and on
On and on and on

On, goes on
On and on, on and on
The night goes on, goes on
On and on, on and on

I can feel your love, love
Your love, love, love breathin' inside of me (on and on)
And I can feel your heartbeat
Your heart, heartbeat, beatin' inside of me (on and on)

Should I pull him here up on the wall?
Oh, the temptation
Oh, the temptation
Takin' me over

Your skin on mine is inevitable
I'm up for the danger
Up for the danger

I can feel your love, love
Your love, love, love breathin' inside of me
And I can feel your heartbeat
Your heart, heartbeat, beatin' inside of me

The night goes on and on and on
On and on and on

On, goes on
On and on, on and on
The night goes on, goes on
On and on, on and on

I can feel your love, love
Your love, love, love breathin' inside of me (on and on)
And I can feel your heartbeat
Your heart, heartbeat, beatin' inside of me (on and on)

The night goes on (on and on)
(On and on, on and on, on and on)
The night goes on and on and on
On and on and on
