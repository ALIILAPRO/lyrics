		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what happened
I guess you finally got me
Now you're off to somewhere
I don't know, kn-know, kn-know, know, kn-know

And I don't wanna make up
Cause I've already seen the light
Everybody fakes it
And everybody hurts sometimes

You go a long way getting your way
Sometimes
And everything's screaming

It's time we let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go

Let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
Say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go

Now every time it happens
You make it for a day and
Then you get to thinking
Oh no, n-no, no, no, n-no, n-no

But I don't wanna hear it
And I don't want a second call
Every lie is making
Me feel like

It's time to let go, let go, let go
It's time we let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go
It's time we let go, let go, let go

Let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
Say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go

You're always telling me to hold on
You're always telling me to hold on
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go

Let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
Say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go

I don't know what happened
I guess you finally got me
