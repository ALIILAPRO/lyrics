		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing on the corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset, and Jane is her vest
And me, I'm in a rock 'n roll band, ha
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim
You know, those were different times
Oh, all the poets, they studied rules of verse
And those ladies, they rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, whoa
Sweet Jane, oh-oh
Sweet Jane

I'll tell you something, Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
And both of them save their monies, ha
And when, when they come home from work
Ooh, sittin' down by the fire, oh
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah

Sweet Jane, ah, come on, baby
Sweet Jane, oh-oh
Sweet Jane

Some people, they like to go out dancing
And other peoples, they have to work, just watch me now
And there's even some evil mothers
Well, they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that women never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, ooh
And that, you know, children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die
But everyone who ever had a heart
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and hate it

Sweet Jane, oh-oh
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her when he smiles, ah
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her, hey, when she smiles

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
