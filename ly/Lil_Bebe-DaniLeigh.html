		  My lil' Bebe
Change your price tag
There's a upgrade
On a watch, yeah
Yeah, I'm all work
If you want that
Is your Rollie
Be precise, yeah
See, my lil' baby
Change your life, yeah
That's a upgrade
On your ice, yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

Night, one night
Gimme more than one night, yeah
It's all mine
When I see you on sight, yeah
On sight
It's so good you miss your flight, yeah
It's so exciting (so exciting yeah)

Been waiting to get with you
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Can't send love through a picture
(No way, no way)
Here's your chance
Baby, don't miss it
Let you tell it

I'm the best that you never had (eh)
I'm the best that you never had (ya ya ya)

My lil' Bebe
Change your price tag
There's a upgrade
On a watch, yeah
Yeah, I'm all work
If you want that
Is your Rollie
Be precise, yeah
See, my lil' baby
Change your life, yeah
That's a upgrade
On your ice, yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

Stop, I need the bag (I need the bag)
I can't go back
I won't do that
Get it straight
Nothing personal
I choose myself
Yeah, I'm first (yeah yeah, woo woo)

Been waiting to get with you
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Can't send love through a picture
(No way, no way)
Here's your chance
Baby, don't miss it
Let you tell it

I'm the best that you never had (eh)
I'm the best that you never had (ya ya ya)

My lil' Bebe
Change your price tag
There's a upgrade
On a watch, yeah
Yeah, I'm all work
If you want that
Is your Rollie
Be precise, yeah
See, my lil' baby
Change your life, yeah
That's a upgrade
On your ice, yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

Best that you never had
I'm the best that you never had
Ah
