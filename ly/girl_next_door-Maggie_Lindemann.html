		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red eyes, stumbling 'cross the road
She's still wearing the same clothes
Sipping on a cherry Coke
And I'm wondering

Whatever happened to the girl next door?
She's all grown up, she don't come home anymore
I hear them talking when she's not around
The sun goes down, she don't wanna be found
Wanna be found

I might be high or half-asleep
Maybe I'm just imagining
But it's strange how much she looks like me

Whatever happened to the girl next door?
She's all grown up, she don't come home anymore
I look at her and I'm all that I see
She's in the mirror looking back at me
Back at me

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh (back at me)
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
The girl next door is me
