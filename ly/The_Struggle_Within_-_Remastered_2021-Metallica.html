		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reaching out for something you've got to feel 
While clutching to what you had thought was real 
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you 
No way of showing your gratitude 
So many things you don't want to do 
What is it What have you got to lose 
What the hell 
What is you think you're gonna find? 
Hypocrite 
Boredom sets into the boring mind 

Struggle within it suits you fine 
Struggle within your ruin 
Struggle within you seal your own coffin 
Struggle within the struggling within 
Home is not a home it becomes a hell 
Turning it into your prison cell 
Advantages are taken, not handed out 
While you struggle inside your hell 
Reaching out 
Grabbing for something you've got to feel 
Closing in 
The pressure upon you is so real 

Struggle within it suits you fine 
Struggle within your ruin 
Struggle within you seal your own coffin 
Struggle within the struggling within 

Struggle
Go
Reaching out for something you've got to feel 
While clutching to what you had thought was real 
What the hell 
What is you think you're gonna find 
Hypocrite 
Boredom sets into the boring mind 

Struggle within it suits you fine 
Struggle within your ruin 
Struggle within you seal your own coffin 
Struggle within the struggling within
