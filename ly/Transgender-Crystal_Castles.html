		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are from the start
The chosen few
Out of the youth
Are from the start
Oh I'll lie with you out in the dew

Intimacy, real love true
Regarding a deal, is it really true?
I love you, is it really you?
'Cause I have some news for you

You
Will you ever preserve, will you ever exhume?
Will you watch petals shed from flowers in bloom?

Nothing can live up to promise
Nothing can stop its narrative
Nothing in place of catalysts
And you'll never be pure again

Are from the start
The chosen few out of the youth
Are from the start
Oh I'll lie with you out in the dew

Intimacy, real love true
Regarding a deal, is it really true?
I love you, is it really you?
Cause I have some news for you

You
Will you ever preserve, will you ever exhume?
Will you watch petals shed from flowers in bloom?

Nothing can live up to promise
Nothing can stop its narrative
Nothing in place of catalysts
And you'll never be pure again

Intimacy, real love true
Regarding a deal, is it really true?
I love you, is it really you?
'Cause I have some news for you

You
Will you ever preserve, will you ever exhume?
Will you watch petals shed from flowers in bloom?

Nothing can live up to promise
Nothing can stop its narrative
Nothing in place of catalysts

Intimacy, real love true
Regarding a deal, is it really true?
I love you, is it really you?
And you'll never be pure again
