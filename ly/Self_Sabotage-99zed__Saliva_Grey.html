		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smoking in the back, I don't know where I'm at
I do a lot of drugs, Imma die and that's a fact
Scratches on my back, shawty leak and then she tap
Smoking out the pack I ain't never gonna pass
Dying in my room with my mind stuck on you
Bad bitches hit my phone you know I'm coming through
Chopping up the script so I can die in my whip
Imma whip it off the bridge watch my civic do a flip
Running in, with my mask
Wrapping up everything and then I put it in the bag
Exit out the back, run in like track
Under all the pressure I ain't never gonna crack
Taking the pills so I don't feel anything
Because in my brain it plays all our memories
Waking up at noon I don't leave my fucking room
Swear to God really want to see myself lose
Self sabotage everyday it's the mood
Self sabotage only thing that I can do
Hit 100k I still wanna blow my brain yah
Whatchu gon' say when Saliva in the grave? I
Bet you won't say I was such a fucking waste
Tell the fucking truth tell 'em I was in the way
I don't want no material shit
Except a .38 in my grip
And one hollow to put me to bed
Night night lullaby yeah yeah
Imma die die it's alright yeah yeah
I die it's alright yeah yeah
Imma die die it's alright yeah yeah
I die it's alright yeah yeah
Smoking in the back, I don't know where I'm at
I do a lot of drugs, Imma die and that's a fact
Scratches on my back, shawty leak and then she tap
Smoking out the pack I ain't never gonna pass
