		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stranger days, stranger times
Put your hands upon your eyes
Draw the ways, draw the lines
Nothing is forever
Stranger days, stranger times
Don't believe in any lies
Draw the ways, draw the lines
Nothing is forever

It feels like we got lost among the tides
A place somewhere between the space and time

Anyway, anyhow, anything that matters
Will be like it was one day
Like the stars, like the dust, we will burst and scatter
Further and further away

Our future comes too soon
I'm so afraid to lose you
Our spirit sings in tune
So comforting and soothing

Stranger days, stranger times
Put your hands upon your eyes
Draw the ways, draw the lines
Nothing is forever
Stranger days, stranger times
Don't believe in any lies
Draw the ways, draw the lines
Nothing is forever
