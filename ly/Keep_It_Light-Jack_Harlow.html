		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm everythin' that I said I'd be
Everythin' that I bet I be
All the kids that I grew up with
They see me out and congratulate me
Couple of 'em just graduated
Couple of 'em done had a baby
But all of them look at my life and say, "That's amazin'"
I say, "Thank you" like twenty times
Try to talk about somethin' else
Reminisce on some funny time
Truthfully I'm not comfortable with gettin' all the praise
Even more when y'all get to drinkin'
And start tellin' me all the thin's that you really think
Like what I should've done differently
What you think of my energy
The downsides that come with bein' friends with me
I can tell you think this the realest that anybody's ever been with me
But luckily I got PG
And luckily I keep them with me

I keep it humble so you can have a good time
I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine
And I sleep at night just fine
I tried to be kind, now I'm speakin' my mind

Time (ah)
I like how you got the vocals
Just make 'em like a little less harsh
That's the only thing
But it's in that good world
In my time (ah)
In my time (ah)
Right here? Look
(La m√∫sica de Harry Fraud)

Once people lose touch with ya
They start to hate ya
Start to show you they true nature
Start to be the ones in the comments
That's talkin' 'bout you like you a stranger
Talkin' 'bout ya like y'all didn't have class together
Talkin' like you not humble now or you actin' better
Speakin' on the things you've done that they haven't ever
I play the game, you watch the game, like Adam Schefter
I created this added pressure
I'm the one that made jack get better
Tone it down? I could never, ooh
All the greats caught all the hate
All the rappers I love the most at one point got called a fake
Everybody seem to know the song that I oughta make
Know the route that I oughta take
I put too much work in to just call it fate

But I keep it humble so you can have a good time
I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine
And I sleep at night just fine
I tried to be kind, now I'm speakin' my mind

Time (ah)
I told your brother this, so I'ma tell you this
This is probably advice that I've been givin' you frequently
I probably will continue to give it to you frequently because it's made a difference in my life
Take some moments today durin' the shoot to look around
Look at the faces of all the people you've brought together
Watch their reactions, look at the joy on their faces
Take a moment to really absorb what you've created, what you're creating and try to savor it
I know that you and I are built the same and that it's never enough
There's always some other thing we want to accomplish, but
Just lean back for a moment today and really comprehend the greatness that you've made
Love you, babe
