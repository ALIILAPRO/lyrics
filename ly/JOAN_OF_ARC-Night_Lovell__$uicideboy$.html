		  Ay, yes, ay, yah, ay, ay
Fatality

Tell me that she wanna ride me through the night then call me back
I like how she riding 'cause she take that shit all in that back
I got bands in my pants and I'm dancing
I'm like man, you a fan, why you snapping?
By the place, so I'm like baby, you my novocaine
I don't even know you, swear to god, bitch, how you know my name?
I'm like damn, why you mad? I'm the god, nigga
I'm so sorry, check that shawty, she's a gold digger

I don't give a fuck, never cleaning up
Bitch my blood is mud, never clean it up
Enter the chamber of love, set it on fire and run
Bitch, I'm a sub when it come to the drugs
I was sent here to get fucked up and then die
You don't want me bitch and if you say you do then you lyin'
I ain't a socialite, I'm staying home tonight
Maybe another line, shawty give me dome I'm high
Never thinking with a sober mind
So I might guess that she left me for the same reason she loved me
Sold her fucking those and now she don't trust me
Slapped me across my face, she say Ruby you disgusting
Baby girl, I got money, ain't no need for discussing
Told me never call her back and I don't think she bluffin'

Tell me that she wanna ride me through the night then call me back
I like how she riding 'cause she take that shit all in that back
I got bands in my pants and I'm dancing
I'm like man, you a fan, why you snapping?
By the place, so I'm like baby, you my novocaine
I don't even know you, swear to god, bitch, how you know my name?
I'm like damn, why you mad? I'm the god nigga?
I'm so sorry, check that shawty

Yuh, yuh, cradle to the grey, I cradle in my grave
Flick your ash, brain on drugs, I can't get no peace of mind
I can't lie it fucking hurts, I was designed to shine
Now I'm popping bars, 'til my brain fogs, drop like a phone line
Don't speak, we just squeeze, bitch on her knees
I might put my mind at ease, begging to god I don't believe
Give me relief, on this grief
No sleep, I can't eat
Light getting dimmer and dimmer
Call me selfish, blow my brains out now I'm gone forever
