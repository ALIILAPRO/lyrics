		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

We gon' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say, she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo ingl√©s"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Y'all don't from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

Why you come here
I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found
See I'm often at your cross ways
Forgetting it was that Heaven let ya
They'd tried to bring me down

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
Always knew that one day, they'd tried to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down, down down, down down, no no no
