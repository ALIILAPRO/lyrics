		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
Delicate are the colors piercing through
As they bloom

Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
As they bloom
Razor sharp flowers as they bloom

What makes you miserable
It'll creep up and destroy you
If you breathe it in
Like a fume in the toxic night
In field with the beauty and the poison

Don't let it seduce you
Don't let it sting you
Oh it wants to fool you 
It deadly when you touch

Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
Delicate are the colors piercing through
As they bloom

Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
As they bloom
Razor sharp flowers as they bloom

What makes you vulnerable
Will always eat inside you
The prettiest petals are the sharpest thorns
They always know what they're looking for
Blinded by the beauty I don't' know anymore
I don't know anymore, I don't know

Don't let it seduce you
Don't let it sting you
Oh it wants to fool you
It deadly when you touch

Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
Delicate are the colors piercing through
As they bloom

Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
As they bloom
Razor sharp flowers as they bloom

Oh look around 
How can something be so beautiful
Oh pierce me now

Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
Delicate are the colors piercing through
As they bloom

Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
As they bloom
Razor sharp flowers as they bloom
