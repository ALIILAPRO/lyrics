		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back in the day,I used to
look up to the sky all day
The colors after the storm
The stars that almost
going to fall
The way back home
with full of tears
The color of sunset
The smell of night
Even the sound of my bag
Those songs, too
Days that I can't forget
I dreamed to be a bird
so I can fly high
So I could fly to
reach the highest sky
I could've catch the stars
with my hands
So I can have my own star
I just kept running on
I just kept smiling on
Everything in my
sight was shining
Back in the day
I never thought of running away
from where I was
I never thought of
fading out from here
I guess I'm the one
that has changed
I am not the same anymore
Coz even now, the sky that I
see from this same old place
Is stil glittering so blue
I'm the one that has changed
Now I can't remember anymore
The sky that I've seen
The songs that I loved
Like I use to do
Maybe I guess Ican't fly anymore
Can't fly anymore

What is most precious
in this life?
You can pick up the things
you have dropped on the way
And you can make again
the things you have lost
How deeply you regret
This sky will be blue
until eternity
What's most precious in life,
is you to stay as you are
is you to stay as you are
I'm the one that has changed
I am not the same anymore
Coz even now, the sky that
I see from this same old place
Is still glittering so blue
I'm the one that has changed
Now I can't remember anymore
The sky that I've seen
The songs that I loved
Like I use to do
I guess I can't fly
Even if you can't fly
Even if you left it all behind
Even the scenery
don't look the way it used to be
Even the shape of your
heart has changed
You don't have to cry
Nothing's gonna change the way
you are forever
Nothing's gonna change the way
you are forever
