		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cutest girl behind my door
Everybody's hiding in love from war
The beauty broke down their chains somehow
Who's gonna living on my body now?

A growing pain within my pop divine
Will I ever regret the line?
Switching on the light
I will not reassign
Girlfriend's girlfriends never could be mine

Drop her white pants wide open warm
Now she's slipping on her uniform
And every second would become so mis-defined
Girlfriend's girlfriends never could be mine

What can I do?
What can I say?
Choose your weapon, time to pay
Forget about the second day
We could be friends
With a kiss in flow
Choose your weapon, time to go
A military fashion show

Cutest girl asked for more
Unfortunately, someone's creeping on my floor
An empty glass, a topless babe, a knock on the door
Girlfriend's girlfriends never could be more

What can I do?
