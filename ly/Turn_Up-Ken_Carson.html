		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm turnt up with my bitch (turnt)
I'm turnt up with my gang, yeah (turnt)
I'm turnt up with my clique (turnt)
I turned up on the lame ho
I bussed down my neck and wrist (turn up)
Turn up to my shit (turn up)
Make this bitch moshpit (turn up)

(Turn up, turn up)
Turn up to my shit, yeah (turn up)
Make that bitch moshpit, yeah (turn up, turn up)
My diamonds hit won't miss, uh-uh
(Turn up)

Say you going dumb but I'm going dumber (turn up)
I'm turning up all summer (turn up)
My gang we turnt, my opps they burnt
I crashed a SRT
I tried to drift the curb
I'm rolling and I'm geeked
But no I'm not a nerd
Miu Miu right on my feet (turn up)

Alexan on my shirt
And you can't turn up with me
If yo' swag not observed
Them bitches look at me 
They like, "His swag off the Earth"
Boy, you ain't got no clothes
Yo' swag I ain't never heard of it
My swag one of my purposes
My swag got me turnt
My swag got me lit
Yo' swag ain't get you nowhere
Yo' swag ain't get you shit
My bitch ain't going nowhere
She know that I'm the shit
These niggas don't wanna go there
'Cause I walk around with that stick
Fucked the bitch out right at the hotel
I'm at the Waldorf not the Ritz
He only go shopping when it's on sale
I'm in Balenciaga wit' yo' bitch
She used to buy her clothes on wholesale
Now I got her draped up in Givenchy
I'm too turnt up for these bitches
I'm too turnt up for these niggas
I'm too turnt

I'm turnt up with my bitch (turnt)
I'm turnt up with my gang, yeah (turnt)
I'm turnt up with my clique (turnt)
I turned up on the lame ho
I bussed down my neck and wrist (turn up)
Turn up to my shit (turn up)
Make this bitch moshpit (turn up)

(Turn up, turn up)
Turn up to my shit, yeah (turn up)
Make that bitch moshpit, yeah (turn up, turn up)
My diamonds hit won't miss, uh-uh
(Turn up)

Say you going dumb but I'm going dumber (turn up)
I'm turning up all summer (turn up)
