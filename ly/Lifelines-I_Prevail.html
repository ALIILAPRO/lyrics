		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I open my eyes and see the lines that live on the life I left behind
I feel disconnected from the place that I call home
When I try rewind I can't design, a way to go back to that place and time
I remember that moment that changed everything I know
(Everything I know)

Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Who's gonna be there to make me whole?
I can't stop the bleeding
Looking for a meaning
Throw me a line and bring me back home
Won't you say something, say something
I can't do this alone
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Throw me a line and bring me back home

(I live with all the goodbyes, doesn't matter how hard I try)
(They end in long nights spent up looking back on my life)
I feel disconnected from the place that I call home
(They hit me from the blind side, caught me in the blink of an eye)
(Just like a landmine going off inside my mind)
I remember the moment that changed everything I know
Everything I know

Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Who's gonna be there to make me whole?
I can't stop the bleeding
Looking for a meaning
Throw me a line and bring me back home
Won't you say something, say something
I can't do this alone
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Throw me a line and bring me back home
(Back home, back home, back home, back home)

This life can cut like a knife, it leaves lines and divides

This life can cut like a knife, it leaves lines that divide a before and an after

Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Who's gonna be there to make me whole?
I can't stop the bleeding
Looking for a meaning
Throw me a line and bring me back home
Won't you say something, say something, now (I can't do this alone)
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Throw me a line and bring me back home

When I open my eyes and see the lines (I see the lines)
That live on the life I left behind (I see the lines)
