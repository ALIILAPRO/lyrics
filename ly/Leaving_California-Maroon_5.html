		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got in so late
It's Sunday morning
Said that you were leaving
Letting go of us
Where did we go wrong, oh
And now you say you're leaving California
Gotta head back East and want to leave tonight
Pack your things and go, oh
But if you run away
I won't be alright

Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light
Stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah

Pick up all the pieces
Fight to hold on
Put them back together, do it all for love, oh
Never let it go
Oh yeah, hm
'Cause I don't need a reason
Just to hold ya
Wipe all of your tears and
Look you in the eyes, oh
Oh baby please don't go
Oh yeah
But if you run away 
I won't be alright

Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light
Stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah

Now you say you're leaving California
