		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't keep loving your nor can I stop
Once I leave your gaze,I return to drown In your eyes
Through the murkiest darkness your smile
Guides me to safety like a lighthouse
This is the beginning of the end of my lonely days
I wasn't alive until I've met you
 
Dock my boat on the land of life that is yet to come
Hide me in your eyes for I have no friend but you
My days of wondering the lonely seas are over
For I have you as a harbor for my sunken heart
 
The nightmares in my sleep torment me causing me to scream
I'm Running away from my memories
I'm scared of the past to return
And nervous of what tomorrow might bring
I wake to your voice and touch
Feeling as if have been resurrected, born anew
You're my medicine and all I wish for
You're the angel approaching from afar
 
Dock my boat on the land of life that is yet to come
