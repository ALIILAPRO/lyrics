		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a full-blown problem
Lucky I'm your baby's father
Got that ooh, so proper 
And I'm thankful for your mama
Got that two-step popping
You're a melody, babe

Skyline baby blue
Still catching feelings for you
Feeling for you

You feel like summer, baby
Heating up my body
Too much tequila
Now we're dancing in the lobby
Know every inch upon that body 
But the feeling is new
Still catching feelings for you

Underworld voodoo, babe, supernatural sugarcane
Overdrive all the way, hypersonic ricochet
In my head every day, like a melody, babe

Skyline baby blue
Still catching feelings for you
Feelings for you (hey)

You feel like summer, baby
Heating up my body
Too much tequila
Now we're dancing in the lobby
Know every inch upon that body 
But the feeling is new
Still catching feelings for you

Feels for you, feelings for you (hey)
I'm catching feels for you, feelings for you
Catching feels for you, feelings for you
Feelings for you

You feel like summer, babe
You feel like summer, babe
Still catching feelings for you

You feel like summer, baby
Heating up my body
Too much tequila
Now we're dancing in the lobby
Know every inch upon that body 
But the feeling is new, yea-yeah
Still catching feelings for you

Still catching
I'm still catching those feelings
I'm catching, baby
Now when I go to the right
Yeah, you go to the left
I'm catching feels
Feels for you, yeah
Now when I go to the right
Yeah, you go to the left
I'm catching feels
