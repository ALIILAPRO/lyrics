		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

Didn't I tell you
What I believe?
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last?
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby?

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

I keep crying (I keep crying)
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I, baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

When you came my way (my way)
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile

Didn't I tell you
What I believe?
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last?
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby?

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

I keep crying (I keep crying)
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I, baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
Keep flying for you
Keep flying, I'm falling (falling, falling, falling)

Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
Keep flying for you
Keep flying, I'm falling (falling, falling, falling)

And I'm falling (falling, falling)
