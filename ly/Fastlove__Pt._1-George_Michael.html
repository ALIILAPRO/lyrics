		  Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get (gotta get up)
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get (gotta get up)
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down

Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
What's there to think about, baby?
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Hey, baby, oh yeah
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
But I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details, baby
Gonna get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
That's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Yeah, what's there to think about, baby?
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
Get yourself some lessons in love
Ooh-ooh, baby, baby

Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
So close
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Taste it now, baby
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
So close
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down

In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me (stupid Cupid keeps on calling me)
But I see loving in his eyes
I miss my baby (oh yeah)
I miss my baby (tonight)
So why don't we make a little room in my BMW, babe?
Searching for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

Oh, you really oughta get up now
That's right (that's right)
Oh, you really oughta get up

Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Oh yeah
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Oh yeah
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Oh yeah
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down

Looking for some affirmation
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
