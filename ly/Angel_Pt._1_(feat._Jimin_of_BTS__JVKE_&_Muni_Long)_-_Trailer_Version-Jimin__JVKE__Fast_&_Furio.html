		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'll pull you down eventually
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want not what you need
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things

I give it all up to ease your pain
Yeah, I would do that all day
I step back from the game to keep you out of harm's way
Would risk it all for the game, but it take more than one person
Two people, one 'til I feel the same way you hurtin'
I was still in middle school when Givens had flipped the whip
Bodies were droppin' before we ever knew 'bout the drip
We gon' be family no matter what way this go, brother
From the ugly corner where everybody betray each other
