		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rolling around like a big rubber ball
Writing this song about some things that I saw
Trying to stand like a big strong tough man
Finding out fast that I'm sinking in sand

All I got is nothing but
A little bit of love and gonna
Give it to the people then they'll
See, then they'll see

Spinning the tops as the tables they turn
Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn
Riding the tracks but I was fine
Got no self control now I'm back here in line

All I got is nothing but
A little bit of love and gonna
Give it to the people then they'll
See, then they'll see
