		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, there little honey, won't you groove?
I've been trying all night to dance with you
Hey there little lonely, won't you stay?
I said, "I would rather die than feel this pain"

You said, "I know, I feel very much the same
But I am afraid that I don't know, knowing's not my thing"
But I would like to dance with you
Awkwardly in haze, to this little tune

It goes

I said, "Hey there little honey, won't you groove?"
I've been trying all night to dance with you
I said, "Hey there little lonely, won't you stay?"
I said, "I would rather die than feel this pain"

Then you said, "I know, I feel very much the same
But I am afraid that I don't know, knowing's not my thing"
But I'm sure, I want to be with you
Awkwardly in haze, to our little tune

It goes, ah
It goes, ah
It goes, ah
It goes, ah

Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well I know I'm sure

But I know
Well I know
