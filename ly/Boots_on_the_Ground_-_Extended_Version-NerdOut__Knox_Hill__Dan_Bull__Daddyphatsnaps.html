		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm imbued with the spirit
Of the English Tommy dunno my kill count
It's bigger than the fingers on me
Imma sing a song for the
Memory that lingers on
When everything is gone and makes
Grown men scream for mommy
You've never seen a zombie
Until you've seen your best friend
Trying to scoop his intestines back
Into his bleeding tummy
Muffled battle tunes
Hum and rattle through the shrapnel wounds
Crushing out the fluid of the fruit's
Of war like apple juice

Thickly trickle all down the tricolour
Flag that's in tatters
Its fabric is ragged and haggard
Telling a France that is shattered
That there's still a thread of
Hope somewhere through the telescope
It's difficult to tell it though
Invisible there's hella smoke
That'll envelop and choke a
Delicate bloke into silence
So telling a joke is a
Method of coping with violence
You're thrown into darkness when even
The stars are going out
Fifty million little candles, blown out

This is it, you already know
It's okay, just get ready, go
Your life, gotta lay it down
Ain't no time to play around
Everybody say it loud:

I sacrifice myself
I commit to the cause, no hesitation
Fight, 'til there's no one left
I am leading the charge against a nation
Ain't gonna die
Fighting in a war that I am bound
Aim for the sky
But I'm keeping my boots on the ground

Gotta get my mind right
Mission: storm the beach of Normandy
Sent a letter to my family
And told them orally
Before I left that I'd be coming back
So we can normally return to our routine
Resume the spot that I was formerly
This isn't what I do the majority of the time
I am morally intact, abnormal to me the grime
But these are different days
I grab my weapon clammily
Insanity is war, but I do it for my family
Focus on the task
Block the chatter and profanity
Of other soldiers on the craft
Screaming of calamity
Disappear into a canopy of tragic fantasies
Where I don't make it back
Getting crushed by the gravity
Of that reality
I won't put them through the agony
Of growing up without a father
Teach them how a man should be
Pull yourself together, soldier
Heart is beating rapidly
And if you're gonna survive
You're gonna need a strategy

Knuckle up, it's time
You're pushing through the casualty
Keep your aim true
Turn them into shooting galleries
Unleashing a battery
You don't need no cavalry this is war
And we're fighting for our families

I sacrifice myself
I commit to the cause, no hesitation
Fight, 'til there's no one left
I am leading the charge against a nation
Ain't gonna die
Fighting in a war that I am bound
Aim for the sky
But I'm keeping my boots on the ground
