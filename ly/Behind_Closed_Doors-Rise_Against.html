		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chairs thrown and tables toppled,
Hands armed with broken bottles,
Standing no chance to win but,
We're not runnin', we're not runnin'.

There's a point I think we're missin',
It's in the air we raise our fists in,
In the smiles we cast each other,
My sister, my brother.

About the time we gave up hope and
We never find these locks still open,
Stumbling on stones unturned,
The hurt we feel, we all have found.

The lines we've crossed in search of change, but all they see is treason

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.

Bonfires burn like beacons,
Guiding the lost and weakened.
Flames dance on crashing waves,
Guiding ships who've gone a stray

Time out, let's stop and think this through,
We've all got better things to do,
A talk in circles run in place,
Answers inches from my face.

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.

Black eyes, broken fingers,
Blood drips and I let it run down my lips and to my swollen gums
When hope is non-existent,
Our instincts all scream, "Run",
We never turn our backs or even bite our tongue.

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.
