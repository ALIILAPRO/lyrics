		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bum ba dum, bum ba dum
Bum ba dum, yeah, yeah

One day I don't wanna wake up
Wondering, wondering where'd all the time go?
One day I don't wanna be stuck
With a page full of plans that I made no time for
It's been a minute
Yeah, we talk about life but I wanna live it
I wanna live it with you

Whatever, whatever you wanna do
Down for whatever as long as it's you
Nothing but time, we've got nothing to lose
Down for whatever as long as it's you
When you're with me nowhere I'd rather be, yeah, yeah
Whatever, whatever you wanna do
Down for whatever as long as I'm here with you
Bum ba dum, bum ba dum
Bum ba dum, yeah, yeah

Someday, on a runway
With a couple one-ways somewhere they can't find us
I know that we've been stressed out but we're set now
And I wanna put it all behind us
It's been a minute
Yeah, we talk about life but I wanna live it
So give me a minute with you, with you

Whatever, whatever you wanna do
Down for whatever as long as it's you
Nothing but time, we've got nothing to lose
Down for whatever as long as it's you
When you're with me nowhere I'd rather be, yeah, yeah
Whatever, whatever you wanna do
Down for whatever as long as I'm here with you
Bum ba dum, bum ba dum
Bum ba dum, yeah, yeah
Bum ba dum, bum ba dum
Bum ba dum, yeah, yeah

It's been a minute
Yeah, we talk about life but I wanna live it
So give me a minute with you, yeah
Don't wanna wake up wondering where the time went, yeah
Whatever, whatever you wanna do
Down for whatever as long as I'm here with you
