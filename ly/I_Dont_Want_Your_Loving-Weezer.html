		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are cool, you are hot
And you know what you've got
You can have anyone
When you call they will come
But I won't be a name upon your list
I have way too much pride to go for this

I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love
I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love

When I turn you away
You don't know what to say
Because nobody ever turned you down
Well I guess you'd better learn to frown, cause

I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love
I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love

Mmm, why don't you tell me goodbye
Mmm, why don't you tell me goodbye

When I turn you away
You don't know what to say
Because nobody ever turned you down
Well I guess you'd better learn to frown, cause

I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love
I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love

I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love
I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love

I don't want your love
