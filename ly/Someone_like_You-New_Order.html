		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This can't be real, my heart is burnin'
How does it feel? Well let's say I'm learnin'
It had to come, the ship has landed
It's time to run the crew are stranded

We're having a time of our lives
We're lost in a cruel paradise

Someone like you can make me feel like I used to do
Return my heart, yeah make it feel like it does at the start
Someone like you, someone like you, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You're everything to me the sweetest symphony
All that I try to be, you are my harmony
I guess what I mean to say is you keep the walls at bay
Children on holiday, here comes the crowd

We're having a time of our lives
We're lost in a cruel paradise

Someone like you can make me feel like I used to do
Return my heart, yeah, make it feel like it does at the start
Someone like you, yeah, someone like you, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
