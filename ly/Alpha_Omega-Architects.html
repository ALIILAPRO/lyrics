		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Son of god Hangman's pawn. Control our lives With fairytales and shallow lies. You say we'll burn in hell. Spiteful preacher I know you well. Desperation breathes and follows you home Look around you're not alone. One life and one chance the world in front of me. Intelligent design sending shivers down my spine. Cells mutate and divide what a sadistic intention. No light no dark. No up's no downs. I'll find peace buried in the ground. The lights go out the fuse has blown No heaven or hell to bring me home. You say we'll burn in hell. Spiteful preacher I know you well. Desperation breathes and follows you home Look around you're not alone. One life and one chance the world in front of me.  Another division to tear us apart. Try fill that hole inside your heart. Another division to tear us apart.  Try fill that hole inside your heart.  Sun of god sun in the sky. If you could speak I'm sure you'd say: \""There's more to me than meets the eye.\"" Sun of god sun in the sky. If you could speak I'm sure you'd say: \""There's more to me than meets the eye.\"" Let me say my decency comes from inside. Just human heart a decent mind We all slip up from time to time. Let me say my decency comes from inside. Just human heart a decent mind We all slip up from time to time.""
