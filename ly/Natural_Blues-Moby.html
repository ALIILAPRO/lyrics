		  Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Went down the hill, the other day
Soul got happy and stayed all day

Went down the hill, the other day
Soul got happy and stayed all day

Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Went in the room, didn't stay long
Looked on the bed and brother was dead

Went in the room, didn't stay long
Looked on the bed and brother was dead

Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
Oh Lordy, Lord, trouble so hard
