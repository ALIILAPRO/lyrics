		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight, tonight the light of love is in your eyes my darling
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I, can I believe the magic of your sighs my darling
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
O-o-o-oh
But will my heart be broken
When the dark of night meets the morning sun
(When the night meets the morning sun)
I'd like to know that your love
Is just a love, is just a love I'm sure of
So tell (so tell) me now
And I won't ask again my darling
Will you still love me
Will you still love me
Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now
And I won't ask again my darling
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
