		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Workin to be great, you know how it is
Lost a lot of friends in the process
Met a lot of snakes in the garden
Tryna navigate past my losses
Day job, five days
Monday through Friday
But I still work 25/8
What can I say?
Cause when I get home
I’m grinding, tryna, find a way, oh
Hit the west coast when I migrate, oh
I’m just tryna, buy a house in the hills
Pay respect and I pay my parents bills
Workin to be great, you know how it is
Lost a lot of friends in the process
Met a lot of snakes in the garden
Tryna navigate past my losses
It all comes down to just how bad you want it
(And I want it)
It all comes down to just how bad you want it
(And I want it)
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
Days like this, make me reminisce
On the times when it was happiness and bliss
Nowadays it’s hit or miss
But I sit back and count my chips
I don’t hold back and I can’t wait
(I don’t hold back and I can’t wait)
Put in work and pull my weight
(Put in work and pull my weight)
Catching surf, I ride my wave
Do not swerve, stay out my lane
(Do not swerve, stay out my lane)
Workin to be great, you know how it is
Lost a lot of friends in the process
Met a lot of snakes in the garden
Tryna navigate past my losses
It all comes down to just how bad you want it
(And I want it)
It all comes down to just how bad you want it
(And I want it)
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
And I want it, and I want it
