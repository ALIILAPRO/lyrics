		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me always forever
Say you'll stay never be separate

You know you've got me in your pocket
You know just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
Hard to say things could be better
Darling don't get away right now

You know you've got me in your pocket
You know just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

Oh darling it's alarming thing to think of us apart
You know you've got me in your pocket
You know just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we could settle down

You and me always forever
We could stay alone together

You and me always forever
We could stay alone together

You and me always forever
We could stay alone together

You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
