		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your red boots on
Baby, giddy up
Baby wants a dance
Baby gets her way

Dreamy nights
Talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice
I'll treat you like a holiday

And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Baby, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the 4th of July
Once, twice, three times
The guy I ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie

If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down right next to me

Get your jacket on
Be a gentleman
Get into your truck
And pick me up at eight

'Cause we were built for
The long haul freight train
Burnt by fire
Without trial like a stowaway

And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down right next to me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like ballerina super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like six times 'til I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times
The guy I ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying

If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, you lie
If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, you lie
When you lie down right next to me
