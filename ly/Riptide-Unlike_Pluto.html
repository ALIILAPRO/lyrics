		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hit me like a riptide, yeah
But I never noticed
'Cause you always kept it under disguise
Yeah lifted up the curtain, let me see
What was on the inside, yeah
All of the lies and deceit
An ugly mess you created in me
Something that you knew I could never clean
I'll handle it someday

So hit me with a riptide
If that's the way you wanna say goodbye
My anger's been on standby
So hit me with, hit me with a riptide, yeah

But hey it was an honest mistake
We'll go our separate ways
We don't need to dig our own gravestones
Push each other out 'til we're alone
These fights are taking on the same tone
Oh, it's worse if I stay
'Cause you changed my personality
I'll close the door behind me, I

So hit me with a riptide
If that's the way you wanna say goodbye
My anger's been on standby
So hit me with, hit me with a riptide, yeah

And I have already moved on
To someone who won't do me wrong
I hope that, one day, you can see
The villain you are with me
Release your hold and I'm the one in control
If the riptide comes today
You're the only one that will wash away

So hit me with a riptide
If that's the way you wanna say goodbye
My anger's been on standby
So hit me with, hit me with a riptide, yeah
