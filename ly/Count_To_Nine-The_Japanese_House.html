		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd call you up but you wouldn't understand
I never tell you anything
I never can

It's in the movements you make
It's on your breath
You're a cold blooded killer
Or so you said

When will I learn?
We are all cheated in time
And oh my god, you put me on the line
You said, "Hold your breath and count to nine"

I laid awake with the light coming in from outside
I'm feeling remnants of the face
Painted three hundred years ago on the ceiling

And it looked just like you
And for a moment I was fooled
Oh my god, you told me all the time
You said, "Hold your breath and count to nine"

You said, "Hold your breath and count to nine"
And oh my god, you put me on the line

And it looked just like you
And for a moment I was fooled
And it looked just like you
And for a moment I was fooled

You said, "Hold your breath and count to nine"
And oh my god, you put me on the line
