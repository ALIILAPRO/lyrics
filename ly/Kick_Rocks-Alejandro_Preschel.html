		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bobby and Billy robbed a bank last June
They showed up with guns and shot the place up, boom, boom
Side by side they rode away out of sight
But the devil followed them out of town that night
Kick rocks, little brother, I'm taking home this pay
Kick rocks, little brother, hope you understand some day
Time and trouble make a man go insane
Right and wrong, what difference does it make
Bobby and Billy robbed a bank last June
They came up on money, things done changed too soon
Kick rocks, little brother, I'm taking home this pay
Kick rocks, little brother, you better run or die today
Bobby shot Billy between the eyes, boom, boom
He watched him die under the full moon
Two down bad brothers but only one stayed alive
Through storms and black water
The good inside of him was gone
Kick rocks, little brother, I'm taking home this pay
Kick rocks, little brother, money's mine today
