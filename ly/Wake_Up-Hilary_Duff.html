		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's people talking,
They talk about me,
They know my name,
They think they know everything,
But they don't know anything about me,

Give me a dance floor,
Give me a DJ,
Play me a record,
Forget what they say,

Cause I need to go,
Need to getaway tonight,

[Bridge]
I put my makeup on a Saturday night,
I try to make it happen,
Try to make it alright,
I know I make mistakes,
I'm living life day to day,
It's never really easy but it's OK,

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night,
Could be New York,
Maybe Hollywood and Vine,
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo,
There's something going on anywhere I go tonight,
Tonight, yeah tonight,

The city's restless,
It's all around me,
People, emotions,
Sick of all the same routines,
And they need to go,
They need to getaway, tonight,

I put my makeup on a Saturday night,
I try to make it happen,
Try to make it alright,
I know I make mistakes,
I'm living life day to day,
It's never really easy but it's OK,

[Chorus]

People all around, 
Everywhere that you go,
People all around you,
They don't really know you,
Everybody's watching like it's some kind of show,
Everybody's watching they don't really know you now,
(They don't really know you, they don't really know you)
And forever

Wake up, wake up,
Wake up, wake up,

Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night,
Could be New York,
Maybe Hollywood and Vine,
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo,
There's something going on anywhere I go,

[Chorus]
