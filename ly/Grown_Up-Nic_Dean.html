		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Ohhhh, yeah yeah
Yeah
Ohhhh
Numb to the face
Shaken to your core
Do you feel your body peaking
You'll be needing some more
Where's your mind at
Are you here
Are you staying in the present
Or you thinking bout the past
Tell me that you love me
Cause I know this won't last, last, last, last
Last man that you fucked
Wasn't like me
Set my visions and my goals a priority
Yeah, I'll never put you first
So don't fight back
Said I'll never find love and I meant that
All grown up
Just a little young
But I'm all grown up
Innocence fades when you're all grown up
All grown, All grown up
When
Are you goin find somebody
To relieve the pain
Who will feel the same
When
Are you goin find somebody
To believe the pain
Who will feel the same
I'm drawn back to you
Dug deep in your roots
Smile pretty on the outside
Broken on the inside
It's hard for you to compromise
All that what you say now
Trying so hard to fake out
Feels goin change on the way out
On the way out, on the way out
All grown up
Just a little young
But I'm all grown up
Innocence fades when you're all grown up
All grown, All grown up
When
Are you goin find somebody
To relieve the pain
Who will feel the same
When
Are you goin find somebody
To believe the pain
Who will feel the same
