		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely

Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, and day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice

Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights camera action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, "Oh, love" (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said

Sometimes I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me
So I'm playin' a role, ridin' the boat, stuck in a hole
Taking a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?

Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights camera action and scene
Story of my life, oh

Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, "Oh, love" (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

I said, "Oh, love" (keep me company, I said, I need the company)
(I said, I need the company) have mercy
(I said, oh love)
Oh, love, can you please have mercy on me?
(Keep me company, I said, I need the company)
(I said, I need the company) can you keep me company?
(I said)
L-O-N-E-L
Why am I so lonely?

Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, "Oh, love" (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, "Oh l-"
