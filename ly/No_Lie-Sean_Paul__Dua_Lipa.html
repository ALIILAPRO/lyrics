		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe it's gonna be lit tonight (lit tonight)

Baby girl, you carry ten ton ah fatness gimme some ah dat (gimme dat)
Mixed wit the badness, look how she hot (gyal yuh hot)
Shape like goddess but ah nuh just that
Is a good piece ah mentals unda the cap
Hot piece ah game and me love how you chat (steppa)
Watching every step ah the peppa deh weh you got (peppa)
Stayin' in my brain, 'membering all the touch ('memba)
Mainly my aim is to give you this love

Hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby you
Beam me up like Scottie (baby girl)
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie cah baby you
Move so hypnotic

(No lie) Gyal you never miss
Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal you never miss, gyal you never miss (no lie)
Hypnotized, pull another one
It's alright, I know what you want
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss (no lie)

Same suh we do it (no lie)
So we stay to it (no lie)
Same suh we do it
It's gonna be lit tonight, no lie (boodi-bang-bang-bang, gyal)

Same suh we do it (no lie)
So we stay to it (no lie)
Same suh we do it
It's gonna be lit tonight, no lie (boodi-bang-bang-bang)

I'm so lit, so lit, my girl (zeen?)
So let me see you roll it, roll it, my girl
Me love it when you bend and fold it, now let me bone it
And let me own it, my girl (woo, woo, woo)
Give you all the style that I have mastered
Hoist you up, baby girl, that's my word (ay)
Give you the good lovin' that is preferred
You deserve it, so don't be scared

It's hypnotic the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby you
Beam me up like Scottie (baby girl)
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie cah baby you
Move so hypnotic

(No lie) Gyal you never miss
Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal you never miss, gyal you never miss (no lie)
Hypnotized, pull another one
It's alright, I know what you want
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss (no lie)

Same suh we do it (no lie)
So we stay to it (no lie)
Same suh we do it
It's gonna be lit tonight, no lie (boodi-bang-bang-bang, gyal)

Same suh we do it (no lie)
So we stay to it (no lie)
Same suh we do it
