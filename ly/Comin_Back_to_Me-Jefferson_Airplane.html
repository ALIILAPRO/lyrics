		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The summer had inhaled and held its breath too long
The winter looked the same, as if it never had gone
And through an open window where no curtain hung
I saw you
I saw you 
Comin' back to me

One begins to read between the pages of a look
The shape of sleepy music, and suddenly you're hooked
Through the rain upon the trees, the kisses on the run
I saw you 
I saw you 
Comin' back to me

You came to stay and live my way
Scatter my love like leaves in the wind
You always say you won't go away
But I know what it always has been
It always has been

A transparent dream beneath an occasional sigh
Most of the time I just let it go by
Now I wish it hadn't begun
I saw you, yes, I saw you 
Comin' back to me

Strolling the hills overlooking the shore
I realized I've been there before
The shadow in the mist could have been anyone
I saw you
I saw you 
Comin' back to me

Small things like reasons are put in a jar
Whatever happened to wishes wished upon a star?
Was it just something that I made up for fun?
I saw you, I saw you comin' back to me
