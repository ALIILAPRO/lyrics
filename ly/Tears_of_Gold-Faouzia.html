		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama always told me
That I was too naive
Gave away my trust for pennies
I said don't you worry
Didn't think that I'd be
Broken down and crying
"Help me"

Wrecked? Check
Heart? In debt
All you do is come around
Just came here to collect
Wrecked? Check
Heart? In debt

Don't you know that
I cried tears of gold for you
I sit here poor for you
Collect my pennies and my dimes
That's why you love it when I cry
Platinum love for you
I'd give no less for you
Generosity's my enemy
So I'm broke and
Your heart's rich because of me

Know that this is my fault
Gave a little too much
Knew that this was gonna happen
But I'm not gonna lie
You can make me cry, thousand times
I come running back like
"What is going on with my head?"

Wrecked? Check
Heart? In debt
All you do is come around
Just came here to collect
Wrecked? Check
Heart? In debt

Don't you know that
I cried tears of gold for you
I sit here poor for you
Collect my pennies and my dimes
That's why you love it when I cry
Platinum love for you
I'd give no less for you
Generosity's my enemy
So I'm broke and
Your heart's rich because of me

And the worst part is I'd do it all over again
The worst part is, I know it's never gonna end
I keep coming right back like a maniac
I keep coming right back like

And the worst part is I'd do it all over again
No, the worst part is I know it's never gonna end
I keep coming right back like a maniac

I cried tears of gold for you
I sit here poor for you
Collect my pennies and my dimes
That's why you love it when I cry
Platinum love for you
I'd give no less for you
Generosity's my enemy
So I'm broke and
Your heart's rich because of me
