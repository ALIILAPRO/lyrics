		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can work you out
Are you thinking 'bout something better?
Holding onto you
While you drag me through stormy weather

The only time you smile is in the photographs
And when I pull you close, it's like you're holding back
Before we turn to strangers tryna love in the dark

Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing
If it's me you're missing
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sounded silence
Is a place we're dying

Tell it to my heart, heart, ah
Tell it to my heart, heart, ah

Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing
If it's me you're missing
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sounded silence
Is a place we're dying
Tell it to my heart

Before a light goes out
Come and tell me now if something's fading
'Cause I can feel it in
Every single thing that you're not saying

You move close to me but I can feel a space
Whatever time we have, I'm not gonna waste
Before we turn to strangers tryna love in the dark

Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing
If it's me you're missing
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sounded silence

Tell it to my heart, heart, ah
Tell it to my heart, heart, ah

Tell it to my heart
'Cause I can't keep guessing
If it's me you're missing
Tell it to my heart
'Cause the sounded silence
Is a place we're dying
Tell it to my heart
