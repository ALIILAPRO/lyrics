		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (VO) You’re always going to be the villain in someone else’s story
That’s their fault for pissing you off in the first place 

Mirror mirror, on the wall
Who’s the baddest bitch of all - it’s me
No need to think - No need to think
Mirror mirror, on the wall
Who’s the baddest bitch of all - it’s me
No need to think I know it’s me 

I never take shit from anybody
Don’t know why you think it was wise to cross me 
If ya got a death wish, then I’m listening 
I’ll end the life that you’re living 
Just call me your genie 

I don’t take shit from anybody
Piss me off and I’m leaving bodies 
Better get down on your knees and count your prayers
Cause nothing good comes after here 
You’re ‘bout to meet your queen 

Lemme tell ya that you’re messing with the wrong bitch now
Can’t let you forget it’s me who wears the crown 
And if you dare stand in my way then baby imma cut you down (down down) 
You’re messing with the wrong bitch now
I’m calling out for blood, it echoes in the crowd
And if you’re gonna beg, then do it now
Or else I’m gonna stain my gown

Uh oh there ya go again, keep making me mad 
And it’ll be off with your head (it’ll be off with your head) 
Uh oh, here we go again, keep playing your games 
And somebody’ll wind up dead (Somebody’ll wind up dead)

Cause I don’t take shit from anybody 
You ain’t even seen me go full crazy
Boy you really love to go and run your mouth 
I hope you go down half as proud 
I wanna hear you plead 

I don’t take shit from anybody
Did ya really think I would let ya walk free 
Kinda sad that all good things come to end, 
So baby kneel, off with your head, 
I wanna hear you scream (ara ara)

Lemme tell ya that you’re messing with the wrong bitch now
Can’t let you forget it’s me who wears the crown 
And if you dare stand in my way then baby imma cut you down (down down) 
You’re messing with the wrong bitch now
I’m calling out for blood, it echoes in the crowd
And if you’re gonna beg, then do it now
Or else I’m gonna stain my gown

Mirror mirror, on the wall
Who’s the baddest bitch of all - it’s me
No need to think - No need to think
Mirror mirror, on the wall
Who’s the baddest bitch of all - it’s me - it’s me

Messing with the wrong bitch now
Messing with the wrong bitch now
Messing with the wrong bitch now

Lemme tell ya that you’re messing with the wrong bitch now
Can’t let you forget it’s me who wears the crown 
And if you dare stand in my way then baby imma cut you down (down down) 
(Imma cut you down down down)
You’re messing with the wrong bitch now
I’m calling out for blood, it echoes in the crowd
And if you’re gonna beg, then do it now
Or else I’m gonna stain my gown
