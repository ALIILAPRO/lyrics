		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
I'm not scared, not at all
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
I'm not scared
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
I'm not scared of the dark
Of the dark, mmm

Ozuna
Yo no le temo a la oscuridá'
Aunque es más poderosa la maldá'
To'a las noches se presta, la vida cobra lo que da
No quiere decir que la luz no te la da
Pero mi beba 'tá mejor cuando me visto y salgo cuando el sol se va
No tengo enemigo' oculto', de una los sepulto
Siempre con el bien, feliz de ver hermano' junto'
Lo que pasa en el mundo ya no e' justo
Tiene que venir alguien pa'cá a resolver un par de asunto', oh

I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Of the dark, mmm (I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)

Tunechi
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
I just look down at my Rolex, 
It said it's the darkest times
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em, "Get a life"
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
I mean every word, feelin' like "do not disturb," wait
Let me testify, I have never testified
And I'm married to my pride, I ain't never, never cried
I got eyes like marbles, if I cry they sparkle
You know I can read your mind like I'm the author
There's a line for tomorrow and that line's gettin' shorter
I'm behind the trigger, what if I am the target?
Deep sigh, a sayonara, I ain't afraid to die
It's either goodbye or good mornin', and the skies start to fallin'
And I'ma shine in the darkness
I look back down at my Rollie, it says "Time for the chorus"

(You know I'm not scared) I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Of the dark, mmm (I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)

Yeah
Okay, put my heart to the side
In my feelings, let's ride
Big MAC to the side
If she call, I'm gon' slide
"That my baby," boy, you crazy
She might get a new Mercedes
She say she want me, oowee
Okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, come on

If I could count the tears I've cried
A million times, I swear I've died
I'm trying, but it's still not right
The only time I want her is tonight

I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not scared (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even from the start (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared of the dark (I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Of the dark 
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I ain't never scared)
