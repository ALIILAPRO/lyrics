		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Ooh it's something about
Just something about the way she move
I can't figure it out
It's something about her

Say, ooh it's something about
Kinda woman that want you but don't need you
Hey, I can't figure it out
It's something about her

'Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicure nails just sent the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly

And she move like a boss
Do what a boss
Do, she got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need, ooh

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Ooh, the way she shine
Miss independent

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, oh

Ooh there's something about
Kinda woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her

Something ooh so sexy about
Kinda woman that don't even need my help
She said, she got it, she got it no doubt 
There's something about her 

'Cause she work like a boss
Play like a boss
Car and the crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And her bills are payed on time, yeah
She made for a boss
Only a boss
Anything less she telling them to get lost
That's the girl that's on my mind

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Ooh, the way we shine
Miss independent, yeah, mm

Her favorite thing to say, don't worry I got it, mm
And everything she got best believe she bought it, mm
She goin' steal my heart ain't no doubt about it, girl
You're everything I need
Said you're everything I need

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah

She got her own thing
That's why I love her (that's why I love her)
Miss independent (independent) 
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing (she got, she got)
That's why I love her (that's why I love that girl)
Miss independent (oh)
Ooh, the way you shine

Miss independent
That's why I love her
