		  Miss my baby
Hope she ansa mi
(Hello)

Hello baby can you come ova?
Right now loneliness taking ova 
Me need you tonight ya me lovah
Come warm me up under the cover
Mek we rock 'til the lampshade turn ova
Rub me chest rest yuh head pon me shoulder
Ah mek we listen sum Anita Baker 
Mek love 'til we wake up the neighbor

Girl you're all I need 
And I'm always missing you
Miss you miss you

I can't resist you

Gal hug me up squeeze me tight and close 
Come har mek me brace yuh pon di king size post

We toast to long life we ah prosper the most 
Love yuh tone ah voice wen yuh call mi name 
Ova an ova she scream again 
Inna mi arms me want yuh fi remain 
'Til the sunshine cum out again

Girl you're all I need 
And I'm always missing you

Mek we rock 'til the lampshade turn ova
Rub me chest rest yuh head pon me shoulder
Ah mek we listen sum Anita Baker 
Mek love 'til we wake up the neighbor
