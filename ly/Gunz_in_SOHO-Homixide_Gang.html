		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, 5-5-5
They ask me how I'm livin', I respond, "Like 5"
Grown men couldn't even solve the equation
That's why we screaming, "Free Problem Child"
I know Beenie and Migo rock out
You know it be a whole new day when Demon pop out
Yo, 5-5-5
Free the 5
What? (Ready)
Homixide
Uh, yeah (yeah)
Uh, yeah (yeah)
Uh, yeah (yeah), yeah
Homixide
Uh, yeah (yeah)
Uh, yeah, uh

This a Givenchy long green coat
It's a Glock on the side of my arm
Nigga play with my woe and he done
Spin the block, they ain't know what that for
No matter that shit, know I'm gettin' brackin'
.308, you know I don't panic
.308, it come with attachments
.308, you know I make it happen, yeah
Yeah, it's a Glock on the side of my arm
And Givenchy long green coat
And my pants Japanese, though, yeah (Homixide, Homixide)

Uh, yeah, I come out the window, we creep
Chopper gon' put that lil' buddy to sleep
Play with my gang and you D-I-E
You know we eat beef, uh
Sliding black truck and know we four deep
Switch on that bitch and we ready to swiss cheese
Ride with that bitch and it come with red beam
I ride with that thing

Twelve hundred horses, I'm ridin' in a Demon
Watchin' for police, we steady high-speedin'
All types of choices, you know we got plenty
Percocet, Adderall, Xanny and shit
We gon' run it up, run it up, times ten
All of my niggas, it's me and Been
Homixide Gang business
All my niggas, we get it (Homixide, Homixide)
Yeah, we post up and zone
Turned the notch up, let's go (ready)
We got the trap runnin' for sure

This a Givenchy long green coat
It's a Glock on the side of my arm
Nigga play with my woe and he done
Spin the block, they ain't know what that for
No matter that shit, know I'm gettin' brackin'
.308, you know I don't panic
.308, it come with attachments
.308, you know I make it happen, yeah
Yeah, it's a Glock on the side of my arm
And Givenchy long green coat
And my pants Japanese, though, yeah (Homixide, Homixide)

Uh, yeah
Uh (yeah), yeah
Uh (yeah), yeah, yeah (yeah)
Uh, yeah (Homixide)
Uh (yeah), yeah, uh
