		<p>
		  (Uh-huh, mm-hm, woo)
New choppa, new choppa it came with the beam (ya)
Actavis pouring up lean (ya)
Got Flacko, yeah Rocky, he pass me the beam (ya)
I shoot like a king (LeBron)
All of these knots on my jeans (yeah)
Alexander of McQueen (yeah yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh)
(Mm-hm, yeah, yeah)
Diamonds they lookin' like ice (ya)
I whip the hoe like I'm Ike (ya)
Stack up my cash I got height (ya)
Take advantage of the Sprite (ya)
Take the bando bring the hype (ya)
We just go hard in the kitchen (uh-huh, uh-huh)
(Mm-hm, yeah, yeah)
Had to catch up with my bitches (ya)
They know that young nigga be living (uh-huh, uh-huh)
(Mm-hm, yeah, yeah) run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa (yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, mm-hm, yeah, yeah)
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I ain't hearing what you say (new choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa)
I ain't listening what you say (run it up, run it up, run it up)
Get the fuck up out the way (new choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa)
Go on let a playa' play
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa (run it up)

I roll up an L in the lobby
My partner's got waps and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a choppa, chop you, if you try me, bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky you bodied this," that's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being boujee by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us, hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas run up the racks
"For the most part, I rap", when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus
It's A$AP, and I ain't one to rush

(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
(Mm-hm, yeah, yeah) run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
I ain't hearing what you say (new choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa)
I ain't listening what you say (run it up, run it up, run it up)
Get the fuck up out the way (new choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa)
Go on let a playa play (run it up)
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa (run it up, run it up, run it up)
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa (run it up, run it up)
