		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In her favorite locket, hiding yellow pills
With white wine to chase them, lying on the hills
We kissed until we couldn't breathe
The coldest sand is on the beach

Now she's in her swimsuit with the yellow straps
Cutting it with scissors 'til there's nothing left
And rubbing sunscreen on her breasts
She's putting on her sunglasses

I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
Stop waiting

I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
Stop waiting
