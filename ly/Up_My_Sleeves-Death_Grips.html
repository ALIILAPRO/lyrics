Sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves
Up my

I take my life like I kept it
Up my sleeves, never sounds like you meant it
Up my sleeves, I take my life like any way I can fetish
That's my fact
Snatch it, only as directed
Snatch it, 'cause I got the queen's tits
Up my sleeves
Snatch it like you're the queen's bitch
Up my sleeves I hold your ground with my perch
Up my sleeves fill my soul, quench my hearse
Up my sleeves
I don't wanna
Cut mine off
I don't wanna
Fuck you back
I'm rolling
Oh, my agony's priceless
I take my life any way you can slice this
Snatch my shame and fetish
Got it in discretion for effect
For effect
Snatch my shame and I connect
Disconnect I'm a
I'm the wretch Maya

I've always known
I've always known

If you can't snatch my fetish, I'll FedEx it
Notify me when you miss it
I'll be on my liquid
Pickled but lavished
If you'll miss it, I'll track it
My fetish like magic
Feel contrived to see you snatch it

Snatch my, fetish, I keep it up my

I'll ever know
Was like I even wanna know
Was like I didn't want to know
Was like I never didn't know
Was like I never I don't know
If I'm so necessary
Blank blank obituary
At Broadway cemetery
At Broadway cemetery
Was like all I'll ever know
Was like I didn't want to know
Was like I never didn't know
Was like I never I don't know
If I'm so necessary
Blank blank obituary
At Broadway cemetery

Tsk tsk tsk
My terracotta army
Disarms me
Disowns me
Also
Also also
Mr. Ripley told me
You play highway hocus
Ain't much more highway can ride me
My dead mother in my dream
Remember when December blew her ashes 'cross my jeans
Off these chains
Some things only I have seen
Some people only I have been
Used to know who I was
Fuck if I knew who that was
Pay no mind illogical
Just don't die in a hospital
Oh yeah
I should be worried
Oh yeah
I'm temporary

Don't know what I do
I'll tell you how I knew
I've always known
I've always known

I was conceived, by my disease

Up my sleeves
Any how
Any more
Any one
Anything
Any where
Any time
Snatch my fetish

Sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves
Up my

Nothing you can offer
I ain't hocked
Up my sleeves
Everything's nothing to me, I'm knocked
Up my sleeves
I abstain from being and succumb
Up my sleeves
Don't feel none, I flog the remedy
Up my sleeves
Alchemy for your bodily
Up my sleeves
Nonsensically
Up my sleeves
Got a Pendleton on my valley
Up my sleeves

I came to free your bodily up my sleeves
