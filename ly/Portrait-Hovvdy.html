		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It is hard to forget how it went that night
Silhouettes burning out
Broken like glass from the second floor
Washed by a rush when the flooding came down

We were cut from the vine of our parents hands
Ran from the noise to the minivan
Lost down a path and got turned around
Since Jill moved to Ada
And Amy burned out

Your eyes are talking
And they don't seem fine to me
May as well be walking away
With your eyes turned from me

Bringing all I knew to what I don’t know
Two years later and you still have a hold
Hold my breath to the top of the hill
See the world move while I’m standing still

Your eyes are talking
And they don't seem fine to me
May as well be walking away
With your eyes turned from me
