		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One by one
One by one, we all fall
One by one, Lord
One by one, we will all fall
Open your arms wide
Open your eyes wide
Brother, run fast
They're coming your way
Oh, brother, run fast
They're headin' your way

I've got my heart bleedin' for change
I've stood by and closed my eyes in shame
You'll see them someday
You'll find them again
'Cause as the good Lord will give
The good Lord will take

Oh, brother, run fast
Brother, run fast
They're coming your way, coming your way
Brother, run fast
Brother, run fast
They're headin' your way, headin' your way

It's best you not speak of what you've found
Please don't pass judgment on me now
They don't seek the truth
They'll make their own groove (oh)
And when they've come for me
They'll come back for you

Oh, brother, run fast
Brother, run fast
They're coming your way, coming your way
Brother, run fast
Brother, run fast
They're headin' your way, headin' your way

One by one, now
One by one, we all fall
One by one, Lord
One by one, we will all fall
One by one
One by one, we will all fall
Spreadin' your arms wide
Open your eyes wide
Brother, run fast
They're coming your way

Oh, brother, run fast
Brother, run fast
They're coming your way, coming your way (oh)
Brother, run fast
Brother, run fast
They're headin' your way, headin' your way

Brother, run fast
Brother, run fast
Brother, don't break
Brother, don't break
Brother, run fast
They're coming your way
