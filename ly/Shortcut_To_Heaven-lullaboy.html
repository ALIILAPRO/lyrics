		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, what if it is?

Been a long day, been a long year
Runnin' in circles jumpin' the hurdles
Til' you walked in my life
Everything changed and I swear
I couldn't have planned it
You were the answer
I never thought I would find (Oh oh)

They say love can come so soon
(So soon, yeah) you're my living proof

Oh my God, what a blessing
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallеlujah
I waited so long, I'll never movе on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

Your love is a shortcut to heaven

I think I struck gold and I found home
All at the same time my high and my baseline
You're my holiest ground (Mm-mm, yeah)
So good it hurts you make it worth
All of the waiting somebody patient
Somebody kind

They say love can come so soon
You're my living proof

Oh my God, what a blessing
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallеlujah
I waited so long, I'll never movе on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

Your love is a shortcut to heaven

Oh my God, what a blessing
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallelujah
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

Your love is a shortcut to heaven

They say love can come so soon
Thank God that I found you

Oh my God, what a blessing
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallеlujah
I waited so long, I'll never movе on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

Your love is a shortcut to heaven

Oh my God, what a blessing (Oh my God)
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
(Your love is a shortcut to heaven)
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallelujah
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

Now that I found ya now that I found ya
Now that I found ya
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Now that I found ya now that I found ya
Now that I found ya
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
