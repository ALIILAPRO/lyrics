		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pulling down backstreets, deep in your head
Slipping through dreamland like a tourist
Pulling down backstreets, deep in your head
Slipping through dreamland like a tourist

That first friend you had, that worst thing you said
That perfect moment, that last tear you shed
All you done in bed? All on Memorex
All 'round, 'round your head, all 'round, 'round your head

Pulling down backstreets, deep in your head
Slipping through dreamland like a tourist
Pulling down backstreets, deep in your head
Slipping through dreamland like a tourist

You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live, you want things you can touch
Make it feel like like a movie you saw in your youth
Make it feel like that song that just unopened you
You were ten years old holding hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre, old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag, you want boys with guitars

Pulling down backstreets, deep in your head
Slipping through dreamland like a tourist
Pulling down backstreets, deep in your head
Slipping through dreamland like a tourist

You see Kodachrome, you see pink and gold
You see Mullholland glow, you see in airplane mode
All 'round, 'round your head, all 'round, 'round your head
All 'round, 'round your head, all 'round 'round your head

You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
You go ask your questions like, "What makes a man?"
Oh, it's 2020 so it's time to change that
So you go make an album and call it Dreamland
