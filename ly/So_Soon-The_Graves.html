		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Theres so much I could say and I wish I could convey 
The way, I feel but I can’t say, cuz youre so far away
And I am tired all the time now, that you’re not by my side
and I can’t seem to stay awake, with you so far away


I would walk the distance but I still don’t really know
I could climb the rockies covered head to toe with snow
So I could ask you if you feel it too
I’ll see you so soon

Your hands are always blue and I would keep them warm for you
But the plane wouldn’t let me stay that day
Now your so far away

I would walk the distance but I still don’t really know
I could climb the rockies covered head to toe with snow
So I could ask you if you feel it too
I’ll see you so soon

When these words reach your ears I hope that it becomes clear the way
We’re on each others minds from so far away

I would walk the distance but I still don’t really know
I could climb the rockies covered head to toe with snow
So I could ask you if you feel it too
I’ll see you…
Then ill tell you that I love you and you’ll say I love you too
You’ll come to California where the only thing that’s blue
Is the sky and sea I’ll stick to you like we were glued

I’ll see you so soon
