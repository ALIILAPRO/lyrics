		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm singin' at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talkin' to his dad, it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it, I can't breathe

And I have this dream where I'm screamin' underwater
While my friends are wavin' from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears

And last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishin' I was someone else, feelin' sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

And it's 4 AM again
And I'm doin' nothing
Again
