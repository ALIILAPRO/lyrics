		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hmm, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, hmm
Da-da-da-hmm (yeah, yeah)
Oh, ah

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say "thank you" or "please"
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

Gold teeth, my neck, my wrist is froze (so icy)
I got more ice than, than the snow
That guy, don't act like you don't know
That guy, so critical (skrrt)
Tattoos on both my sleeves
Yeah, I don't sleep, please don't wake me
Loosen my tie up so I can breathe
It ain't political, oh no (uh-uh)

Yeah, I'm a bad guy
Ain't no holdin' back guy
Come off like I'm mad guy
Always got your back guy
Yeah, I'm the real type
Keep you for the thrills type
Show you what it feels like
Got an open invite
I'm the bad guy, whoa-ooh (duh)

I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

(Ahh)
(Ah)
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone (so icy)
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne (let's go)

I'm the bad guy (damn right)
I-I'm the bad guy (aw, yeah)
