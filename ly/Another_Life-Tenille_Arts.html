		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to buy you a t-shirt
From everywhere I went
Everywhere I went
Kinda like a postcard
I was sending you my heart

I came home last Christmas
We sat opening up gifts
It's those special moments
That keep my heart frozen

And I know, you're probably doing fine
But I can't help but think tonight

I don't wanna kiss anybody else's lips
I don't wanna feel anybody else's touch
I just wanna be the old you and me
We'd be married, have a house and kids by this time
In another life
In another life

We were gonna grow old together
Go somewhere with warmer weather
Or up north where it's colder
It didn't matter we had forever

And I know, you're probably doing fine
But I can't say that I am tonight

'Cause I don't wanna kiss anybody else's lips
I don't wanna feel anybody else's touch
I just wanna be the old you and me
We'd be married, have a house and kids by this time
In another life
In another life

In another life
I would get to kiss you goodnight
Hold your hand, play with your hair, feel your arms around me
Giving me the best hug
Yeah, we'd be so in love

In another life
In another life

I wouldn't have to kiss anybody else's lips
I wouldn't have to feel anybody else's touch
We could just be the old you and me
We'd be married, have a house and kids by this time
And you'd be here tonight
In another life
