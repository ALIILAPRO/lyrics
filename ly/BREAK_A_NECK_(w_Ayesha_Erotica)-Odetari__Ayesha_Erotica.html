		  ('Tari, get over here)

(Dance all night)
I just wanna dance all night, dance all night
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna, I just wanna-
(Dance all night)
I just wanna dance all night, dance all night
Dance-dance all-all-all night

Bitch, get fucked, 'cause you ass and you puss
How you bitches got signed and you don't got push?
Like, please, everything I do is for a fee
I'll shake a bitch down for a purse and a weave
I'll shake a bitch down for a BMI
Who writes your shit, bitch? Just me and I
Why you bitches act scary and dark? It's just dumb
You would pop a damn tit tryna shoot off a gun

(Dance all night)
(Dance-d-d-dance-d-d-dance-night-night)
(Dance all night)
(Night, n-n-night, n-n-night)
(Dance-dance-a-a-all night)

Damn, whoa, you're moving too fast
Girl, you need to slow down
(I just wanna dance all night)
Damn, whoa, you're moving too fast
Girl, you need to slow down
(Dance, dance, a-a-all)

(Dance all night)
I just wanna dance all night, dance all night
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna, I just wanna-
(Dance all night)
I just wanna dance all night, dance all night
Dance-dance, all-all-all-

She don't wanna think about her problems
She just want to get into that club to shake her bottom
She think if she drink this liquor then it's gon' dissolve 'em
When she grabbed me by my neck, I knew it was a problem

Break a sweat, I can make you
Break your neck, I can make you
Break your neck, I can make you
Break a sweat, bre-break a sweat
Bre-break a sweat, I can make you
Break your neck, I can make you
Break your neck, I can make you
Break a sweat, bre-break a sweat

Damn, whoa, you're moving too fast
Girl, you need to slow down
(I just wanna dance all night)
Damn, whoa, you're moving too fast
Girl, you need to slow down
(Dance, dance, a-a-all-)

And you ain't slick, bitch, you ain't shit
I seen you rise and fall, bitch, you ate shit
Chopped cheese, you done, you got 8-6'd
When you bitches speak my name, I know you taste it
And about that album, bitch, stop it
That shit corny like tees at Hot Topic
I'ma make you bimbo hoes go back Gothic
Let me know how many streams until you profit

Pussy, pussy
Pussy, pussy
