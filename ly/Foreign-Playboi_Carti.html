		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what I'm sayin', man
Still drinkin' lean and shit

Ooh, hop in that motherfuckin' foreign
And that motherfucka be roarin'
Big gun big, yeah show 'em
City to city, I'm tourin'
Lil Carti, I'm ready to pull up
All of my diamonds they glowin'
Fuck on your bih, yeah
She left in the mornin'

Diamonds they skatin' on ice
Run it up bih, Jerry Rice
Aye, hurt your feelings with the price
Everythin' come with a price
Everythin' come with a price
Hundred thousand, yeah my price
Too many rings like I'm Mike
I got the muhfuckin' mic
I got the muhfuckin' ike
I told your bitch to come trike
Pass me the muhfuckin' mic
I'm in the lobby, I'm piped
I told that bih to come pipe
Shawty wanna fuck on the pipe
Shawty gon' lick on the pipe
I got the strap like a dyke
I got the strap, I don't fight
My diamonds they icey, aye
My diamonds they ice, they bite
Your diamonds they ight, a-ight
Ask that lil bih, what's her type?

Ooh, hop in that motherfuckin' foreign
And that motherfucka be roarin'
Big gun big, yeah show 'em
City to city, I'm tourin'
Lil Carti, I'm ready to pull up
All of my diamonds they glowin'
Fuck on your bih, yeah
She left in the mornin'

Diamonds on diamonds on diamonds
Empty your pockets and pay a lil homage
I got Pirus in the lobby
I got Pirus right behind me
Cranberry drip with the Vette
I might just pull up in bottoms
Walk in the lobby like Gotti
You can't trust me, I'm too poppin'
These niggas they tryna 2Pac me
Used to be robbin'
Molly santana jaw locking
This Spanish bih callin' me Papi
She ride me like a Bugatti
Hop in the foreign for the mileage
Peekaboo, fuck, bitch, I'm tired
Booted up, bih never tired

Ooh, hop in that motherfuckin' foreign
And that motherfucka be roarin'
Big gun big, yeah show 'em
City to city, I'm tourin'
Lil Carti, I'm ready to pull up
All of my diamonds they glowin'
Fuck on your bih, yeah
She left in the mornin'
