		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be a part of all your fantasies
The way you make me feel, it's like I'm family
Asking me permission to exceed baby
You've got me leaning forward on the sheets yeah
Oh
Let me tell you how I want it
Oh
There's no need, you've already got it
Oh
I know you hold it back because you want in
My heart's been through attacks, are you my one and only?
Told you all my secrets, yet you're near me
I feel you on my skin and in my feelings
I can't sleep when you're in my head
I can't breathe while you're in my bed
When I'm with him I feel honest, oh
Fingerprints on me like garnets
I wanna be the one to put your love on
I wanna be the star you look upon when you feel low
I see your bullets and your butterflies
I see right through you when you need to cry
Oh
Let me tell you how I want it
Oh
No, there's no need, you've already got it
I feel you on my skin and in my feelings
I can't sleep when you're in my head
I can't breathe while you're in my bed
When I'm with him I feel honest, oh
Fingerprints on me like garnets
I can't sleep when you're in my head
I can't breathe while you're in my bed
When I'm with him I feel honest, oh
Fingerprints on me like garnets
When I'm with him I feel honest
Fingerprints on me like garnets
Ohh
