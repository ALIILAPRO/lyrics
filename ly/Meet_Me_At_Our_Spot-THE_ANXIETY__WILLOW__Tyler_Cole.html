		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I wake up
I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot

Caught a vibe
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

When I go to sleep
I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older, I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
(Meet me at our spot)

We caught a vibe (yeah, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
When I look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna hold you all night (all night)
Maybe we can take a drive (take a drive)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there

Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there

Caught a vibe
Baby, are you coming for the ride (the ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
