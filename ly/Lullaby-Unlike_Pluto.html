		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I’m gone 
Maybe I’m gone 
But you couldn’t see
Light years away 
Memories fade
Can’t remember your face 
and it’s like you never noticed
never had a chance to hold it

Just sing your lullabies, lullabies put me to sleep
And with these lullabies, filled with lies, go and leave me 
The miles turned to silence
With years we’ll learn to forget

Crazy how life 
Can just move on
it’s a lot to hold on
Regret is a song
That played it all wrong 
I can’t remember the pace
you said you’d come back one day
I guess I’ll exit left stage

Just sing your lullabies, lullabies put me to sleep
And with these lullabies, filled with lies, go and leave me 
The miles turned to silence
With years we’ll learn to forget

Wasted time
The years turned to dust
Whatever once shined
Turned to rust
And still we keep pretending like nothing changed
But (oh) we are not the same
Time doesn’t care, what you went through
 it moves like nothing changed
and it’s like you never noticed
never had a chance to hold it

Just sing your lullabies, lullabies put me to sleep
And with these lullabies, filled with lies, go and leave me 
The miles turned to silence
With years we’ll learn to forget
