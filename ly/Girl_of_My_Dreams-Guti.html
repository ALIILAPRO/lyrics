		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a thing for pretty girls with skinny waists 
Treat my time like money 
Wants to spend it all away 
Not the type you see tomorrow
but the bitch she's here to stay 

And I just keep on movin' on and on 
And I just keep on movin' on and on 
(Yeah, I can't keep my eyes off of you)
 
Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down 
Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down 
Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down 
Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down 

And all the times we lied awake 
When you said you'd leave, but you stayed 
And I can't promise you I'm better than the next few
Better than the next few 

But I 
But I'm just tryna' say 

Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down 
Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down 
Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down 
Your love's got me high, baby girl 
I'm addicted and I'm never coming down
