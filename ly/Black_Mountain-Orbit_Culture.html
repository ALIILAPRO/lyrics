		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'M HERE
UNDER TORTURE STILL
REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THIS HOLE, BIG DARK ABYSS
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT

I'M HERE
UNDER MOUNTAINS, I FEEL LOST, BUT SO HOME
I FEEL, THAT I'VE WANDERING TOO MUCH ON MY OWN
I'M LOST ON THIS PATHWAY

PATHWAY

THE SPIKE OF THE THORN
IT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK
IT JUST KEEPS COMING FOR MORE

LET ME TAKE THOSE FEARED STEPS
SEE THE ICE MELT ALL AROUND ME
CLEARED MY EYES NOW FORGIVE ME
I'VE FALLEN

I'VE FALLEN FOR TOO LONG

THE VICIOUS CIRCLE
IT KEEPS ON FINDING ME
THE VICIOUS CIRCLE OF LIFE

I'M HERE
UNDER MOUNTAINS STILL
THESE CAVES EXPANDING NEW TRAILS THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN IN HERE
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME I'M DROWNING IN WATER
I'VE REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

THE SPIKE OF THE THORN
IT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK
IT JUST KEEPS COMING FOR MORE

LET ME TAKE THOSE FEARED STEPS
SEE THE ICE MELT ALL AROUND ME
CLEARED MY EYES NOW FORGIVE ME
I'VE FALLEN

I'VE FALLEN FOR TOO LONG

LET ME TAKE THOSE FEARED STEPS
SEE THE ICE MELT ALL AROUND ME
CLEARED MY EYES NOW FORGIVE ME
I'VE FALLEN

I'VE FALLEN FOR TOO LONG

THIS BLACK WALL IN SKIES
KEEPS MOST OF THE LIGHT
THIS MOUNTAIN I'LL CLIMB
IT'S THE LAST TIME I KNOW IT

ALL ALONE IN THE BOTTLE
ALL ALONE IN THE BOTTLE
