		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my tru'
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my tru' tru' tru'

It's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my tru'
I got that thump in my tru' tru' tru'

It was a late night
No scrabble, game night
I'm a handful, ain't I
Ain't I, ain't I

Let me show you
Back seat, front door you
Pop the trunk
Shut your mouth and turn that shit up

We ride by like there's no one there
And they stop and stare, yeah they stop and stare
We ride by like nobody knows what's in my trunk
What's in my trunk

It's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my tru'
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my tru' tru' tru'

It's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my tru'
I got that thump in my tru' tru' tru'

Ridin' in a saucy whip
Even if it's costly
I'm a be flossy
Maybelline shade glossy
Watch out I'm spending it
Got bitches on deck and they mexican
Another street, red line
Don't stop 'till they hit the bay side

We ride by like there's no one there
And they stop and stare, yeah they stop and stare
We ride by like nobody knows what's in my trunk
What's in my trunk

It's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my tru'
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my tru' tru' tru'

Got the north, got the east, got the west with me
So I suggest you better not mess with me
Be cool, you don't wanna squat them
We could do the four but you don't want no problems
I put that on something, I put that on fathers
I put that on something, I put that on mommas
I put that on something, I put that on gransethers
You run up on me, get your man be up

It's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my tru'
I got that thump in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump in my tru' tru' tru'
