		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swim, the tide is coming
We spent too long watching
Bullet holes are rushing in
No use bailing

Bullet proof, they never loved you
You let too many bullets through

To be patient and awake
There are things to learn here, Kate
To forgive and to accept
Things that haven't happened yet

Bullet proof, they never loved you
You let too many bullets through

Everything we broke today
Needing breaking, anyway
Can you prove to me
That you can feel anything?
Prove to me that you can feel

Bullet proof, they never loved you
You let too many bullets through
