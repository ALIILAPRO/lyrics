		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me feel dizzy
I'm free to get busy
I don't need to teach you about birds and bees
Get to the point please

I don't want your love
I just want your night
So let's stop
Wasting time
I don't need your name

You make me high on your looks
Your playing games is so cruel
You're the kind of girl censored in textbooks
You're the fire and I am the fuel

You don't want my love
You just want my night
So let's stop
Wasting time
I don't need your name

On the tip of my tongue
It feels so wrong
But deep in your heart
It feels so right
I'll make you shiver
From the touch of my fingers

I don't want your love
I just want your night (Night)
So let's stop
Wasting time, yeah (Ooh)
I don't need your name
You don't want my love, no (You don't want my love)
You just want my night (You just want my night)
So let's stop (So let's stop)
Wasting time, yeah (Wasting time)
I don't need your name (I don't need your name)
