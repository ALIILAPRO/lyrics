		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the sun goes down, leave all my love behind

You said I was special, I was everythin'
You wanted more than pleasure, so I let you in, but
Should've known you'd leave me here to sink or swim
Didn't notice, don't do me like that

Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the sun goes down, leave all my love behind
Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the lights go out, leave all my love behind
Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the sun goes down, leave all my love behind
Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the lights go out, leave all my love behind

Why'd you leave me empty, then come back for more?
You say you miss me now, but that's a mystery to me
I kept you warm, but you just left me cold
How do one do that? (Do that)
But now, I know that
I don't need another lie
Don't need another try
I gave you more than body to body
So I gave up on what we had
And now you want me back
Don't do me like that

Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the sun goes down, leave all my love behind
Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the lights go out, leave all my love behind
Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the sun goes down, leave all my love behind
Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the lights go out, leave all my love behind

Tell me what it feels like
Tell me what it feels like (tell me what it feels)
Tell me what it feels like when you're alone tonight
When the sun goes down, leave all my love behind
