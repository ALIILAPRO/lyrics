		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stony and grey is the whore 
And long are the days in the morgue 
Where god is a wall 
Where god is a wall to look upon 

Legions and hordes 
The seas have been torn 
And buildings remain where they fall 
And I solemnly walk 
Through legions and hordes 
A dark mass of infidels 

Long is the howl at the end 
A cry from the tail echoing 
And fools reverberate 
And fools reverberate and carry on

What have they done to themselves? 
Look what have they done to themselves. 

If you don't learn to leave this thing alone 
You'll never get to see the sun again 
You won't come out on top 
The seed is sown
