		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah
Don't let your love go astray, save it for me
Don't give your sweet kiss away, save it for me
I know you're feelin' blue
'Cause I feel blue like you
I'll be strong as long as you are and wait just as long as you

Don't waste that look I adore, save it for me
Just wait a little bit more, save it for me
I know that you must cry
Cry baby, so do I
Just sit tight and leave on your light

'Cause I'm comin' home to your arms
Oh baby, I'm comin' home to your arms

Ah, save it for me
Ah, save it for me

I know that you must cry
Cry baby, so do I
I'll be strong as you are
And wait just as long as you
Save it for me

Save it for me
Oh, ah
Save it for me
Oh, ah
Save it for me
Oh, ahh
Save it for me
Oh, ah
