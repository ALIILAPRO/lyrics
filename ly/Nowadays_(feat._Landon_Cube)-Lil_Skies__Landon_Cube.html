Ayy, ayy, ayy

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
If it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switch lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real, I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck
Want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was taught stay down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, ballin' on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul, run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose, do 'em like I'm Deebo

Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
If it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switch lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody 
(I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
If it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
