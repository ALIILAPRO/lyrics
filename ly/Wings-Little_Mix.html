		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  인생을 절대 낭비하지 마
작고 이쁜 나비 날갤 펼쳐봐
그 누가 뭐라건 밤을 설치지 마
누가 뭐래도 shh
조용히 가라 해

두발 땅에 닿지 않아
아무 말도 안 들려
넌 계속 지껄이지만 oh, yeah
가, 저리로 걸어가
신경 쓰기엔 난 멋져 oh, yeah

아무 의미 없어, 들리지 않아
계속 외쳐, 날 믿어줘

Mama told me not to waste my life
She said "Spread your wings, my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you
'Cause wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly (hey, hey)

확 달아오른 저 런웨이
언젠가 도착할 건데
준비 따윈 필요 없어 no, no
Talk 하늘을 가르며
전혀 상관 안 해 oh, yeah

아무 의미 없어, 들리지 않아
계속 외쳐 날 믿어줘

Mama told me not to waste my life
She said "Spread your wings, my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you
'Cause wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly

I don't need no one saying "Hey, hey, hey, hey"
I don't hear no one saying "Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey (hey), hey (hey)"
그냥 계속 걸어가
아무 말 말고 지나가 boy
그냥 계속 걸어가
아무 말 말고 지나가 boy

아무 의미 없어, 들리지 않아
계속 외쳐 날 믿어줘

Mama told me not to waste my life
She said "Spread your wings, my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you
'Cause wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly

And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
