		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide, oh, no
I'll beat around the bush
I've got nothing but time, oh, no, oh, no
You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing is all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And this is the town, this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
So be it

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing is all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
 
I'll take my car, I'll take my house
I never liked that beated motor mouth
And it only looks so worn out then
Just like a stranger in the candlelight

Take, take, take, take, take it all

Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

Leave me now
Leave me now
