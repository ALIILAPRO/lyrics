		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moana, make way, make way
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is all you need

Consider the coconut (the what?)
Consider its tree
Each part of the coconut that's all we need

We make our nets from the fibers (we weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (and we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside (we have mouths to feed inside)

The village believes in us (that's right!)
The village believes 
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

So here I'll stay (Moana)
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way 
I'll have my people to guide me 
We'll build our future together 
Where we are, where we are
