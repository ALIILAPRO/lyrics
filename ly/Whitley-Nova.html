		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I've been lookin' for you
In these other bitches
I could never find exactly
What I'm lookin' for
And being on this chase has
Finally got me sick of
All of these new faces I just
Can't get used to it
New to this, I'm new to this, I'm new to this

After all of this you know
I'm so over all of it, all of it, all of it
All of this and now i just get more colder
As time got over and over
Girl you know that it's over

And day go after day i think bout you
Imma play these little games
I think bout you and daily I've been saying
Pray these dreams not through
And I need you by my side
Cause I dream bout you
And all I need is this moment please
Could you hold it for me
Girl I know that I see
What I want, what I want

After all of this you know
I'm so over all of it, all of it, all of it
All of this and now i just get more colder
As time got over and over
Girl you know that it's over

You don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna
I’ve been up a very long time
Wonder why they hate on me
I don’t wanna love myself
I’m praying that they all love me
Cause you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
You don’t wanna
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna
I should’ve let you know
That you’re my only one
I know your feeling numb
I’ll fuck you till you cum
Said, "I don’t understand
How you don’t gotta man"
You want me in your bed
Cause I've been in your head no, no, no
No, no, no no, no, no
No, no, no no, no, no
No, no, no
