		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reach the city steps tonight
Following the power lines

Met a man barside
With eclipses for eyes
And you tell yourself you wont let them touch
Did I say too much did I say enough
I don't know Sylvia
I don't know Sylvia

Circle round the room still
Breaking my will

Know I can't have you here
Someone else on your skin

And it's all my fault for not getting off
And you made it start, can you make it stop?
You don't know Sylvia
You don't know Sylvia

Damn
Damn

Reach the city steps tonight
Following the power lines

And your skin is so white
Underneath the black night
And your voice calls out for the Coup de grace
When the lights go out will there be a trace?
I don't know Silvia
That I loved, Silvia
That I loved, Silvia
