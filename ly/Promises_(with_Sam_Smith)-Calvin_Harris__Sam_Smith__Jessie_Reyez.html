		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you drunk enough?
Not to judge what I'm doin'
Are you high enough
To excuse that I'm ruined?
'Cause I'm ruined
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love
So tease me, hmm

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything 
(Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything 
(Tonight)
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything 
(Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything 
(Tonight)

Tonight
(You're everything tonight)

Is it loud enough?
'Cause my body is calling for you, calling for you
I need someone
To do the things that I do (hmm)
I'm heating up
Energy's taking control
I'm speeding up
My heartbeat's dancing alone

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything 
(Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything 
(Tonight)
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything 
(Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything 
(Tonight)

Tonight
(You're everything tonight)

'Cause I need 
Your green light
Day and night, say that you're mine
'Cause I need
Your green light
Day and night, say that you're mine (you're mine)
Say that you're mine (you're mine)
Say that you're mine

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything 
(Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything 
(Tonight)
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything 
(Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything 
(Tonight)

Tonight
