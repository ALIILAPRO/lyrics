		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Like the fire needs the air)
Yeah
(I won't burn unless you're there, you're there)
I need you
(Ooh, I need you)
I need you to hate so I can use for your energy
(Like the fire needs the air)
You know (I won't burn unless you're there, you're there)
It's real shit
(Ooh-)
Feel this

America got a thing for this gangsta shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skullies, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duck tape on my trey-eight handle
The women on my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in New Jack I holla, "Cancel that bitch"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man, my heart done froze up
I build a empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam dreaming, niggas be scheming 
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me (yeah)

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm tryin' to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

Yeah 
I don't know shit about gymnastics, I summersault bricks
And black talons start flyin', when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-Ds', they call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed
Shit, send me them seeds, I'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm sellin' them for five-hundred a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything, I'ma hustler I know how to grind
Step on grapes put it in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find 
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind 
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'll be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key (uh-huh)
And you can locate me where ever that dope be 
Getting money, man

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm tryin' to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

It's a Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin' 
That drama means nothin', it's part of the game 
Catch me in the coupe switchin' lanes
Or in the jeweler switchin' chains
I upgrade from dirty BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watchin' the spinners spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo' ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hef'll tell you he don't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icy, they can't stop me
Racist, pointin' at me, "Look at Niggaracci"
Hello

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm tryin' to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
