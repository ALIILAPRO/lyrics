		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't really want it
It's all the same to me
I don't really want it
I don't really want it

I don't want the white picket fence and the ten car bay
And the bright green grass and the white gold chain with the
I just wanna say thanks to the ones who stayed at the end of the day but I
Can't say shit when I feel like this
Sapphire tears with the iced out wrist
All those years and I can't do shit
Yeah the fire inside burned out cuz I miss you

Cuz I can't break away
When I'm locked in the chains
My mind is living in yesterday
Bout time that I stopped but I

Cannot keep my fear of falling off the edge from you
Tell my mother that I love her and my father that it's true
And the lightning strike in the dead of night so don't you go to far
The thunder in the distance is the rhythm of my heart it beats for you

It beats for you
It beats for you
It beats for you

I don't want the white picket fence with the ten car bay
And the bright green grass and the white gold chain with the
I just wanna say thanks to the ones who stayed at the end of the day but I
Can't say shit when I feel like this
Sapphire tears with the iced out wrist
All those years and I can't do shit
Yeah the fire inside burned out

I don't want the white picket fence with the ten car bay
And the bright green grass and the white gold chain with the
I just wanna say thanks to the ones who stayed at the end of the day but I
Can't say shit when I feel like this
Sapphire tears with the iced out wrist
All those years and I can't do shit
Yeah the fire inside burned out cuz I miss you
