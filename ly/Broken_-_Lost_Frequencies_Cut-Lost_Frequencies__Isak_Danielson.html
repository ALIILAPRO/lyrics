		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are broken on the floor
And you're crying, crying
He has done this all before
But you're lying, lying
To yourself, that he'll find help
That he will change to someone else
But you're broken on the floor
Still asking him for more
Still asking him for more
Still asking him for more
Still asking him for more
But you're lying, lying

(Still asking him for more)

(Still asking him for more)

(Still asking him for more)
(Still asking him for more)
(Still asking him for more)
(Still asking him for more)
(Still asking him for more)
(Still asking him for more)
(Still asking him for more)
But you're lying, lying

(Still asking him for more)
(Broken on the floor)
(Asking him for more)
(Asking him for more)
But you're lying, lying
