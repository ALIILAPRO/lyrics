		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If love is an understatement
Then, honey, I'm a goddamn fool
When I tell you there's no replacement
For what you do to me

So give all your love to me
And give all your love to me
Those other boys will let you down
No, I would never mess around
One, two, three

Baby, won't you be my girl?
Baby, won't you be my girl?
Baby, won't you be my only girl?

Love's a dog and it's tail I'm chasin'
I'm pullin' down the moon for us
Stumbled towards the room, heart's racin'
Just know that it's because of you

So give all your love to me
And give all your love to me
Those other boys will let you down
No, I would never mess around
One, two, three, ah

Baby, won't you be my girl?
Baby, won't you be my girl?
Baby, won't you be my only girl?
Baby, won't you be my girl?
Your loving's got my head in a twirl, lady
So, baby, won't you be my only girl?

I don't want nobody else
No, I just want you to myself
So won't you please forever be
My only girl, only girl?
I don't want nobody else
No, I just want you to myself
So won't you please forever be
My only girl, only girl?

Baby, won't you be my girl?
Baby, won't you be my girl?
Baby, won't you be my only girl?
Baby, won't you be my only girl?
