		  (Mano)
You've never been to Heaven, have you? (OG Parker)

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on, 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (yeah, yeah, yeah, ah)
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it (yeah)
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on, 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)

Baby, I'm the sweetest, pussy is the meanest (yeah)
Hot girl shit, but I'm cold every season (but I'm cold every season)
Know he got that pipe, let him bust it 'til it's leakin' (yeah, yeah)
Booty like a pillow, he can use it while he sleepin', look
Don't be goin' through my phone 'cause that's the old me (old me)
Ain't the only one tryna be my one and only (one and only)
Real thick, movin' slow, that body like codeine (hey, hey)
He a player, but for Megan, he cuttin' the whole team (hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)
That body lookin' nice (lookin' nice)
I got cake and I know he want a slice (what? What?)
I wish a nigga would try to put me on ice (huh?)
I ain't ever had to chase dick in my life (dick in my life)
I want that nasty, that freaky stuff (freaky stuff)
Live under my bed and keep me up (hey, hey)
That Hansel and Gretel, let him eat me up (ah)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Ooh, this the ride of your life (yeah, yeah)
Hold on, 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh)
Ooh, baby, we can go fast (yes)
I'll drive and you just lay back (ah)
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie (uh-huh)

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it (whoa, oh)
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on, 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)

You got me hung up from across the room
I'm so high that I'm on another altitude
And on my cloud, I got some space for you
Got a taste for you, ay

More bounce to the ounce (ay)
Pick it up, put it down (whoa)
Wanna put his Nutty Buddy in my Fudge Round (ba-ba-baow)
Pussy tighter than a bitch, he ain't had it like this (ay)
Toes curling like they throwin' gang signs on Crip (on Crip)
One thing about me, I ain't takin' no shit
He will, I know it's pissin' off his old bitch
Cesar Millan, I got his ass trained (I got his ass trained)
Gotta let a dog know who really runnin' things (huh, ah)

You've never been to Heaven, have you? (Huh?)

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on, 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back (ah)
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh)

I might take you home with this (hey)
I might give you all of it (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie (hey, hey)
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on, 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (uh-huh, uh-huh) (ay, ay, ay)

Real hot girl shit (ooh, this the ride of your life)
Me and Dua Lipa finna get the party lit (hold on, 'cause, baby, I might) 
Hm, ah (I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie)
