		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Snowqueen of Texas
Left Paris in a cloud of smoke
They say she may be beaten
But I know that she's not broke
She's living in a cool green farmhouse
If you go to Houston
Be quiet as a mouse

Met a man in Beirut
Having her name tattooed on his arm
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
Boots of Spanish leather
I never meant you any harm
I'm on my knees, your majesty
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss for me
I'm on my knees your majesty
Snowqueen of Texas

Left Paris in a cloud of smoke
They say she may be beaten
But I know that she's not broke
She's living in a cool green farmhouse
If you go to Houston
Be quiet as a mouse

She's mending a fairy tale
Reading her heart
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
That's a good motto
For some jokeman's card
I'm on my knees, your majesty
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss for me
(I'm on my knees your majesty) 
I'm on my knees your majesty
(I'm on my knees your majesty)
I'm on my knees your majesty
(I'm on my knees your majesty)
Snowqueen
Save a cold kiss for me
