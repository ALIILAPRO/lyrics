		  Welcome to the DCC, Dead Club City
Wake up in the DCC, Dead Club City
All the heaven, all the time
If you dream it, you can have it
If you believe it, it can happen
Welcome to the DCC, Dead Club City
Live your perfect life
Welcome to the

We got problems
See them gather on the shore
Empty promise
Can't say nothin' anymore
I've been shoutin'
I've been shoutin' down a hole
Hello? Watch and repeat
Saw your heaven in between
Come and get me
I'm so ready to begin
I've been hopin'
I've been hopin' for your call

Welcome to the DCC, Dead Club City
You can live your perfect life
Wake up in the DCC, Dead Club City
All the heaven, all the time, oh

Sunlit upland, a new planet
Enjoy the feelin', let it happen
If you dream it, you can have it
If you believe it, it can happen
It can happen, oh

(Welcome to the DCC)
We've got the feelings that you want
Peace, love, and understanding
We've got the feelings that you need
Take back control, be happy
(Be happy)
(Welcome to the DCC)
(Be happy)

Welcome to the DCC, Dead Club City
You can live your perfect life
Wake up in the DCC, Dead Club City
All the heaven, all the time
