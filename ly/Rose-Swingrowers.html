		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bye bye Rose, you're my love
I'll see you with my heart
We've lived highs and lows
But I know we'll get better
I'll be close to you Rose
I'll feel you everywhere
In every part of the world

Bye bye Rose I felt lost
I had to close my eyes
Carried by a storm 
I wandered for no reason
Now the wind blows 
Your scent flows
It guides me everywhere
To every star in the sky

I'll be there for you
No matter how far I go
I will cherish you
No matter if you stay
The greatest things are invisible
I need to leave you
Till I find my "because" 

Bye bye Rose, my heart glows
Illuminates the night
Out there no one knows
What I really feel for you
I just want to show
I'm grateful 'cause I know
You love me, yet you let me go

I'll be there for you
No matter how far I go
I will cherish you
No matter if you stay
The greatest things are invisible
I need to leave you
Till I find my "because" 

I'm not turning you down
We've not run out of sweet dreams
I'll seek my true inner child
To be forever your little prince
