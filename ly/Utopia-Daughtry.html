		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're all in the gutter now
With cigarettes and alcohol
Life can surely beat you down
And throw your back against the wall
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's funny how your life can change
And turn around on a dime
Yeah it can take you down the darkest lane
Then lead you into better times
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all we've known is hell, hell, hell
If we make a new world
Then we gotta story to tell wo oh, Wo oh
Will we stand together-gether-gether
Or just get torn apart part part
Let's find utopia
And that's a good place to start

Didn't claim to write the book of life
But read it all a couple times
I'd rather be soaking up the sun
And sippin' on the cheapest wine
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all we've known is hell, hell, hell
If we make a new world
Then we gotta story to tell wo oh, Wo oh
Will we stand together-gether-gether
Or just get torn apart part part
Let's find utopia
And that's a good place to start

Money can't buy us
Never said our souls were for sale
(Wo oh, Wo oh, Wo oh)
But they're gonna try us
Whether we succeed or fail
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is utopia let's make a brand new start
(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) this is utopia
Let's make a brand new start
(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all we've known is hell, hell, hell
If we make a new world
Then we gotta story to tell wo oh, Wo oh
Will we stand together-gether-gether
Or just get torn apart part part
This is utopia let's make a brand new start
(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) this is utopia
Let's make a brand new start
(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

This is utopia let's make a brand new start
