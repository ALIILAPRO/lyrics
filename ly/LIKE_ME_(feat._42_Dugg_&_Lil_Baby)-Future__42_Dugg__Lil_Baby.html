		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I got HitMan on the beat)

I got twelve watches, four bustdowns, ain't none of my shit plain
I got twenty watches, all Plain Jane and I bulletproof my Range
I got twenty bustdown watches, could've went and bought me a plane
You don't got business mind, and you ain't killed nothin'
Ain't no sense in stressin' my game
You can't turn mud into diamonds, then you won't feel my pain
Swear I used to sell drugs to buy fly shit
You don't know how far I came
I'm a real skreet nigga, I'm on that
For these millions, I play lane
Fuck up they feelings, nigga, I made it
Do what you want, bitch, when I'm payin'

God damn, rap's ten
Got about a quarter M in that van
How you doin' shit but servin' them jays
And we still duckin' them rakes

You jumpin' in that water, nigga, you just like me
I spent your salary with boss niggas who just like me
You from the truck, got the line on dog food, you just like me
You on a jet, playin' with a check, nigga, you just like me
A street nigga would finesse, dog, you just like me
You know how to play around with that Fentanyl, you just like me

You with the junkies standin' outside, just like me
Tote a hundred drum, that's just like me
Slangin' choppas, you outside, just like me
Plain watch, bust down, you just like me

Playin' catch, ain't got no lease, nigga, you just like me
You was tryna rap, get out the streets, nigga, you just like me
You love that bitch, but you can't trust her, dawg, you just like me
You hustled hard to get new Air Force 1s, you just like me
You put 'em switches on your Glock, nigga, you just like me
You ready to die behind your block, just like me, yeah, yeah
Just like me
You ready to die behind your block, just like me, yeah, yeah

If I don't pour certain lines, bro, I just can't sleep
He bought the Demon, then the Lamb', nigga, just like me
You out here riskin' it for your fam', nigga, you just like me
He went to bricks from a gram, nigga, just like me

You with the junkies standin' outside, just like me
Tote a hundred drum, that's just like me
Slangin' choppas, you outside, just like me
Plain watch, bustdown, you just like me
