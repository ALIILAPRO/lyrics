		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give anything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you

Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted?
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to touch you once again
