		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I didn't know what I was about to trade
All I know is where I saw a way
You saw the worst in me

Ooh, I didn't know where we were heading to
All I know is where I saw a truth
You saw an enemy

Wait, friend of mine
Don't run away
I grow numb with time
But I'm still awake enough
To care for both of us

Ooh, I didn't know who I was working for
Though I recall they always wanted more
They got the best of me

Wait, friend of mine
Stay for a while
I'm sure by now
You've realized
I'm not the same
Neither are you
We watched the flame
Between us turn blue
Is there enough to keep us trying
