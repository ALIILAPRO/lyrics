		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused

I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain? (Yeah, yeah)
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never (uh huh) loved someone (someone)
The way that I (way I) love you (uh, uh)

Oh, baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall (sing)
Fall

I keep on fallin' in and out (out)
Of love (love) with you (with you)
I never (never) loved someone (loved)
The way that I (I) love you

I'm fallin' in and out 
Of love (of love) with you (with you)
I never (no) loved someone (no, no)
The way that I (uh) love you

I'm fallin' in and out
Of love (of love) with you (with you)
I never (no) loved someone (no, no)
The way that I (uh) love you

What?
