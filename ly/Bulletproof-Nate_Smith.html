		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Usually these ol' neon lights
Are pretty good for bad goodbyes
They got some girls off of my mind
But baby, not tonight

'Cause I've been putting in overtime
Trying to get over your leaving
You're still right here on my mind
You sure did a number on me

I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
Eighty, ninety, everything they've got
But the whiskey don't kill like it's supposed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

There ain't no way I'm driving home
I'm three sheets, done tied one on
But this liquor ain't as strong
As your sweet love is

I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
Eighty, ninety, everything they've got
But the whiskey don't kill like it's supposed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

All my favorite country songs
Guess they must've got it wrong
'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone
You ain't gone, baby

I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
Eighty, ninety, everything they've got
But the whiskey don't kill like it's supposed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

All my favorite country songs
Guess they must've got it wrong
'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone
You ain't gone, baby
Oh oh, you ain't gone, baby
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof
