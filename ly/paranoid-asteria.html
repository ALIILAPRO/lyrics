		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear to God, I'm so paranoid with all these eyes on me
It's like everybody around me got some time for me
I swear, like, I just wanna be left all alone
All by myself inside my room is all I know
I swear to God, I'm so paranoid with all these eyes on me
It's like everybody around me got some time for me
I swear, like, I just wanna be left all alone
All by myself inside my room is all I know
'Cause I'm just sitting in my room staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout it all, thinking 'bout it all
Sitting in my room staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout it all, thinking 'bout it all
Hard decisions
If I pick either one, am I really winning
I'ma be gone in an instant the second that I am finished
Will I go missing for a minute or am I tripping, listen
Am I really doing this all for myself
It's the only thing that really help out with my mental health
I've been working real hard to play the cards that I was dealt right
But I swear all this working and working has never felt right
I swear to God, I'm so paranoid with all these eyes on me
It's like everybody around me got some time for me
I swear, like, I just wanna be left all alone
All by myself inside my room is all I know
I swear to God, I'm so paranoid with all these eyes on me
It's like everybody around me got some time for me
I swear, like, I just wanna be left all alone
All by myself inside my room is all I know
'Cause I'm just sitting in my room staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout it all, thinking 'bout it all
Sitting in my room staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout it all, thinking 'bout it all
Thinking, thinking 'bout it all
Thinking 'bout it all
I swear to God, I'm so paranoid with all these eyes on me
It's like everybody around me got some time for me
I swear, like, I just wanna be left all alone
All by myself inside my room is all I know
I swear to God, I'm so paranoid with all these eyes on me
It's like everybody around me got some time for me
I swear, like, I just wanna be left all alone
All by myself inside my room is all I know
'Cause I'm just sitting in my room staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout it all, thinking 'bout it all
Sitting in my room staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout it all, thinking 'bout it all
