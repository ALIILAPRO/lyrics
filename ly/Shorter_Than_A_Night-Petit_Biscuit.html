		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never said
That it’d be longer than a night
I never told you lies

You think I’m cold
And I agree, you never lie
You wanted more than a night

There’s something untold, that you
Hid me from the start
I can read it in your eyes

I won’t stop
Dating girls for you
Cause I’ve heard
That’s your type of guy
That denigrates you

I don’t even know
Who I am for you
But I don’t
Tell them that you’re mine
Want you to be mine

Gonna give a bit of attention
I’ve awaken a deep tension
Unhealthy intentions
Want you to be mine

You’re trynna keep me distracted
Our stories playing disrupted
Admit our love is wasted

I’ve broken this bridge between my soul
And what you see outside
Not a single doubt

I’m getting defensive at the first shadow of a doubt
I never let a tear out

I keep my fantasies
Inside out every time

Not enough
Criminal
The way the silence
Kill them all
I’m gone and it’s of little consequence

I never told you lies
I won’t stop
Dating girls for you
Cause I’ve heard
That’s your type of guy
That denigrates you

I don’t even know
Who I am for you
But I don’t
Tell them that you’re mine
Want you to be mine

Gonna give a bit of attention
I’ve awaken a deep tension
Unhealthy intentions
Want you to be mine

You’re trynna keep me distracted
Our stories playing disrupted
Admit our love is wasted

I’ve broken this bridge between my soul
And what you see outside

I’m getting defensive at the first shadow of a doubt

You fall asleep but demons
Every night - don’t you hear the last call

Not enough
Criminal
The way the silence
Kill them all
I’m gone and it’s of little consequence

Shorter than a night
