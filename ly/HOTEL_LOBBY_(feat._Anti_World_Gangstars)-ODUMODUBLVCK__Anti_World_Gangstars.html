		  (This lighter dey work?)

(Like this I suppose dey smoke igbo o, I swear)

Yeah
For their hotel lobby
With the gang I'm smoking
But they say no puffing
For their hotel lobby
Man I don light my shiba

Say I go blow big smoke o
They can't stop it
They can't stop it
Light incense, so they can't smell it
They can't smell it

For their hotel lobby
With the gang I'm smoking
But they say no puffing
For their hotel lobby
Man I don light my shiba

Say we go blow big zoot (zoot)
They can't stop it
They can't stop it
Light incense, so they can't smell it (yeah)
They can't smell it

Original ganja
Original mago man
I dey carry one type, ask olopa
Manager, this your smoking detector
E too loud, e be like coti go cramp us
For their pompit inspection
I carry kele for passenger
For her brassiere, she dey duck many
She go duck molly
Canadian kala, she dey whine move heavy

They know say me no blow no trees but
I getty quarter ounce on me for
The Kele wey dey whine pon me
And me guys them
All of them ah roll like 3

Light my bazz puff one throw-away face hn
No smoking na Wetin dey the door for the place

Fatboy Bill am up
Put am for the rizzla make you fill am up
Odumodu say make I dey feel among

For their hotel lobby
With the gang I'm smoking
But they say no puffing
For their hotel lobby
Man I don light my shiba

Say we go blow big smoke o
They can't stop it
They can't stop it
Light incense, so they can't smell it
They can't smell it

Every time we dey roll
Say na big big zoot
Smoke 'til I can't feel my face
'Til I can't move
Everybody wavy
Tell my baby move in slow mo
Only loud we dey puff
Me I'm not on kolos
More time I double cup
Make me move in slow mo
We go smoke inside
We go smoke outside
Them go fight bouncer
If him come my side
Iye iye iye

Slow and steady
Moving heavy
Rapping trappin'
Big chains big blunts
The way I move pounds
I should know King Charles
99 missed calls
100 alerts
Time done past
Plug done cast
Men done mount
Vip section
Minding my business
Rolling my kpo
(Pass the kush to the left and skip the okpo)

For their hotel lobby
With the gang I'm smoking
But they say no puffing
For their hotel lobby
Man I don light my shiba

Say I go blow big smoke o
They can't stop it
They can't stop it
Light incense, so they can't smell it
They can't smell it

I go blow the kpo di kpo
Like say I no know
Breaking all the rules
Cannot enter kom kom
Komport
Omo nigga commot
If you touch me small small
Fit to turn to consult

I go blow the kpo di kpo
Like say I no know
Breaking all the rules
Cannot enter kom kom
Komport
Omo nigga commot
If you touch me small small
Fit to turn to consult

For their hotel lobby
I go blow the kpo di kpo (di di kpo)
I go blow the smoke dey go
Like say I no know I no send
For their hotel
Um
