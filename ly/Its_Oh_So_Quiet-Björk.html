		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's oh so quiet
Shh shh
It's oh so still
Shh shh
You're all alone
Shh shh
And so peaceful until

You fall in love
Zing boom
The sky up above
Zing boom
Is caving in
Wow bam
You've never been so nuts about a guy
You want to laugh you want to cry
You cross your heart and hope to die

'Til it's over and then
Shh shh
It's nice and quiet
Shh shh
But soon again
Shh shh
Starts another big riot

You blow a fuse
Zing boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing boom
So what's the use
Wow bam
Of falling in love

It's oh so quiet
It's oh so still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until

You ring the bell
Bim bam
You shout and you yell
Hi ho ho
You broke the spell
Gee, this is swell you almost have a fit
This guy is "gorge" and I got hit
There's no mistake this is it

'Til it's over and then
It's nice and quiet
Shh shh
But soon again
Shh shh
Starts another big riot

You blow a fuse
Zing boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing boom
What's the use
Wow bam
Of falling in love

The sky caves in
The devil cuts loose
You blow blow blow blow your fuse
When you've fallen in love

Shh
