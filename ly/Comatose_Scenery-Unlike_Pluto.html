		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pay no mind
There's no reason, nothing to see
Comatose scenery, a boring dream
Take your time
When you're driving down this street
Route ain't got scenery, there's nothing to see

Pack up all my thoughts and I'll just drive
Let thoughts and my future just collide
Finding I'm moving in a circle
I am getting sick
Dizzy while I spin

Just another day, just more of the same
Monotone melodies, don't sing to me
All the shades of grey got me black and blue
What I'd give for hue, a color or two

Pack up all my thoughts and I'll just drive
Let thoughts and my future just collide
Finding I'm moving in a circle
I am getting sick
Dizzy while I spin

Stranger than fiction I don't think so oh
Stranger than fiction life will unfold
Stranger than fiction, it's an addiction, I'll never get it, not today

Pack up all my thoughts and I'll just drive
Let thoughts and my future just collide
Finding I'm moving in a circle
I am getting sick
Dizzy while I spin
