		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He said, "Mamacita, very nice to meet ya
See you is a leader, can I take you deeper?"
Ooh, you give me fever (fever)

I'm at São Paulo with me and my friend
She is a ten, I is a ten
Shut down the city, won't see us again
I am the realest, I cannot pretend
Countin' my money, I know how to spend
Mother, I apologize if I offend

Sem atrasar, sem esperar
'To sempre pronta pra chegar
Eles me veem no palco
E sabem que eu dei show
International Simbi
De Londres a São Paulo
Onde quer que vá eu faço
Da cidade o meu lugar

He said, "Mamacita, very nice to meet ya
See you is a leader, can I take you deeper?"
Oh, you give me fever (fever)

I'm out in Rio with me and my dawgs
Test drivin' all of these different cars
Don't need to say, you know who we are
Can you believe that we made it this far?
Still the same me that I've been from the start
Know what I bring, I've been playin' my part
