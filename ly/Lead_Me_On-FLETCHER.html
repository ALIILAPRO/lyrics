		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born to love you
You were born wild and free
I was made to find you
But your heart is constantly runnin'
Just never toward me

So why don't you just lead me on?
'Cause something is better than nothing at all
Yeah, I want you to lead me on
'Cause something, your something is better than nothing
Something, your something is better than nothing at all

It's hard to tame wild horses (it's hard to tame wild horses)
It's hard to stay sound asleep (sound asleep)
The thought of you is torture (the thought of you is torture)
But your heart is constantly runnin'
Just never toward me

So why don't you just lead me on?
'Cause something is better than nothing at all
Yeah, I want you to lead me on
'Cause something, your something is better than nothing
Your something, your something is better than nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

So why don't just lead me on?
'Cause something is better than nothing
At all, at all, at all

So why don't you just lead me on?
Something, your something is better than nothing
Your something, your something is better than nothing
Your something, your something is better than nothing
Just a little something, your something is better than nothing at all
