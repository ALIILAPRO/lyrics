		  Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me

Kinda sad that you always been like that
See me making waves and you don't like that
Driving through your puddles goin' splish splash
(Splish, splash, splish, splash)

Stressing over nothing baby, relax
While you gettin' angry, I'ma kick back
Only thing I think about is big stacks
(Racks, racks)

Negative days, negative nights
Baby, you're wasting all your time

I can't relate, I keep it light
No, no, no drama in my life

Wake up, yeah
Makeup, maybe
I need you, nah
I been good lately
Blowin' up 
Workin' busy

You ain't worth my love
If you only love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

You ain't worth my love 
If you only love to hate me

I'ma let you fade into the background
Baby, all my shows are gettin' too loud
Keep on turnin' it up when you want me down (me down, me down, me down)

Negative days, negative nights
Baby, you're wasting all your time

I can't relate, I keep light
No, no, no drama in my life

Wake up, yeah
Makeup, maybe
I need you, nah
I been good lately
Blowin' up
Workin' busy

You ain't worth my love
If you only love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

You ain't worth my love 
If you only love to hate me

Love to hate me, you hate to love me
I'm takin' back what you've taken from me
You're mistaken honey, this something that
Remind me why I be alone, on my own
If I needed you, I'd have you that I know, hold up
I could do bad by myself, don't need help
One of a kind, the hand that I was dealt, like oh, well
Felt, Cupid was stupid, I should have knew it
'Cause I been through it
You wouldn't do it if it ain't foolish, stupid (stupid, stupid, stupid)

애써서 활짝 웃었던 날에
밤은 왜 더 어두울까? It keeps bringing me down
Down, down
Umm 모두 너무 쉽게 내뱉던 말
아마 들리겠지 머지않아
I've heard enough, I've heard enough
Of the things that I'm not
온 세상이 바뀌어가도
아직 나는 그대론 걸
내가 걸어가는 이 길을 꿈꾸던
그때 그대로, 그때 그대로
내 매일을 춤추던
처음 그 자리에 남아 있는 걸

But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes
You'll never know 엉켜버린 내 끈
'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see
It's easier to judge me than to believe

깊이 숨겼던 낡은 생각들
가끔 나를 잡고 괴롭히지만
그럴수록 I'ma shine, baby
You know they ain't got a shot on me

Sunday night, I've been swallowed by my bed
I've been all over my head
Wonderin' if I gotta try and pretend
나도 잘 모르는 날
누가 알아주길 기대하는 내 모습을 찾을까 두려워

저 빛이 더 밝아질수록
내 그림자도 길어지는데
너무 눈이 부셔올 때
난 뒤를 볼 수 있을까?

온 세상이 바뀌어가도
아직 나는 그대론 걸
내가 걸어가는 이 길을 꿈꾸던
그때 그대로, 그때 그대로
내 매일을 춤추던
처음 그 자리에 남아 있는 걸

But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes
You'll never know 엉켜버린 내 끈
'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see
It's easier to judge me than to believe
깊이 숨겼던 낡은 생각들
가끔 나를 잡고 괴롭히지만
그럴수록 I'ma shine, baby
You know they ain't got a shot on me

가라앉으면 안 돼
나도 잘 알아
땅만 보는 채론 날 순 없어
구름 건너편엔 아직 밝은 해

내가 그려왔던 그림 속에
찢어버린 곳들까지
다 비워내고 웃을 수 있게
보기 싫었던 나와 마주할래 eh

난 기억해 so I'll be okay
파란 내 방 한가득 꽃이 피게
You know I'll always be waiting

But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes
You'll never know 엉켜버린 내 끈
'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see
It's easier to judge me than to believe

깊이 숨겼던 낡은 생각들
가끔 나를 잡고 괴롭히지만
그럴수록 I'ma shine, baby
You know they ain't got a shot on me
