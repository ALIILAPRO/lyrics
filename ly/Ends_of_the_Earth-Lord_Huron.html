		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak

Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin' why I'm-a wanderin'
Not while we're both still alive

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
Well if you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert thats size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes

Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger
Please don't say I'm goin' alone

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
Well If you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee

I was a-ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' a life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place?

I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
