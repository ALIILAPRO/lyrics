		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, hey, ayy

Baby, baby girl
Fill me up, fill me with love, yeah, yeah
You give me a feeling, I don't wanna lose, no
Baby girl, no, no
It's fillin' me up, it's fillin' me up, yeah, yeah
The feeling it feels like

Ridin' through the city
Liquor spillin' like a faucet
Phone calls to my baby
She know I be gone all night
Check in on the late night
Lord knows that I'm wrong
For cheatin' on you in the late night
Can't seem to leave her 'lone

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way

Baby, baby girl
You givin' me something that I don't feel too often
You givin' me something
I wanna taste your sweat, your tears, oh, believe me
But, baby, I don't wanna lose it
I don't wanna lose it, no

Ridin' through the city
Liquor spillin' like a faucet
Phone calls to my baby
She know I be gone all night
Check in on the late night
Lord knows that I'm wrong
For cheatin' on you in the late night
Can't seem to leave her 'lone

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, you know, I'm on my way
