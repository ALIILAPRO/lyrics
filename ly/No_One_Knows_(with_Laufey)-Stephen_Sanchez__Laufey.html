		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one knows the trouble, honey
That we've been through
No one knows the trouble, honey
That we've been through

When I left you in the cold
When you cursed at me in bold
When you broke my old guitar
When you crashed my brand new car

No one knows the trouble, honey
That we've been through, mm-hmm
Still, I know you love me, baby
I see right through

When I ran you to the edge
And you pushed me off
When I tried to tell you
And you cut me off

Lonely nights I've cried to you
There's no truth I'd hide from you
Know I've never lied to you when I said that I need you

No one knows the trouble, honey
That we've been through, mm-hmm
Still, I know I love you, baby
You see right through

You're still the picture in my locket
The lucky penny in my pocket
Still, I hate you when you're talking to me so cruel

No one knows the trouble, honey
That we've been through, mm-mm (mm-mm-hmm)
No one knows the trouble, honey
That we've been through (ha, oh-oh, oh)

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-oh, oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-oh, oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-oh, oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
