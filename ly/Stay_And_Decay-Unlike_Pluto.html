		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were on the right track
You were on the right path
Black door in the forest
 is it here to taunt us?
'Cause it's goin' nowhere  (Ah ah)
You gotta move on 'cause shadows in the dark
Are always comin' towards you (Ah)
Red eyes in the night
You put 'em out of sight
Don't be paralyzed, move onto

Nirvana or Shangri-La or Valhalla
Move 'cause if you stay in limbo
You'll decay, decay (O oh) decay

Roots, trees, branches, leaves
They're coverin' the skyline
Blockin' off the sunlight
Makin' noon like midnight (Ah ahh)
White horse on the right
It calls you to the light
Put it outta sight, you (Ah)
Need to try and see the forest from the trees
Don't be paralyzed, move onto

Nirvana or Shangri-La or Valhalla
Move 'cause if you stay in limbo
You'll decay, decay (O oh) decay

Maybe no one really knows the way
No one really knows
No one really knows the way
Broken clocks are right twice a day
No phone booths, lifelines, not today
No one really offers help anyway
No one's there to save you from this place

Nirvana or Shangri-La or Valhalla
Move 'cause if you stay in limbo
You'll decay, decay (O oh) decay
