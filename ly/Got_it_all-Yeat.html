		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in Paris, I'm in Paris, 'til they get it, uh
I got bands, sittin' on bands, told 'em, "Let's get it," uh
my money tall, your money small, your money midget, uh
I had a Tonka before I had a Urus, lil' bitch had to flip that ball
Fuck what they said about me, they don't know nothin', they know nothin', bitch
I'm in Atlanta, I'm pushin' two hundred million on billions, bitch
They said they forgot about us, but we ran it up, we touchin' money, bitch (ayy)
They said we ran it up, we touchin' millions (ayy) but we touchin' billions, bitch (shh, shh)
I don't know nothin', I don't know nobody, I'm on nothin', bitch
I'm on the boot-up, the cranky, the yanky, the Xan' the boot-up, lil' bitch
I heard the kids tryna stop me, yeah, I touched two mill', lil' bitch
I heard they tried to call God, bitch, I work with the Devil, kid

I make 'em fit on my schedule
Bitch, I do work with the Devil, huh
Bitch, I do work with the Devil, huh
I put the pack on the metal, huh
I put this bitch on the bezel, huh
I put these diamonds on diamonds on pointers on pointers 
they're not on no metal

No, I don't fit in the middle
I already went to the top, they're playin' my shit like a fiddle
huh, yeah, ayy, ayy-yeah, I'm raisin' bands, don't stop
I got a brand new drop (drop), and watch how y'all just flop, yeah
I ride in the Aventi', and I'm rockin' Balenci'
I'm rockin' that Marni, baby, and I'm rockin' that Ricky
How you tryna get stuck up, lil' bitch? This shit could get cheeky
you tryna go run up the kid, heard you tryna be blicky
I don't give a fuck 'bout this shit, I don't fuck 'bout a fifty
I bought a crib in the Hills, I done got rich
I give a fuck 'bout the feelings, lil' bitch, you suckin' the blick'
Ran up the sticks, ran up a muhfuckin' blitz, uh
They barely hear what I'm sayin' but I gotta tell you to get to that bread
I bought a Rollie that don't talk and I bought a AP to match me the face
Woah, heard you wanna pull up in Wraiths
I got a muhfuckin' Urus, I'm bootin' up in outer space

I'm in Paris, I'm in Paris, 'til they get it, uh
I got bands, sittin' on bands, told 'em, "Let's get it," uh
my money tall, your money small, your money midget, uh
I had a Tonka before I had a Urus, lil' bitch had to flip that ball
Fuck what they said about me, they don't know nothin', they know nothin', bitch
I'm in Atlanta, I'm pushin' two hundred million on billions, bitch
They said they forgot about us, but we ran it up, we touchin' money, bitch (ayy)
They said we ran it up, we touchin' millions (ayy) but we touchin' billions, bitch (shh, shh)
I don't know nothin', I don't know nobody, I'm on nothin', bitch
I'm on the boot-up, the cranky, the yanky, the Xan' the boot-up, lil' bitch
I heard the kids tryna stop me, yeah, I touched two mill', lil' bitch
I heard they tried to call God, bitch, I work with the Devil, kid

I make 'em fit on my schedule
Bitch, I do work with the Devil, huh
Bitch, I do work with the Devil, huh
I put the pack on the metal, huh
I put this bitch on the bezel, huh
I put these diamonds on diamonds on pointers on pointers 
they're not on no metal
