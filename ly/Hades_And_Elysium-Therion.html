		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bells do echo, sad is their toll
Close to Hades' misty abode
Di inferi shape the dark waving of Charon
'Cross the Styx shades must
Travel just like yours

Concealed forever within the silence
You'll feel the grief of Acheron
You'll hear the moaning from the
Tongues of the ancients
All shrouded spirit's awaiting judgement
To reach the Elysian fields
The solemn shoreline rests
In nightfall eternal

Fragments of today are close but far away
For all that is time sails in the moment
But a memory

At the crossing, three are the roads
Fate shall greet you forevermore
Will the fields of Asphodel or Elysium
Save you from every curse of Tartarus?

Concealed forever within the silence
You'll feel the grief of Acheron
You'll hear the moaning from the
Tongues of the ancients
All shrouded spirit's awaiting judgement
To reach the Elysian fields
The solemn shoreline rests
In nightfall eternal

Fragments of today are close but far away
For all that is time sails in the moment
Fragments of today are close but far away
For all that is time sails in the moment
But a memory
