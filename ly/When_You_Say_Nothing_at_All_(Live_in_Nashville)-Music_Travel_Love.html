		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Yeah, now you say it best, when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd, oh, oh
Old Mister Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Yeah, now you say it best, when you say nothing at all
Yeah, yeah

Oh, the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Oh, you say it best, when you say nothing at all

Oh, the smile on your face
The touch of your hand lets me know that you need me, girl
Lets me know that you need me, girl
