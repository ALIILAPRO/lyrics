		  (Love you, Chris)

Baby, how you doing? 
I know you're not doing the best 
But I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin' alone 
'Cause I'm here, I'm always right here
Tell me that I'm dumb, I love to get numb 
I know that I'm young, but I'm still right here
I don't give a fuck, I love who I love 
And girl, you're that one, so I'll wait right here (GothBoiClique)

Baby, how you doing? 
I know you're not doing the best 
But I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin' alone 
'Cause I'm here, I'm always right here
Tell me that I'm dumb, I love to get numb 
I know that I'm young but I'm still right here
I don't give a fuck, I love who I love (yeah)
And girl, you're that one so I'll wait right here

Baby, I'm leaving 
I'm not taking anything but you
Picture us escaping
In the background of the photo I see you
I remember the time, I remember hearts sewn together with twine
Just remember that I am still right here
And if you doubt me, that's just fine
And when it comes clear
I will be waiting right here
Just tell me if you need me 
And I will meet you right there
