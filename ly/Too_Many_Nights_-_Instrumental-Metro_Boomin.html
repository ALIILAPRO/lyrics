		  (Honorable C.N.O.T.E)
(Metro)

Keep the bitch ju-u-ump, keep it on ju-u-ump (jump)
Keep the bitch ju-u-ump
I got it cool, for a ten
The bitch get loose, she tryna win
I beat her by the house, or beat her in
There's forty in the couch, I let her spend

When it costly, you better call in
She done popped all out, she can call twin
I done went and spazzed out, I put the raw in
I done hit the strip club and spent a tall ten
Lil' shawty off the Clicquot
She been comin' hot just like a heat stroke (heat stroke) 
I could see you lurkin' through the peephole
I'm stackin' different money, type a C notes (C notes)
I'm talkin' C notes, nigga, hit CNOTE

You spend what you want and you get what you want
I guess you got what you wanted
You're hittin' the pole and you give it your all
Man, you keepin' it honest (yeah)
It's too many nights I went nameless
It's too many nights I went famous
It's too many nights I went brain insane, uh-uh-uh-uh (yeah)
Let's get dru-u-unk

Keep the bitch ju-u-ump (keep jump)
Keep the bitch jump (keep jump)
Keep the bitch-
I got it cool, for a ten
The bitch get loose, she tryna win
I beat her out the house, I beat her in
There's money in the couch, I let her spend

You made a hunnid and you fall back, did you wanna call back?
Knowin' that you're all that, bae
Always two hunnid on your dashboard, stampin' out your passport
Ask me if I'm really okay

You get what you want, you want, you want
You get what you want, you want, you want
You get what you want, you want, you want
You get what you want, you want, you want

You spend what you want and you get what you want
I guess you got what you wanted
You're hittin' the pole and you give it your all
Man, you keepin' it honest (yeah)
It's too many nights I went nameless
It's too many nights I went famous
It's too many nights I went brain insane, uh-uh-uh-uh (yeah)
Let's get dru-u-unk

Keep it on ju-u-ump (jump)
Keep it on ju-u-ump

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (keep it on ju-u-ump)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (keep it on ju-u-ump)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (keep it on ju-u-ump)

Bottega Veneta whenever you ride with me
It ain't like I'm askin' you to ride for free
From trappin' to rappin', needa be proud of me (proud of me)
Pack out the studio and throw parties (throw parties)
Money comin' too fast, I can't slow it (I can't slow it)
Feel like I'm runnin' from my past, I can't slow it down
So many nights, 'bout to crash (skrrt)
Now I'm buyin' the foreigns all cash
I can't slow down
