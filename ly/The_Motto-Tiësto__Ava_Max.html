		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's the motto (mm-mm)
Throw it back with no chaser, with no trouble (mm-mm)
Poppin' that Moët, baby, let's make some bubbles (mm-mm)
Puffin' on that gelato, wanna be seein' double
Gotta do what you gotta

Believe it
We ain't got no plans to leave here
Tell all of your friends to be here
We ain't gonna sleep all weekend

Oh, you know, you know, you know that's the motto (mm-mm)
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles (mm-mm)
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto (mm-mm)
We been up all damn summer makin' that bread and butter
Tell me, did I just stutter?
That's the motto (mm-mm)
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles (mm-mm)
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto (mm-mm)
We been up all damn summer makin' that bread and butter
Tell me, did I just stutter?
That's the motto
That's the motto

Hopped in the Range, can't feel my face, the window's down (down, down, down)
Back to my place, my birthday cake is coming out
The way it's hittin' like I could go all night
Don't want no bloodshot eyes, so hold my drink, let's fly

Believe it
We ain't got no plans to leave here
Tell all of your friends to be here
We ain't gonna sleep all weekend

Oh, you know, you know, you know that's the motto (mm-mm)
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles (mm-mm)
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto (mm-mm)
We been up all damn summer makin' that bread and butter
Tell me, did I just stutter?
That's the motto (mm-mm)
Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles (mm-mm)
Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto (mm-mm)
We been up all damn summer makin' that bread and butter
Tell me, did I just stutter?
That's the motto
That's the motto
