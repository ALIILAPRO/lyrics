		  (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh)

The show is over you can go pack up and leave
But lean a little closer, I can show you what I see
We could be together, I'll be what you think of
I can be your lover, not just someone you meet

Ayo, ayo
She'll never know, how can I get her, get her out of my dreams?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Ayo ayo
'Cause I'm not that bold, how can she be so, be so far out of reach?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)

I know, I know, I know, I said I'm sorry
I hope you go just don't forget about me
I know it's all my fault for falling for you
But I hear you calling my name, is it because of the fame
Or are you feeling the same? (Same)
I can't stop these thoughts
Babe I'm going insane

Ayo, ayo
She'll never know, how can I get her, get her out of my dreams?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Ayo ayo
'Cause I'm not that bold, how can she be so, be so far out of reach?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)

Ayo, ayo
She'll never know, how can I get her, get her out of my dreams?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Ayo ayo
'Cause I'm not that bold, how can she be so, be so far out of reach?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)

And it might be better
To run away
I might upset her worried 'bout how much I make
A thousand letters
I wrote today, ay, ay, today, ay, ay

Ayo, ayo
She'll never know, how can I get her, get her out of my dreams?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Ayo ayo
'Cause I'm not that bold, how can she be so, be so far out of reach?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)

Ayo, ayo
She'll never know, how can I get her, get her out of my dreams?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Ayo ayo
'Cause I'm not that bold, how can she be so, be so far out of reach?
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh)
