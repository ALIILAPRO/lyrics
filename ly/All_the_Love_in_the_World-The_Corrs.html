		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not looking for someone to talk to
I've got my friends, I'm more than okay
I've got more than a girl could wish for
I live my dreams, but it's not all they say

Still I believe (I'm missing)
I'm missing something real
I need someone who really sees me

(Don't want to wake) don't want to wake up alone anymore
Still believing you'll walk through my door
All I need is to know it's for sure
Then I'll give all the love in the world

I've often wondered, if love's an illusion
Just to get you through the loneliest days
I can't criticize it, I had no hesitation
My imagination just stole me away

(Still) still I believe
(I'm missing) I'm missing something real
I need someone who really sees me

(Don't want to wake) don't want to wake up alone anymore
Still believing you'll walk through my door
All I need is to know it's for sure
Then I'll give all the love in the world

Love's for a lifetime, not for a moment
So how could I throw it away? Yeah
I'm only human and nights grow colder (nights grow colder)
With no one to love me that way, yeah
I need someone who really sees me

(Don't want to wake) and I won't wake up alone anymore
Still believing you'll walk through my door
You'll reach for me and I'll know it's for sure
Then I'll give all the love in the world

Don't wanna wake up alone anymore 
Don't wanna wake up alone
Just wait for me
Don't wanna wake up alone
'Cause I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna wake up alone
Don't wanna wake up alone
