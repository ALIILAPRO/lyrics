		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't lack imagination
I'm just too scared to try
Afraid that I won't make it
But if I never step outside
Of my comfort zone, here in my home
I'll never know
Where I could go
It's worth it to make some mistakes
You miss all of the shots that you don't take

I really wanna change the world
But can't change my clothes
Wanna find a girl but can't find my phone
I just lie in bed 'til the afternoon, dreaming
'Bout the things that I wanna do
If I wanna change the world 
I should change myself
I should make my bed
I should dust the shelf
Shouldn't lie in bed 'til the afternoon
Dreaming 'bout the things that I wanna do, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
'Bout the things that I wanna do

At first my calculations
Seemed bulletproof to me
There can be no humiliation
Without accountability
If I just stay home
Here all alone
In my comfort zone
But now I know
It's worth it to make some mistakes
You miss all of the shots that you don't take

I really wanna change the world
But can't change my clothes
Wanna find a girl but can't find my phone
I just lie in bed 'til the afternoon, dreaming
'Bout the things that I wanna do
If I wanna change the world 
I should change myself
I should make my bed
I should dust the shelf
Shouldn't lie in bed 'til the afternoon
Dreaming 'bout the things that I wanna do, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
'Bout the things that I wanna do

I'd rather find out
Than regret never trying now
I won't let inhibitions take control
I'd rather fail
Than spend my life in a jail
Of my very own creation
Of my very own creation

I really wanna change the world
But can't change my clothes
Wanna find a girl but can't find my phone
I just lie in bed 'til the afternoon, dreaming
'Bout the things that I wanna do
If I wanna change the world 
I should change myself
I should make my bed
I should dust the shelf
Shouldn't lie in bed 'til the afternoon
Dreaming 'bout the things that I wanna do, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
'Bout the things that I wanna do, mm-mm
