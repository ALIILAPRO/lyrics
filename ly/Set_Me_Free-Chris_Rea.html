		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up see the morning light
This is you
This is today
You try so hard to get it right
Can't help thinking somewhere you lost your way
When was the last time
You saw a smile ?
There's a scream on every silent face you see
They're singing set me free

I got a friend
Who burns like a fire
Says there's only one thing you'll ever know
It's out there somewhere
Way out on the open road

And me I'm always looking down
Down that road out of town
Each morning and night
You can see me
I'm singing set me free
Set me free

Goodnight Auberge
I leave you now
You must sleep
While I work the day
Till I return
To dream of you
Through the night
And that free, freeway
