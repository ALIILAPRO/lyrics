		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you need is instant gratification
(You desire nothing more)
Kill the weak then crawl back into the darkness
(Settle down and start your war)

I've been living life in monochrome
I'm the grey upon the sea
So entangled up in the brevity
And the constant tragedy

I see myself in the grave defiled
It's constantly draining
Anxiety's is all mine
It's like I'm bleeding through for you

This is clarification that we're spinning out of control
You don't care if I ever make it out alone

I've been living life in monochrome
I'm the grey upon the sea
So entangled up in the brevity
And the constant tragedy

I've been drowning in the undertow
In the face of every fear, in the eye of the storm
Longing for a touch of serenity
'Cause it's overwhelming me

I'd say my piece but it takes a while
I'm missing the right words
My feelings are on fire
It's like I'm bleeding through for you

This is clarification that we're spinning out of control
You don't care if I ever make it out alone

I've been living life in monochrome
I'm the grey upon the sea
So entangled up in the brevity
And the constant tragedy

All you need is instant gratification
(You desire nothing more)
Kill the weak then crawl back into the darkness
(Settle down and start your war)
