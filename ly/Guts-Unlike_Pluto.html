		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're pulling me inside of the darkness
Dark-darkness, rain-rain fall on me
You're pulling me inside of the darkness
Dark-darkness, rain-rain fall on me
But now that I can't live without you, without you
I'm stuck in your dreams, what can I do?

You make me sick to my guts
You make me sick to my guts
You make me sick to my guts

Sometimes I feel like I'm burning away
You gave me a path without a future
Took all my life to realize
That I am gone

How do you see me in your mind?
There's nothing left but our cries
Spit fire and dark nights

You're pulling me inside of the darkness
Dark-darkness, rain-rain fall on me
You're pulling me inside of the darkness
Dark-darkness, rain-rain fall on me
But now that I can't live without you, without you
I'm stuck in your dreams, what can I do?

You make me sick to my guts
You make me sick to my guts
You make me sick to my guts

Lucky for you I wasn't the same
Old habits die hard with no escape
Lucky for me you didn't know that I am gone

Won't you slice up my pain?
Let it bleed from my veins
I know we'll meet again

You're pulling me inside of the darkness
Dark-darkness, rain-rain fall on me
You're pulling me inside of the darkness
Dark-darkness, rain-rain fall on me
But now that I can't live without you
I'm stuck in your dream, what can I do?

I'm sick to my guts
You make me sick to my guts
You make me sick to my guts
You make me sick to my guts
