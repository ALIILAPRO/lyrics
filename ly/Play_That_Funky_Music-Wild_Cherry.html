		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey do it now, yeah hey

Once I was a boogie singer
Playin' in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems yeah
Burnin' down the one night stands
Then everything around me, yeah
Got to stop to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly, yes I did
To disco down and check out the show
Yeah they were

Dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die
'Til you die, oh yeah yeah

Well, I tried to understand this (yeah)
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish (how could I)
To not see I was the one behind
So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way
I said, I must go back there (I got to go back)
And check to see if things still the same

Yeah they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
'Til you die, yeah
Oh 'til you die

(Gonna play some electified funky music, yeah)

(Hey, wait a minute)
Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' rock and roll and minds 
Yeah, things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
Oh, but now its so much better (it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (no I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die
'Til you die, yeah
Oh 'til you die

They shouted play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(You gotta keep on playin' funky music)
Play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(Want to take you higher, ya)
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
