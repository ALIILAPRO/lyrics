		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, who that in the Lambo?
That's them Last King boy, huh?
Last King Records takin' over for the 2016 'til forever

I got bitches in my swimming pool
Real life mermaids
Models in my living room
Lined by Hermes
Yeah nigga
Somebody must have heard me when I prayed
'Cause I'm paid cash money
Cash Money never paid me
But your boy did his thing
And still make cash money
Yeah it's mine I can throw it in the air if I wanna

Rolex, mo' sex
T-Raww, gon' flex
Bad bitches
Ass, chest
Rich niggas, no stress
Smoke when I wanna
Ball when I wanna
Fuck who I wanna
Everything a hundred
My cars diamond diamond
Still minks in the summer
Ice in my grill
Tattoos on my stomach
Yeah, she break it down
Break break it down
I'm in the cut
Talkin' chop, choppa style
Yeah that choppa style
Chit chat choppa style
We lived a lot
Nigga we on a loud
Ugh private jet
Bubble legs
Super famous don't need no press
I'mma hot boy shout out Weezy baby
If your man is low
Nigga, you should pay 'em

I got bitches in my swimming pool
Real life mermaids
Models in my living room
Lined by Hermes
Yeah nigga
Somebody must have heard me when I prayed
'Cause I'm paid cash money
Cash Money never paid me
But your boy did his thing
And still make cash money
Yeah it's mine I can throw it in the air if I wanna

I don't be talkin' a lot
She be frontin' a lot
Wanna pull up on the block
Bitches rubbin' their twat
I'm in the car with a vibe
Yeah the car cost a lot
Now she fuckin' a lot
Yeah we fuckin' a lot
Now she rubbin' my cock
Yeah we huggin' the block
Put your face on my watch
Yeah it's chrome on my watch (All ice)
I got hella hoes believe me
Tell 'em bitches pimpin' ain't easy
I'm on top with the top down
One Loc with the sugar and I'm sauced out
I'm hot now
Played with fire, I ain't never drown
Ballin' out number 1
With assist now
Big hits, mo' rich
New car, new bitch
I'm a hot boy, free B.G
Free the Carter V, let your streets eat

I got bitches in my swimming pool
Real life mermaids
Models in my living room
Lined by Hermes
Yeah nigga
Somebody must have heard me when I prayed
'Cause I'm paid cash money
Cash Money never paid me
But your boy did his thing
And still make cash money
Yeah it's mine I can throw it in the air if I wanna

I got bitches in my swimming pool
Real life mermaids
Models in my living room

Somebody must have heard me when I prayed
'Cause I'm paid cash money
Cash Money never paid me
But your boy did his thing
And still make cash money
Yeah it's mine I can throw it in the air if I wanna
