		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling sick of myself
Think I'll try to be someone else
Can't be hard to paint a person
In my head create a version
The parallel

Pull my head out the sand
Try as hard as I can
Guess I must be satisfactory
You said you love me exactly the way I am
And you know I find it hard to understand
Pay a visit to the doctor 'cause I have

A sweet tooth for you
I'm wide awake
The sugar went straight to my brain
Feel like a kid, I double tap
My chest with my fist

I like you
Say it back
Say it back

Never had a cavity
Never had nobody as sweet as you
Smooth around the edges, good as new
Gently insulating every rendezvous

Caught myself blaming planets, like you do
I know every line and curve of your tattoos

A sweet tooth for you
I'm wide awake
The sugar went straight to my brain
Feel like a kid, I double tap
My chest with my fist

I like you
Say it back
Say it back

Sweet tooth for you
My dreamin' space
It's filled with scribbles, tore the page
Decipher them with colored paint
Repair the stitches in my veins
Sweet tooth for you
My honeydew
I'll see you in my garden soon
Beneath the skin, it's cardiac
A safety pin

I like you
Say it back
