		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

I usually love sleepin' all alone
This time around, bring your friend with you
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often (baby)
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class grey 'matic (oh)
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew back in town
She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man, it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often (she rode the wave)
Bitches down to do it either way (baby), often
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often (baby, I can make that pussy rain)
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

Ooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again

She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often
Bitches down to do it either way, often (bitches down to do it)
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
