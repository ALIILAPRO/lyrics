		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does it ever get lonely
Up where its holy
With your head in clouds
My gravities pulling you all the way you down
Does it ever get heavy
When Holding me steady
Picking me up off the ground
I know its not easy to have me around
It's hard to see from way down here but hope you're happy still
Cause If i were to disappear
Don't know if you could tell

Cause You
You live in a castle in the sky
Does my baggage ever make it hard to fly
So high up that I'm feeling out of touch
Promise me I'm
Not too much
Not too much for you

Cause You live in a castle in the sky
When it's raining you're my sun that always shines
So high up wish that i could see the view
Promise me
I'm not too much
Not too much
For you

Tell me what did you do to deserve this shit
Sorry I never could change but you still insist
Am i to blame darling for all of your pain wondering
Why do you stay
Only god knows how i got to be with you
You live in a castle in the sky
Does my baggage ever make it hard to fly
So high up that I'm feeling out of touch
Promise me I'm
Not too much
Not too much for you

Cause You live in a castle in the sky
When it's raining you're my sun that always shines
So high up wish that i could see the view
Promise me
I'm not too much
Not too much
For you
