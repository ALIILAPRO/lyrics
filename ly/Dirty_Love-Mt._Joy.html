		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you think I think too much
But I don't know if it's enough
Dirty love, all I want are your eyes on mine
And underneath of it all
I dream of a thousand shooters
Hallelujahs, are unable to save us

But did I ever want love?
Or, did I ask too much?
Young dirty love, come get us strung
Let's cover up what we really want

And, all you see and all you feel
Are skin and bones they don't hold the show like real love
No, you can't control who you really are or what you really want
So, I met you in the hotel, dim little lobby
I've been on the road since you last saw me
And I don't need a reason to bleed until we're even

But did I ever want love?
Or, did I ask too much?
Young dirty love, come get us strung
Let's cover up what we really want, oh

Oh, is it any wonder our love
Isn't what we thought it was?
Is it any wonder our love
Isn't what we thought it was?
Is it any wonder, oh lord
Is it any wonder our love
Isn't what we thought it was?
When all we do is hurt ourselves
