		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind
And slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he sat there
Staring into space
No sign of life
Would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye
And then he died

Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Yeah I will start again
It can take forever, and ever whatever, whenever, but I'll still win

How many like him
Are they still
Who to us all
Seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands
Lank and lost
Is knowledge worth this bitter cost

Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
Beyond the realms of death
