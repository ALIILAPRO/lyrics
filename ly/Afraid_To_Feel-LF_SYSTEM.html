		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes 
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel 
What you know is real
Like any other guy?

Oh, babe, I'm the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes 
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel 
What you know is real
Like any other guy?

Oh, babe, I see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes 
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel 
What you know is real
Like any other guy?

Oh, playing with my heart will get you nothing
You've got to come on inside
My heart's an open door 
Who could ask for more?
Come on in for a ride

Can't stop (can't stop) 
What I'm doing (what I'm doing)
What I'm doing to you
Can't stop turnin' you on

Oh, you see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes 
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel 
What you know is real
Like any other guy?

Oh, playing with my heart will get you nothing
You've got to come on inside
My heart's an open door 
Who could ask for more?
Come on in for a ride

Can't stop (can't stop) 
What I'm doing (what I'm doing)
What I'm doing to you
Can't stop turnin' you on

Can't stop (can't stop) 
What I'm doing (what I'm doing)
What I'm doing to you
Can't stop turnin' you on

Oh, you see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes 
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel 
What you know is real
Like any other guy?

Oh, playing with my heart will get you nothing
You've got to come on inside
My heart's an open door 
Who could ask for more?
Come on in for a ride

Can't stop (can't stop) 
What I'm doing (what I'm doing)
What I'm doing to you
Can't stop turnin' you on
