		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on, boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
Why am I feeling about you?
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm 
Music will take you high

Sun is up, move your body
I got moves and all the night I will not sit, yeah
I came up for this party
I will stop when Mr. DJ stops the beat, yeah
Sun is up (whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Sun is up (whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Sun is up (whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Sun is up (whoa-oh)

All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on, boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
Why am I feeling about you?
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm 
Music will take you high, whoa

All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on, boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
Why am I feeling about you?
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm 
Music will take you high, whoa
