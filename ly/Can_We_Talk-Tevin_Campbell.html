		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I
I saw you standing
And I started
Started pretending
I knew you and you knew me too
And just like a Roni
You were too shy
But you weren't the only
'Cause so was I
And I've dreamed of you ever since
Now I've built up my confidence
The next
Next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name

I started
To write you letters
But I wanted
To be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey baby
But just like a baby I could not talk
And I tried to come closer but could not walk
And I think of it every night
How I just could not get it right, oh
If we ever come close again
I know what I'll say then, yeah

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name

Oh, girl
One more chance
With you again
I will not let it go
Oh, please
Give me just one more chance
For love, love, love, love

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name

Can we talk for a minute?
Come on and talk to me baby
Say I want to know
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute? 

I said can we talk for a minute
Come on and talk to me baby
See I wanna know
You better tell your name, baby

Can we talk for a minute?
I said talk to me for a minute
Come and talk for a minute
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know your name 

Can we talk for a minute?
Talk to me for a minute
Come and talk for a minute
Come on, come on, come on and talk to me, yeah
