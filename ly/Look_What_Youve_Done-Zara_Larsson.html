		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look what you've done, look what you've done

And now they're playin' our favorite song that
We used to dance to, nights like tonight
The paint is fading, feels so amazing
To know you hurt me for the last time

So I ain't crying anymore
I'm stronger than I was before
You keep calling me again
But I keep dancing anyway

'Cause now that you're gone, I'm number one
Boy, I should thank you for who I've become
Don't need no one, this girl's having fun
Watch me catch fire, yeah, look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done

The beat puts my body next to somebody
Ain't no more tears now, I'm lost in time
Can't take your eyes off this new life that I've got
Boy, I should thank you 'cause this helped me shine

So I ain't crying anymore
I'm stronger than I was before
But you keep calling me again
But I keep dancing anyway

'Cause now that you're gone, I'm number one
Boy, I should thank you for who I've become
Don't need no one, this girl's having fun
Watch me catch fire, yeah, look what you've done
Look what you've done (look what you've done, look what you've done)
Look what you've done
Look what you've done (look what you've done, look what you've done)
Look what you've done (look what you've done)

Baby, can't you see what you've done to me?
Look what I've become, look what you have done
Look what you have done

'Cause now that you're gone, I'm number one
Boy, I should thank you for who I've become (who I've become)
Don't need no one, this girl's having fun
Watch me catch fire, yeah, look what you've done
Look what you've done (look what you've done, look what you've done)
Look what you've done
Look what you've done (look what you've done, look what you've done)
Look what you've done (look what you've done)
