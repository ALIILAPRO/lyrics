		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're trying to replace yourself
You're trying to replace yourself, you're trying to replace yourself
You're trying to replace yourself, you're trying to replace yourself
You're trying to replace yourself, you're trying to replace yourself
You're trying to replace yourself, you're trying to replace yourself

Carving out a fact from a reckoning, beckoning you back, skin sagging off its skeleton
Levitating off the ground is another man wearing your face
cll the other false identities, remedies or enemies to mitigate your memories
Shuddered at what they found when they stripped away the grace

Eulogy or biography, I'm who I oughtta be, and that is God to me
(never never never)
So, my God, what's wrong with me? If who I wanna be might be
Never Never Never. Never Never Never. Never Never Never. No, never.

You'll never take me alive, baby. You'll never take me alive
You'll never take me, you'll never take me, you better pray that I die
You'll never take me alive, baby. You'll never take me alive
You'll never take me, you'll never take me, and no, you're never gon' find

Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself
Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself

Damn, I thought you're not your imposter. You're so sure you're not gonna get caught
Dead in your own skin, but you didn't choose what you were born in
cnd another man in your repertoire, ready in your head and fed upon your memoirs
Still the same rules apply from the birthday to the mourning

What you feel and what you do; are those things really you? cnd if not, then what is?
(never never never)
So, my God, what's wrong with you? cnd I'm still asking who that is
Never Never Never. Never Never Never. Never Never Never. No, never.

You'll never take me alive, baby. You'll never take me alive
You'll never take me, you'll never take me, you better pray that I die
You'll never take me alive, baby. You'll never take me alive
You'll never take me, you'll never take me, and no, you're never gon' find

Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself
Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself

You'll never take me alive, baby. You'll never take me alive
(This is not enough! This is not enough to prove it yet)
You'll never take me, you'll never take me, you better pray that I die
(No, I need to hit the bottom)
You'll never take me alive, baby. You'll never take me alive
(This is not enough! This is not enough to prove it yet)
You'll never take me, you'll never take me, you better pray that I die
(No, I need to hit the bottom)

Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself
Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself
Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself
Somebody to replace yourself, Somebody to replace yourself
