		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired
Of tending to this fire
I've used up all I've collected
I have singed my hands
It's glowing
Embers barely showing
Proof of life in the shadows
Dancing on my plans

They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over

The burning
Is so low it's concerning
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It's a glorious gone
It's only time before they show me
Why no one ever comes back
With details from beyond

They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know
They know

In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive

They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know

Last year
I needed change of pace
Couldn't take the pace of change
Moving hastily
But this year
Though I'm far from home
In TRENCH I'm not alone
These faces facing me

They know
They know
What I mean
