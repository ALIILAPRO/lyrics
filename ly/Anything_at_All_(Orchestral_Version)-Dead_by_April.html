		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Protected by these walls I've built
But what's inside I've already killed
â€¨Nobody knows what I've been through 
Nobody knows that it was you
You destroyed everything 

Echoing in my head
Is the ripple effect
Of all the words you said 
The words that scarred my heart 
They really hit me hard
But that's just who you are

There were too many lies for me to memorize
And I never make the same mistake twice
I bet the truth weighs heavily on you
It must be

Echoing in my head 
Is the butterfly effect
Of your biggest mistake
I'm a violent earthquake
Splitting a tectonic plate 
In two and I'm not afraid of you

Did I mean anything at all to you
Did I mean anything at all to you
Do you think about us every now and then
Because I do
Did I mean anything at all to you

I'm not
Afraid
Of you
