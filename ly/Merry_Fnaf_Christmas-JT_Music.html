		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the time of year for christmas cheer
And Santa's on his way
With his 8 reindeer, we're waiting here
Excited for the slay we've been so nice
Through all these nights
We'd love for you to stay
Making childring smile and all the while
We're rotten and decayed

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Don't you run away
Freddy's got a special present
Here on Christmas day
Jingle bells, jingle bells happy Holidays
Come grab a slice, the end of your life
Is five more nights away

Oh the weather's bad tonight
Stay inside and have a bite
Sing with us and spread delight
Cuz we don't have a tree to light
The power's off, we cut the phones
Here's a suit to call your own
Try it on, welcome home
You'll never spend another
Christmas all alone

Bonnie brought a stocking for you
That you've gotta hang up
Chica's wrapping presents
Foxy's chugging all the eggnog
Freddy's setting up a snack
For Santa Claus to have
And we hope he likes Pepperoni Pizza
That was all we had

Silent night, holy night it's all in my head
We may be dead, but we won't forget
The way we met our end
But it's the time to reconcile
And leave behind regrets
The only gift that's on our list
Is imminent revenge

Oh the weather's bad tonight
Stay inside and have a bite
Sing with us and spread delight
Cuz we don't have a tree to light
The power's off, we cut the phones
Here's a suit to call your own
Try it on, welcome home
You'll never spend another
Christmas all alone

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We're back cuz we know you missed us
Take this, it's a little gift
That we hope you might wear

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We know just how much you missed us
We'll give you a scary Christmas
Five nights of nightmares

Oh the weather's bad tonight
Stay inside and have a bite
Sing with us and spread delight
Cuz we don't have a tree to light
The power's off, we cut the phones
Here's a suit to call your own
Try it on, welcome home
You'll never spend another
Christmas all alone
