		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a bad idea, me and you

I know, I totally agree

It's a bad idea, me and you

I've never known anything so true

It's a terrible idea, me and you

You have a wife

You have a husband

You're my doctor

You've got a baby coming

It's a bad idea, me and you
Let's just keep kissing 'til we come to

Heart, stop racing
Let's face it, making mistakes like this will make worse what was already pretty bad
Mind, stop running
It's time we just let this thing go
It was a pretty good bad idea, wasn't it though?

It's a bad idea, me and you
It's a bad idea, me and you
Hold me close while I think this through
Yeah, it's a very poor idea, me and you

Heart, stop racing
Let's face it, making mistakes like this will make worse what was already pretty bad
Mind, stop running
It's time we just let this thing go
It was a pretty good bad idea, wasn't it though?

I know it's right for me
It's the only thing I've ever done
What if I never see myself ever be anything more
Than what I've already become?

I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea

I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
Just one

Heart, keep racing
Let's make mistakes
Let us say "so what?" and make worse what was already pretty bad
This secret is safe
No reason to throw it away when there's love to be had
Hold me tight as I tell myself that you might make sense
And make good what has been just so bad
Let's see this through
It's a pretty good bad idea
Me and you
