		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We stand upon a travesty
At the mouth of the gods
Holding our hands out for affirmation
Peering over the edge with our back to the wind
We're screaming out for release into the emptiness

Swept away, beneath the undertow
Laid to waste by our mistakes

Conspiring, we blur the line 
Between dependence and blind addiction
Permeating everyday monotony
Left to bear a crutch of complacency

I don't fuck with fate
Everything is crashing around me
But I don't feel pain
I've given up

Now we have finally reached the reckoning
So now I wait for the day that we give up our place
Only the void remains, welcome to eternity

All hope swept out of my hands
There's nothing you can take from me
No future waits, an origin erased

Bottled up and useless
Broken and insatiable
Cover up our weakness
Existence unsustainable
Staring down devastation
I will welcome the end
If only for the chance to feel again

I curse this earth, for my soul is tired
Burning brighter
Burning brighter
Burning brighter
On the fire

Curse this earth, for my soul is tired
Burning brighter
Burning brighter
Burning brighter
On the fire

Now we have finally reached the reckoning
So now I wait for the day that we give up our place
Only the void remains, welcome to eternity

All hope swept out of my hands
There's nothing you can take from me
No future waits, an origin erased

We're dying in the storm
While our world lays burning
Beneath the embers we choke
We're nothing but a memory

A bed of atrophy, a resting place
And though the rain grows heavy
Our tears will never dull the flames
