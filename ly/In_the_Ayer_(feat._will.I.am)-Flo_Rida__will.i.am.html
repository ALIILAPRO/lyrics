		<p>
		  Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partying 'til the AM
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partying 'til the AM
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Hey this is my jam
Y'all don't understand
I'll make you understand
What's pumpin' in my CD player (player)
Party all night like yayer (yayer)
Shawty got a hand in the ayer (ayer)
Make me want to take it da yer
Then I go, here I go, here is my song
Dj bring it back come in my zone
I get paid for them couple bones
The next wop until the early morn
I need that crunk when I'm up in tha club
Even my when my Chevy pull up on them dubs
Give me that drop yellow waist like a drug
Lil mama hot and she might show me love
Oh hot damn
Celebrate to tha AM
I love it so much it got me sayin

Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partying 'til the AM
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partying 'til the AM
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Hey hey I might just start the wave
Like I'm at a ball game do my thang
Hands up high I got money in tha bank
I'm so fly 747 pain
Rock it no stop it how I got my name
Baby keep poppin' you might get tha fame
Walk tha red carpet wont see you the same
I get tha stuntin' forget my name
Start with me, ride with me
Represent tha city vibe with me
Make me throw it up ma timid in tha club
Go ahead throw it up gotta wonder
How much to show enough to stare (stare)
I'm hood so it's really unfair (unfair)
Shorty go ahead and get bare (bare)
We aint gonna treat our city like the mayor (mayor)

Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partying 'til the AM
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer
Ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer
Ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Alright now stop (oh-oh)
Put your hands in the ayer
It's a stick up (stick up stick up)
It's a stick up, touch the ceiling, baby
Put your hands in the
Put your hands up, put your
Put your hands in the
Put your hands up to the sky
Wave 'em 'round and 'round and side to side

It's a party, shawty, go and touch the roof

And we got the bottles poppin' so throw your hands in the ayer
Touch the ceiling baby

Feel it, feel it baby, throw your hands up

Oh hot damn (damn), this is my jam (jam)
Keep me partying 'til the AM
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer
Ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer
Ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, (throw your hands up)
