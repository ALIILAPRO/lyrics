		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In it just for the clout
You're just a spineless scum
There's nothing left but a scorched earth when you're done
You got what you wanted
But you still can't feel anything
Now choke on it bitch
Swallow it all don't bite it
Like a vulture
(You circle around me)
I see through you
(These words are empty)
Your life purpose is being somebody else
On your own you are worthless
Never enough, all-consuming voice is calling your name
Was it worth it in the end?
Was it worth it in the end?
Never enough, all-consuming voice is calling your name
Was it worth it in the end?
Was it worth it in the end?
Never enough, all-consuming voice is calling your name
Tunnel visioned, your true intentions are still the same
Your intentions are still the same
I feel infected by you
Yet I still let you stay
Forever cursed by your presence
Dragging me down once again
Always around me
Consuming all what is left
But on the inside
Rotting away
Like a vulture
(You circle around me)
I see through you
(These words are empty)
Your life purpose is being somebody else
On your own you are worthless
Never enough, all-consuming voice is calling your name
Tunnel visioned, your true intentions are still the same
You bit more than you could chew
So now fucking choke on it motherfucker
A two-faced piece of shit like you
Belongs in the gutter
Suffocate on your lies
There is no help in sight
No one would trust a fucking leech like you
Fucking leech like you
