		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days it's hard to see
If I was a fool, or you, a thief
Made it through the maze to find my one in a million
Now you're just a page torn from the story I'm living

And all I gave you is gone
Tumbled like it was stone
Thought we built a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake
Thought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made
Thought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up

The scar I can't reverse
When the more it heals the worse it hurts
Gave you every piece of me, no wonder it's missing
Don't know how to be so close to someone so distant

And all I gave you is gone
Tumbled like it was stone
Thought we built a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake
Thought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made
Thought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up

It all fell down, it all fell down,
It all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down
It all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down, it
It all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell down

And all I gave you is gone
Tumbled like it was stone
Thought we built a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake
Thought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made
Thought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up

It all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down, it
It all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell down
It all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down (and all I gave you is gone)
Thought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up
