		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life, yeah
'Cause I was sittin' there bored to death
And in just one breath he said

You gotta get up
You gotta get off
You gotta get down, girl

You know you drive me crazy, baby
You've got me turning to another man
Called you on the phone
No one's home 

Baby, why'd you leave me all alone?
And if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do, yeah

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

You know I hopped into my car, didn't get very far, no
Before I had you on my mind, why be so unkind?
You've got your women all around
All around this town
But I was trapped in love with you and I didn't know what to do

But when I turned on my radio
I found out all I needed to know
Check it out

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

Hey, listen up to your local DJ
You better hear what he's got to say
There's not a problem that I can't fix
'Cause I can do it in the mix
And if your man gives you trouble
Just you move out on the double 
And you don't let it trouble your brain

'Cause away goes trouble down the drain 
Said away goes trouble down the drain

Well alright

Double time

Last night a DJ saved my life

There's not a problem that I can't fix
'Cause I can do it in the mix
'Cause I can do it in the mix
In the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix
In the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix
