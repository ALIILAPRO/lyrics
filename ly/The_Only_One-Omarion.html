		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the moment you came in
You knew I been watching
Been picturing you out of
Them clothes that you wearing
Get naked
Girl can you blame me?
When your hair long and your ass fat
And you know how much I like that
Heels high and that dress tight
And I'm wondering why you wore that
To tease me
Can't be no other reason

And there's so many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here that's so so fine
But shawty I can't lie

Out of all of these girls in this club
You're the only one that I wanna
You're the only one that I wanna fuck, baby

Out of all of these girls on this floor
You're the only one that I wanna
You're the only one I wanna take home, baby

Gone get your drink and them drinks on me don't trip
I'm lost in the moment you got a nigga horny
I promise (soon as we get back to the crib tho)
I'm a put it on you
I wanna be covered in your lip stick
And wearing your fragrance
Whatever the name is
I don't really care put it on me
You know you want me, yeah

And there's so many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here that's so so fine
But shawty I can't lie

Out of all of theses girls in this club
You're the only one that I wanna
You're the only one that I wanna fuck, baby

Out of all of these girls on this floor
You're the only one that I wanna
You're the only one I wanna take home, baby

Holla at me shawty right before you know you leaving
I'm here for the night
I'm staying at the four seasons
If you wanna roll, if you wanna roll
Shawty you can go, shawty you can go
Shawty you can go, shawty you can go
