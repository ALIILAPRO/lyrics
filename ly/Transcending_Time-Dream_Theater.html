		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drifting in a far off place
I roam the countryside
Seeking wings of thought
Waiting in the blind

Enchanted and transfixed
I am pulled into the still
By a backward ticking clock
Held against my will

Illusions turn to dust
Scatter to the wind
Like dreaming while awake

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Midnight in the garden
Digging for a spark
Where seeds of inspiration
Lie buried in the dark

Attention starts to wonder
As the poet lifts his pen
And the critic from within
Is silenced once again

Limits leave no trace
Ashes in the rain
Lost and far away

Signals in the mist
Altered state of mind
Stars in the abyss
Transcending time

Signals in the mist
Stars in the abyss

Euphoric obsession
Without conscious intention
Being pulled by the current
On a vessel steered by someone else

Transcending time, transcending time
Transcending time, transcending time
