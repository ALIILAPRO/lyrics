		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's Britney fuckin' Manson, ah)

Like a face of beauty clinic, a cosmetic exclusivity
I'm a precious baby, and my driver in infinity
I just got my puss done, and I think that was fun
And my lips are so expensive, you could never be the one

Ah (yeah), I have it all
A-A-A-Ah (woah), I have it done
I know what you want
(Come on baby, I'm so hot)
Ah (yeah), look like a god
Ah (woah), I'll do my slutty pop
Bitch, don't try to take me out
(I'm expensive, you're not)

We poppin' out the party, with bottles of Bacardi
This ho, she really wants me
(And he can't get enough of me)
This girl is so expensive
This shit don't make no sense, bitch
I bring her to the mansion
It's Britney fuckin' Manson
Poppin' out the party, with bottles of Bacardi
This ho, she really wants me
(And he can't get enough of me)
This girl is so expensive
This shit don't make no sense, bitch
I bring her to the mansion
It's Britney fuckin' Manson

I got one, two, three, four pretty bitches with me
Poppin' off bottles, sippin' on Whitney
I don't give a fuck if my lifestyle kills me
I been posted up in the club with Britney (oh yeah)
Pourin' up a four while I'm smokin' up a pack
All these bitches know me, had to tell them to throw it back (ah-ah)
All these bitches know me, had to tell them to throw it back
All these bitches know me, had to tell them to throw it-

Like ah, I feel like a god
Got any bitch I want, I walk into the club
These bitches fiendin' for my cock
I feel like a god
Got any bitch I want, I walk into the club
These bitches fiendin' for my cock

We poppin' out the party, with bottles of Bacardi
This ho, she really wants me
(And he can't get enough of me)
This girl is so expensive
This shit don't make no sense, bitch
I bring her to the mansion
It's Britney fuckin' Manson
Poppin' out the party, with bottles of Bacardi
This ho, she really wants me
(And he can't get enough of me)
This girl is so expensive
This shit don't make no sense, bitch
I bring her to the mansion
It's Britney fuckin' Manson

Ah (ah-ah-ah)
