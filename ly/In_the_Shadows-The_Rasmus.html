		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer

Sometimes I feel like going down I'm so disconnected
Somehow I know that I am haunted to be wanted

I've been watching, I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrow's all my life
In the shadows
In the shadows

They say that I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
But I, I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave

Sometimes I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
Somehow I just don't want to stay and wait for a wonder

I've been watching, I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrow all my life

Lately, I've been walking, walking in circles
Watching, waiting for something
Feel me, touch me, heal me
Come take me higher

I've been watching, I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrow all my life

I've been watching, I've been waiting
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrow

Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows 
Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows 
I've been waiting
