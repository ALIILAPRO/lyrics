		  Let me see what ya working with

Ahhh

Shawty bad
Better dance like a stripper
She want this cash
Better dance like a stripper
Shake that ass baby
Dance like a stripper
You want this cash right
Dance like a stripper
Shawty shake that ass
Shake it on the floor
You want cash
Gimme mo
Dance like a stripper
Shawty Bad
She can dance like a stripper

She badder than a bitch
But I don't really know her name
I just call her red bottom
Gotta mean shoe game
Well you know
They call me million
Swagger on infinity
I want this bitch bad
Thank god she ain't no kin to me
Hair to her ass
Shawty know I like that
Hit the mall last week
Now she right back
Sitting pretty
Her beamer 650
Getting brown bag money
Tax free on you bitches
You can tell she got ass
From the side view
Street smart
Not them hoes that you lie too
She a single mother
But she paid bitch
Everything designer
She don't wear that fake shit

Shawty bad
Better dance like a stripper
She want this cash
Better dance like a stripper
Shake that ass baby
Dance like a stripper
You want this cash right
Dance like a stripper
Shawty shake that ass
Shake it on the floor
You want cash
Gimme mo
Dance like a stripper
Shawty Bad
She can dance like a stripper

Let me dance on it
Throw them bands on it
Suki ah never
Put no hands on it
I don't like zelle
I like cash only
Double c's
Bags only
Too much ass on me
Cant barely walk
With this cat on me
Good pussy gotta tax on me
Gotta walk around
With that strap on me
Bitch I'm gucci down
Louie down
Rich bitch
You better ask around
Riding round
With that 4 pound
Fuck nigga play
It's going down
Bitch I'm outside
You hoes tied
If I want that nigga
He gone be mine
Broke niggas on decline
Need a rack
For this feline
Get the head
Then get a peace sign
Get the head
Then get a peace sign
Suki

Shawty bad
Better dance like a stripper
Like a stripper
She want this cash
Better dance like a stripper
Bend it over
Shake that ass baby
Dance like a stripper
Shake that ass hoe
You want this cash right
Dance like a stripper
Right
Shawty shake that ass
Shake it on the floor
Going up
You want cash
Gimme mo
Turn it
Dance like a stripper
Shawty Bad
She can dance like a stripper

Cool ass maine
On the beat
Yeah he did that
