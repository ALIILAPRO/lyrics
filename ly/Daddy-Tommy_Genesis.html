		  Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Who made the beat? Charlie

He like me better with no makeup
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
He call me""Daddy's little Geisha""
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
I'm makin' love with his face, uh
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Charlie gonna make the bass bump
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?

Two in a row, fuckin' it up, I do what I want
I like to floss, big like a boss, hash in the blunt (Got hash in the blunt)
He just say he love me, I can't say it back
He just bought me diamonds, I don't feel bad
Let 'em smell the flower 'fore he go down
L-l-let him smell the flower 'fore he go down
Catch me bouncin' on my daddy, bounce-bouncing'on my daddy
If it's good, then I'm yours, and I'm bouncin' on my daddy

Wanna fuck up my makeup, he put in work, no pay cut
And he just wanna wake up next to me and eat the cake up
Wanna fuck up my makeup, he put in work, no pay cut
And he just wanna lay up next to me and beat the cake up

He like me better with no makeup
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
He call me""Daddy's little Geisha""
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
I'm makin' love with his face, uh
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Charlie gonna make the bass bump
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?

Icing on the cake, blow the bag like a candle
Can you fill my needs? 'Cause I'm too much to handle (handle)
Take one for the team, 'cause you know that I'm winnin' (winnin')
You can't fuck with me if I gave you permission (swish, ah)

Wanna fuck up my makeup, he put in work, no pay cut
And he just wanna wake up next to me and eat the cake up
Wanna fuck up my makeup, he put in work, no pay cut
And he just wanna lay up next to me and beat the cake up

He like me better with no makeup
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
He call me""Daddy's little Geisha""
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
I'm makin' love with his face, uh
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Charlie gonna make the bass bump
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?
Oh, you wanna get it, daddy?

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
