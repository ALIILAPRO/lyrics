		<p>
		  Yeah, ayy, mm

Roll it up, lace it, pop a few to chase it
I'm in my own Matrix, none of this shit makes sense
All these humans basic, don't got no home trainin'
Codeine by the cases, I've been purple rainin'
Roll it up, lace it, pop a few, chase it
I've been in the Matrix, none of this shit makes sense
All you humans basic, you ain't even got home trainin'
Codeine by the cases, I've been purple rainin'

Stressed out, so I tend to take meds (take meds)
The Devil told me, "Good show, break a leg" (break a leg)
All these painkillers like I got a pair of broken legs (broken legs)
All these Percs I pop, you thought I was plannin' to break my neck
Grindin' man, I'm hungry for this shit like I ain't ate yet
You wish that you could have what I could have, you could just say that
If you ain't my lil' bitch, then, bitch, them convos, you can save that
These niggas think they invincible 'til they see them bullet holes in they Maybach

Roll it up, lace it, pop a few to chase it
I'm in my own Matrix, none of this shit makes sense
All these humans basic, don't got no home trainin'
Codeine by the cases, I've been purple rainin'
Roll it up, lace it, pop a few, chase it
I've been in the Matrix, none of this shit makes sense
All you humans basic, you ain't even got home trainin'
Codeine by the cases (yeah), I've been purple rainin'

You pop some ecstasy first, it gets progressively worse (yeah)
Try your best to reverse (nope)
Unsuccessfully flirtin' with certain death
And revertin' to your promethazine urge (yeah)
The fuckin' devil, he lurks (yeah)
Lose your best friend, he smirks
Wake up and everything hurts (ah)
And as you spiral downward, listen (yeah)
I know just how it is when (what?)
You start slow, then before you notice it, now you're mixin' (what?)
Oxys without prescription (yeah)
Cough medicine, valium with 'em (damn)
But ain't that how addiction sorta works? (Uh)
They call it lean 'cause you gravitate and lean towards the purp
The blessin' or the curse of fame 'cause now you can afford the syrup (damn)
Percocet and Percodan, but that ain't what you meant
When you said that you're in it for the perks (nah, damn)
Develop a habit out of that
Need a Xanax now to rap, so you pop it 'fore you record a verse
Your buzz wear down, yeah
Like a rabbit out a hat, makes you wanna pull your hair out (ah)
Fentanyl (yeah), Oxy (what?), Demerol (uh)
Dem are all what possibly got Shock G (damn), Roxy
Codone and lean is probably what got Lil Peep and ODB (yeah)
So many who OD be (what?) way to young to go see me (me)
I was lucky (why?), my escape was narrow
And do not think I take it for granted that I'm still here
Synthetic heroin, you (what?)
Tried to kill me then you (yeah)
Murdered Jarad didn't you? (Bitch)
You piece of shit
Thanks to you, now we lost Gangsta Boo and Pimp C
Prince and Michael mixin' Nyquil
With prescription Vics, addiction's like a fuckin' vicious cycle
Juice, we will forever miss you (what?)
To the younger generation (nah)
I ain't lecturing you, but man, just be careful when you

Roll it up, lace it, pop a few to chase it
I'm in my own Matrix, none of this shit makes sense
All these humans basic, don't got no home trainin'
Codeine by the cases, I've been purple rainin'
Roll it up, lace it, pop a few, chase it
I've been in the Matrix, none of this shit makes sense
All you humans basic, you ain't even got home trainin'
Codeine by the cases, I've been purple rainin'

I ain't comin' down from this high
Ain't finna let nobody kill my vibe
They committed social suicide
But me? I refuse to die (I refuse to die)
I will never come down from this high
I won't let them kill none of my vibes
They committed social suicide
Me? I can never ever die, I can never ever die
