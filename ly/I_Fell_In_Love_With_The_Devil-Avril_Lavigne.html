		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shot guns and roses
Make a deadly potion
Heartbreak explosions
In reckless motion
Teddy bears and "I'm sorry" letters
Don't seem to make things better
Don't bury me alive
Sweet talkin' alibi

But I-I-I-I-I can't stop the rush
And I-I-I-I-I can't give you up
No I-I-I-I-I, know you're no good for me
You're no good for me

I fell in love with the devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the devil
I'm underneath his spell (ah)
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the devil
Please, save me from this hell (oh-oh-oh-oh)

Got me playing with fire (playing with fire)
Baby, hand me the lighter (hand me the lighter)
Tastes just like danger (tastes just like danger)
Chaotic anger (chaotic anger)

But I-I-I-I-I can't stop the rush
And I-I-I-I-I can't give you up
No I-I-I-I-I, know you're no good for me
You're no good for me

I fell in love with the devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the devil
I'm underneath his spell (ah)
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the devil
Please, save me from this hell (oh-oh-oh-oh)

Angels and devils always fight over me (fight over me)
Take me to heaven, wake me up from this dream
Even in sunlight a cloud shadows over me (shadow over me)
It's now or never, wake me up from this dream

I fell in love with the devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the devil
I'm underneath his spell

Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the devil
Please, save me from this hell (this hell)

Dig deep, six feet (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Dig deep, it's killing me
I fell in love with the devil (dig deep) (ah, ah, ah, ah)
And now I'm in trouble (six feet) (ah, ah, ah, ah)
I fell in love with the devil (dig deep) (ah, ah, ah, ah)
It's killing me
