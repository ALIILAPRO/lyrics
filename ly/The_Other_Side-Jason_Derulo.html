		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah

In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer (yeah)
'Til you were eating off my spoon
And coming over
We would talk all afternoon

Tonight, we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
And just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

This could be perfect, yeah
But we won't know unless we try (try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight, we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
Then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side (whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You'll kiss me like it's do or die (whoa, whoa, whoa)
And take me to the other side (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Kiss me, baby (kiss me, baby)
Kiss me, baby, like it's do or die, oh
Kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Tonight, we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way", yeah
