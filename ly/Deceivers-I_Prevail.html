		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was so wrong to believe all of you
Every time I open my eyes, I see the darkness come through
The darkness come through

I see the world through the undertow
These anchors of hope, they drag me down below
Put my faith in ones who promised change
But where has it gotten me?
A broken dreamer, from a, corrupted preacher
A vagabond, without a home
I've been cursed to wander
All alone

'Cause I've been buried alive (I've been buried)
But I still have hope inside, yeah

I was so wrong to believe all of you
Every time I open my eyes, I see the darkness come through
(The darkness come through)
If that's whats left of me, to live my life aimlessly
I'll search for a light, a way to fight, until the world collapses on me
(Collapses on me)

What good comes from the hands of a thief, the words of a beggar
The mind of a coward, the heart of a sinner?
The hands dug the grave, and the words threw me in
The minds still caved shut, but my heart's still beatin'

Cause I've been buried alive (I've been buried)
But I still have hope inside, yeah

I was so wrong to believe all of you
Every time I open my eyes, I see the darkness come through
(The darkness come through)
If that's whats left of me, to live my life aimlessly
I'll search for a light, a way to fight, until the world collapses on me
(Collapses on me)

Collapses on me (collapses on me)
Collapses on me!

Is this it?
Have I spent a lifetime of regret?
Not knowing what I want
Giving up all of my thoughts
But I've changed who I am
I'll start over again
Change my ways, change my life
I am finally alive

Is this it?
Have I spent a lifetime of regret?
Not knowing what I want
Giving up all of my thoughts
But I've changed who I am
I'll start over again
Change my ways, change my life
I am finally alive

Is this it?
Have I spent a lifetime of regret?
Not knowing what I want
Giving up all of my thoughts
But I've changed who I am
I'll start over again
Change my ways, change my life
I am finally alive
I am finally alive
I am finally alive
