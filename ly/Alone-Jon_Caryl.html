		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up every morning
And I'm alone
The emptiness inside me
It fills my home
Cause I thought that I would find your love by now
I thought I'd have it all figured out
But I don't
And there's nowhere left to go
I just wanna fall in love so bad
Is that such a problem?
But no one loves me back
And my friends say I'm better without them
So I dive in head first
Even though
I know the outcome
Cause no one loves me back
So I guess
I'll always be alone
And after I've had a good day
There's no one to tell
So that good day becomes a bad day
As I talk to myself
Cause I thought that I would find your love by now
I thought I'd have it all figured out
But I don't
And there's nowhere left to go
I just wanna fall in love so bad
Is that such a problem?
But no one loves me back
And my friends say I'm better without them
So I dive in head first
Even though
I know the outcome
Cause no one loves me back
So I guess
I'll always be alone
So should I just give up?
Or should I test my luck?
Well I don't even know
All I know
Is that it hurts to be alone
I just wanna fall in love so bad
Is that such a problem?
But no one loves me back
And my friends say I'm better without them
So I dive in head first
Even though
I know the outcome
Cause no one loves me back
So I guess
I'll always be alone
