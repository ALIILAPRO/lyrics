		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that I'm messing with your head
All 'cause I was making out with your friend
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop 'cause I'm having too much fun

You're on your knees
Begging, Please
Stay with me
But honestly
I just need to be
A little crazy

All my life I've been good
But now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me
If you hate me
You can't save me
Baby, baby
All my life I've been good
But now
What the hell?

What?
What?
What?
What the hell?

So what if I go out on a million dates?
You never call or listen to me anyway
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play

You're on your knees
Begging, please
Stay with me
But honestly
I just need to be
A little crazy

All my life I've been good,
But now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me
If you hate me
You can't save me
Baby, baby
All my life I've been good
But now
What the hell?

La, la, la, la, la, la
Whoa, whoa
La, la, la, la, la, la
Whoa, whoa

You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head when
I'm messing with you in bed

All my life I've been good,
But now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
All my life I've been good,
But now
I'm thinking, what the hell?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

(If you love me)

If you love me
If you hate me
You can't save me
Baby, baby
(If you love me)
All my life I've been good
But now
What the hell?

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
