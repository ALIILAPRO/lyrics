		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanted me back since last fall
I wonder why
You shoved me to the edge and said it's my fault
But girl that's fine

'Cause something ain't right
'Cause something ain't right
I can see it in your eyes
Right, right
You're fast in your lies

You gave me your word but that wasn't enough
You told me it's love when it was only lust
The roles have now changed so who can you trust
It's hopeless for us, so hopeless for us

Well, baby I tried I think we might be lost
Seven feet down 'bout to bury my loss
The roles have now changed so who can you trust
It's hopeless for us, so hopeless for us

So hopeless for us
Oh you ain't even batting for us
Oh you're just in it for the ride, got you here like every night
Oh, yeah

So tell me if you really want it
Yeah tell me are you being honest
These countless times you brought me down
I'm so tired of keeping count
Oh, yeah

You gave me your word but that wasn't enough
You told me it's love when it was only lust
The roles have now changed so who can you trust
It's hopeless for us, so hopeless for us

Oh baby I tried I think we might be lost
Seven feet down bout to bury my loss
The roles have now changed so who can you trust
It's hopeless for us, so hopeless for us
