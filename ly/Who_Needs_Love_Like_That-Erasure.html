		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who needs love like that?
There's something going on
Something not quite right.
There's something stranger happening to me.
There's someone at the door
Hear voices in my head

It seems things aren't the way they ought to be.
Who needs love like that? Who needs love like that?

It seemed so clear before
I held my point of view

I kept my conversation
Never changed.
And now it's all gone wrong
The words are kind of hard

And nothing else around me looks the same.
Who needs love like that? Who needs love like that?

Love can turn you upside down and leave you cold
It's plain to see you're losing all control.
Who needs love like that? Who needs love like that?
I'd like to understand
I'd like to find out why
I can't remember all the line I should say.
But then I see her face and nothing really counts

Don't tell me now this feeling will stay.
Who needs love like that? Who needs love like that?

Love can turn you upside down and leave you cold
It's plain to see you're losing all control.
Who needs love like that? Who needs love like that?
Who needs love like that? Who needs love like that?
Who needs love like that? Who needs love like that?
