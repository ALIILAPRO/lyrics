		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jeez, that bitch sexy
In the mirror like "that's my bestie"
Fuck with me, who you testing?
If you want then let's get messy

Overrated
All the boys are overrated
So conceited
Stroke your ego then I break it
Say you need it
Lucky if I let you see it
Heavy breathing
Wait til we get physical

Ooh
I'm a hottie
Ain't my body crazy?
Ooh
You would die to see me naked

Jeez, that bitch sexy
In the mirror like "that's my bestie"
Fuck with me, who you testing?
If you want then let's get messy
I ain't one to play
Take your breath away
Nothing left to say
If you want then let's get messy

Boys to the front
Cause they all want some
And they all tryna get inside
Falling in love
But I ain't the one
If you want you can get in line

Ooh
I'm a hottie
Ain't my body crazy?
Ooh
You would die to see me naked

Jeez, that bitch sexy
In the mirror like "that's my bestie"
Fuck with me, who you testing?
If you want then let's get messy
Jeez, that bitch sexy
In the mirror like "that's my bestie"
Fuck with me, who you testing?
If you want then let's get messy
I ain't one to play
Take your breath away
Nothing left to say
If you want then let's get messy
