		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open hearts 
Empty up 
All the love 
waits for us

A simple sound 
A True Desire 
Giving life
A new design

All of this time I was caught up 
In fighting it

Everything's fine
I just had to invite it in

Easy enough
When there's Nothing you have to win

Time after time it shows up in my eyes again

Driving down 
With busy minds
Making known 
We'll be alright
All of this time I was caught up In fighting it

Everything's fine
I just had to invite it in

Easy enough
When there's Nothing you have to win

Time after time it shows up in my eyes again
