		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cosette, it's turned so cold
Cosette, it's past your bedtime
You've played the day away
And soon it will be night
Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading
Don't you see, the evening star appearing?
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder
How fast the minutes fly away
And every minute colder
Hurry near, another day is dying
Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying?
There's a darkness which comes without a warning
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning

Oh, Fantine, our time is running out
But Fantine, I swear this on my life
Look, Monsieur, where all the children play
Be at peace, be at peace evermore
My Cosette
Will live in my protection
Take her now
Your child will want for nothing
Good Monsieur, you come from God in Heaven
And none will ever harm Cosette as long as I am living
Take my hand, the night grows ever colder
Then I will keep you warm
Take my child, I give her to your keeping
Take shelter from the storm
For God's sake, please stay 'til I am sleeping
And tell Cosette I love her
And I'll see her when I wake
