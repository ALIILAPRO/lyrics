		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby

I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y I just might take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy
Tonight I am all yours boy
The way your body
Moves across the floor
You got me feelin n-a-s-t-y, I just might take you home with me

Baby the minute i feel your energy
The vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl (I'll be you naughty girl)
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
