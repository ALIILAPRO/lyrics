		  (Wheezy outta here)

What a nigga do, you don't ever appreciate
You give me attitude, I just might go cheat today
It's 2021, so I'm plannin' on lead the way
I been plottin' my in's and out's, and nigga gotta put my cheese away

Took a bad bitch to Hibachi in Huaraches
Got too many jewels on my squad, fuck a Nazi
Two hundred fifty cash, hit Japan and get some chopsticks
I've been with lil' man, countin' up bands, I ain't gotta drop shit
What's your ETA? I ain't even eat today
I know some nigga 'cross the street sell it for a cheaper rate
Still gotta run it up, run it up like I don't got shit
Always say fuck these niggas and these bitches 'cause they fake

More money than you lil' boys, it ain't no reason for me to hate
Anybody try my shit, I'm tryna shoot 'em in they face
They know I'm a demon, caught somebody 'round the way
Yeah, I pull up speedin', but nigga, I ain't tryna race
Young nigga on the scene, I got my Rollie stickin' up
Everybody with me on beans, they already know we glizzied up
Shoe pass in the county jail, rockin' Yves Saint Laurent
Fuckin' on a cracker bitch, Britney Minaj

Fuck 'em all, we gon' ball (21)
Stand tall, never fall
Bad bitch answer every time I call (facts, 21)
Got my Glock, use protection, I don't hit her raw (on God)
Eatin' noodles in the trenches where they break the law (pussy)
Piss me off, I just might cheat, I got a bad reflex (21)
I got tattoos in my face but I like R&B sex (21)
Hit a couple flight attendants 'cause I ride big jets
And I still ain't met a bitch that I'll pay to keep yet (facts)
That's deep (21)
Savage own his masters, ain't no shackles on my feet (facts)
Know they takin' pictures, tryna calculate a G (rats)
I got tunnel vision, need binoculars to see (21)
Took her to Hibachi, all she wanted was my meat (facts)
Gang hit the corner, nigga stopped, dropped and freeze (pussy)
VVS diamonds in my ear, Christmas Eve (21)
Your lil' bitch a thot, you need a DNA from Steve (on God)
My brother sellin' P's, he say his money grow on trees (21, 21, 21, 21)

What a nigga do, you don't ever appreciate
You give me attitude, I just might go cheat today
It's 2021, so I'm plannin' on lead the way
I been plottin' my in's and out's, and nigga gotta put my cheese away

Took a bad bitch to Hibachi in Huaraches (in Huaraches, in Huaraches)
Got too many jewels on my squad, fuck a Nazi (fuck a Nazi, fuck a Nazi)
Two hundred fifty cash, hit Japan and get some chopsticks (chopsticks, chopsticks)
I've been with lil' man, countin' up bands, I ain't gotta drop shit
(Drop shit, drop shit, drop shit, drop shit)
