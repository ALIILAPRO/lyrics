		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man I been feeling pain
Man I been going through a lot just to add weight to my name
I don't wanna be stuck in my room bro I wanna be on stage
I ain't tryna follow nobody, I make my own lane
Rise up from nothing to something, now I'm coming for the game
Man I been going through a lot just to add weight to my name
I don't wanna be stuck in my room bro I wanna be on stage
I ain't tryna follow nobody, I make my own lane
Rise up from nothing to something, now I'm coming for the game
I'm coming for the game, yeah I said that
And if we don't chill, well you'll get left back
Told me that you don't believe in me
Now I'm gonna make sure you regret that
One thing about me is I can forgive
But I'll never forget that
And if I don't feel like the love is the same
Then I guess I'll just step back
Drained from love got me feeling numb
So I release music just to feel some
Writing lyrics like every minute
Up late nights 'til I see the sun
Work for myself cos I wanna see changes
And I been waiting for my time for ages
But I can't talk to no one, I talk to a beat cos
Man I been feeling pain
Man I been going through a lot just to add weight to my name
I don't wanna be stuck in my room bro I wanna be on stage
I ain't tryna follow nobody, I make my own lane
Rise up from nothing to something, now I'm coming for the game
Man I been going through a lot just to add weight to my name
I don't wanna be stuck in my room bro I wanna be on stage
I ain't tryna follow nobody, I make my own lane
Rise up from nothing to something, now I'm coming for the game
Draining love had to let that go to let me grow, so now I know
I can do this all on my own, it's DND don't call my phone
Tryna make life a movie, but right now I'm just Home Alone
If I ain't home I'm in studio writing lyrics to help me blow
Tryna be better than the best
Guys move fake and make it bait, now I gotta check mates like chess
And yeah I said that with chest
Were you calling me when I was down
Now I got OB, come give me my crown
Ain't felt love since father ain't around
Instead
Man I been feeling pain
Man I been going through a lot just to add weight to my name
I don't wanna be stuck in my room bro I wanna be on stage
I ain't tryna follow nobody, I make my own lane
Rise up from nothing to something, now I'm coming for the game (Game Over)
