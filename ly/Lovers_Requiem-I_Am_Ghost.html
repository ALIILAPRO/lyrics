		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This book of love is a final gift, dramatic in its virtue
It's a beating heart I made for you
Ten razors buried bones
And a kiss that tastes like violence
Blue sand shadows look from above, yeah
We're not alone
The dead will rise again

Show me why we won't let go and why we still must pray
This is our lovers' requiem
As wings unfold, just breathe for me...

(just breathe, just breathe, just breathe for me)

In freaks below, a savage plot of golden dust
And chariots of liars, a course of waiting
For existence
Sin's bleeding cast has struck a nerve
Sin's bleeding hand has filled the lakes
For you and me a war has just begun
A sharpened sword, ice and cuts
And laughing dolls, tonight they live again

Show me why we won't let go and why we still must pray
This is our lovers' requiem
As wings unfold, just breathe for me...
Oh heaven's gate will cast a shadow

Truth, forgiveness still and cold
A secret little garden
She built
Sold for beauty in disguise,
Sweet hideaway from never,
From the never, never

Now... the devil has stolen the key
It tastes like skin and bone, fire

Show me why we won't let go and why we still must pray
This is our lovers' requiem
As wings unfold, just breathe for me...

(just breathe, just breathe, just breathe for me)

Show me why we won't let go and why we still must pray
This is our lovers' requiem
As wings unfold, just breathe for me...

(just breathe, just breathe, just breathe for me)
