		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stopping thoughts from coming out
Visions they float around
Like debris in my head
It's hard to wrap my heart around
The fact that you have been found
By another instead
I know you got a girl
You know I've got a man
But in a perfect world
This happened it happened
The chemistry
Is getting the best of me
I'm going to try and see
If I can do what I would want done if it were me
Cause I want you
If I'm honest
I ain't trying to have that sittin on my conscious
Trying to do the right thing boy I promise
But it feels right dammit cuz I want you baby boy
I want you
If I'm honest
I'm just trying to have you sit me on the counter
You went lookin for trouble now you found her
And it feel right don't it cause I want you bad baby
Cause I want you bad baby
Cause I want you bad baby
I want you bad baby
I ain't trying to act like I'm perfect
I'm workin
To be better in life I'm searching
But I rather be laid up and caked up with you
I see greater with you no
And I hate to say that
I delete the evidence when I'm on my way back
She be catching on fast
How you gone explain that
I be catching feelings fast
How I'm gone contain that
You got a girl
You know I got a man
But in the perfect world
This happened this happened
The chemistry
Is getting the best of me
I'm going to try and see
If I can do what I would want done if it were me
Cause I want you
If I'm honest
I ain't trying to have that sittin on my conscious
Trying to do the right thing boy I promise
But it feels right dammit cuz I want you baby boy
I want you
If I'm honest
I'm just trying to have you sit me on the counter
You went lookin for trouble now you found her
And it feel right don't it cause I want you bad baby
Cause I want you bad baby
Cause I want you bad baby
I want you bad baby
