		  [Intro]
Let me show you the way 
(Uh, yeah, uh, yeah)
Let me show you the way

Didn't I make a good lady
Didn't I have your baby
Maybe I shoulda known you were crazy
When you was caught playin' me shady
Didn't I keep your kids when
You were out smokin' and drinkin'
Why did I treat you like my king
When you were out doing your own thing
(Let me show you the way)

Tell ya what I think about you
You're tired and confused
And I want nothing to do with you
Tell you what you think about me
You think that I'm crazy
You think that I am dumb and naïve
(Let me show you the way)

Let me break it down
Let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove
Watch me make my moves and get rid of you
(Let me show you the way)
You can pack your things, you can take this ring
It don't mean a thing
(Let me show you the way)
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more
I can't take no more
(Let me show you the way)

Didn't I show you this good love
Didn't I do it just because
Tell me why you went and did me wrong
I heard you sayin' you love her on the phone
Wasn't I down for you and
Even when you put me through it
Why didn't I listen to my girlfriends (Girlfriends)
When they said you were not worth it
(Let me show you the way)

Tell ya what I think about you
You're tired and confused
And I want nothing to do with you
Tell you what you think about me
You think that I'm crazy
You think that I am dumb and naïve
(Let me show you the way)

Let me break it down
Let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove
Watch me make my moves and get rid of you
(Let me show you the way)
You can pack your things, you can take this ring
It don't mean a thing
(Let me show you the way)
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more
I can't take no more
(Let me show you the way)

(Let me show you the way) 
Uh, yeah, ah ha

Since you went and broke the rules
This is what I got for you
Take your jacket and your shoes
You'll never play me for a fool

Tell ya what I think about you
You're tired and confused
And I want nothing to do with you
Tell you what you think about me
You think that I'm crazy
You think that I am dumb and naïve
(Let me show you the way)

Let me break it down
Let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove
Watch me make my moves and get rid of you
(Let me show you the way)
You can pack your things, you can take this ring
It don't mean a thing
(Let me show you the way)
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more
I can't take no more
(Let me show you the way)

Let me break it down
Let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove
Watch me make my moves and get rid of you
(Let me show you the way)
You can pack your things, you can take this ring
It don't mean a thing
(Let me show you the way)
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more
I can't take no more
(Let me show you the way)
