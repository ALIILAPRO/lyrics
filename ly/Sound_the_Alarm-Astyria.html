		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something is stirrin’ 
Startling sound 
Under the surface 
Reachin’ out 

This is how It all starts 
This is how it all starts 

Were holdin’ our breath 
Creepin’ around 
We’re getting restless 
The time is now 

This is how It all starts 
This is how it all starts 
This is how It all starts 
This is how it all starts 

Sound the alarm 
We’re breakin’ out 
Out of the dark 
Sound the alarm 
We’re not backin’ down 
We come as we are 
Sound the alarm 

Take your chances
You must choose your side 
Anything could happen 
It all starts tonight 
Tonight 

Sound the alarm 
We’re breakin’ out 
Out of the dark 
Sound the alarm 
We’re not backin’ down 
We come as we are
 Sound the alarm 

Were breakin’ out 
Out of the dark 
No turning back now 
This is how it all starts 
Not backin’ down 
Come as you are 
No turnin’ back now 
This is how it all starts 

Sound the alarm 
We’re breakin’ out 
Out of the dark 
Sound the alarm 
We’re not backin’ down 
We come as we are 

Sound the alarm 
This is how it all starts 
Sound the alarm 
This is how it all starts
This is how it all starts 
Sound the alarm 
This is how it all starts

This is how it all starts 
This is how it all starts
This is how it all starts 
This is how it all starts
