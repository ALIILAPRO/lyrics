		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A lucky, lucky girl
She got married to a boy like you
She'd kick you out if she ever, ever knew
'Bout all the **** you tell me that you do
Dirty, dirty boy
You know everyone is talkin' on the scene
I hear them whisperin' 'bout the places that you've been
And how you don't know how to keep your business clean

Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop
Doin' somethin' unholy
He's sat back while she's droppin' it
She be poppin' it
Yeah, she put it down slowly
Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at
Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome so he can get that
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop
Doin' somethin' unholy (Woo)

Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot (Hot)
At the body shop (Shop)
Doin' somethin' unholy
He's sat back while she's droppin' it (She)
She be poppin' it (She)
Yeah, she put it down slowly
Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at
Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome so he can get that
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop (Ah)
Doin' somethin' unholy

Oh-oh, oh-ee-oh-ee, ee-oh (Unholy)
Oh-oh, oh-ee-oh-ee, ee-oh (Unholy)
Oh-oh, oh-ee-oh-ee, ee-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-ee-oh-ee, ee-oh
