Yeah, nigga I got a real real addiction for this cash (yeah, nigga)
I got a real ambition for this cash (yeah)
Thirteen years old, with a shoebox stash (yeah)
I'm always up to somethin', never sittin' on my ass 

Nigga (what?), this Glizock got my skinnies saggin'
Nigga (yeah), I tote that Glizock with a passion (baow)

And I talk a whole lotta shit 'cause I can bag it (uh, uh)
Yeah, it's up there (yeah)
Bitch my heart cold (yeah), my last name Moncler (yeah, 'Cler)
My pockets fat swole (swole), no, I don't eat pears (uh-uh)
And trappin' ain't dead (what?), these niggas just queers
I'm sippin' color purple syrup 
Ballin' hard just like The Beard (swoosh, yeah)
Yeah and Larry Bird, I'm shootin' shit, I know you heard
Ten toes never in no hurry, nigga, I call shots, you heard? (yup, yup)
Money talkin' what's the word (brrt, huh, what's up?)
Ayy, I pray but don't go to church
Don't ask me to spit a verse (uh-uh)
Can't trust no ho, that's devil word
Yeah, I know the devil work (I know)
And I know that nobody's perfect
Still can't trust a bitch for certain (huh?)
For real though (what the fuck?)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm in my bag
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, bitch, I just made a bag
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, bitch, I just made a bag
Yeah, bag, yeah, bag, yeah, a bag a big bag 

Yeah, nigga I got a real real addiction for this cash (yeah, nigga)
I got a real ambition for this cash (yeah)
Thirteen years old, with a shoebox stash (yeah)
I'm always up to somethin', never sittin' on my ass

Yeah, nigga I got a real real addiction for this cash (yeah)
I got a real ambition for this cash (yeah)
Thirteen years old, with a shoebox stash (yeah)
I'm always up to somethin', never sittin' on my ass
