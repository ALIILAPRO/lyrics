		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the still of the night I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

In the shadow of night, I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store
My heart start aching, my body started shaking
And I can't take no more
No, no, no

Now I just want to get close to you
And taste your love so sweet
And I just want to make love to you
Feel your body heat

In the still of the night
In the still of the night
Over here, baby

In the heat of the day I hang my head down low
And hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day until the evening time
I'm waiting for the night to c-c-c-come
Ooh, baby

In the still of the night
In the cool moonlight
I feel my heart is aching
In the still of the night

Ooh, baby
Ooh, babe
I can't keep away
Closer and closer
Need to be closer
I can't keep away
Can't keep away, can't keep away
I can't keep away, no

You gotta give me love
You gotta give me some lovin' everyday
I can't keep away

Ooh, baby, ooh woman, ahh

Get over here, babe

In the still of the night, I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night, I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

Ooh, mama

Now I just want to get close to you
Taste your love so sweet
And I just want to make love to you
Feel your body heat

In the still of the night, ooh yeah
In the still of the night
I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
Ain't nothing gonna stop me now

Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
