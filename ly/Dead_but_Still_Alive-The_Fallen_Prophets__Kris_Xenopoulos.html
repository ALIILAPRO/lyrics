		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I control your life now
Tear you inside out can't look back as I snap your neck
Life brittle as the guts that keep you together
Vomit rains down on you 
 

Fall into my trap the cage they built for you can't hold me back
I rip out your spine and show it to you
who has the knife stuck in their head


I will torture you 
And see how much the soul can stick on a rotting 
maggot invested human body vessel
The time has come to take my revenge 
My evil master plan has started
Failure is no option 
You will die 
as the rest did to


Murder you 
To control you
Dead but still alive
I will feed on you 


As the blood drips from my knife
Revenge is sweet
Bleed out like you bled on me
I will show no mercy this is the end for you
You have taken it all away from me
All your empty lies fallen on me
Now it's my time my place
To end the human race

Count down has begun
Three two one you are all gone
I will laugh and say you are all welcome

As the soul leaves the body in disgrace
The dead comes and claims its lost property 
The
End 
For 
You
Is near


Clouds above dies raining acid
Burning everything, they built to ashes


Drag the rest of the corpse into the cursed grounds
Let them stink and rot as they did when they were still alive


Demonic possession to end life with a simple fact that you all will die
Not even a slight chance to survive

Dead but still alive
