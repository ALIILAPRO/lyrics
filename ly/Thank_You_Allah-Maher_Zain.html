		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was so far from you
Yet to me you were always so close
I wandered lost in the dark
I closed my eyes toward the signs
You put in my way
I walked everyday
Further and further away from you
O Allah, you brought me home
I thank You with every breath I take.
Reff.
Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah
All praises to Allah, All praises to Allah
I never thought about
All the things You have given to me
I never thanked You once
I was too proud to see the truth
And prostrate to You
Until I took the first step
And that's when you opened the doors for me
Now Allah, I realized what I was missing
By being far from You.

Reff.
Allah, I wanna thank You
I wanna thank you for all the things that you've done
You've done for me through all my years I've been lost
You've guided me from all the ways that were wrong
Indeed you gave me hope

O Allah, I wanna thank You
I wanna thank You for all the things that you've done
You've done for me through all my years I've been lost
You've guided me from all the ways that were wrong
I wanna thank You for bringing me home
