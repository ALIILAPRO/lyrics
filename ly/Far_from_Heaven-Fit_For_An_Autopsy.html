		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw the fallen stars
Descend into the sea
Reborn as fallen gods
They keep me far from heaven

Saviors revealed as the wretched
The world is a corpse field, accept it
Why is life a death sentence?
A coffin encasing our uncounted blessings
And it burns until the sky turns black

Terrorized
Inches from death, permanent threat, there can't be compromise
Never forget, a life of neglect leaves one dehumanized
Loss and regret, the senses are ripe but the mind is paralyzed
With a lust for Earth to flood in sulfur and blood

I saw the fallen stars
Descend into the sea
Reborn as fallen gods
They keep me far from heaven

Acolytes
Dealers of death, a shortness of breath plagued by the parasites
The bodies regress, abused and oppressed, the mind is weaponized
Put to the test, the children of war will quench their appetite
With a lust for earth to flood in sulfur and blood

I saw the fallen stars
Descend into the sea
Reborn as fallen gods
They keep me far from heaven

Bastard sons of sin
Birthed by the greatest arsonist
They only let the light in
To show us darkness is permanent

We are what you created
We are what you created
We are what you created
We are what you created

An infinite expanse of pine boxes
Illuminate the sky

Keep me far from heaven
So far from heaven
