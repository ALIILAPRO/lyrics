		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you know 
The streets are colder now, 
Then they have ever been
Would you let me in

I'm invisible
You walk right on through, 
Like I wasn't there
Like you didnt care

All we ask is for you eyes to see us, not for our disguise
To hear our beckon hear our cries,
Why can't you stop to meet our eyes
All we want is a little love, to trickle down from up above
We've been waiting for a flood, 
But all we've got is sweat and blood

You can't let me down
The prospect of a savior has lost its appeal, 
Maybe I can heal

They say that hope lives on but I don't really care, 
If I am treated as
A quarter of my halves

All we ask is for you eyes to see us, not for our disguise
To hear our beckon hear our cries,
Why can't you stop to meet our eyes
All we want is a little love, to trickle down from up above
We've been waiting for a flood, 
But all we've got is sweat and blood

I want to soar
I want to fly away
To freedom in outer space
If I were bold, if I were brave

I'd take a stand
I would accept the reins
I would assume the pain
I wouldn't need to place the blame

So when you're looking down upon
Our weary masks that life has drawn
Remember how you fill your void
Like us, you're trying to find some joy
