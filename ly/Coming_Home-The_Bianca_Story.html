		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if there's a place I need to know?
And what if something's waiting there for me?
What if I don't see a future where I'm coming from?

Have I ever thought about leavin' my house?
Never ever thought about burning my town
Will I get rid of all the pictures of my first love?

I could paint a circle on a blanket
And walk through a hole
Escape through the mirror on my wall

And here I lay down the past and what I've begun
And here I go and there's just no turning around
But if you need somebody to rely on, my dear
I can swear I will be coming home for you

Now I feel lost in outer space
Have to move my legs, I can escape
Gotta understand that someone is waiting there for me

I could paint a circle on a blanket
And walk through a hole
Escape through the mirror on my wall
And here I lay down the past and what I've begun
Oh, here I go and there's no way of turnin' around
But if you need somebody to rely on, my dear
I can swear I will be coming home, but

Something wasn't right with the judgment call
Oh, something wasn't right from the bottom of my heart
I was out there on my own
I had no plans for coming home
But I could never love somebody without you

So I laid down the past and what I'd begun
Said, "Here I go and there's no way of turning around"
'Cause if you need somebody to rely on, my dear
I can swear I will be comin', I can swear I will be comin'
Oh, I swear I will be coming home for you
I can swear I will be coming home to you

Now I feel lost in outer space
Can't move my legs, I can't escape
Did I understand that no one was waiting there for me?
