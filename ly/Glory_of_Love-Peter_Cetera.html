		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight it's very clear as we're both lyin' here
There's so many things I want to say
I will always love you 
I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you cryin'
I don't want to lose you 
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for the glory of love

You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you've been dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for the glory of love

It's like a knight in shining armor from a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We're gonna live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for the glory of love

We'll live forever (we'll live forever), knowin' together (knowin' together)
That we did it all for the glory of love

Ooh
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
