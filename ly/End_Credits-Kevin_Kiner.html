		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the blood dries in my veins and my
Heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way,
To heavens door,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I can feel, something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

I can feel, something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

When my mind stops thinking,
My eyes stop blinking,
I hope
Somebody's there.

And my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing
In air,
I hope somebody cares,

When the blood dries in my veins and my
Heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way,
To heavens door,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I can feel, something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreams will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

When my mind stops thinking,
My eyes stop blinking,
I hope
Somebody's there.

And my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing
In air,
I hope somebody cares,

When my mind stops thinking
My eyes stop blinking
I know
At the end.
