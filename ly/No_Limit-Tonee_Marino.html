		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I be lowkey but my life full of high notes
Shits crazy, had to go psycho
No I don't dance 
One shot, two shots to the face now I'm moving like Michael 
Two shots to the face no lipo
Bro hold the whips down like this shit Geico 
cnd I never chase girls, they go wherever I go

Two shots to the face 
Shots, shots
Shots to the face
Sh-, shots, shots
Two shots to the face 
Shots, shots 

Hop out the Beam, light up the party 
Hop out the Beam, light up the party 
Hop, hop out the Beam, light up the party 
Hop, hop, hop out the 
Hop, hop out the

Hop out the nice two-door with a bad one, and she got a fat one tryna' get loose 
We been outside for the weekend, swimming through the deep end, not no pool 
Only come out when the sun down, every time I touchdown I be on the move 
When I'm in the party better stand up, everybody's hands up, reach for the roof 

Bottles on bottles 
Models on models 
cll the way turnt up in it full throttle 
Pulled up like the President, back of the â€˜Burban  
Shots to the face but I ain't a surgeon 
Pour up tequila, the vodka, the bourbon

Hop out the Beam, light up the party 
Hop out the Beam, light up the party 
Hop, hop out the Beam, light up the party 
Hop, hop, hop out the 
Hop, hop out the 

Pockets out of shape no fitness 
My shits looking like I need me a gymnast 
Green whip, red seats like Christmas
Shutting shit down like it's going out of business
My lifestyle way out your budget 
I'm not on your level I'm way up above it 
Bad ting, cute face, with her ass out 
She gon' make it hit the floor like it passed out
Know the birds gon' flock when the cash out
We ain't got no limit, no max out
