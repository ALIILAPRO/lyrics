		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father
Now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you
This world, at times will blind you
Still, I know I'll see you there

Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been seein'?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?
Come a little closer, then you'll see

Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders
Will we burn on or just smolder?
Somehow, I know I'll find you there
Ooh, you wanna see if you can change it
Change it
Still, I know I'll see you there

Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Do you understand the things that you've been seein'?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see

Ten thousand people stand alone now
And in the evening, the sun sank
Tomorrow it will rise
Time flies by
They all sang along
Time flies by
They all sang along
Time flies by
They all sang along
Time flies by, by

Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
