		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah (Mr. Worldwide)
Oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey hey hey (Ne-Yo, let's get it)
Let's get it now

This the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender "line up some shots"
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And now I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, "Wanna ride out?" and she said "Yes"
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah
Oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey hey hey
Let's get it now

Tonight I'ma lose my mind
Better get yours 'cause I'm gon' get mine
Party every night like my last
Mami you know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead, baby, let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me, I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This is a for sure, I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah
Oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey hey hey
Let's get it now

Everybody goin' through somethin' (everybody goin' through somethin')
I said, everybody goin' through somethin' (everybody goin' through somethin')
So you might as well roll it up
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight, oh yeah

Everybody goin' through somethin' (everybody goin' through somethin')
I said, everybody goin' through somethin' (everybody goin' through somethin')
So you might as well roll it up
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight, oh yeah

This is for everybody going through times
Believe me, been there, done that
But every day above ground is a great day, remember that

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah
Oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey hey hey
Let's get it now
