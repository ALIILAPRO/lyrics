		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you get the money, yeah, this shit gon' run the world
Know you love them diamonds, yeah, you tryna see them pearls
Had to mix it up, I double back and then I swirl
Bought a brand new crib, this shit gon' sit out way in Europe

Million for million, building for building
Billion for billion, la familia ain't feeling ya
Million for million, building for building
Billion for billion, la familia ain't feeling ya

I go tic for tac, I go blick for gat
You a fat ass rat, you go chit for chat
I go everything, I go pop and rap
If you try us, kid, we get you double smacked (double smacked)

I don't fuck with not nothing, I don't even know nobody (uh, yeah)
I don't fuck with nobody, not nothing at all (whoa)
I'm pissin' on this beat, it's like a bathroom stall
And what you get from me is that no fucks involved (yeah, yeah)
I could win a Grammy, still not say a word (yeah, yeah)
Keep that shit like Drizz, it's all a blur
That shit for all the dawgs on the earth
I don't fuck with no pussycats, they get on my nerve
My diamonds do activities, they could be fucking surfin' (surfin')
They could be diamond hopping, could be fuckin' urchins
Gotta get shit off my chest like it's fuckin' urgent
Number one worldwide, so we keep it perfect
When ya diamonds hop the best
When ya diamonds jumpin' off that bitch and hit ya chest
When you get this shit, motherfucker, off the press
When you get that shit, go take that shit all to the press

When you get the money, yeah, this shit gon' run the world
Know you love them diamonds, yeah, you tryna see them pearls
Had to mix it up, I double back and then I swirl
Bought a brand new crib, this shit gon' sit out way in Europe

Million for million, building for building
Billion for billion, la familia ain't feeling ya
Million for million, building for building
Billion for billion, la familia ain't feeling ya

I go tic for tac, I go blick for gat
You a fat ass rat, you go chit for chat
I go everything, I go pop and rap
If you try us, kid, we get you double smacked (double smacked)
