		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another wasted breath trying to prove my innocence
I know I seal my fate, another lie that ???
I know you want to see, see me hurt, make me suffer
But all that's left are all
Broken shattered pieces of our lives

I wish that I could tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin
I want to tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin

So come and take my life, let me fill your wickedness
I know I made mistakes so come and watch me fall from grace
I know you want to see, see me hurt, make me suffer
I'm nothing left so I'll just sacrifice myself to make it right
(Make it right)

I wish that I could tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin
I want to tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin

I want to tell you so you know
I want to tell you

???
I'm pretty sure that this will be the death of me
???
I know it's all my fault
I'm pretty sure that this will be the death of me

I wish that I could tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin
I want to tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin

I wish that I could tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin
I want to tell you so you know
That sins are hiding deeper beneath my skin
Beneath my skin
