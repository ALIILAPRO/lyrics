When I woke up in my bed 
Opened my eyes this morning 
I saw the heavy black side of my soul 
was creeping out the window 
The happiness I felt disappeared again 
'cause there was someone 
knocking at my door 
I guess it was the postman 
with a lot of messages 
from the world outside 

Chorus: 
Keep all your bills 
keep all your papers away from here 
Leave me alone 
it is such a lovely day 
No matter what you do in your life 
You know you always have to sign 
In a world where we are drowning in papers 
it's difficult to hold the line 
Newspaper pages always full of lies 
Letters that make me cry 
Sometimes I think that I've got enough 
You better keep that stuff 
away from sy side 

Chorus: 
Keep all your bills 
keep all your papers away from here 
Leave me alone 
it is such a lovely day
