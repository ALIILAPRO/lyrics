		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And tonight I'm a little bit yours

I'm trying to be honest
With the way I'm feeling now
And maybe I get lonely, lonely 
When the sun is going down 

I'll love you in the night, night 
But I might not stay around
But I might not stay around

I'm a little bit wild, a little bit shy
A little bit low even when I get high
A little uncertain, still you want more
And tonight I'm a little bit yours
I'm a little bit here, a little bit gone
A little bit found right where I belong
What's coming tomorrow we'll never be sure
But tonight I'm a little bit yours
I'm trying, trying

Da-da-da, da-da-da-dum
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-dum (woo)
Da-da-da, da-da-da-dum
And tonight I'm a little bit yours

I'll love you in the night, night 
But I might not stay around 
I'll love you in the night, night 
But I might not stay around
But I might not stay around

But tonight I'm a little bit yours

I'm a little bit wild, a little bit shy
A little bit low even when I get high
A little uncertain, still you want more
And tonight I'm a little bit yours
I'm a little bit here (for tonight), a little bit gone (for tonight)
A little bit found right where I belong
What's coming tomorrow we'll never be sure (for tonight)
But tonight I'm a little bit yours
I'm trying, trying

Da-da-da, da-da-da-dum
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-dum (woo)
Da-da-da, da-da-da-dum
And tonight I'm a little bit yours

I'm a little bit wild, a little bit shy
A little bit low even when I get high (oh)
A little uncertain, still you want more
And tonight I'm a little bit yours

Da-da, da-da-da-dum
Da-da-da, da-da-da-dum
