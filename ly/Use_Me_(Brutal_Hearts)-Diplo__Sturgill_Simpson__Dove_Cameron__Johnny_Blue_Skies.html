		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you the brutal heart?
Are you the brutal heart that I've been lookin' for?
'Cause if you're lookin' for love, you can look through that door
Hearts
Hearts that break the night in two
And arms that can hold you, that's true

So use me
So use me

I don't mind at all
I don't mind that you only call me when you want
And I'm just glad you want me at all
And hearts
Hearts that break the night in two
And arms that can hold you, that's true

So use me
So use me

Are we brutal hearts?
Are we brutal hearts that break the night in two?
'Cause I just want this night with you
I don't like the man (no, I don't like the man)
I don't like the man that I am (you are)
'Cause I just want this night with you
So let's take this night from black to blue
So let's take this night from black to blue

So use me
So use me
Hey

Use me
Use me
