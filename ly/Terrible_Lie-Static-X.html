		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why are you doing this to me?
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?
Why am I seething with this animosity?
I think you owe me a great big apology

Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie (terrible lie)
Terrible lie (terrible lie)

I really don't know what you mean
Seems like salvation comes only in my dreams
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
Can this world really be as sad as it seems?

Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie (terrible lie)
Terrible lie (terrible lie)

(Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to)
(Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to)
(Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to)
(Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to)

(Don't tear it away from me, I need you to hold on to
(Don't tear it away from me, I need someone to hold on to)
(Don't tear it away from me, I need you to hold on to)
(Don't tear it, don't tear it, don't tear it, don't tear it, don't tear it)

There's nothing left for me to hide
I lost my ignorance, security and pride
I'm all alone in a world you must despise
I lived your promises, your promises and lies

Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie (terrible lie)
Terrible lie (terrible lie)
Terrible lie

You made me throw it all away
My morals left to decay 
How many you betray, you've taken everything (terrible lie)
My head is filled with disease
My skin is begging you please 
I'm on my hands and knees
I want so much to believe

Terrible lie (terrible lie)
Terrible lie (terrible lie)
