		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can anybody hear me
Or am I talking to myself
My mind is running empty
In the search for someone else
Who doesn't look right through me
It's all just static in my head
Can anybody tell me why 
I'm lonely like a satellite?

'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending SOS from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down, come down
'Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round
Can I please come down?

I'm deafened by the silence
Is it something that I've done
I know that there are millions
I can't be the only one who's so disconnected
It's so different in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending SOS from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down, come down
'Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round
Can I please come down?

Now I lie awake and scream in a zero gravity
And it's starting to weigh down on me, whoa
Let's abort this mission now
Can I please come down?

So tonight I'm calling all astronauts
All the lonely people that the world forgot
If you hear my voice, come pick me up
Are you out there?
'Cause you're all I've got

And tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending SOS from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted up
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot

'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending SOS from this tiny box
To the lonely people that the world forgot
Are you out there?
'Cause you're all I've got

Can I please come down?
'Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round
(Can I please come down?)
