		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grew up under yellow light on the street
Putting too much faith in the make-believe
And another high school football team (ah-ah)
The neighbor's brother came home in a box
But he wanted to go, so maybe it was his fault
Another red heart taken by the American dream

And I feel it there, in the middle of the night
When the lights go out and I'm all alone again

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done, done
I do what I want, crying in the bleachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year, but I'm all good out here

Sunday morning, hands over my knees in a room full of faces
I'm sorry if I sound off, but I was probably wasted 
And didn't feel so good 
A life of whiskey but I always deliver
Jesus, if you're listening let me handle my liquor
And Jesus, if you're there
Why do I feel alone in this room with you?

And I feel it there, in the middle of the night
When the lights go out, but I'm still standing here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done, done
I do what I want, crying in the bleachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year, but I'm all good out here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fist for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
I do it for my daddy and I do it for Dale
I'm doing what I want and damn, I'm doing it well
For me, for me, for me, for me
