		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, she lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
"It's all about the exposure the, lens," I told her
The angles were all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da

So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure to build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
We'll bury the castle, bury the castle

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic

Well, if it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah

Go get your shovel (you'll be better)
We'll dig a deep hole (off without me now)
To bury the castle, bury the castle (ooh)
Go get your shovel (you'll be better)
We'll dig a deep hole (off without me now)
To bury the castle, bury the castle (ooh)

Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba (ba)

Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
