		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where’d you go? Had I known, I don’t think I would have followed
Now I’m home, all alone, trying to make it til tomorrow
I can’t sleep but I can scream ‘cause there’s no one here to hear me
Empty house, empty heart, God I wish you never loved me

Why’m I still loving you? 
Swear I’m not trying to
All that you put me through
It’s time to get over you

I put on my shoes and go for drinks with all my friends
I laugh at all their jokes and swear I’m happier than I’ve ever been
They say they’re surprised I’m fine with how this thing is ending
But the truth, the truth is I’m pretending, I’m pretending
The truth is I’m pretending

Even now you’re too proud, you can’t even say you’re sorry
But in the night, I know you fight yourself to make through til morning
This fuckin leash, can’t get it off, when you call me I come running
But that’s on me, ‘cause foolishly I still believe that you might love me

Why’m I still loving you? 
Swear I’m not trying to
All that you put me through
It’s time to get over you

I put on my shoes and go for drinks with all my friends
I laugh at all their jokes and swear I’m happier than I’ve ever been
They say they’re surprised I’m fine with how this thing is ending
But the truth, the truth is I’m pretending, I’m pretending
The truth is I’m pretending
