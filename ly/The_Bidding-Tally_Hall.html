		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been sleeping in a cardboard box
Spending every dollar at the liquor shop 
And even though I know I haven't got a lot 
I'll try to give you love until the day you drop

I've been training like a Pavlov dog
Let my independence out to take a hike 
All you got to do is activate my bell
And I'll fetch you anything you like 

Going once, going twice
Every man here has a price
Over where? Over there, sold
To not a single lady in here 

I've been in like a thousand times
Dated every woman in the atmosphere 
I've been to every continent
Broken all the hearts in every hemisphere
And if I'm not the type of guy you like to circumvent
Just remember not to love me when I disa-

I graduated at the top
I like to take advantage of the bourgeoisie 
So if you have a fantasy of being a queen
Maybe you should blow a couple bucks on me

Going once, going twice
Won't these gentlemen suffice
Any here? Any there? 
Any motions anywhere?
Going twice going thrice
Guess this means we'll go four times a lady

I promise I'll be all you'll need, ever need
You'll never have to shop around (don't shop around)
And I'll give you all you'll ever need, ever need 
Don't worry I will never let you down, let you down 
Don't worry I will never let you down 

So many ladies are wanting for mates 
And the prospects are good but the date's never great 
Over here over there over where? Anywhere
They're too busy with winning the bidding to care
And he's sold
