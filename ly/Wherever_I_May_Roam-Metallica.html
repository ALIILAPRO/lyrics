		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I may roam

Where I lay my head is home, yeah
And the earth becomes my throne

And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

And my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover wanderer
Nomad vagabond
Call me what you will
Yeah you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah yeah

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home, I swear 

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home, carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam, yeah yeah
Wherever I may roam yeah yeah

Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam 
Yeah, yeah wherever I may roam
Yeah, yeah wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
