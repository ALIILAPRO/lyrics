		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never knew you before.
I've been walking around with my eyes on the floor.
But now you're everywhere to me you're every face that I see.
Things ain't moving quick enough for me.

I guess I've been running round town leaving my tracks, burning out rubber,
Driving too fast but I've gotta slow right down.
Back to the moment the very start, from the very first day you had my
Heart but I've gotta slow right down.
Slow it down, down, down, down, down

Wishing, wanting for something more, always better than I had before.
Who knew these dreams would come true?
And I run the red won't stop at night I don't care for traffic lights.
Things ain't moving quick enough for me.

I guess I've been running round town leaving my tracks, burning out rubber,
Driving too fast but I've gotta slow right down.
Back to the moment the very start, from the very first day you had my
Heart but I've gotta slow right down.
Slow it down, down, down, down, down

I guess I've been running round town leaving my tracks, burning out rubber,
Driving too fast but I've gotta slow right down.
Back to the moment the very start, from the very first day you had my
Heart but I've gotta slow right down.

I guess I've been running round town leaving my tracks, burning out rubber,
Driving too fast but I've gotta slow right down.
Back to the moment the very start, from the very first day you had my
Heart but I've gotta slow right down.
Slow it down, down, down, down, down
