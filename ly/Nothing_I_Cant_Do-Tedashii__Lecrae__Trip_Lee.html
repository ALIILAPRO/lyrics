		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know what I've been through
Lost it all and my rent's due
Trouble, when it rains it floods
In my pain no it ain't all good
No but I tell them this i'm a witness
That everything is made new
So tell em' dawg I ain't through
Feels like feels like this life
Just became a fight
Yeah I'm in it ain't no way out
I know the pressure's on me
Yeah the stress is on me
But tell em' who ain't gon' crack homie

I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Look it ain't nothin' I can't do

OK life, for most
We know that this is not paradise
But we swear it's tight when
She wear it right
I feel the heat it's Miami Vice
It's the rest in me to get the rest of me
You start burnin for that but
Ain't no turning me back
That's pressing me and they testing me
To see me fail and give me hell
So I'd be burnin' in that yeah right
Life is an island which means
We trapped in that
But we cool cuz' the view so nice and lax
And like we don't feel the
Pain cuz' of laughing gas
But one blast of that and you'll
Forget that this pain is real
Yeah but no matter how good that feels
Man this pain is a thing that kills
Man I heard that so I swerve back
Curve that so let me curve back
Every time I feel that urge back
We crossing paths where we merge at
It drives me crazy but lately
Man I feel like I can't make it
Just last year I couldn't take it
In His strength man I can say this

I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Look it ain't nothin' I can't do

Might walk on water i won't lose a step
Got-gotta go harder
But I ain't gotta do it myself i can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Feelin like I can't lose
There ain't nothin' I can't do

Hold up what you said? All that fame
Done gone to my head?
Like that same power that saved me
Can't raise me from the dead?
They get me reading thinking
Bout keepin' peace
While I'm raging war on myself
I'm feeling myself then I'm killing myself
I'm sipping on blood and
I'm chewing on flesh
Just chill out we don't want
To hear that mess
All that 'won't do that' or
That 'can't do this' pain, death, hurt
Hate we done been through this
And I'm sure there's plenty more that
I ain't been through yet
But I don't care though
Bring on the heavy metal
I got a power living in
Me that'll never settle
Never leave nor forsake I'm
A bleed never break
I'm a die come back with
The keys to the safe
Gotta keep sitting deep for the
Things that I face
Can't erase God's ink wait
Clean with the paint
And I'm stained in it when the pain hit me
I withstand anything that you bring to me
They love to tell me what
I can't do faithfully
They love to tell me what
I can't do faithfully
They love to tell me what
I can't do faithfully
I'm coming back from the dead
What you saying to me i can't do

I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Look it ain't nothin' I can't do

Might walk on water i won't lose a step
Got-gotta go harder
But I ain't gotta do it myself i can't do
There ain't nothin' I can't do
Feelin like I can't lose
There ain't nothin' I can't do
