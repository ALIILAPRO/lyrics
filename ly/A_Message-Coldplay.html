		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My song is love
Love to the lovers shone
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you, clearly 
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'll get that message home

My song is love
My song is love I know
And I'm on fire for you, clearly 
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
But I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until its much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love I know
And I've got to get that message home
