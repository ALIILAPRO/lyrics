		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was you I’d run
If I was you I’d hide
If I was you I’d be afraid
Afraid of what’s inside 

If I was you I’d run
If I was you I’d hide
If I was you I’d be afraid
Afraid of what’s inside 

Afraid of what’s inside 

I can hear your voice
I can feel you cry
No matter what you do now
Don’t dare to close your eyes

The end is drawing near
I’ll tell them that you tried
Shed a single tear now
Time to say goodbye

Time to say goodbye
