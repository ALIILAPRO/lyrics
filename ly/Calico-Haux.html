		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Still I wait for you
As you asked me to
'Cause in the calico
On the western shores
When the colors changed
I came up short

Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name

Safe but not for long
So leave before the feeling's gone
'Cause in the calico
On the western shores
I felt my age
And I lost my nerve

Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name
Could've sworn you called my name

Don't believe a word they say
When they tell you, "Everything will be okay"
When it's not okay, won't be okay
And that's fine by me

It's in the calico
On the western shore
When the colors changed
I lost my nerve
Could've sworn you called my name
