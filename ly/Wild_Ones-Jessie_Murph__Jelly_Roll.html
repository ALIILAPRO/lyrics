		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hmm, yeah, yeah
Got me wide, wide open, got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a hundred and two
Always smokin' somethin', he ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothin' to lose

I got a thing for the hard liquor on ice
Short days and long nights
Marlboros out the window
Middle finger to the sky
Say you wanna get dangerous
Now you're speakin' my language
I forgot what your name is
So, I'ma call you mine
I'ma call you mine

Got me wide, wide open, got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a hundred and two
Always smokin' somethin', he ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothin' to lose

I got a thing for the wild ones (wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones (wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, they like me too

Yeah, I'm attracted to things that are really crazy
Asking me how I've been feeling lately
Coming for mine, then it's do or die
I won't let it slide, no stealing bases
No back-and-forth bargaining (now)
No bitchin' and arguing
A whole lotta problems, living in Gotham
And Bunnie's my Harley Quinn (my Harley Quinn)

Was raised in the darkness, forgive me, I'm guarded (guarded)
I have no shame, I'm in love with the heartless
The police will never take us alive
And cowgirls don't cry

Got me wide, wide open, got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a hundred and two
Always smokin' somethin', he ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothin' to lose

I got a thing for the wild ones (wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones (wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, they like me too

Yeah (wild, wild, wild)
Oh, a thing for the wild ones (it's like he knew)
I got a thing for the wild ones (wild, wild, wild)
Got a thing for the wild ones (they like me too, mm)
