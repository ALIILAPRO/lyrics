		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing whatever look)
We met through mutual friends
And this is where the story and confusion begin
'Cause I was in a problem but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like "I don't know"
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid

Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me
And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

A six year difference is a ten year sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like "I don't know"
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid

Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young
And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

When you're 35, I'll be 41
And when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo this is dumb
You should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck your shit
It's that kitchen fan
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie
(But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young)

Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
(Just say the word)
See the answers are all there
(But I'm just too gone to see)
You and I are cut from different fiber
(I wonder why, I wonder why, girl)
Don't be too material to see
(But I'm just too gone to see)
This world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me

But you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
Fuck
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me, yeah

I rock
