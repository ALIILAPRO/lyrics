		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slay and listen for the wolves
And listen for their howls
Hear whispers of the cold
This endless night

Slay and listen for the wolves
And listen for their howls
Hear whispers of the cold
This endless night

We are bloodstained

I kill for tomorrow's daylight
No king or queen
I've always fought for freedom
Couldn't care less for a king

And I am not the only
Of soldiers waiting
For the night has come
We're waiting
For the eternal oblivion

I will break them all
We'll rise up to see our lands
Rise from the fire
In fire

Slay and listen for the wolves
And listen for their howls
Hear whispers of the cold
This endless night

Slay and listen for the wolves
And listen for their howls
Hear whispers of the cold
This endless night

We are bloodstained

Four days, the skies are starless
No winds to feel
Four nights of slaughter so far
Hard to wield this sword and shield

From the woods of darkness
With the wolf-heart scream
We rise once more to fight it
For the eternal oblivion

We are bloodstained

The wargs are coming for all

I die
I'll fight
I'll die

We've lost too many
I thought we had it
I thought we could win
I thought we had upper hand now

We've lost far too many
I thought we had it
I thought we could win
I thought we had upper hand but no

The day you died in my arms
The day you died in my arms

I will break them all
We'll rise up to see our lands
Rise from the fire
In fire

Slay and listen for the wolves
And listen for their howls
Hear whispers of the cold
This endless night

Slay and listen for the wolves
And listen for their howls
Hear whispers of the cold
This endless night

We are bloodstained

The wargs are coming for all
