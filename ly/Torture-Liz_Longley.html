		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Being without you
Is being locked in a room
An eternal afternoon
set to a song sung out of town
Over and over again

Why does it feel like torture?
Not to have your skin on mine
How I lived before you loved me
Now I’m dying all the time

All my pleasure choked by pain
Since I let you let you get away
Should’ve tied to you bed
When I had you in the flesh

Now I’m chained to the memory
How the music played loud
How my hair came down
How you kissed my mouth with a fire I can’t put out

Why does it feel like torture?
Not to have your skin on mine
How I lived before you loved me
Now I’m dying all the time

I’m only mad for you my love
I come alive for you my love
I’m only mad for you

Why does it feel like torture?
Not to have your skin on mine
How I lived before you loved me
Now I’m dying all the time
