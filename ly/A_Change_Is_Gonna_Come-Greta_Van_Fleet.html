		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river, baby
I've been running ever since

It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there, baby
Beyond the sky

It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come

Well, I go down to my brother
And I say
Brother, help me breathe
But he winds up
Knocking me back down
On my knees, yeah
Yeah
 
There'd been times where I thought I
Couldn't last for long
Now I think I'm able
To carry on

It's been a long (it's been a long, long) 
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
Oh yes, it will

It's been a long (it's been a long, long) 
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will
Well, it's been a long (said it's been a long, long) 
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come, change (change)

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Change, change is gonna come

Whoah
