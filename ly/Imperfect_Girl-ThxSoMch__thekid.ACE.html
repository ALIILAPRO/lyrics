		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark hair
Blue face
She's an imperfect girl, the perfect girl for me

Light hair
Brown or grey
Just know that you're perfect
You're the perfect thing for me

Dark hair
Blue face
She's an imperfect girl, the perfect girl for me
Don't care
What you say
She's an imperfect girl, the perfect girl for me
She's an imperfect girl, the perfect girl for me
She's an imperfect girl, the perfect girl for me

Dark hair
Blue face
That girl is perfect in every single way
Too late
To go back now
I don't wanna leave, that girl is all that I need
If you want it then it's yours
Just say the word
Every dime spent, and you, you deserve it
All, you deserve it
All, you deserve
It all

Dark hair
Blue face
She's an imperfect girl, the perfect girl for me
Don't care
What you say
She's an imperfect girl, the perfect girl for me
