		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bought myself an airplane
To see how high that it could take me
I made it past the Milky Way
But it seems I'm still not even close
I'm having dinner with the king, the queen
I swear I'm living out my wildest dreams
I'm trying to give the DJ all of me
But I'm dancing like a ghost

'Cause no matter who I love
And no matter who I touch
I'm afraid there isn't much
Without you
See, look at all my stuff
You would think I had enough
But I swear there isn't much
Without you

I bought a house and named it after you
I keep it dark to kill the afternoons
I fill my bedroom up with big balloons
But there's still not much to hold (still nothing to hold)
I threw a party and I hoped you'd come
I guess the postman delivered wrong
They're trying to set me up with Mike or John
But I'd rather just get old

'Cause no matter how I'm loved (I'm loved, I'm loved)
And no matter how I'm touched (I'm touched, I'm touched)
I'm afraid there isn't much (isn't much, isn't much)
Without you
See, look at all my stuff (my stuff, my stuff)
You would think I had enough (enough, enough)
I'm afraid there isn't much (isn't much, isn't much)
Without you

And oh, God willing you'll find it in your heart
And whisper I'm forgiven
I've taken you for granted, baby, I admit it
But all I really want (baby)
All I really want
Baby, all I really want
Is you

I regret it
I get it
There's nothing and there's no one quite like you
I'm begging
You've got me on my knees this afternoon
Pathetic
But all I really want
Baby, all I really want is you

'Cause no matter who I love (I love, I love)
And no matter who I touch (I touch, I touch)
I'm afraid there isn't much (isn't much, isn't much)
Without you
See, look at all my stuff (my stuff, my stuff)
You would think I had enough (enough, enough)
But I swear there isn't much (isn't much, isn't much)
Without you
