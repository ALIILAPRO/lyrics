		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dawn hits
The sunrise on my breath
The fog lifts
From pretending to forget

All the nights we left those bereft street hotels
To the corners where we wished each other well

It's alright
I'm not tryna get 'em out of my head
It's alright
If you don't care then I don't care
Is this where we begin again?

From a stumbling mess I was searching to your reigns
To the hands that pulled me through without a trace

I no longer see faces on the Polaroids we hid
Behind the street sign in St. James's where no one is forbidden
So here's to the moment I deceive my better angels
In the foggy midnight floors a perfect strangers

It's alright
I'm not tryna get 'em out of my head
It's alright
If you don't care then I don't care
It's alright
I don't wanna get 'em out of my head
Is this where we begin again?
