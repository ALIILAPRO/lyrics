		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once we were one 
Now we're worlds apart
Deep inside you know you are my other heart
My memories seem like yesterday
Can't believe it's all so far away
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
You said to me
That we hold the key
Eternal love we give and take
It was meant to be
My love for you
Was always true
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
