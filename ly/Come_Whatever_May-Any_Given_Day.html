		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With fire in our hearts and steel in our souls
We're burning up the road and taking the control
Not afraid to fight and always on the run
We're brothers of the storm and we've just begun

We‘re the devil's riders from the pits of hell
We'll make you feel the burn, with our rebel yell
raised by cowboys from hell, and we're here to stay
We'll take you down down , come whatever may

With fire in our hearts and steel in our souls
We're burning up the road and taking the control
Not afraid to fight and always on the run
We're brothers of the storm and we've just begun

We‘re the devil's riders from the pits of hell
We'll make you feel the burn, with our rebel yell
raised by cowboys from hell, and we're here to stay
We'll take you down down , come whatever may

Burn, burn, burn, we got the fire
Burn, burn, burn, the flames will lift us higher

Burn, burn, burn, we got the fire
Burn, burn, burn, we are the wildfire

So we‘re gonna let it

Burn, burn, burn, we got the fire
Burn, burn, burn, the flames will lift us higher

Burn, burn, burn, we got the fire
Burn, burn, burn, we are the wildfire


We‘re the devil's riders from the pits of hell
We'll make you feel the burn, with our rebel yell
raised by cowboys from hell, and we're here to stay
We'll take you down down , come whatever may
