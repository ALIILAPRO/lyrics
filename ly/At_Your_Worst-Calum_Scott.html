		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I'll love you at your worst (at your worst)
Be right beside you when it hurts (when it hurts)
Don't you know I would die for you?
The least that you deserve

You know I'll always put you first (put you first)
Do anything to make it work (make it work)
I would go anywhere for you
Across the universe

I'd go all the way to love you
I'll be there when you say you need me
On the days when you don't believe me
I'll find all the ways to love you
And as long as my heart is beating
I'll be there with you, please, believe me
You know I love you at your worst

And I know sometimes the days get heavy (oh, yeah)
And I know sometimes the life can get you down
But I promise I'll be right beside you

You know I love you at your worst (at your worst)
Be right beside you when it hurts (when it hurts)
Don't you know I would die for you?
The least that you deserve

I'd go all the way to love you (all the way to love you)
I'll be there when you say you need me
On the days when you don't believe me
I'll find all the ways to love you (all the ways to love you)
And as long as my heart is beating
I'll be there with you, please, believe me
You know I love you at your worst 

(All the way, all the way, all the way)
Be right beside you when it hurts 
(All the way, all the way, all the way)
Don't you know I would die for you?
The least that you deserve
You know I love you at your worst 
(All the way, all the way, all the way)
(All the way, all the way, all the way)
Don't you know I would die for you? 
(All the way, all the way, all the way)
The least that you deserve

You know I love you at your worst
