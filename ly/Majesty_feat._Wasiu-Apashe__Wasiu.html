		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the shit, use your throne as my toilet seat
I demand the king's ransom for royalties
I deserve a mansion, I'm royalty
Address me your majesty
To form a new dynasty
The old one was dying, see?
I am your highness, please
Address me your majesty

Instant classic, that's classical gold art
Urban blacksmith; black-fisted Mozart

Requiem for the souls of the old us
Gather 'round, we can all watch the throne fall
A new king has ascended, a ghost, y'all
Crown me your majesty, oh lord!
Majesty, oh lord
Oh lord!

Instant classic, that's classical gold art
Urban blacksmith; black-fisted Mozart

Stay cool, the North King must be cold-ah
Exhale, now I look like a smoker
They hail me as king, but when hell freezes over
Will I raise supreme and that hail on your shoulder?
Raindrop feel like a boulder
Drown in a pool of your cold blood
Suffocate dumb kings, nothing in lungs
Hold your breath, I'm the air to the kingdom!

All the stars and galaxies address me as your majesty
So better say your majesty, I might react erratically
Throw you in a fire, purify you
I'm the sire, my empire's on the rise
You better find yourself a place to hide
Your place to find, but say it twice
My name divine, I'm aimin' high
Don't look in my face or eyes
Take a bow and save your life
Glory to the emperor, my temperature is risin'
Always hot, it's getting violent
I need silence, I need silence, shh

Requiem for the souls of the old us
Gather 'round, we can all watch the throne fall
A new king has ascended, a ghost, y'all
Crown me your majesty, oh lord!
Majesty, oh lord
Oh lord!

Instant classic, that's classical gold art
Urban blacksmith; black-fisted Mozart
