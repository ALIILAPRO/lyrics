		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do, how do you do?
My name is you

Flies, they all gather around me and you too
You can't see anything well

You ask me what size it is, not what I sell
The flies, they all gather around me and you too
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone

The Devil's apprentice he gave me some credit
He fed me a line and I'll probably regret it
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Ah.

I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
