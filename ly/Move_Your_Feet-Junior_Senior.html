		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't stop (can't stop) can't stop the beat
I won't stop (won't stop) won't stop the beat and go

Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah

Don't, don't, don't, don't stop the beat
I can't, can't, can't, can't control my feet
P-P-P-People in the street
C'mon everybody and move your feet
Don't stop (don't stop) don't stop the beat
I can't stop (can't stop) can't stop the beat
I won't stop (won't stop) won't stop the beat and go

Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah
We're going downtown, oh yeah

Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing my song
And you, you, you, you, you sing along
Just put, put, put, put my record on
And all of your troubles are dead and gone
Don't stop (don't stop) don't stop the beat
I can't stop (can't stop) can't stop the beat
I won't stop (won't stop) won't stop the beat and go

Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Don't stop (don't stop) don't stop the beat
I can't stop (can't stop) can't stop the beat
I won't stop (won't stop) won't stop the beat and go

Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody, move your feet and feel united
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah
