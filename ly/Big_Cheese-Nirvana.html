		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big cheese make me
Mine says, go to the office

Big cheese make me
Mine says, one that stays

Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
Show you all what a man is

Big lies make my
Mine says go to the office

Big cheese make me
Message? What is it?

Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
She eats glue, how are you?

Big cheese make me
Mine says, go to the office

Big cheese make me
Mine says, one that stays

Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
She eats glue, how are you?

Black is black straight back
Need more enemies
Show you all what a man is

She eats glue, how are you?
Need more enemies

Show you all what a man is
