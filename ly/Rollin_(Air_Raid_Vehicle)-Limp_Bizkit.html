		  Alright, partner 
Keep on rollin', baby 
You know what time it is 

(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your, your hands up)
Ladies and gentlemen (throw your, throw, throw your)
(Throw your, your, your hands, your, your hands up)
Chocolate Starfish (throw your hands up)
Wanna keep on rolling, baby (throw, your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)

I move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breath in, now breath out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what?)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Now I know why'all be lovin' this shit right here 
L.I.M.P Bizkit is right here 
People in the house put them hands in the air 
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care (yeah!)
One, two, three times two to the six 
Jonesin' for your fix with the Limp Bizkit mix 
So where the fuck you at punk? 
Shut the fuck up and back the fuck up 
While we fuck this track up 

(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw, throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)

I move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breath in, now breath out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what?)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

You want to mess with Limp Bizkit? (Yeah) 
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (why?) 
Because we get it on (when?) 
Every day and every night (oh) 
Yeah, this platinum thing right here? (Uh-huh) 
Well we're doing it all the time (what?) 
So you'd better get some better beats and uh,
Get some better rhymes (d'oh!) 
We got the gang set so don't complain yet 
24/7 never begging for a raincheck 
Old school soldiers passing out the hot shit 
That rock shit puttin' bounce in the mosh pit 

(Throw your hands up)
(Throw, throw your hands up)
(Throw, throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)

I move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breath in, now breath out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what?)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Hey ladies (where you at?), hey fellas (where you at?)
And the people who don't give a fuck (where you at?)
All the lovers (where you at?), all the haters (where you at?)
And all the people that call themselves players (where you at?)
Hot mommas (where you at?), pimp daddies (where you at?)
And all the people rolling up in Cadies (where you at?)
Hey rockers (where you at?), hip hoppers 
And everybody all around the world 

Move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breath in, now breath out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Move in now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breath in, now breath out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (what?)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
