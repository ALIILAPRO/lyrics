		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You would use your songs to say
The words you couldn't say
And every word you sang
Was about you and me
I loved
Everything you wrote, and when
You would sing, I felt
That my heart was falling

You're all I want
We fucked so hard, it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love
It's only yours

You're all I want
All the love

And with Cristal and pink champagne
On our wedding day
You had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine
For us
Then you got on top of it
And you sang to me
As the snow was falling

You're all I want
We fucked so hard, it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love
It's only yours

You're all I want
All the love
