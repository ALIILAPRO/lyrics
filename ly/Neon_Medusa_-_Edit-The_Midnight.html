		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don’t fall in love with the man on stage
I’ll be on in a minute
I’m just sharpening my blade
Don’t fall for his flattering tune
He’ll promise you the world until you drink that perfume

It’s a highway
Highway to the dark
And a neon medusa’s got your heart
Sweet canyon lullabies
Don’t look straight into its eyesIt’s a highway
Highway to the dark

There’s only two ways to make it in this town
One is to be brilliant
The other is to drown
But don’t take both drugs all in one go
You can’t reach the heavens passed out on the floor

It’s a highway
Highway to the dark
And a neon medusa’s got your heart
Sweet canyon lullabies
Don’t look straight into its eyes
It’s a highway
Highway to the dark

If your mama could see you now
If your mama could see you now
Topless and upside down
The room spinning around
If your mama could see you now
With the party lines coming out

Are you lost or are you found
Are there too many mirrors in this house?
Don’t fall in love with the man on stage
I’ll be on in a minute
Then I’ll sweep you away
Don’t fall for the monsters in this maze
But I could love you forever if you’d meet my gaze
