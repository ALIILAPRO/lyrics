		<p>
		  Na-na, I want nobody
Na-na, I want nobody
Na-na, I want nobody
Na-na, I want nobody

I miss the way that the sun hits your face in the mornin'
I miss the way that it feels when we're in the same room
I miss your voice, on the phone all night, never thought you'd stop callin'
I miss the way I get lost in the moment with you

Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you
Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you
I feel like I'm burnin' inside, so what about you?
Do you need me at all?
Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you (you)

I miss the days you give me everything without even tryin' (tryin')
Now the distance between us gets bigger and bigger by day
I even you miss the days when we never stopped fightin' (fightin')
And I'd do it all over and over and over again
Again and again

Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you
Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you
I feel like I'm burnin' inside, so what about you?
Do you need me at all?
Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you (you)

I feel like I'm burnin' inside, so what about you?
Do you need me at all? All

Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you
Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you
I feel like I'm burnin' inside, so what about you?
Do you need me at all?
Don't need nobody, don't need nobody
Don't need nobody if it's not you (you)

Na-na, I want nobody
Na-na, I want nobody
Na-na, I want nobody
Na-na, I want nobody
