		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you want the truth
But you can't take it
So I give you lies
I give you lies
You say you want the best
But you destroy it
So I keep it inside
I keep it inside

I'll tell ya something
It's a double-edged sword you're giving
And I can't see the truth in living
When we hide behind a wall of fear
And you don't see it
It's a twisted dream you believe in
And what's the use in pretending
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear

So there I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
Cause I'm a grown-a** man
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadow
So there I said it
I won't apologize to you anymore
Cause I'm a grown-a** man
And I don't understand
Why I should be living in the shadows
So there I said it

You wanna hear my voice
My mind, my demons
But not too much
Or you'll give up

I'll tell ya something
It's a double-edged sword you're giving
And I can't see the truth in living
When we hide behind a wall of fear
And you don't see it
It's a twisted dream you believe in
And what's the use in pretending
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear

So there I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
Cause I'm a grown-a** man
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadow
So there I said it
I won't apologize to you anymore
Cause I'm a grown-a** man
And I don't understand
Why I should be living in the shadows
So there I said it
