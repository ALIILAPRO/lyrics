		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someday I want to love like the love I had with you
Someday I want to hold like the way that I held you, no

My heart's been struggling with changes
No jokes that deepen my fears
No words that bring me tears
No end to face my situation
I've lost my will to stay

I've let my soul drag on and on and on
Same day just living in myself
Gone on and on and on
Same pages, never reached that omen

Someday I want to love like the love I had with you, oh
Someday I want to hold like the way that I held you, no
Someday I want to go to places that I'd never been
Places that I'd never seen
Someday I want to love like the love I had with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh-oh

My heart won't beat unless the world does
No rush and pain to feel, don't wanna make it heal
My heart won't move unless it's stolen
I've lost my will to stay

I've let my soul drag on and on and on
Same day just living in myself
Gone on and on and on
Same pages, never reached that omen

Someday I want to love like the love I had with you, oh
Someday I want to hold like the way that I held you, no
Someday I want to go to places that I'd never been
Places that I'd never seen
Someday I want to love like the love I had with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh-oh, oh
