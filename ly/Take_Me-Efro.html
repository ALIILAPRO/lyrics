		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you take me out of here
Take me
Can you take me out of here
There are so many better places
That we could be in
I think there is one
That you will particularly enjoy
If you know what I mean
Can you take me away
I want my Sunday morning
To feel just like a Friday night
Can you take me away
I want to see the light of day
While I'm dancing underneath the moonlight
Take me
Take me
Can you
Take me
Take me out of here
A little death is all that I need
Take me
Take me out of here
There's a better place I wish I could be in
Take me
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Take me
Can you take me like
You take your morning coffee
When you were up till 5
Can you take me like
You eat your Monday dinner
Like it's the last meal that you'll ever have
Take me
Take me
Take me
Take me
Take me out of here
A little death is all that I need
Take me
Take me out of here
There's a better place I wish I could be in
Take me
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Take me
Can you take me out of here?
I mean that's really all that I need to hear
We can get to know each other better
When we are as close as skin to skin
Take me
Take me out of here
Take me
Take me
