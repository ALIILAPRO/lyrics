		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a spanner in the works, you know
You gotta step up your game to make it to the top
So go
Got a little competition now
You're gonna find it hard to cope
With livin' on your own now, oh oh, oh oh

Let's make this happen, girl
We're gonna show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you
And you know that it will

Let's get this started, girl
We're movin' up, we're movin' up
It's been a lot to change, but you
Will always get what you want

It took a little time
To make a little better
It's only going out
Just one thing then another you know, you know

It took a little time
To make a little better
It's only going out
Just one thing then another you know, no

Let's make this happen, girl
We're gonna show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you
And you know that it will

Let's get this started, girl
We're movin' up, we're movin' up
It's been a lot to change, but you
Will always get what you want

Let's make this happen, girl
We're gonna show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you
And you know that it will

Let's get this started, girl
We're movin' up, we're movin' up
It's been a lot to change, but you
Will always get what you want

Let's make this happen, girl
We're gonna show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you
And you know that it will

Let's get this started, girl
We're movin' up, we're movin' up
It's been a lot to change, but you
Will always get what you want
