		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yes
Yes I did baby
Yes I did

It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile, but
Deep inside I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Because I love you I just tried to stay

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it (yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright (I'm gonna be alright)

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright (be alright)

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Said I wouldn't walk away
Somedays I want to stay (days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay (need to be okay)
Never thought it would be true
Me livin' without you (livin' without you)
But now it's time for me to make that move

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it (but I did baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (to my eyes)
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright (be alright)

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it (but I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (wasn't with it )
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright (be alright)

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh no)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright (be alright)

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside
