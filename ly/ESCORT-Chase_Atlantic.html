		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's been down the darkest roads
She's been all alone, yeah
Strangers seem to come and go
Helps her business grow, yeah
Daddy didn't want your love
He fucked you up
He lost your love
He took your heart, yeah, yeah
She put a price on that body
You want it, you pay it, yeah, yeah
A trip to Dubai or Miami
Just so she can lay up, yeah, yeah

Well, business is business
And girl, I know you're on your way up
Baby, wait up
If you're gonna fuck him for money
Make sure he don't play up

She said
Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free, yeah
Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free, yeah
You're doing acrobatics with your body
Let the money fall like those leaves, yeah
You told me that you're done with this life
But your friends all disagree, yeah, oh-oh

I can give you love for free, yeah, yeah
She said, "Babe, I can give you love for free," yeah, yeah
She said, "Yeah, I can give you love for free," no-no, oh, yeah
Girl, I got what you need, no, oh-oh

The penthouse we rented
Said, "I love you," I meant it
The view was expensive
So you show me affection
And I knw you stuck in your ways
Usually wanna get paid
Usually nothing to say
Usually grams to the face, but
Old friend, new friend
Where the fuck's the balance? Yeah
Backstabbing, black hearts
Followed you from Dallas, yeah

But business is business
And girl, you know you're on your way up
Baby, wait up
If you're gonna fuck him for money
Make sure he don't play up

She said
Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free, yeah
Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free, yeah
You're doing acrobatics with your body
Let the money fall like those leaves, yeah
You told me that you're done with this life
But your friends all disagree, yeah, oh-oh

I can give you love for free, yeah, yeah
She said, "Babe, I can give you love for free," yeah, yeah
She said, "Yeah, I can give you love for free," no-no, oh, yeah
Girl, I got what you need, no, oh-oh

Driftin' away
Driftin' away
She's sick of this place
New man every day
She wants a new life to live
She wants to feel safe, yeah

Driftin'
One needle is enough to make a difference
She needs me more than love
She needs commitment
I'll sail you away, babe
Let's fuck off this place, yeah
And we could keep on driftin'

Driftin'
Driftin'
Driftin'
Yeah
