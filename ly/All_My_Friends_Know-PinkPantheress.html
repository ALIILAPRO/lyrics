		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you ever want me? No worries if not
It's just that I told my mum
She thinks we're still going strong
She knows that I'm (I'm) 
So fond of you that she can't ignore
How every day she knocks, but I don't answer my door

Every time I look outside my house 
I try to make myself believe
I can look at nature and feel good again
You just called and text to say 
"I want to talk," but I'm too scared to meet
Is that why you think the worst of me?

Say we'll make up
Why'd you say that?
Why'd you break up?
'Cause I never got to teach myself at all
How to not show
Myself, let go
All my friends know
That you think the worst of me

Even though you broke my heart
Now we're different worlds apart
Now I've blocked you since I'm smart
Never got to teach myself at all
Now that all that's done and said
I see all the time I spent
Not talking to my best friend
'Cause I thought the worst of me
