		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  CAN WE STOP
MAKIN THE
SAME MISTAKES

FACE TO FACE
ALL THE WORDS
FADE AWAY

WHY YOU ALWAYS MAKING IT CONFUSING
I’M WONDERIN’ WHAT THE FUCK WE DOIN
TIRED OVER GETTIN’ USED
TIRED OF CRYIN’ OVER YOU

MAYBE THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING IS PERMANENT
I’D BE LYIN IF I SAID IT WASN’T LOVE
TELL ME IF I WASN’T GOOD ENOUGH
SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO GIVE IT UP
WE’RE SO ADDICTED

INSTEAD I’M RUNNIN’ ROUND IN CIRCLES WITH YOU
KEEP RUNNIN’ ROUND IN CIRCLES WITH YOU

WE KNOW WE BOTH JUST CAN’T GIVE IT UP
LETS PRETEND WE KNEW IT FROM THE START
FUCKED IT UP SO BAD I CALLED IT LOVE

FEELS LIKE JUST ANOTHER DAY
WE’RE FIGHTING OVER WORDS WE NEVER SAID
HIDE MY FEELINGS JUST TO KEEP YOU SAFE
YOU SAID YOU WANTED THINGS TO STAY THE SAME

I’M TIRED OF THE GAMES WE’RE PLAYIN’
DONE WITH ALL THE HIGHS WE’RE CHASIN’
LETS GO BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED
CAUSE UR THE ONE WHO GOT ME JADED

MAYBE THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
(I KNOW WE’VE BEEN THRU ALL THE CHANGES)
MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING IS PERMANENT
I’D BE LYIN IF I SAID IT WASN’T LOVE
TELL ME IF I WASN’T GOOD ENOUGH
SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO GIVE IT UP
WE’RE SO ADDICTED

I’M RUNNIN’ ROUND IN CIRCLES WITH YOU
I KEEP RUNNIN’ ROUND IN CIRCLES WITH YOU

WE KNOW WE BOTH JUST CAN’T GIVE IT UP
LETS PRETEND WE KNEW IT FROM THE START
FUCKED IT UP SO BAD I CALLED IT LOVE
