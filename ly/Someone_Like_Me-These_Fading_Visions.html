		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone in my head once again and
No longer afraid of the emptiness
But now I'm lost, no closure
Cause you just had to hold on
I almost had all I needed
But you took it away
I wanna know how someone
Someone like me, losing control can finally breathe
So let me go
You break me down when I need isolation
I think it's time you let me go
So let go
So here we are with a rope in between
Tied to our hearts with no hole for the air they need
You don't have what I need
Hold a little tighter and I'll bleed
I almost had all I needed
But you took it away
I almost had all I needed
Now it's gone
I wanna know how someone
Someone like me, losing control can finally breathe
So let me go
You break me down when I need isolation
I think it's time you let me go
So let go
This time I won't take your hand so
Get your claws out of me
I don't know why I have to feel
You need to lose your grip
I feel like you won't even understand
Cause in the end the only one
It really matters to is me
I wanna know
I wanna know how someone
Someone like me, losing control can finally breathe
So let me go
You break me down when I need isolation
I think it's time you let me go
So let go
