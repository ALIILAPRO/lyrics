		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ask the moon
Why I was sad everytime she was there I ask the sun
Why he made me so happier
I ask the mirror
Why his reflection of myself looks so old I ask the rocks on the sidewalk
Why they were that cold
Nobody respond, nobody
Nobody respond, nobody seems to care
Ohoh Ohoh
Nobody respond, nobody
Nobody respond, nobody seems to care
I ask the moon
Why I was sad everytime she was there I ask the sun
Why he made me so happier
I ask the mirror
Why his reflection of myself looks so old I ask the rocks on the sidewalk
Why they were that cold
Nobody respond, nobody
Nobody respond, nobody seems to care
Nobody respond, nobody
Nobody respond, nobody seems to care
Ohoh Ohoh
