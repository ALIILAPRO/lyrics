		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Germ)

It's a bird, it's a plane, its a stray, nigga duck 
Waddle when I walk, my pockets fallin' come pick Benji up 
Poppin shit like soda light em up, they ass ain't had enough 
Budapest I'm havin' motion, I can teach you how stunt
It's a bird, it's a plane, its a stray, nigga duck 
Waddle when I walk, my pockets fallin' come pick Benji up 
Poppin shit like soda light em up, they ass ain't had enough 
Budapest I'm havin' motion, I can teach you how stunt

(Shakewell)

It's a goon, it's a Shake, Mr. walk up, walk em down
Got a broom it's a drac, come n sweep up your whole town
Got more blues than a lake, and I take em buss em down
Now my nose got more holes, time to pull the reynolds out
Type to shank we don't wrestle, pinky cost more then your crib
Tbh a condo, call up Carlos we gon' send the blitz 
Heard you keep on buyin' buttons but you scared to drop some shit
I was raised a demon, findin' Jesus had to call up Fitz
Big carnal Guillermo, don't make me call up Mexico 
Know gorillas in the mix who'll stomp you out in shell toes
All it take a quarter brick, send the sidas in a hole
Said I'd never say that shit, but it's time to let em know

(Germ)

It's a bird, it's a plane, its a stray, nigga duck 
Waddle when I walk, my pockets fallin' come pick Benji up 
Poppin shit like soda light em up, they ass ain't had enough 
Budapest I'm havin' motion, I can teach you how stunt
It's a bird, it's a plane, its a stray, nigga duck 
Waddle when I walk, my pockets fallin' come pick Benji up 
Poppin shit like soda light em up, they ass ain't had enough 
Budapest I'm havin' motion, I can teach you how stunt

You sorry fuck, I'm high off wocky slush 
Shameless they can't fuck with us 
Watch me count it up 
My pockets double stuffed, just like your slut 
Rolly on my arm, out in Milan still rollin blunts
I do all my own stunts
I give no fucks
Can't get a hold of me
Im in and out of ovaries, I think they controlling me
There must be more to see
Cartier frames on my face I copped overseas
Niggas is dead to me 
Flies everywhere, I must be some shit to see
Dead dudes on me, I'm feelin' like Curren$y, who tryin' to smoke with me?
