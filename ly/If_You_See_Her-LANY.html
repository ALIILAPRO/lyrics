		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just look at us
You'd never bet against our love
Got that kind of thing that lasts
Table for two
She said "for life" so I'm confused
How'd she turn it off so fast

Don't know what she left me for
She won't talk to me anymore

So if you see her
Tell her I'd do anything, I need her
I know I'm not perfect but we were
She says she doesn't love me, don't believe her
If you see her

Maybe today
My phone will ring, I'll see her name
Trying not to hold my breath
It's all a blur
But I remember holding her last
Time that I was in her bed

Woke up with her head on my chest
This doesn't make any sense

So if you see her
Tell her I'd do anything, I need her
I know I'm not perfect but we were
She says she doesn't love me, don't believe her
If you see her

Does she remember
The night before goodbye she said forever
And made me swear I'd never leave her
She says she doesn't love me, don't believe her
If you see her

Yeah

So if you see her
Tell her I'd do anything, I need her
I know I'm not perfect but we were
She says she doesn't love me, don't believe her
If you see her

Does she remember
The night before goodbye she said forever
And made me swear I'd never leave her
She says she doesn't love me, don't believe her
If you see her

If you see her
Tell her that she's fucked it, I can't read her
We both know she's not perfect either
But if she says she loves me, let me see her
Let me see her
