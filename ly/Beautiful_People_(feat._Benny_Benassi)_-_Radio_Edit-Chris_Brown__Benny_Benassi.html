		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been
The only thing I see is
Is beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people

Oh-whoa, don't you know, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, beautiful, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, don't you know, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, beautiful, don't you know, know, know?

Live your life, live your life
Let the love inside
It's your life, it's your life
Your beauty's deep inside
Inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no
Your beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no

Oh-whoa, don't you know, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, beautiful, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, don't you know, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, beautiful, don't you know, know, know?

Take your time, take your time
Take your sexy time
Don't lose your head, lose your head
Your beauty's deep inside
Inside you

Don't let 'em bring you down, no
The beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no

Oh-whoa, don't you know, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, beautiful, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, don't you know, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, beautiful, don't you know, know, know?

Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Beautiful people

Live your life, live your life
Let the love inside
It's your life, it's your life
Got to live it right
Beautiful people
