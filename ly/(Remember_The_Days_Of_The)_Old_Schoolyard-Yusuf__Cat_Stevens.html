		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
And needed love yes, I do
Oh and I remember you
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to cry a lot, oh don't you
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had simplicity and we had
Warm toast for tea and we laughed
And needed love yes, I do
Oh and I remember you

You were my sweet love, my first sweet love
My lovey dove, my love lovey dove
No matter what place, whichever the place
I still see your face, your smiling face
In childish dreams, inside my dreams
Like king and queen, god save our dreams
N'though time may face, though time may fade
It ain't never too late, to learn about love
Learn about love

Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
And needed love yes, I do
Oh and I remember you
