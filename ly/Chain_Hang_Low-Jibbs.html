		  [Chorus]
(Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to da flow?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over ya shoulder?
If ya hot, it make ya cold
Do your chain hang low?)

Is that your chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
How 'bout the ride 'n let the diamonds smoke off the Range 
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do a thang 
You know the name

Is that yo' chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
How 'bout the ride 'n let the diamonds smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do a stain 
I'm off the chain

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm hot, kid
Chain's so low you would think that diamonds never stop it 
And it's funny 'cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand 'n I ain't even on the block yet 
Show 'em white gold, sorta hold 'em like my Tim's 
And a chain hang twenty-four inches like the rims 
Diamonds all blown up, yeah, sorta like a pimp 
So when I like hit the ice 
It starts glistenin' off the Tims (off the Tims) 

My chain hang 
All it do is blang, blang 
Have blue, have red 
Like my diamonds gang bang 
And don' even think 
We on tha same thing 
My charms so heavy that my neck don't like it 

[Chorus: x2]

(Chain)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm so icy (Do yo' chain) 
My charm's so heavy that my neck don't like it (Do yo' chain)
Go no, no, no, no is not a game, kid (Do yo' chain)
'Cause I throw my chain in the crowd 
(Do, do, do, do, do, do yo' chain) like game, B 

Is nothin'
Diamonds is nothin' to me 
(Do yo chain) especially when I'm dressin' up 
Is just a button to me 
Bling! (Could you throw it over yo' shoulda)
and not to mention my teeth 
'Cause they color coordinated 
Complimentin' the teeth 
Oh, boy, dat's! 

So check out my swag 
Diamonds red, white 'n blue like the American flag 
Boy, (Do yo' chain) is so colorful 
And, see, I got that nice screen 
My money I spend on jewels 
I call it my ice cream (Chain, chain, chain, chain) 

My music give you a black eye 
'Cause of the beating 
They think I am a mutant 
The way a boy is beasting (Chain, chain, chain, chain) 
I stay when 'n sometime you a call it cheating 
Yeah, my boys always around 
Like is a meeting

Is that yo' (Do yo chain) chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang (Do yo' chain) 
How 'bout the ride 'n let the diamonds smoke off the Range (Do yo' chain) 
Just by the chain you can tell a big kid do a stain (Do yo' chain) 
You know da name (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do yo' chain) 

Is that yo chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang (Do yo chain) 
How 'bout the ride 'n let the diamonds smoke off the Range (Do yo' chain) 
Just by the chain you can tell a big kid do a stain (Do yo' chain) 
I'm off the chain (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do yo' chain) 

[Chorus: x2]
