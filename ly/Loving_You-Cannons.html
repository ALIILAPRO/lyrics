		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting for the night to come
'Cause I've been hiding from the sun, ah-ah
Every time I hear the wind
Yeah, I can feel it rolling in
(Rolling and rolling)
(Rolling and rolling)
Tell me what you wanna do
'Cause I've been thinking me and you could, ah-ah
Won't you say what's on your mind?
'Cause I've been running out of time
(Running and running)
(Running and running)

When the day is done
And the lights are gone
There's something in the air

Can you hear the voices calling?
I was made for loving you
Don't be scared, we're only falling
I love the way our bodies move

I was made for loving you

My heart is beating like a drum
And my head is numb, ah-ah
We're getting lost in the rhythm
Of the rattle and hum

And when the day breaks
However long that it takes
We can leave our heartaches behind

Can you hear the voices calling?
I was made for loving you
Don't be scared, we're only falling
I love the way our bodies move

I was made for loving you

When the day is done
And the lights are gone
There's something in the air

Can you hear the voices calling?
I was made for loving you
Don't be scared, we're only falling
I love the way our bodies move

I was made for loving you
