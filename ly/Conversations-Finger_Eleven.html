		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something changing
The secret is building
Almost over and somehow seems a beginning
Losing focus
It must be boring
Looking forward never turns out the wrong way

Conversations alone
Complicate us together on our own
Conversations alone
So alone

No one calling
But someone is bound to reply
No one out there
But someone hears every word
I know we're playing the same game
Easing the conscience by

The road was taken
The path led on
Til a new one's left to clear
The signal's given
The show turned on til emotion cut too near

The road was taken
The path led on
The signals given
The show turned on
Still receiving
And still believing
The time that you take isn't gone

Keep us from together on our own
Together on our own
