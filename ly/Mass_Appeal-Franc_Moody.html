		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Switchblade stars in magazines
Stone cold hearts and limousines
Canap√© smiles and Creatine
Leopard print and Neoprene

Mass appeal
Tastes like
Mass appeal
Just like
Mass appeal
Feels like
Mass appeal

I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it

I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it

All the chickens taste like saccharine 
And all the deep sea fish like Dramamine 
Fill me up with gasoline 
Neoprene garms and leopard print 

Mass appeal
Tastes like
Mass appeal
Just like
Mass appeal
Tastes like
Mass appeal
Just like
Mass appeal

(Come over, it's near me)
Tastes like
Mass appeal
(Come over, it's near me)
Just like
Mass appeal
(Come over, it's near me, oh no no no)
Tastes like
Mass appeal
(Come over, it's near me)

I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it

I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
