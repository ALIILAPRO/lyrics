		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems the natural thing to do

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us

When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it, too

Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds

When I make love to you, tonight
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you
Tonight
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
Tonight
