		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless, like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile, you don't show the world how
Alone you've become

They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless, like tears in the rain

Like tears in the rain, hmm
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch

They all feel the same (mhm, mhm)
Adjust to the fame (hoo hoo, yeah)
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (like tears in the rain)
So now that she's gone (oh no)
Embrace all that comes (embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
You don't show the world how alone you've become
Alone you've become
They all feel the same

I should've let you leave
But, I let you, watch me slip away (yeah)
I could've set you free
But, I'm selfish, I watched you stay
Oh babe

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away

They all feel the same (away, ooh ooh ooh)
Adjust to the fame (adjusted to the fame)
'Cause no one will love you like her (no one's gonna love me)
It's pointless (no one's gonna love me) like tears in the rain
(No, one's gonna love me no, no)
So now that she's gone (oh, baby, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (oh, embrace all that comes no, no)
And die with a smile
You don't show the world how alone you've become (I'm not gonna show the world)
Oh, how alone I've become oh, oh

They all feel the same (hoo, hoo baby, hoo, hoo baby)
Adjust to the fame (oh I adjust to the fame, I ain't trying to be alone)
'Cause no one will love me like her (oh no, baby)
It's pointless like tears in the rain (now no one's gonna love me no more)
(Hoo hoo, hoo, baby)
So now that she's gone (hoo baby)
No one's gonna love me no more
Embrace all that comes (oh, no one's gonna love me, no one's gonna love me)
And die with a smile (oh, woah, oh, yeah)
You don't show the world how alone you've become now (no one's gonna love me back)
No, woah, yeah

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
