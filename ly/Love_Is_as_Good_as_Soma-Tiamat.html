		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to crush all bones in you
Cause I've got nothing better to do
Well, I'm no son of Aquarius
I think the world is too small for both of us

Hug me till you drug me, honey
Kiss me till I'm in a coma.
Hug me, honey, snuggly bunny,
Love is as good as soma.
Love is as good as soma.

And your friends and all your sister too
Let the world spin like the lovers do
Let the angels fly free tonight
For the devil's kiss, the deadly snakebite

Hug me till you drug me, honey
Kiss me till I'm in a coma.
Hug me, honey, snuggly bunny,
Love is as good as soma.
Love is as good as soma.

Hug me till you drug me, honey
Kiss me till I'm in a coma.
Hug me, honey, snuggly bunny,
Love is as good as soma.
Love is as good as soma.

Love is as good as soma....
