		  Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more

Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more

What is love?
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

Yeah
Yeah-yeah 
(Ooh, ooh)

No, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love, but you don't care
So, what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign

What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh

Yeah
Yeah-yeah

Oh, I don't know, what can I do?
What else can I say? It's up to you
I know we're one, just me and you
I can't go on

What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh

What is love? (Ooh)
What is love? (Ooh)
What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more

Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

What is love?
What is love?
Uh, uh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Uh, uh, ooh, ooh
Mmm

I want no other, no other lover
This is our life, our time
We are together, I need you forever
Is it love?

What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, uh

What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more (uh, uh, uh, uh)

Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
