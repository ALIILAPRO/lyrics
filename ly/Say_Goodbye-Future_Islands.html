		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After we say, "Goodnight"
I smoke another twenty cigarettes
Before I close my eyes
If I'm up past midnight
Might have a chance to say, "Good morning"
Right before I cut the light
When I wake up at dawn
I reach across the void, just hoping
We can share a moment's time
And then the evening's mine
And I can finally say, "I love you"
Right before I say, "Goodnight"

Oh why, oh why
Do I even try?

When I don't wanna say goodnight
And every day without you feels one closer to goodbye
I just need to make this world seem right
You just sleep tight 'til I'm on your side
Know you need to go to sleep
There's comfort knowing that at least you can escape this heat
I'll sit up and watch this world burn bright
I'll be alright
When you're on my time

They didn't change the date
That's another month to wait
It's another month to try
To hold on to a lie

Oh why, oh why (oh why, oh why)
Do I even try?
Every other girl
We'd just cut the line

But I don't wanna say goodnight
Is every day without you feels one closer to goodbye?
I just need to make this world seem right
You can sleep tight 'til I'm on your side
When you finally go to sleep
There's comfort knowing that
At least you can escape this heat
I'll sit up and watch, this world's on fire
I'll be alright
When you're on my time

You're on my time
When you're on my time
When you're on my time
You're on my time
You're on my time
You're on my time
You're on my time
Whoa, you're on my time
Whoa, you're on my time
Oh, you're on my time
You're on my time
I'll be alright
When you're on my time
