		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could wander in the garden of eden baby 
We could anything tonight, maybe 
We could even touch the sky 
If we just get up on our feet and try 
We could wander in the garden of eden baby 

Will you settle for the bull's run 
For the second best of fun 
For the fire of a handgun 
Burns brighter than the sun 

Any color you like as long as it's black 
You have anything if you just give it back 
You could be a celebrity like me 
It won't change anything as you will see 
Any color you like as long as it's black
