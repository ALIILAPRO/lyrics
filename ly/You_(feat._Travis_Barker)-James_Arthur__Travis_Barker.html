		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fighting, living, dying
For what? For freedom?
That for which men have fought since time began, to be free

They've been making blanket statements, scaring everyone
They've been making you feel like you never did belong
Yeah, he said, and she said, yeah, they say a lot
So many things, they just think you forgot

Who you are, and what you do, and where you're coming from
I just thought I could remind you with a simple song
No bad body language can start to rub off
'Til we're choosing weapons and hatred, not love
Not you

You were in the wilderness
Looking for your own purpose
Then you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always would
'Cause they were throwing sticks and stones
But words could never break your bones
You just spread your wings and fly, your wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always were
I knew there always was nothing wrong with being
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

All you ever see on CNN are enemies
Telling you to lose your individuality
Look, do this and do that, 'til you've lost your way
'Til you need a vice or a means of escape

They want you to stare into your screen and see yourself
Blow smoke into your mirror 'til you're mentally unwell
So don't let them catch you with lies and deceit
They can't take your soul or desire for freedom
You

You were in the wilderness
Looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always would
'Cause they were throwing sticks and stones
But words could never break your bones
You just spread your wings and fly, your wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always were
I knew there always was nothing wrong with being

Yeah, yeah
Who said I wanna be, I'm gonna be
Everything they said that I couldn't be
Everything that I said I would be, when I picked up a pen and I started to speak
I hear the beat, my melody
I just pour all my heart in these sheets
I could not just be a star in these streets
Man, I knew I was different, I harbored belief
Nowhere to live, nothing to eat
You were so hungry that you couldn't sleep
You couldn't breathe, I couldn't be
All of this shit was happening to me
I would do drugs, I was a thief
Still on the run from the karma police
You were the mission that's given to me
By the powers that be, man, there is a G-O-D?

You were in the wilderness
Looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always would

You were in the wilderness
Looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always were
'Cause they were throwing sticks and stones (they were throwing sticks and stones)
But words will never break your bones
You just spread your wings and fly, your wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always were
Yeah, I knew you always were
I know there always was nothing wrong with being
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
