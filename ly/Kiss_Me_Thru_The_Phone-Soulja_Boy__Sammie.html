		  Soulja Boy Tell 'Em

Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight 
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue 
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now
So, baby, kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (later on)
Kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (when I get home)

Baby, I know that you like me, you my future wifey
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, yeah
You can be my Bonnie, I can be your Clyde
You could be my wife, text me, call me
I need you in my life, yeah, all that, everyday I need ya
And every time I see ya, my feelings get deeper
I miss ya, I miss ya, I really wanna kiss you but I can't
Six-seven-eight, triple nine, eight-two-one-two

Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight 
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue 
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now
So, baby, kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (later on)
Kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (when I get home)

Baby, I been thinking lately so much about you
Everything about you, I like it, I love it
Kissing you in public, thinking nothing of it
Roses by the dozen, talking on the phone
Baby, you so sexy, your voice is so lovely
I love your complexion, I miss ya, I miss ya, I miss ya
I really wanna kiss you but I can't
Six-seven-eight, triple nine, eight-two-one-two

Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight 
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue 
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now
So, baby, kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (later on)
Kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (when I get home)

She call my phone like
Da, da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
We on the phone like
Da, da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
We taking pics like
Da, da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
She dial my number like
Da, da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Six-seven-eight, triple nine, eight-two-one-two

Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight 
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue 
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now
So, baby, kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (later on)
Kiss me through the phone (kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (when I get home)
