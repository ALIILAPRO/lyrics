		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm in this bitch wit' da terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch for terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos

Cr, cr, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack
You hear the echo, man
I seen the best go 'cause he ain't have this metal
I'm a hustla's hustla, a pusher's pusher
You a busta, a custerma
I get you some cooka
Yeah, crack is a chemist
I pack an eleven
I mack in a seven
I'll clap at your reverend
I see you in NY
I'll send you an invite
You gon' need you a pass
That's the code that we live by

Yeah, I'm in this bitch wit' da terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch for terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos

Oww, clap, clap, clap, gotta make that ass clap
Gotta make that ass clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, gotta make that ass clap
Gotta make that ass clap

Now why's everybody so mad at the south for
Change your style up
Switch to southpaw
Jada, I was listenin' (listenin')
So I made him a anthem to make some dividends
Lil' mama, try to hit me with the shoulder lean
This cootco crack, and I control the team
Couple bricks stacked up on that triple beam
My dirty bro sippin' that Promethazeen
That gonja green, that Cali weed
A nigga lose his life try roll on me, now
Yup, yup, we get it
No advanced about it
And the rain keep fallin', even when it's drownin'

Yeah, I'm in this bitch wit' da terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch for terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos

Mami's body is bangin', man
She got it, man, she does it all
She gets it poppin' with no hands
I'll make it pour
I'll make it rain on 'em
I'll lay a game to 'em
I'm gassin' misses to tattoo my name on 'em
Gotta get that baby love
Gotta get my paper up
Gotta suspect me exactly
Test this crack and want a ring on us
And you know what it is
Yo, it's them powder kids
And we know how to biz, so we don't give a shit

Yeah, I'm in this bitch wit' da terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch for terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
I make it rain, I make it rain
I make it rain on them hos
