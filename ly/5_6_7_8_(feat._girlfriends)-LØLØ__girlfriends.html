		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We’re so good at forgetting
We’re so good at brushing it under the rug
But now it’s kinda depressing
Just a pile of problems we keep tripping on

Another it’s fine
But it’s not
Another white lie everytime that we talk
So you put out your hand and we hit the floor
Going 5,6,7,8

And we just keep on dancing round the truth
That in the end it won’t be and me you
Spinning round the elephant in the room
It’s getting pretty dizzy when we go through the motions
oh what a performance
could win an award but i don’t wanna lose you
So we just keep on dancing round the truth
Ya we just keep on dancing

It’s like the truth makes you nervous
Twist my words like they’re cursive
You would think we rehearsed it
The way that we’re hurting doesn’t make any sense
Still got your voice in my head
You’re either saying “I love you” or you wish I was dead

Another it’s fine
But it’s not
Another white lie every time we get caught
So you put out your hand and we hit the floor
Going 5,6,7,8

Dancing and dancing and dancing
We keep on dancing and dancing and dancing
We keep on dancing and dancing and dancing
Going 5,6,7,8
