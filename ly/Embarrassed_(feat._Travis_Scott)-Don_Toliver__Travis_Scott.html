		<p>
		  (Wheezy outta here)

New checks on me, they clear
Got her naked on the terrace
Got my diamonds on in Paris
Got my diamonds on, embarrassed
Had to hit that pussy in Paris
Girl, your mama is overbearin'
Know she always, always there
Got my diamonds on, embarrassed (let's go)
Got my diamonds on, embarrassed
Got my diamonds on, embarrassed
Too many chains on me, I'm embarrassed
I got my diamonds on (I got my diamonds on)
I got my diamonds on, embarrassed (ooh)
Too many chains on me, embarrassed (yeah)

I'm feelin', I'm feelin', I'm feelin', I'm runnin' it up
Dr-drop my cup, four-by-four, I'm pickin' you up (yuh)
I'm on my way and I'm drunk out here, yeah
I'm on my way and I'm drunk right here (let's go)

Walk in, got 'em all starin'
Diamonds, yellin' louder than Karen (oy), yeah
Came fit for the expense
What I'd seen left me so embarrassed
And it fit but it really ain't fair (rawr)
Shawty sittin' on a nigga like a chair
It ain't me 'cause I'm standin' right here
Don't care but I'm not that careless

New check in, gotta go clear it
Got her naked on the terrace
Got my diamonds on in Paris
Got my diamonds on, embarrassed
I wanna hit that pussy in Paris
And her mom is overbearin'
Know she always, always there
Got my diamonds on, embarrassed

I feel when you call when you knowin' I'm drunk right now (drunk)
I feel when you callin', know that I'm upside down (yeah)
I'm on my way and I'm drunk out here, yeah
I'm on my way and I'm drunk right here, yeah

What's on my neck? It's karats
Put a ring on him baby, that's marriage
On a PJ, just landed in Paris
Say she want me to meet both parents (yeah)
Yeah, these diamonds on me shinin' like the Eiffel
Kickback, hit it like a rifle
Fuck around and die, I might snipe (pew)
You can vibe for me, baby, I like
I asked her "Whose is it?" She told me "c'est Ã  moi" (it's mine)
The diamonds is violatin', you know they hittin' from all angles
Hunnid K right in your palm, bitch
I rub on her butt, it's a Palm Angel
Baby, stop playin', what's up? (I'm embarrassed for them too much)

All these diamonds seem like they last forever
I wanna hit that pussy in Paris
Got her naked on the terrace (I know)
Got my diamonds on in Paris
Got my diamonds on, embarrassed
(I know, hmm, that these diamonds are forever)
(I need you, it's better)
(Baby, I'm embarrassed)
Hop in a foreign, I don't want you to go
Ooh, so good, baby
