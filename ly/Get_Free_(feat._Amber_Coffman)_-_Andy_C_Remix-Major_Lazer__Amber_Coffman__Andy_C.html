		<p>
		  (Ahh, ayy)
(Hey)

Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream 'til the levee gives in
What can I do to get the money?
We ain't go the money, we ain't gettin' out (hey)
Heading downstream 'til the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearin' thin
All I need's relief
I need, I need some sympathy, yeah
(Hey)

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

(Ahh, ayy)
(Hey)

All of my life been wadin' in
Water so deep, now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long 'til we have a friend? (Hey)
Comin' down, feelin' like a battery hen
Waves won't break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?
What will I do without my dreams?
(Hey)

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me (I know)
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat

Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me (I know you, you know me)
We could never get free (baby)
I just wanna be (you know me)
I just wanna dream
I just wanna dream
I just wanna dream
Baby, you know me

(Major Lazer)
