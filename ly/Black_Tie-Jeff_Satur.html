		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the middle of the night
I fear I'd lost my mind
Used to feel the colour now my world turns black and white
Seven years old
Losing that part of my soul
Keep your head low
Bound to the money they own
I was invited into the party of the silence
Be what they're like and be quiet
I'm in my black tie
Are you all satisfied?
Sipping the red wine
Just like your black lies
Lalala lalala lalala lies
Lalala lalala lalala lies
Now I'm in the wedding of my tears and my despair
Soon I'd be at the funeral of all the things I care
Say yes or no
Say it although you don't know
I'm getting cold
Can't find a way back to my home
I was invited into the party of the silence
Be what they're like and be quiet
I'm in my black tie
Are you all satisfied?
Sipping the red wine
Just like your black lies
I'm in my black tie
The world is colour-blind
Into the black light
I'm on the other side
Lalala lalala lalala lies
Lalala lalala lalala lies
I'm in my black tie
Are you all satisfied?
Sipping the red wine
Just like your black lies
I'm in my black tie
The world is colour-blind
Into the black light
I'm on the other
Lalala lalala
Lalala lalala lalala lies
Lalala lalala lalala lies
Lalala lalala lalala lies
Lalala lalala lalala lies (Sipping the red wine)
I'm on the other side
Lalala lalala lalala lies
I'm on the other side
Lalala lalala lalala lies
On the other side
Lalala lalala lalala lies
Lalala lalala lalala lies
On the other side
