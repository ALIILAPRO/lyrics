		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me where did you go?
Tell me where did you go?
Tell me where did you go?
Hoping and praying maybe I'm mistaken
That this feeling is all in my imagination
Cos I, I never knew your love would change so fast
I thought we'd built a love so strong to last
Driving me crazy am I losing you
Won't you tell me cos I need to know

[Chorus:]
Tell me where did you go?
(we made a promise to be open now the secrecy)
Where did you go?
(you drive me crazy, can't imagine how it's hurting me)
Where did you go?
(although you're here with me it seems we've lost that chemistry)
And I can't be in love on my own
Where did you go?
Tell me where did you go?

You said forever
We'd cherish all our dreams together
Seems like forever
Forever since I felt the pleasure
Oh girl,
The pleasure holding you so close at night
The times we used to talk by candle light
(by candle light)
There's something in the air you've been so cold
Is there something that I need to know

[Chorus]

I never knew your love would change so fast
I thought we'd built a love so strong to last, girl
Driving me crazy am I losing you
Won't you tell me 'cos I need to know

[Chorus]

(we made a promise to be open now the secrecy)
(where did you go? where did you, where did you?)
(you drive me crazy, can't imagine how it's hurting me)
(where did you go? where did you, where did you?)
(although you're here with me it seems we've lost that chemistry)
(where did you go? where did you, where did you?)

[Chorus]
