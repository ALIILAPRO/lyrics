		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Learning how to live when there's no one around
It's like learnin' how to feel when the drugs run out
You can see my scars 'cause I'm wearin' them proud
Even with my broken parts, I feel better now

If I could crawl in my mind
And give any advice to my younger self

Find something you can hold onto
Find someone who'll be there for you
'Cause that's all that really matters in the end
Find somewhere you can come home to
Find someone that'll die for you
'Cause that's all that really matters in the end

Is love, love, love
'Cause it's all that really matters in the end
'Cause it's all that really matters in the end

It's hard to tell the truth when you lie to yourself
Always give too much of you to someone else
I'm talkin' to you now like we're all friends
It will never be too late to start again

Find something you can hold onto
Find someone who'll be there for you
'Cause that's all that really matters in the end
Find someone you can come home to
Find someone that'll die for you (die for you)
'Cause it's all that really matters in the end

Is love, love, love
'Cause it's all that really matters in the end

Find something you can hold onto
Find someone who'll be there for you
'Cause that's all that really matters in the end
Find someone you can come home to
Find someone that'll die for you
'Cause that's all that really matters in the end

Is love, love, love
Love, love, love
Because that's all that really matters in the end
Is love, love, love
Love, love, love
It's all that really matters in the end
(Is love, love, love)

'Cause that's all that really matters in the end
'Cause that's all that really matters in the end
