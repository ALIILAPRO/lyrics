		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm baby, you know it feels right
Take it a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what your feelin'
I'll feel it with you

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow
We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

Move a little closer
Make sure I'm lookin' up
Heal me with your loving
I need you so much, I need you so much , I need your so muchhh
Yeah
Oh oh

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

You touch my mind in special places
My heart races with you
I'll take your love and I'll take my chances
I'll take them with you

Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm baby, you know it feels right
Take it a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what your feelin'
I'll feel it with you
Feel it with you
Feel it with you

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow
We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

You touch my mind in special places
My heart races with you

Take my mind in special places
My heart races with you

I'll take your love and I'll take my chances
I'll take them with you

I need you so much
