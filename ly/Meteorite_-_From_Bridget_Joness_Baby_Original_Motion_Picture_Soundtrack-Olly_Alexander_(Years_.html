		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how it led to this
I felt a tremor in your kiss
Earth shakes, and I answer it, my body realigns
It's too much, I cannot handle this
I taste, the pleasure on your lips
You make, planets start to spin I'm ready to ignite

Let me feel your devotion
Let me feel your emotion
Love me like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite
Don't let me go, don't let me go

You've been, following the rush
I've sinned, but I keep it hush
You're near, but it's not enough, I need this to survive
Reckless, what I'm heading for
Lights flash, and I hear a roar
One touch and you're so powerful, you're burning through the night

Let me feel your devotion (devotion)
Let me feel your emotion (emotion)
Love me like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite
Don't let me go, don't let me go
I can feel it coming tonight
Don't let me go, don't let me go

Our path turned to stone, everything's falling
In silver and gold, colours are warning
And I see it, gold, when I look to the sky
I want it all tonight, I want it all tonight

Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite, oh
Hit me like a meteorite
Don't let me go, don't let me go
I can feel it coming tonight
Don't let me go, don't let me go
