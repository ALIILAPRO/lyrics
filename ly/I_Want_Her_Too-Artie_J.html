		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want her too, I want her too
You said that she loves you the same way
You know that she just be talking
She don't love you the same way
Cuz she's mine and she's yours
She's mine and she's yours
Because she's mine and she's yours
Did you really think she loved you? Nigga I know
That she gone say anything, yea I know
Popping off the seal when I'm drinking with her
We be out the whip when I late night swerve
Honestly I feel like I'm sorry
I be so in love with your girlfriend
And she loves it too, and I love it too
When we rendezvous, we get comfortable
Shawty's in love with a savage
Heart games you can play with a bad bitch
I want your girl I think she's so fine yeah
I want her too, I want her too
Shawty's in love with a savage
Heart games you can play with a bad bitch
I want your girl I think she's so fine yeah
I want her too, I want her too
You said "I'm in love with her"
I am too
Tryna play all these games with her
I am too
Cuz she ain't just yours she belongs to me
And she smoke my drugs when I
Pull up in town for the ride, Oh oh oh oh
You know that she's down for the ride all night
All night, yeah
I know she don't like your vibe, yeah, yeah
She don't like your vibe, Oh
And you should know your girlfriend
Your girlfriend
She don't love you the same way
Cuz she's mine and she's yours
Shawty's in love with a savage
Heart games you can play with a bad bitch
I want your girl I think she's so fine yeah
I want her too, I want her too
Shawty's in love with a savage
Heart games you can play with a bad bitch
I want your girl I think she's so fine yeah
I want her too, I want her too
