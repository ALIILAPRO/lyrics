		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm rough around the edges
Mistake me for pretentious
I get stuck in my head
It's not personal, it's just personal
I've been strong for too long
Sometimes, I forget why I'm trying
I'm trying i'm trying

I'm just a statistic
Just another tragic misfit
Ship that cliché to the clinic
Document my disposition
Then they put me in a box
Slap a label on the top
Tape me up and ship me off
Now I'm someone else's problem

They call me damaged
I let them think what they like
They call me difficult
'Cause I don't fit in the lines
But I didn't get this far without any scars
I'm not brittle well, maybe just a little
A little

I'm not brittle maybe just a little

If I get defensive
Don't say I'm oversensitive
Maybe I have a tendency to
Snap on people telling me
"You fit inside this box we built
We know you better than yourself"
They're lying they're lying
They're lying

I'm just a statistic
Just another tragic misfit
Ship that cliché to the clinic
Document my disposition
Then they put me in a box
Slap a label on the top
Tape me up and ship me off
Now I'm someone else's problem

They call me damaged
I let them think what they like
They call me difficult
'Cause I don't fit in the lines
But I didn't get this far without any scars
I'm not brittle well, maybe just a little
A little

I'm not brittle (I'm not a diagnosis)

I tell myself
Keep breathing, don't lose focus
I'm alive, I'm not a diagnosis
Keep breathing, don't lose focus
Keep breathing, don't lose focus
You're alive, you're not a diagnosis
Keep breathing, don't lose focus
I'm not a diagnosis

They call me damaged
I let them think what they like
They call me difficult
'Cause I don't fit in the lines
But I didn't get this far without any scars
I'm not brittle well, maybe just a little
A little they call me damaged
But they can think what they like
They call me difficult
'Cause I don't fit in the lines
But I didn't get this far without any scars
I'm not brittle well, maybe just a little
A little i'm not brittle
I'm not a diagnosis

Keep breathing don't lose focus
