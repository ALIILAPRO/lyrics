		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here now
You remember still
I remember nothing and I hope I never will
Still here
They turned their back on you
And I remember when I know there's nothing I can do

Lifeless children of sorrow
Lifeless children no more
Lifeless children of sorrow
Lifeless children grown old
We live beneath and we invited you
Long live me

Here's now, let it comfort you
I remember nothing and I hope I never do
Still fear, you'll abandon me
Don't abandon me

Lifeless children of sorrow
Lifeless children no more
Painless children of sorrow
Lifeless children no more

No one will ever know
That you're here
No one will ever know
That we're here

Lifeless children of sorrow
Lifeless children no more
Endless children of sorrow
Lifeless children no more
