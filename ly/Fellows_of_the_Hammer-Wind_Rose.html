		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come, and ride through a land of gold
Together we'll crush the world
On the hills a new kingdom is rising
In the fire of the smithy is born

And smithed by the anvil strong
With the hammer it has been forged
Through the clans of the dwarves reunited
The new blood of the realm now flows

We conquer for all of us
We're fighting for all of us
On the hills a new kingdom is rising
In the fire of the smithy is born

We're standing for all of us
We're dying for all of us
Through the clans of the dwarves reunited
The new blood of the realm now flows

From the seven stars
And spoken by all of us
To be strong when the time comes
Is the oath made by everyone

Born in the iron hills
And trained in the centuries
The time for the hammer arrived
The clans are reunited in us

Take me down to the land of gold
Come with me as the glory is rising
Take me down to the promised home
We have awaited for so long
From the deep a song will rise in the dark
Hear from afar its call
When the fellows of the hammers
Sing from night til the rising morn

Come, and gather with all of us
Our destiny is at hand
On the hills a new kingdom is rising
In the fire of the smithy is born

And rally to all of us
The time to arise has come
Through the clans of the dwarves reunited
The new blood of the realm now flows

When the storm is descending
There is no threat that we fear
All the hammers will be raised
By the clans reunited
