		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981 (so long, farewell)
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981

She's throwing punches to the beat
To the sound of cable TV
And she'll never see the world the same
She is a Cold War in my head
And I am East Berlin
On the danger side of parts unknown

Coffee and cyanide for lovers in disgrace
If this is not a test, we got one foot in the grave

She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981 (so long, farewell)
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981

Crime, from another time
Champagne and party lives
God-bless the end of times
Pain, commies and cocaine
Slam danced in acid rain
We'll live the dream, for fifteen minutes of fame

She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981 (so long, farewell)
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981 (so long, farewell)
(So long, farewell)
