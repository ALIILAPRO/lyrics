		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel the caution
See the signs at the bottom
Now don't bother
Kill the pain, I'll never see the chains
I never paid no attention
Let it slide, never mentioned
Never would have made the connection
Kill the pain, I'm wrecking every piece now
Kept you in a black spot
In the fire like a fresh cut
Stepping through lies with a mask on
We've got deep, sudden cuts

Sudden cuts
We've got sudden cuts
You've got me so bound, down by your side
You've been cut with a new incision
Come and roll so scarred with your new religion

Sipping chlorine got that sweet vibe over me
Follow up with morphine and a backwards slip until you can't feel
Nah, don't bother
Every day it's another
Six days died in that blackout
Kill the pain, I'll never feel the shame now
Curled up in your back pocket
The last pieces of your gone profits
You want to loose sight when the chills won't cut
The feeling's all chemical
Kept you in a black spot
In the fire like in deaths jaws
Step into lies with your mask off
We've got deep, sudden cuts

You've got me so bound, down by your side
You've been cut with a new incision
Come and roll so scarred with your new religion
You ain't stuck where I’m bound
Back where I followed you
You've been cut by the new edition
Come and roll so scarred with your new religion

Your emerald green
You stripped your skin
You took me in to feel your emerald green
Emerald green
Two sides in a casket
Covered all eyes when you fail now
Leaving all ties at the backdoor
You stripped your skin
You took me in to feel your emerald green
You walk around like your all messed
Stacking up tears in your gold chest
You stripped your skin
You took me in to feel your emerald green
To feel your emerald green
Sudden cuts

You've got me so bound, down by your side
You've been cut with a new incision
Come and roll so scarred with your new religion
You ain't stuck where I’m bound
Back where I followed you
You've been cut by the new edition
Come and roll so scarred with your new religion
