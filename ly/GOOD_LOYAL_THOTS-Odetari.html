Girl, you not the only one

There's more where that came from

Girl, you not the only one
Had to kick that bitch up out my house
She thought she was the one

World don't revolve around you
Girl, you not the only one
World don't revolve around you
Girl, you not the only one
World don't revolve around you
Girl, you not the only one
World don't revolve around you
Girl, you not the only one
