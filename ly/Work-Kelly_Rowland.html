		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't go be easy, uh
You got it, you got it
Put it in

Tables turned into a situation
Now you standing in my face and you been patiently waiting
Fumbling over words, forget the conversation
Thinking maybe we could make the combination
Want to see me lose my breathe, want to hear me moan
Better be ready, will and able when we get along
You was talking tough up on in the telephone
So you better put it in when we get it on

No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (hey)
And is not no coming down from this high
My love Do not go nowhere less I say

Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be a less opportunity that would not be

Put it in
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it
Don't come around, keep on letting me down
You got to get it all the way in, I want to see you work

Now you looking like you looking for an explanation
Is the curve on my body for you motivation?
Skip the petty needs, no time for complication
Use both hands to make sure I reach my destination
Better leave a good impression fore you hit the door
'Cause you Do not want me talking about your business on the low
You show it off, I had to fit you in my schedule
So you better put it on me when It is time to go

No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (hey)
And is not no coming down from this high
My love don't go nowhere less I say

Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be a less opportunity that won't be

Put it in
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it
Don't come around, keep on letting me down
You got to get it all the way in, I want to see you work

I is not excepting no excuses, baby (no)
Do not brag about it if you useless baby (no)
You better blow me away, make a girl want to stay
At your spot for another round
It's your chance to prove, don't forget your moves
There is nothing to lose, but me

Put it in
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it
Don't come around, keep on letting me down
You got to get it all the way in, I want to see you work
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby, get it
