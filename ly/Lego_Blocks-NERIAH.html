		  (Aah, aah, Aah, aah)

I thought we were better friends
You kept asking what that meant
Looking back, does it all makes sense?
Used to pick me up at dark
Now I'm crying in my car
And I heard you took her to our old bar

I don't know how you seemed so perfect
I hope it was worth it
(I didn't deserve this)

You chose lego blocks, not choices
To build your fucking fortress
Stop treating girls like toys, you stupid boy
Go have fun with what's her name
Take your pictures, it's so lame
Boys will just be boys
Should've known you'd be the same

Now watch me crash your fortress
Fortress (You chose lego blocks, you chose lego blocks)
Now watch me crash your fortress

You told me she was just a friend
Now she's sleeping in your bed
And I'm rereading the last text you sent
Did you tell her 'bout the time?
Nevermind, you probably lied
It's always repeat every fucking time

I don't know how you seemed so perfect
(perfect) i hope it was worth it
(I didn't deserve this)

You chose lego blocks, not choices
To build your fucking fortress
Stop treating girls like toys, you stupid boy
Go have fun with what's her name
Take your pictures, it's so lame
Boys will just be boys
Should've known you'd be the same

Now watch me crash your fortress
Fortress (You chose lego blocks, you chose lego blocks)
Now watch me crash your fortress
Fortress (You chose lego blocks, you chose lego blocks)

You chose lego blocks, not choices
To build your fucking fortress
Stop treating girls like toys, you stupid boy
Go have fun with what's her name
Take your pictures, it's so lame
Boys will just be boys
Should've known you'd be the same

You chose lego blocks, not choices
To build your fucking fortress
Stop treating girls like toys, you stupid boy
Go have fun with what's her name
Take your pictures, it's so lame
Boys will just be boys
Should've known you'd be the same

Now watch me crash your fortress
Fortress (You chose lego blocks, you chose lego blocks)
Now watch me crash your fortress
Fortress (You chose lego blocks, you chose lego blocks)
Now watch me crash your fortress
