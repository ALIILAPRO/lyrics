		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stepping out
Lonely feet
Seeming too far from home
There’s only one way we could go
I hope you’re feeling that
However it's gonna be
You know that you’re not alone
Breaking down
What it means
Thinking too hard, to slow
There’s only one thing you should hold
And I hope you feel it, that
However it's gonna be
You know that you’re not alone
All the mornings
All the memories in between
All those midnights
All the places you would lead
I would fall through it all and again
Just for the little lights
You know we’ll be alright
In different lives
We could lead
Breathing new air, let it flow
There’s only one world we could roam
I hope you feeling, that
However it's gonna be
Even if we’re moving on
And everything’s not what it was
You know that you’re not alone
However it's gonna be
Even if we’re moving on
And everything’s not what it was
You know that you’re not alone
That however it's gonna be
You know that you’re not alone
