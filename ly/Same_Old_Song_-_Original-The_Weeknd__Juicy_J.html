		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin' 'bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
Bet you miss me now, baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun

You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential couldn't ever last this long
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right?

You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

And now I'm poppin' yea
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl, oh
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well, you can take another shot every time you hear me playin' in the club, oh

You never thought that I would ever go this far
(Never thought I'd go this far I made it)
You said potential couldn't ever last this long
(You never thought it could last so long)
Well, baby I've been alone for almost all my life
(I been alone for most of my life)
What makes that you think you can ever do me right?

Ooh, yeah you're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

Ooh
Ooh yeah, ooh
Ooh yeah, ooh
Ooh yeah, ooh
Oh yeah, ooh
Ooh yeah, ooh

Listen to that shit, man
The Weeknd music is making
Ladies' panties get wet
Jam that shit my nigga
I'm high as a motherfucker
I don't give a shit
I'm going to the strip club
I'm throwing thirty thousand dollars nigga
Thirty thousand
Fuck that shit
Spend that shit nigga, it's Christmas
Shut the fuck up
We trppy mane
