		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought this would be the end of the fantasy, what's reality?
Don't you worry we'll work it out
Just trynna figure out what it's about 

I see it now, we've been messing with our compass we can't get home
How could you be so out of your mind
I ain't naive, just not resigned 

Hey, tell me one thing, what keeps you satisfied in a place like this, you know?
When all hope has gone away for now 

You're so out of touch don't know what's going on
All the ghosts get in your head
Fill the gaps with all their plausible lies

I won't blame you for this shit
Because we didn't start the fire
Why am I getting seasick
Reality is rougher waters
No time to cast the anchor
Sailing on full steam ahead
No no can't stop me now

I never thought this would be the end of the fantasy, what's reality?
Don't you worry we'll work it out
Just trynna figure out what it's about

I see it now, we've been messing with our compass we can't get home
How could you be so out of your mind
I ain't naive, just not resigned

If there's one thing that keeps me up at night
It's seeing how the people think, when there's nothing left inside their minds

I worry about you, 'cause the past has proved to me
Without using your brain
You'll never be unchained from this barge

I won't blame you for this shit
Because we didn't start the fire
Why am I getting seasick
Reality is rougher waters
No time to cast the anchor
Sailing on full steam ahead
No no can't stop me now

I never thought this would be the end of the fantasy, what's reality?
Don't you worry we'll work it out
Just trynna figure out what it's about

I see it now, we've been messing with our compass we can't get home
How could you be so out of your mind
I ain't naive, just not resigned

I never thought this would be the end of the fantasy, what's reality?
Don't you worry we'll work it out
I ain't naive, just not resigned
