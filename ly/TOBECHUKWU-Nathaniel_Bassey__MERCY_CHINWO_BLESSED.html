		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many of you like Highlife
This is not Highlife music
This is the Highest life music
The Zoe life
Our own is Highest life music say Highest life music
Eternal life is the Highest life
Hallelujah band are we ready
Are we ready

Tobechukwu

He has done it for me

He has done it for me (Is that your testimony listen)

Even before I prayed
Jehovah Nissi answered me

He has taken away my fears
And given me peace of mind
Tobechukwu
He has done it for me
See the way He answered me

See the way He lifted me

When I was worried and couldn't sleep
He was working behind the scene o

He has done it for me

He has taken away the pain
And given me joy and victory
Tobechukwu
He has done it for me
