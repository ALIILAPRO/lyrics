		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, whoa
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby 
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react 
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that niggas songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy 
Shawty come sit on my lap, ayy
They sayin' Drizzy just snapped
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I seen some niggas attack
And don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad 
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby 
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer
But you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper
You play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood
Surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case
I'ma do what it take

And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad 
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby 
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent 
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin'
My niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea 
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad 
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby 
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
