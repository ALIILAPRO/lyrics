		  Uh, uh
Uh-huh, uh, uh
Uh-huh, uh, ayy
Ayy (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight (seven, eight)
I told her 8:30 for a dinner date (dinner date)
Pull up at 8:50, bitch, I'm always late (always late)
I kill the pussy, dip and I don't leave a trace
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cuatro, cuatro, cinco, seis (cinco, seis)
Did a show in Egypt, pay a hundred K
Spend half of the profits on some real estate
Private jet to London for a dinner date

Young nigga with a big-ass check (Check)
They see me as a big-ass threat (Threat)
I'm like, "What I do? I'm just doin' me"
I was doin' two, now I'm doin' three
Shift the gear on a ho nigga, oh my God
Now I'm up, I don't know niggas, who are y'all?
Matter of fact, I never knew you niggas, I'm like, "Who you niggas?"
You keep puttin' on a show, I'ma have to boo you niggas
Put a M on his head, I'ma Majin Buu these niggas
No pad, no pen, but I'm still gon' school these niggas
Stay out of the loop, she do not fuck with them fruity niggas
I'ma buy chicken like two-piece, nigga
I got a chick in a two-piece, nigga, like

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight (seven, eight)
I told her 8:30 for a dinner date (dinner date)
Pull up at 8:50, bitch, I'm always late (always late)
I kill the pussy, dip and I don't leave a trace
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cuatro, cuatro, cinco, seis (cinco, seis)
Did a show in Egypt, pay a hundred K
Spend half of the profits on some real estate
Private jet to London for a dinner date

Swervin' in a Lamb' truck, no Benz (skrrt)
He is not no friend of me, these niggas not my kin (at all)
Say she wanna fuck with me, I'm like, "Bitch, that depends"
Took a private jet to London just to see how that bitch live
Man, these niggas cap, fuck you think this is, Litz? (Litz)
I don't pay no goddamn child support, but nigga, I got kids (I got kids)
All these rap niggas my sons, put them bitches in some bibs (yeah)
You can ask 'em where they been at, bet they say, "Up in the crib"
You niggas cryin', get a bottle, I just fucked on me a model
Niggas worry 'bout some Similac, I should have wore a condom (haha)
I'ma stack me up a million plaques and make me a Wakanda (woo)
Put my family queens in Birkins, floss some Dolce & Gabbana

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight (seven, eight)
I told her 8:30 for a dinner date (dinner date)
Pull up at 8:50, bitch, I'm always late (always late)
I kill the pussy, dip and I don't leave a trace
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cuatro, cuatro, cinco, seis (cinco, seis)
Did a show in Egypt, pay a hundred K
Spend half of the profits on some real estate
Private jet to London for a dinner date

(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
