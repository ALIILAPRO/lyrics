		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it in my blood
Darling, when you hold me, I can feel the chemicals
You took the man I was
Burned away the broken parts and left the beautiful

There ain't a feeling that I would trade
For that little smirk when you say my name

You get me high, high, high with just your smile, my love
Oh, my love
You get me high, high, high when you're by my side, my love
Oh, my love

You get me high, high, high

Told mommy, you're the one
She asked me when I knew and I said, "Oh, right from the jump"
You're the only love I want
'Cause all I ever crave is you on days when we're apart

There ain't a feeling that I would trade
For that little smirk when you say my name

You get me high, high, high with just your smile, my love
Oh, my love
You get me high, high, high when you're by my side, my love
Oh, my love

You get me high, high, high
You get me high, high, high oh with just your smile, my love
Oh, my love
You get me
