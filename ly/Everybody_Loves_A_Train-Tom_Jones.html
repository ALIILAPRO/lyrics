		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A long time down away on the Eastside
Southside los Angeles, Detroit, America, USA
Sittin' right about here
Watchin' high heels
And sneakers tread concrete
Platform headin' straight
For who knows where and why and how come

Goin' down the rails and comin' back
Train a-comin' goin' clack, clack, clack
Goin' down the rails and comin' back
Clack, clack, clack clack, clack, clack
I'm thinkin' in sick a brain "Say, man
Where you goin' with all those stories
Wrapped up in suitcase and
Handbags and old rags?"
He says, "I can't stay
Cause the 12: 40's got my name"
Well it goes without saying that
Everybody just loves a train

Steel whistle blowing crazy round and round
Jump on a car when she comes around
Steel whistle blowing crazy round and round
Jump on a car when she coming around
Clack, clack, clack clack, clack, clack

Goin' down the rails and comin' back
Train coming, going
Going clack, clack, clack
Clack, clack, clack

Just goes without saying that
Everybody loves a train
Go ahead and call us insane
But we all just love a train we love a train
Yeah, we love a train

Yeah, the train coming down the track
Hear the whistle going
Yeah, the train coming down the track
Hear the wheels going clack, clack, clack
Everybody just loves a train
