		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the greatest

What do I do?
I feel like I don't want to see you
I feel like I'm not in the mood
I feel like I got déjà vu
Isolation
Isolation
Isolation
Isolation
Yeah, yeah

I've been isolated, but having conversations
I feel like a doctor, I got a lot of patients
I got a lot of patience, patient with my time
But if you waste that, then you just crossed the line, and
I do this on the daily, and life is kinda crazy
See, life is like a game, but you can never play me
I used to party, but then I had to think right
If life is a party, I ain't looking for that invite
I see different energy and I'm feeling it
This a lifestyle that I never thought I'd be living in
Never move too fast
I'm always patient
I think I need time to myself in isolation

What do I do?
I feel like I don't want to see you
I feel like I'm not in the mood
I feel like I got déjà vu
Isolation
Isolation
Isolation
Isolation
Yeah, yeah

You're like an open book that I've never read
You're at chapter seven, while I'm at chapter ten
Looking at your past life, flipping through these pages
Going through your life, going through these different phases
Isolation or selfish ambition
But I hope I can deal with the distance
And I know my mind got me tripping
I don't even know what I'm missing
I talk but I don't ever listen
I used to be afraid of commitment
But now I know what I was thinking
Thinking I wasn't ready, thinking it wasn't time, yet
When I'm alone is when I have the best mindset
Never move too fast
I'm always patient
I think I need time to myself in isolation

What do I do?
I feel like I don't want to see you
I feel like I'm not in the mood
I feel like I got déjà vu
Isolation
Isolation
Isolation
Isolation (ooh, ooh)
