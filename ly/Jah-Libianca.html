		<p>
		  In my Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah

When it's time to focus on you, I will (I will, I will, I)
But right now I just really need to get on my feet
'Cause when I bleed, you don't really see me
You're never thinkin' about me
I'm your shield and your protector, darling
But when do you protect me?

You cannot reciprocate, no ('cate, o)
Can I be on your case, o? (On your case, o)
But me, I won't wait 'cause I have that all I need

In my Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah
If not for Jah
I fo don die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
There's no one to blame but me
If I decide to trust in a man
I'll rely on Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, ohh
In my Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah
If not for Jah
I fo don die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah

When your light goes out and you're lookin' for me, baby
Your disguise is beautiful, beautiful
And if I knew that you were my kryptonite o
I would have deserted you
Mmh, my darling
Seeing is deceiving, always deceiving
Mmh, my darling
Only God can save you now

You cannot reciprocate, no ('cate, o)
Can I be on your case, o? (On your case, o)
But me, I won't wait 'cause I have that all I need

In my Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah
If not for Jah
I fo don die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
There's no one to blame but me
If I decide to trust in a man
I'll rely on Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah
My Jah, my Jah
In my Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah
If not for Jah
I fo don die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
There's no one to blame but me
If I decide to trust in a man (If I decide)
I'll rely on Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah

In my Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah
If not for Jah
I fo don die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
