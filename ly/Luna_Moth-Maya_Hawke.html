		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put my foot down on a luna moth
In the bathroom at your party
You screamed into my terrycloth
I said that I was sorry

You found me with a door locked
I only went upstairs to cry
I came over here to be alone
Not to kill your things that fly

I don't need anyone to hurt me
I can do that myself
I don't see why you would want me
If I could, I would be anybody else

Put a needle through a luna moth (through a luna moth)
The one I crushed and let you down
I left it on your doorstep
But I didn't stick around (but I didn't stick around)
To watch you smile at an ugly thing
To try to ease my guilt
Watch you looking at a broken wing
Like it could be rebuilt

I don't need anyone to hurt me
I can do that myself
I don't see why you would want me
If I could, I would be anybody else

If I could, I would be anybody else
