		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goddamn, how'd I end up here?
My dreams, they all turn to nightmares
I'm not the same since that November
I know that you don't deserve this
My problems, my fight and your shit
I got them tangled up together

I won't blame you
If you walk away

But won't you stay?
I got a battle here to fight
Don't know if I'll ever see the light
But won't you stay?
I don't need much from you tonight
Just tell me you'll meet me there alive

On the other side
Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
On the other side

On the other side
On the other side

I wasn't always like this
Sixteen and na√Øve, a good kid
My mom and dad never saw it coming
But now I'm stuck in the trenches
Crawling through my consequences
I guess it's time I stopped the running

I won't blame you
If you walk away

But won't you stay?
I got a battle here to fight
Don't know if I'll ever see the light
But won't you stay?
I don't need much from you tonight
Just tell me you'll meet me there alive

On the other side
Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
On the other side

On the other side
On the other side
Woo-ooh-ooh, oh
