		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're surrounded
By debris of the past
And it's too late
To cause a change in the tides
So we slip into
Our hopeless sea of regret
As I stare

Through
The haunted maze in your eyes
Right through
Where I'll remain for all time

And time won't change this
This promise we made
Yeah, time won't change this
It's how it'll stay

This is our time
We devour the days ahead
We've been possessed
By these changing times
As we slip on through
We promised to meet again
Somewhere

Through
The haunted maze in our minds
Right though
Where we shall remain for all time

Yeah, time won't change this
This promise we made
And time won't change this
We shall remain
