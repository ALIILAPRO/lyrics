		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stupid me, thought I could trust you, what a lie
That you’d stay, no way you’d be leaving without goodbye.
And I’m still asking why?

Did you run out of love?
Was my own not enough?
Did you know from the start that I’d never be worth it, like you did it on purpose?
Had me falling so hard just to leave me in the dark

What a joke, and you made me the punchline, I should have known
That you, you were too good to be true.
Just a somebody to lose, I let you in and you let go
And I’m still asking why?

Did you run out of love?
Was my own not enough?
Did you know from the start that I’d never be worth it, like you did it on purpose?
Had me falling so hard just to leave me in the dark

Just to leave Me in The Dark

Did you run out of love?
Was my own not enough?
Did you know from the start that I’d never be worth it, like you did it on purpose?
Had me falling so hard just to leave me in the dark
