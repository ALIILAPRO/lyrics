		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell all the children
There's a new day dawnin'
If you are willin'
You can hear that a train a-callin'
Tell all the poor folk
In their homes across the nation
Tell 'em they better hurry
'Cause it's pulling into the station

If we don't change
Then we stay the same

Ride with me
Come on and ride with me
I will set you free
All you gotta do is ride with me

Children can you hear it?
Can you hear that whistle blowin'?
There's no need to fear it
'Cause you know just where it's goin'

If we don't change
Then we stay the same

Ride with me
Come on and ride with me
I will set you free
All you gotta do is ride with me

Ride with me
Come on and ride with me
I will set you free
All you gotta do is ride with me
Ride with me
Come on and ride with me
I will set you free
All you gotta do is ride with me

Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Ride with me
Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Ride with me
Come on and ride
Come on and ride
Ride with me
