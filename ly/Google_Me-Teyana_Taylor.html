		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the word? I'm the word on the street
Ain't nobody hotter than me, broads wish they was me
Huh! I'm superb, fly like a bird
Sixteen, with the baddest curves, weezy checkin' on me

I'm hot hot! But I'm cooler than your jewels
I'm a big shot, probably seen me in the news
Explorer, Safari, you know where your girl be
If you want to find me, baby, you can Google me

You ain't even gotta ask nobody 'bout me
I'm certified on the internet, read about it
If you're looking for me, go and pull it up
Cause I'm a celebrity, I know you done heard of me

You ain't even got a clue but it's so true
They flashing the cameras 'cause baby I'm the new new
So if you looking for me go and pull it up
Cause I'm a celebrity, go 'head and Google me

Ye' ain't nobody
Google me, baby
You better ask somebody
You better Google me, baby

Ye' ain't nobody
Google me, baby
You better ask somebody
You better Google me, baby

Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby

I bet you find me in Webster under the word 'star'
And I shine like the deuce 6's on the car
Can't get away from my pictures everywhere you are
Wanna see a living legend? You ain't gotta look far

Up close and personal, don't act like you don't know
I'm all professional, check the record
Put it in your search engine, 'Teyana, the princess of Harlem'
Baby, you can Google me

You ain't even gotta ask nobody 'bout me
I'm certified on the internet, read about it
If you're looking for me, go and pull it up
Cause I'm a celebrity, I know you done heard of me

You ain't even got a clue but it's so true
They flashing the cameras 'cause baby I'm the new new
So if you looking for me go and pull it up
Cause I'm a celebrity, go 'head and Google me

Ye' ain't nobody
Google me, baby
You better ask somebody
You better Google me, baby

Ye'ain't nobody
Google me, baby
You better ask somebody
You better Google me, baby

Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby

(Teyana)
On the cover of the magazine
Hand wavin' out the limousine
Interviews, puttin' it down in the booth
So you can see me and hear me

Every day, all day I grind
So you can go ahead gimme my shine
Cause I'm a prodigy, you ain't gotta believe me
Google me

Ye' ain't nobody
Google me, baby
You better ask somebody
You better Google me, baby

Ye' ain't nobody
Google me, baby
You better ask somebody
You better Google me, baby

Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby
Google me, baby, Google me, baby
