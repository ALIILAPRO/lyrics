		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I want to live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid

Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid

Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

This is a warning, like it or not
I break down, like a record spinning
Gotta get up
So back off
This is a warning, like it or not
I'm tired of listenin', I'm warning you, don't try to get up

There's a war going on inside of me tonight (don't be afraid)
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (don't be afraid)

Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
It's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
