		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I finally found her but I haven't got a piece of her yet
And I wanna tell you by the way (I think I've ruined your body)
She said "I love you, but you're difficult"
Words I've heard so many times before but those words don't mean a thing
(never meant a thing before you)

I think I found her but I haven't found a way to her yet
I wanna tell you by the way (I think I've ruined your body)
I want to tell her that I love her, but I just don't know
Oh this is terrible

You sounded sober when you told me to come over
I could tell it in the sound of your voice
(I know I better be careful)

She said I never want to let you go
She told me so

Now let me tell you how these steps go.
Step 1, tell me what have I done
Step 2, you know you're better than me or better believe?
Step 3, you'll never be like me so
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-no no

I think I found her but I haven't found a way to her yet
I wanna tell you by the way (I think I've ruined your body)
I want to tell her that I love her, but I just don't know
Oh this is terrible

(?)
Full of empty sighs and wine, and though the children have lost their way
(?)

(?)
Full of empty sighs and wine, and though the children have lost their way
(?)

I think I found her but I'll never let her in
So I guess we'll never know.

I think I found her but I haven't found a way to her yet
I wanna tell you by the way (I think I've ruined your body)
I want to tell her that I love her but I just don't know
Oh this is terrible [x3]

And I want to tell her that I love her, but I just don't know.
Oh this is terrible.
