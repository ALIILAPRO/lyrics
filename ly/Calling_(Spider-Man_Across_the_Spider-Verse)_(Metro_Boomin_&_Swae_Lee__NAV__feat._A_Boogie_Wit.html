		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Metro)
Just to save you (ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Yo) I'd give my all
Hey (ooh-ooh-ooh)

Just to save you, I'd give all of me (yeah)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (fall)
So to save you, I'd give my all (all)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (of me)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (fall for me)
So to save you, I'd give my all (all)

You fell for me, I count on you when times are tough
Instead of holdin' you down, I should lift you up
It hurts me when you start to see my flaws (my flaws)
But just to save you, I'd risk it all (all)
Short on time for you, I never have enough
When I ran into you, I didn't plan on fallin' in love
Always there to wipe your tears, I hate to see you cry
If you tell me to jump, I'll ask you, "How high?"
I know sometimes it be hard for me to tell the truth
But I go through any obstacle to get to you
I'm not materialistic, but I got a thing for you
Treat the world like my guitar, I'm pullin' strings for you

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (yeah)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (fall)
So to save you, I'd give my all (all)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (of me)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (fall for me)
So to save you, I'd give my all (all)

Let me be your hero

You held me down, I was stuck at the bottom
Get out of here, I get you lit, oh (I know they can't stand me)
I am the one that buss down your Rose gold, how your diamonds dancin'?
I pick you up in that Bentley Mulsanne
When them sirens was glaring
I gave you this number
It's nobody else that got it, you can call me
The way I let you come into my life
And take my heart over, it's like a 'Rari
Every time you look up on the charts
Now you seein' me, I hope you proud of me
I got you buss down, Patek Philippes
Ain't no way you goin' back to Carti's
And I splurge on her she like, "Saint Laurent me"
See me out in public, hardly
Lowkey with my mask on solo
If I don't speak to nobody, I'm sorry
And I'll save you, if you can't save yourself
Hold on, let me catch my breath
Need a hero, I'm the last one left

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (yeah)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (fall)
So to save you, I'd give my all (all)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (all of me)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (fall for me)
So to save you, I'd give my all (all)
