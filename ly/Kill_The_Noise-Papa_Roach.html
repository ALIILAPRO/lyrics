		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just feel like I'm channeling something
Kill the noise

No love, no feelings
I choke on the air I'm breathing
Undone, unhealing
Ain't nobody stopping the bleeding

Deaf with demons on both sides
Can't think, no angel left in sight
Chained to this static in my mind
And I can't hide

This rage, I just can't escape
Screaming at my face
So loud I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Freefall into grace
I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise
Kill the noise

My scars keep screamin'
I live through the pain for a reason
My God, my anger
It drags me down like an anchor

I'm deaf with demons on both sides
Can't think, no angel left insight
Chained to this static in my mind
And I can't hide

This rage, I just can't escape
Screaming at my face
So loud I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Freefall into grace
I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise

Shut up
Shut up

This rage, I just can't escape
Screaming at my face
So loud I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Freefall into grace
I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise
Kill the noise

Breaking through my mistakes
Freefall into grace
I'm not insane
