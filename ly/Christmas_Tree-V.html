		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this moment
I see you
It always comes around as I believed

When the rain stops
You shine on me
Your light's the only thing that keeps the cold out

Moon in the summer night
Whispering of the stars
They're singing like Christmas trees for us

So I'll tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside

And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are

It's such a strange thing to do
Sometimes I don't understand you
But it always brings me back
To where you are

혹시 아니?
너에겐 나만 아는 모습이 있어
한여름 밤 오는 첫눈같이
믿기지 않는 기적 같은 놀라운 순간, 넌

언젠가 또
불어온 바람에
마음이 날아다녀도
기다릴게

So I'll tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside

And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are

Tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside

Tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are
