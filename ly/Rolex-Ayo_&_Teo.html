(What's in that bag, boy?)
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie

I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (yeah)
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (yeah)
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me (yeah)
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me (she on me)

My Rollie don't tick-tock, it just glide
Keep starin' at it and you might go blind
I be movin' clean, I don't even try
All I see is bands, bands, I spy
Yeah, that way, I need that moola by Tuesday
Yeah, that way, I lowkey feel like Fungswae
I just now got started, got views on views, I'm poppin'
My diamonds goin' retarded, your girl on deck, it's a party

I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch (dab, dab)
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice (ice) on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch (dab, dab)
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (yeah)
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (Rollie, Rollie) (yeah)
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me (I'm cool, I'm cool) (yeah)
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me

Blue face Rollie, red face Rollie, ayy (woo, woo, yeah)
Purple face Rollie like some Teletubbies, ayy
Baby diamonds wet, shinin' like some guppies, whoa (they wet, yeah)
Your man's hatin', probably 'cause his girl love me, ayy
I pull up to the mall and I'm flexin' on you, whoa
Jahleele in the cut, and he got them buffies, ayy (got them buffies)
Whiteskins got me goin' crazy, crazy, ayy
Your girl love me 'cause she probably want my baby, ayy (woo)
Ice on my neck cost like five K (five K)
I want a girl built just like Kim K (she thick)
Karate chop that bitch just like a sensei (karate)
Pull off up in a 'Rari or a Bentley

I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch (dab, dab)
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice (ice) on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants (Versace)
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (Rollie, Rollie) (yeah)
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie (Rollie, Rollie) (yeah)
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me (brr) (yeah)
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me (she on me)

(Yeah, she on me)
(All I ever wanted was a Rollie)
(All I ever wanted was a Rollie)
(I just want a Rollie)
(I just want a Rollie)
(I just want a)
(I just want a Rollie)
