		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the moon
I see the moon
I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
I'm not a fool
I'm not a fool
Not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

I see in blue
I see in blue
I see in blue
Oh, and you see everything in red
And there's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you
Do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one

I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
