		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time and place 
Not far from here and now 
Maybe a brighter day 
Maybe they had it made somehow 
Living for there and then 
Under a psychadelic spell 
No one was listening 
Still they had so much to tell 

Whatever happened to the dreamers 
They always look beyond the sky 
Saw a world they could believe in 
But only when they close their eyes 

There were the politcians 
Men of the cloth, painters and poets 
Starting a revolution 
Without even knowing it 
Making the world around us 
Making heaven and hell 
Saying so much about us 
Still they had so much to tell 

Whatever happened to the dreamers 
They always looked beyond the sky 
Saw a world they could believe in 
But only when they close their eyes 

Where are they now 
They've all left town 
Bringing the clouds 

Whatever happened to the dreamers 
They always look beyond the sky 
Saw a world they could believe in 
But only when they close their eyes 
But only when they close their eyes 

Why are we on our own, why are we on our own 

Nothing's ever been this way before 
A dream is just a dream and nothing more 
Nothing's ever been this way before 
A dream is just a dream and nothing more
