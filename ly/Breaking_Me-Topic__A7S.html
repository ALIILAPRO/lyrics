		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me what you wanna
I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times
Ayy, ayy
Fallin' for another
I don't even bother
I could do it all my life

So tell me if you wanna
'Cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it
'Cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you
It's like I've started dreaming
Guess Heaven's not that far away

And I'll be singing
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start 
You played with my heart

And I'll be singing
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me

You can do whatever
I'll be here forever
Spinning 'round inside this room
Ayy, ayy
Won't you come on over?
I'm a sucker for ya
Wishing we'll be out here soon

So tell me if you wanna
'Cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it
'Cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you
It's like I've started dreaming
Guess Heaven's not that far away

And I'll be singing
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start 
You played with my heart

And I'll be singing
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
