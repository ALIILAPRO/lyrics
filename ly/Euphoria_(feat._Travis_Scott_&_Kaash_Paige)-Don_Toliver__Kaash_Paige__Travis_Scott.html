		  Euphoria, I'm drownin' in euphoria
Drownin' in euphoria, euphoria

Sleep alone by my phone all the time
Check my phone, already knowin' it's dry
Fake friends and old hoes, they all bangin' my line
Tryna get the patience, but I have no time
Like a dead man walking
Try to speed time, 'cause I know you
Funny how they never care about the old you
I'ma blow up, that's what I'm 'posed to
After I blow up, act like I don't know you

Euphoria
I'm drownin' in euphoria 
Drownin' in euphoria
Drownin' in euphoria 

I pulled off, off the street (pulled off, pulled off)
Took two down, help me bleed (ooh)
Hate when I'm in that mode (in that mode)
I should pull up with the
That's too easy
You say something to leave me, but I'm not good at reachin'
I tried that reason
Secret lust, leave alone, then come back on this side
We both half high

Euphoria, tell me right now
If I can get high with you
Euphoria, ask me right now
And I'll tell you all the truth

Euphoria
I'm drownin' in euphoria
Drownin' in euphoria
Drownin' in euphoria 

Seems like I came in time (seems like)
But I thought I could do better, babe
Think about you every day (seems like)
Just like a diamond, you shine (seems like)
Too many girls in other states
I wouldn't have told you anyway
I guess you've had enough (had enough)
I called you four times, I guess you mad or what? (Mad or)
And me bein' me, I guess I'm outspoken (yeah)
I leave all these girls around my house heartbroken

Euphoria, tell me right now 
If I can get high for you
Euphoria, ask me right now
And I'll tell is all the truth

Euphoria
I'm drownin' in euphoria
Drownin' in euphoria, euphoria

Euphoria
