		  Booty dancer
Booty dancer

Ayy, bitch, keep dancin' (keep dancin')
I was cute but the money made me handsome (handsome)
Ayy, kidnap your bitch, no ransom (ransom)
Ayy, take off your shoes, it's a mansion (take it off)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, bitch, keep dancin'

Ayy, twenty bad bitches in the mansion (mansion)
Got some bitches in the Uber, they just landed (landed)
It's my lifestyle, nigga, I ain't plan it (nope)
Ain't no bitch on this planet that I can't get (none)
Money on my mind, I got the bandwidth (hah)
They gon' show respect, 'cause I demand it (I demand it)
She don't speak English, only Spanish (s√≠)
Sex language, I got advantage
Poppin' that ass, bussin' out the bag (bussin')
Tryna fuck with her, better have cash
All the bitches in my section, niggas gettin' mad
Thought we ran out, I got mo' in the stash (-ash)

Aye, bitch, keep dancin' (keep dancin')
I was cute but the money made me handsome (handsome)
Aye, kidnap yo' bitch, no ransom (bitch)
Aye, take off yo' shoes, it's a mansion (take it off)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, bitch, keep dancin' (bounce that ass)

Flick a romantic, pussy don't panic
Fuck you with your skirt on, slide off the panties (slide, slide)
Put in work and my tube come in handy
Macho man, I'm a savage like Randy (savage)
On the bed, baby (bed, baby)
Gimme head, baby (head, baby)
Spread your legs, baby (legs, baby)
And you goin' crazy
Need a young bitch, need a old lady
Ride for me like Chrisean do for Blueface, baby (baby)
(Haha)
And I told her I put it on as soon as I made it (told her I put it on as I made it)
But the bitch too impatient, that's why she never made it (bitch)

Aye, bitch, keep dancin' (keep dancin')
I was cute but the money made me handsome (handsome)
Aye, kidnap your bitch, no ransom (ransom)
Aye, take off your shoes, it's a mansion (take it off)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, bitch, keep dancin'
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, booty dancer (bounce that ass)
Go, go, bitch, keep dancin'

Pop it, pop it
Go, go, bitch, keep dancin'
Pop it, pop it
Go, go, booty dancer
Booty dancer
Ayy, bitch, keep dancin'
