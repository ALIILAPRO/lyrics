		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much aggression, hey, hey
You shouldn't call me again
'Cause I'm progressing every day
There's nothing more to defend
See the flower closing up
This is our autumn wind
It leaves me so cold

I just wanna get up, run away
I can't wait, see me decay
Under your weight
Not gonna change
I can't wait 
Get my head straight (oh)

I could be happier
It's looking better tomorrow
I could be happier
'Cause I'm ready to let go
Your love's a losing game
I don't wanna keep playing
I could be happier
Happier, I

I could be happier
Happier, happier, happier
I could be happier
Happier, happier, happier

Your love's a losing game
I don't wanna keep playing
I could be happier
Happier, happier

Too much possession, hey, hey
Too many confessions, hey
I can't stop to think about you
I'm done thinking it through
No more allegations, yeah
No negotiations, yeah
I can't stop to think about you

I just wanna get up run away
I can't wait, see me decay
Under your weight
Not gonna change
I can't wait 
Get my head straight (oh)

I could be happier
It's looking better tomorrow
I could be happier
'Cause I'm ready to let go
Your love's a losing game
I don't wanna keep playing
I could be happier
Happier

I could be happier
Happier, happier, happier
I could be happier
Happier, happier, happier
Your love's a losing game
I don't wanna keep playing
I could be happier
Happier
