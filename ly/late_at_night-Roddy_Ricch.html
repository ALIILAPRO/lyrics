		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin', late at night
Catch me drivin' down 405
Catch me and your girl late at night
Side to side
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you

I can't fuck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I been all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside, I'm a high roller
I been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick knacks
Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a Kit-Kat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach
I just fucked off a million but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat
She know I got the game but I'm never gon' give it back
Every time that we fuck, I gotta run it back

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you

I told shorty, never get too comfortable
I like to feel like the pussy untouchable
I like to feel like it's never goin' one way
I like to see your body drippin' Elliante
I say I like the way I took you on a wave
I had you screamin' my name out

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you

Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
