		  Through the valley of lies
Through the valley of lies 

I'm walking through the valley of lies
I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky

Taking trips down uncharted roads, them very lonely roads
Looking for a pot of gold, your love was not enough
It don't make no sense to me, and now you're begging please
Remember you was hurting me, well keep that energy

I've been waiting, knowing you won't show up
Don't make no sense, I'm not
I'm not giving in

I'm walking through the valley of lies
I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky

On and on and on
Keep fighting, Armageddon
Now things are getting rough
I never thought you'd be a lesson

Go, you go, you go
How come I never see ya?
I'm really getting close to giving up, I hate the feeling

Yeah, through the valley of your lies 
The water keeps flowing down 
You won't believe it's all from my eyes 

Thought you were the one 
You tarnished our love 
Yeah, with your liar's tongue 
After all

You knew that we would end up this way 
I never knew my love would turn gray 
All our memories in my head 
It's time to bury 'em away
Way deep inside the valley
It's gonna be okay, hey

Ah-na-na-na-na, ah-na-na-na-na
Ah-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

Ah-na-na-na-na, ah-na-na-na-na
Ah-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

I'm walking through the valley of lies
I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky

On and on and on
Keep fighting, Armageddon
Now things are getting rough
I never thought you'd be a lesson

Go, you go, you go 
How come I never see ya? (see ya)
I'm really getting close to giving up, I hate the feeling
