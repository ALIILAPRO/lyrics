		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I Am what you would define as a murderous psychopath. 
I have no empathy and my only vision in life is to inflict as much pain and suffering as humanly 
possible, unto helpless and terrified victims that may cross my path.
So innocent and lovely yet, i wanna see you suffer slowly. Through sexual acts of murder or torture. 
You will fall victim to my blade of rapture. 
Ill stab you in the skull and pull out your dead brain. 
Then your hollow cranium will give me splendid 
head. 
Using your brain as lubricant , rubbing it onto your dead dry cunt , fucking it harder and harder. 
Forcing my rock hard cock into every  putrid cavity of your deliciously rotting body. 
A brain dead skull fucking is what awaits you. 
A braindead skull fucking i will put you through. 
A braindead skull fucking will send you to the afterlife
A braindead skull fucking die by the hands of my knife. 
I see you So innocent  and lovely, yet the deranged urges in me. 
Just wanna see you suffer slowly by any means 
necessary. 
Any means necessary.
I Am what you would define as a murderous 
psychopath. I have no empathy and my only vision in life is to inflict as much pain and suffering as humanly possible.
 A braindead skull fucking. 
Its not rape if you're fucking 
dead. 
Not that it matters though, ill have my will either way.
