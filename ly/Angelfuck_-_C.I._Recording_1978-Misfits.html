		<p>
		  Little Angelfuck
It's a shame that luck is the only thing
Did you like the fun
Did you like the times that I promised you

Open wounds on your brow
Little angel in red
She isn't loving you anymore

Little Angelfuck
I see you going down on a fireplug
Little Angelfuck
Size for everyone

Let those bastards believe
Dry your eyes and we'll leave
She isn't loving you anymore

Little Angelfuck
I see you going down on a fireplug
Oh, little Angelfuck
Size for everyone

Let those bastards believe
Dry your eyes and we'll leave
She isn't loving you anymore
