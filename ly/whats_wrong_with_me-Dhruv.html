		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found me a boy who does everything right
Knows me generously
Calls me late in the night when I'm down
Oh, I found me a man
With an exquisite mind
He's a world of bright color 
When he hears these songs and the sounds (sounds)

But I don't wanna spend another moment
Acting like it's everything when we kiss
Tripping like I didn't know something's amiss 
In my heart
Oh, I refer you to the gods, the heavens
"Let me fall in love with this gentleman"
Tell me why my mind keeps wandering to other guys

What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me? Oh no, no, no
What's wrong with me?

Get you someone who tells you what you're worth
Picks you up from the bottom 
And scrubs off the dirt with his hands
Oh, found me a love that feels stable and safe
But I'm starting to wonder 
If I need the chase of a man

And I don't wanna spend another moment
Lying to a boy who don't deserve it
Telling empty words that I never meant 
In my life
And I thought that this would be a sweet dream
Tell me, was Monday reality?
Boy, you did so good, it's all on me this time

What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me? Oh no, no, no
What's wrong with me?

I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
You deserve better
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
You deserve better
I'm so sorry
