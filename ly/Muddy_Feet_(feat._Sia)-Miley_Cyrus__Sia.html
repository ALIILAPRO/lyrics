		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know who the hell you think you're messing with
Get the fuck outta my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit

And I don't know who the hell you think you're messing with
Get the fuck outta my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit

You smell like perfume that I didn't purchase
Now I know why you've been closing the curtains, ah
Get the fuck out of my house

You're coming 'round with your muddy feet
I'm about to do something about it
Yeah, I'ma have to do something 'bout it

You keep coming 'round with your muddy feet
Yeah, I'ma have to do something 'bout it
I'm about to do something about it

Back and forth, always questioning my questioning
Get the fuck out of my head with that shit
Get the fuck out of my bed with that shit

You've watered the weeds and you killed all the roses
Worthy arrives when the other door closes, ah
So get the fuck out of my house with that shit

You're coming 'round (coming 'round, baby) with your muddy feet
I'm about to do something about it (what I do)
Yeah, I'ma have to do something 'bout it (what I do)

And I don't know who you're messin' with
Yeah, I'ma have to do something 'bout it (what I do)
I'm about to do something about it (what I do)

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, you're coming around
You're coming around, baby (what I do, what I do)

The fuck out of my house with that shit
