		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boom, boom, boom
Beats my heart, heart, heart
Baby boom, boom, boom
In the dark, dark, dark
Baby boom, boom, boom
Fall apart, part, part
Baby boom, boom, boom
From the start, start, start

But I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
Yeah, I've been waiting for you

Well someone must have sent you here to save my life
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight
I know that in darkness I have found my light
I know that in darkness I've been given sight
In your loving arms I feel delight
In your loving arms I'll be alright
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight
Someone must have sent you here to save my life

Save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life

High, high, high
We take flight, flight, flight
Baby high, high, high
Touch the sky, sky, sky
Baby high, high, high
Diamond nights, nights, nights
Baby, high, high, high
'Cause love don't lie, lie, lie

I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you

Well someone must have sent you here to save my life
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight
I know that in darkness I have found my light
I know that in darkness I've been given sight
In your loving arms I feel delight
In your loving arms I'll be alright
Someone must have sent you to save me tonight
Someone must have sent you here to save my life

Save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life
Save my life (someone must have sent you here to)
Save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life
You saved my life
