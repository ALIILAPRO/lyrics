		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days, they can feel so long
I've been hanging on to a sad love song
Nights never came to dawn
They went on and on
When you pulled me out

And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you
And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you

Days, they'd felt so lost
I was so far gone
Hanging upside down
Nights, were my only friend
My distraction
When you pulled me out

And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you
And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you

Before I knew it
Before I knew it
There was nothing to it
Before I knew it
I became all about you
All about you
All about you
All about you
I said

And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you
I became all about you
I became all about you
