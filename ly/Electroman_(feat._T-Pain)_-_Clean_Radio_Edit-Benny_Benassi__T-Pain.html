		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am electro man, man, man, man, 
You are electro girl, girl, girl, girl
Electricity! Come on! 
Electricity! Come on! 

In the darkness we light up the sky, 
I'm talking party, 
So the darkness can die! 
There's no opponents, can't temperate she and I
We're just a part of one of those secrets societies.
Oh, oh, tell me baby, baby can you, electricity! 
I can really tell you what you really wanna be, 
Come get me! 
Oh, oh, take my hand! 
Do you know who I am?

I am electro man, man, man, man! 
You are electro girl, girl, girl, girl! 
Electricity! Come on! 
Electricity! Come on! 

In the daylight, we wait for the night! 
Stay away from the fight! 
I'll make you blood drained
Count it girl, I'll suck you dry, 
If something to chase you, 
No you cannot die! 
Oh, oh! Aha, aha! 
Turn around, break it down, check it now! 
It's going down! 

I am electro man, man, man, man! 
You are electro girl, girl, girl, girl! 
Electricity! Come on! 
Electricity! Come on

I am electro man, man, man, man! 
You are electro girl, girl, girl, girl! 
Electricity! Come on! 
Electricity! Come on
