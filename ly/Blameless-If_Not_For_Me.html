		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you face yourself? 
You point the finger at everyone else. 
Putting on a show, thought I'd never know. 
You didn't want me but you'd never let go.

Blame it on the monster in my head. 
Blame it on the stranger in your bed. 
But you can't take much more. 
Don't wanna stay but you can't leave, so blame it all on me.

There's nothing left for me to do. 
Don't blame somebody else, you did this to yourself. 
I'm done defending myself to you. 
Don't blame somebody else, you did this to yourself.

What do you want from me? 
All I ever gave was everything. 
Over from the start, never in your heart. 
You couldn't wait to watch it fall apart.

Blame it on the monster in my head. 
Blame it on the stranger in your bed. 
But you can't take much more. 
No you can't take much more. 
I'll never be the one thing that you need. 
So dig a little deeper, and you'll see that you can't take much more. 
Don't wanna stay but you can't leave, so blame it all on me.

Always giving up, never good enough. 
Was it everything you want? 
Fake love. 
Not enough.

I see right through. 
I know the truth.

Blame it on the monster in my head. 
Blame it on the stranger in your bed. 
But you can't take much more. 
No you can't take much more. 
I'll never be the one thing that you need. 
So dig a little deeper, and you'll see that you can't take much more. 
Don't wanna stay but you can't leave, so blame it all on me.
