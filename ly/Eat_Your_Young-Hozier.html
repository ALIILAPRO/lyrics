		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm starving, darling
Let me put my lips to something
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carving, darling
I wanna smell the dinner cooking
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the getting is gone
I won't lie, if there's something to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to it
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, Highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm making sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie, if there's something still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young
