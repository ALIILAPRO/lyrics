		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say, I don't need anyone
But I do
Why is it always misery that I choose?
Am I only climbing
So I can fall?
And you can turn my only hope into my hospital?

So why do I run for the flames?
'Cause there's no way back
And they're all I have
Am I, am I so lost again?
I'd give everything
But I never will

I'll close my eyes
Because the world outside is goin' under
You know I die
I will leave this life to find another
If there's a universe, even one reality
Where I'm enough for me

Now all of my nightmares are comin' true
And I've seen beyond the darkest side of the moon, oh
I've walked in the shadows, but how do I run?
From monsters in the mirror that I'm afraid that I've become

So why do I run for the flames?
'Cause there's no way back
And they're all I have
Am I, am I so lost again?
I'd give everything, but I never will

I'll close my eyes
Because the world outside is goin' under
You know I die
I will leave this life to find another
If there's a universe, even one reality
Where I'm enough for me

Where I'm enough for me
Where I'm enough for me

Am I, am I so lost again?
If there's no way back
Is this all I have?
If I'm alive, but lost again
Given everything
When I'll never win

I'll close my eyes
'Cause the world outside is goin' under
You know I die
I will leave this life to find another
If there's a universe, even one reality
Where I'm enough for me
