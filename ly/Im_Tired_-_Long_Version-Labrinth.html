		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired of tears
Hey Lord, just cut me loose

Hey Lord, you know I'm fighting
Hey Lord, you know I'm fighting
I'm sure this world is done with me
Hey Lord, you know it's true

Now the tide is rollin' in
I don't wanna win
Let it take me
Let it take me
I'll be on my way
How long can I stay?
In the place
That can't contain me

Hey Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Please don't say you need me
Release me, believe me
One day you will see me
Believe me
Please don't say you need me
Release me, believe me
One day you will see me
Believe me, you'll leave me, oh
