		  VERSE 1
I wake up to a little bit of drool on my pillow, feel like It’s gon be a bad day
Yea I’m tired as shit, and the coffee ain’t hit yet 
Damn ain’t that great
I don’t wanna go to work, cuz my boss is a jerk and I’m not even that paid
I need a change in my life, cuz I don’t feel alive and there’s nothing that makes me happy
Uhh
Hold my beer for a minute
I’m bout to quit my job, cash in for a ticket
I’m going on a trip and I don’t plan to visit
I’m gonna stay there till I feel like I’m winning 
…and this is just the beginning
I need a big change, help me feel like living 
I need a big swing home runs I’m hitting
And I’ll never look back, moving on till I get it 

HOOK:
Yea we all got dreams
We all want things
But what you gonna do for it 
How you gonna move for it
What you gonna be ?
And do you believe
You can do anything?
Then what you gonna do for it 
How you gonna move for it
What you gonna be?

VERSE 2:
Yeah this is my life, my strife, my right to fight, to die uh!
And this is my game to play, to claim a brand new name uh! 
And I ain’t gonna lie to you 
I’m a bit nervous, that I might screw
Everything up that I’ve ever done
But what’s the point of living if you ain’t having fun! 
I guess I’ll try this, try that, might miss, gotta find what I’m good at 
I guess I’ll look here, look there, over where? I’m scared where am I at?!
I gotta make it in this life
Whatever makes me happy know I’m doing things right
Sipping in the summer on a goose and sprite
Or find a nightclub for the end of the night 

HOOK:
Yea we all got dreams
We all want things
But what you gonna do for it 
How you gonna move for it
What you gonna be ?
And do you believe
You can do anything
Then what you gonna do for it 
How you gonna move for it
What you gonna be?
