		  (Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)

How can I lose if I'm already chose? Like
If she feelin' hot then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
If the party not lit, then I'd rather not go (why would I go?)
If she feelin' hot then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn

Bitches not bad, they be on my ass
I can hear you hatin' from the back (the back)
Balenciaga baddie, got a bag (a bag)
Nigga munchin', ate it from the back (the back)
Nigga fiendin', got to play it cool (huh?)
Got the jatty, I'ma make a move (God damn)
Breakin' records and I'm breakin' news
Bitches be pressed, like, who you? (Who you?)
I get whatever I like, bitches won't bark but they wanna bite
I got two milli' for usin' a mic bitch 
Think about that when you type shit
She wanna party wit' Spice (party wit' Spice)
And the body gon' eat, bon app√©tit
Ass on fat with the waist on sleek (yeah)
Ginger hair, pretty, calm, beat

How can I lose if I'm already chose? Like
If she feelin' hot then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
If the party not lit, then I'd rather not go (why would I go?)
If she feelin' hot then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn

Look in the mirror, I'm feelin' me (feelin' me)
Stackin' money where the ceilin' be (ceilin' be)
Twenty to stand on a couch (couch)
When out of town, fuck if they feelin' me (feelin' me)
He like the way that I dress (yes)
Throw on Balenci' to flex (grrah)
Like MiMi, I got 'em obsessed (obsessed)
Them bitches see me as a threat (yes)
The baddest in the room (baddest in the room)
So tell 'em to make room
Diamonds glisten on my boob (boob)
They gon' listen to my tune (tune)
Flow the nicest, but I'm rude (rude)
I like niggas, bitches too (bitches too)
Ayo, baddie, what it do? (What it do?)
Ayo, Maddie, what it do? (Ha)

How can I lose if I'm already chose? Like
If she feelin' hot then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
If the party not lit, then I'd rather not go (why would I go?)
If she feelin' hot then I make that bitch froze
And I get a bitch tight every time that I post, damn
