		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yuh, Young Nigga World
(ForeignGotEm!)
Young New Wave
It's a Young Nigga World
Yung Shad, you killed this track!

Back in my dreams
Chillin' with your bae, totin' the AK
Back in my dreams
This never ever what it seems
Choppers to his face, yeah that's a scary cat
Pull up to the light, killers dressed in all black
Jumpin' out a splak, hop out with a MAC
What happens when I die in my dreams?

Back in the days, holding Glocks & AK's
You know, I know, you can see it in my eyes, that I wasn't gonna make it
Older brother thuggin', yeah he taught me all the basics
Told me keep it on by my waist, keep that earthquake
I know, ain't no other way, music my only chance
This my only way, gotta make these bands
I know how fast they can come take my life, gotta watch my left and right
Ooh, they gon' love you and hate you same night
Ooh, don't got time to argue and fight

Back in my dreams
Chillin' with your bae, totin' the AK
Back in my dreams
This never ever what it seems
Choppers to his face, yeah that's a scary cat
Pull up to the light, killers dressed in all black
Jumpin' out the splat, hop out with a mac
What happens when I die in my dreams?

Lil buddy pop a pill
And get wicked wit' da' Glock
No music rolling, heavy metal on yo' block
12 want to know, bodies droppin' on the clock
Gifford's where it's hot, dodgin' death and cops
Melvin, my big brother, so I'm icy
Do it for the money, that's my wifey
And I ain't gonna say nothin', grew up in the G
We was grindin' and hustlin', you know me
I know, back in them days
We was in the trap house, tryna' figure out a way
I know, I know how far to go
I know to take it slow, stretch it and make it grow

Back in my dreams
Chillin' with your bae, totin' the AK
Back in my dreams
This never ever what it seems
Choppers to his face, yeah that's a scary cat
Pull up to the light, killers dressed in all black
Jumpin' out the splat, hop out with a mac
What happens when I die in my dreams?

Back in my dreams
It's never ever what it ever seems
What happens when I die in my dreams?
This never ever what it seems
