		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born in a back alley on a Thursday
So I reach for the tequila when I'm thirsty
You don't like my friends you
Think that they dirty i say I don't give no
Fuck and you should worry
I'm not better off than the company I keep
And they know espresso we can
Get the shots for cheap
You know I take one home if I'm feeling horny
'Cause the only thing I feel
These days is being lonely

I chase my liquor with more liquor
When I'm hanging with my niggas
Pack man came through he delivered
You keep calling, I dismiss 'ya
I chase my liquor with more liquor
When I'm hanging with my niggas
Pack man came through he delivеred
You keep calling, I dismiss 'ya

Just ate a pussy potsticker
Girl you so cold makе that pussy popsicle
Girl you supposed make that nigga buy liquor
I hope you drove Uber here
Don't gotta whip it i told her rosé is red
And violence ain't new bae
Number liquor stores galore where we stay
Prolly why we grew up with
Bottled up battle scars
Tequille O'Neal do magic on alcohol
I'm doing alchemy on alcohol
I alkaline the water
Then another shot I'm Al Capone
Shoot it 'till it's gone
I shoot at least until I'm going
A hundred miles an hour
Back my home that patron got me
Coming on strong like acetone
Okay I chased ambition so ambitious
Steppers with me blessed no fatigue
Sick my fire sick my weed
Fronto on my tree I got forces on my feet
I don't chase hoes but

I chase my liquor with more liquor
When I'm hanging with my niggas
Pack man came through he delivered
You keep calling, I dismiss 'ya
I chase my liquor with more liquor
When I'm hanging with my niggas
Pack man came through he delivered
You keep calling, I dismiss 'ya

I chase my liquor with more liquor
When I'm hanging with my niggas
Pack man came through he delivered
You keep calling, I dismiss 'ya
I chase my liquor with more liquor
When I'm hanging with my niggas
Pack man came through he delivered
You keep calling, I dismiss 'ya

You wanna act a fool
You wanna showup to my spot
You wanna blow it up
You wanna run your fucking mouth
But I'm not having that
So Imma hike it then I throw
It like a quarter back
Cause nigga we don't play
I said shoulders, chest, knees, and toes
Don't be scared girl get down on the floor
Now drop that shit and roll with it
Drinkin' hella liquor so you know we feel it

Just ate a pussy potsticker
Girl you so cold make that pussy popsicle
Girl you supposed make that nigga buy liquor
I hope you drove Uber here
Don't gotta whip it
Just ate a pussy potsticker
Girl you so cold make that pussy popsicle
Girl you supposed make that nigga buy liquor
I hope you drove Uber here
Don't gotta whip it
