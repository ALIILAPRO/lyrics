		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the feelin' is ended 
There ain't no use pretendin' 
Don't ya worry it's only love 

When your world has been shattered 
Ain't nothin' else matters 
It ain't over it's only love 
And that's all ya 
When your heart has been broken 
Hard words have been spoken 
It ain't easy but it's only love 

And if your life ain't worth livin' 
And you're ready to give in 
Just remember that it's only love 

Only love
You can live without the aggravation 
Ya gotta wanna win ya gotta wanna win 

You keep lookin' back in desperation 
Over and over and over again 

Yeah yeah
It's only love baby
Yeah, hey
Ooh baby baby, it's only love, love, love
Love love love
When your world is shattered 
Ain't nothin' else matters 
It ain't over it's only love 

If your life ain't worth livin' 
And you're ready to give in 
Just remember that it's only love 
Yeah, that's all 

Yeah it ain't easy baby 
But it's only love and that's all
