		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wheezy outta here
Yeah

Gunna spittin' words like a mothafuckin' poet
Told 'em, "Press start, I'ma go ahead and record" (go ahead and record)
Push one button, I could close up the doors (yeah)
Made a few millions, give a fuck about the Forbes (uh-huh)
Drippin' all the children, nigga, used to couldn't afford ('ford)
I was in the trenches rockin' Gucci and Dior
BET was trippin', how I didn't get an award? (How?)
You got me annoyed
Double park the Urus, I'll pull up, 'Ventador (skrrt)
Travel like a tourist, had to fly to Bora Bora
Show's around one-fifty, but they paid a lil' more (more)
Me and Wheezy wave, fuckin' bitches on the shore (wave)
We ain't come to play, is you with it, are you sure? (Nuh-uh)
Smokin' like a train, you can smell it in my pores (shh)
Cup full of codeine, you can smell it when I pour (smell it when I pour)
How'd I drink this all?
I'm spendin' on designer when I'm shoppin' in New York (designer)
Goin' shoppin' one stop 'fore I stop at the resort (resort)
You gon' never get it if your feature money short (nuh-uh)
Wake up to a threesome in the penthouse on the Nawf (yeah)
Rick Owens denims, show my sneakers like they shorts (Rick Owens)
Gunna spit venom, you can hear it in his voice (venom)
Tried me and I killed him, I didn't really have no choice
I'm showin' no remorse

Can't see nothin' but the money like a blindfold
Two watches 'cause I'm in two different time zones
She like the way I fuck her, have her mind blown
She stalkin', had to let her hear the dial tone
I'm crissin' with these crosses yeah, it's all chrome
We cookin' with that chopper, send your dog home
Been livin', I'ma paint the Bentley rose gold
Beginnin' and we headed up a long road

Yeah (long road)
You can hear the money in my voice
'Ventador, 2020, I ain't have a choice
And I got a Urus, we the Lamborghini Boys
I been gettin' millions, I ain't trippin' 'bout awards, yeah
Watchin' what I do, I got endorsements
Certified dripper, me and Gunna walk on water, yeah
Middle finger ring cost a quarter
Prolly one the flyest young niggas out of Georgia
I been goin' in, all you gotta do is record me
Niggas actin' like bitches, always keepin' shit corny
Get a nigga whacked for a new pair of Jordans
Hoppin' on the plane, I'm landin' in the mornin
Niggas ain't gang, nah, I'll never let 'em join us
How you go from Section 8 to ridin' in a foreign?
I'm only gon' hit it and forget it if it's borin'
I been sippin' syrup all day, just pourin'
Sold out dates, back to back like I'm tourin'
I just left the house, came in BAPE floors
I ain't miss the Jordans for this pair of Diors
Youngin' on fire, I ain't passin' the torch
I was hood rich, now I passed on the Forbes
Yeah, nigga tried to play me like a toy, damn
Now I feel bad for your boy, yeah

Can't see nothin' but the money like a blindfold
Two watches 'cause I'm in two different time zones
She like the way I fuck her, have her mind blown
She stalkin', had to let her hear the dial tone
I'm crissin' with these crosses yeah, it's all chrome
We cookin' with that chopper, send your dog home
Been livin', I'ma paint the Bentley rose gold
Beginnin' and we headed up a long road
