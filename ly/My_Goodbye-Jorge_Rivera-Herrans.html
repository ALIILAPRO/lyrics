		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are reckless
Sentimental at best
That's not a teaching of mine
You've grown soft
Your dead friends can attest

Hey!

Put your emotions aside
You're a warrior
Meant to lead the rest
I don't know where I went wrong
But I warned you
And you failed the test
So now I'm gone

This way, you'll know what your place is
This way, you can't cross the line
This way, when all is over
You'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
This way, you won't disappoint me
This way, you won't waste my time
This way, I'll close the door
Consider this as my goodbye

That's just like you
Why should I be surprised?
Selfish and prideful and vain
Unlike you
Every time someone dies
I'm left to deal with the strain

What's a title
That a Goddess could lend
If I'll never sleep at night?
I'll remind you
I saw you as a friend
But now we're done

This way, you're out of my head now
This way, you won't plague my life
This way, when all is done
You're out of sight and out of mind
This way, you get what you wanted
This way, you can save your time
This way, you close the door
And have your damn goodbye

You're not looking for a mentor
I'm not looking for a friend
I mistook you for a general
What a waste of effort spent

At least I know what I'm fighting for
While you're fighting to be known!
Since you claim you're so much wiser
Why's your life spent all alone?
You're alone

One day, you'll hear what I'm saying
One day, you might understand
One day, but not today
For after all you're
(Just a man)

This day, you sever your own head
This day, you cut the line
This day, you lost it all
Consider this as my goodbye

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Consider this as my goodbye (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This is my goodbye (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Consider this as my goodbye (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This is my goodbye!
