		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

I said, "Say my name" (say it)
First class flight to L.A, as soon as I land, bill a paper plane (uh)
Soon touch back in the ends 
One-ten on the M, tryna take a chase (skrrt-skrrt)
Big fat stack in my bag, when I un-zip that, finna make it rain

Cuh, when we run down, it's rain 
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain 
She said, "Wagwan, what's goin' on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain 
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain
She said, "Wagwan, what's goin' on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain (yeah)

Me and akhi doin' up money
Gyal on curry, neck McFlurry (bling-blaow)
When you snap your receipts, that's funny (ha)
Your jeans say P's but your bank says bummy (ah)
I was looney before I made tunes
Now I'm AJ but my AP's Bugs Bunny (bling)
Big boogers in my watch, that's runny (blaow)
No drip, when I flick this, man hurry (chin')
I got the gyal of your dreams on her knees
In my inbox, tryna call AJ 'honey' (muah)
I go tape, make it rain or sunny
I came from the dirt so we keep shit muddy (yeah)
Arabic dial, big rocks is flooded (yeah)
See me, the habibti's dem love it (muah)
All up on a bitch, can't tame man, shovin'
Mcglovin', run jokes, get blooded (baow-baow)
These kicks on my feet from Virgil
No Van Dijk, I'm on slime like Keenan
Bro got the cannon, he'll bang it no reason (baow)
Since '08, it's been get money season (baow-baow)
It's like girl, lets get it (yeah)
Spent mans drip on the jail, tek credit (brr)
Got smoke for the opps but they think that's deaded
Snake show skin around me and get shedded (baow-baow)

I said, "Say my name" (woo, say it) 
First class flight to L.A, as soon as I land, bill a paper plane (uh)
Soon touch back in the ends 
One-ten on the M, tryna' take a chase (skrrt-skrrt)
Big fat stack in my bag, when I un-zip that, finna' make it rain

Cuh, when we run down, it's rain (splash)
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain (bling)
She said, "Wagwan, what's goin' on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain (blaow)
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain (splash)
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain (bling)
She said "Wagwan, what's goin' on?" (huh? what?)
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain (blaow, woo)

Yeah, sick of some rappers and that 
But I stay doin' me, never cap on a track (wah?)
Gelato pack in the bag
Then I throw up a M, got the map on my back (uh)
She make it clap for the Snap, yeah 
The back wasn't bad but there's no way I'm tacklin' that (no)
I'm wit' ya gyal on some yack in a gaff 
Bro tryna stack in the trap (stack in the trap)
Said I'm too young and my game's all talk 
But she got buss down like AJ's chain
Psycho, drama, the bitch like Dave 
Yo, what can I say? Man, the brain's insane (ah-ah)
Ten for the two-toe subby and ten 
For the new blueface when I rate 'em plain (yeah, aight)
Still come through and make it rain 
Turn up, stay lit, burn up, get paid
Two-two peng ones givin' man stress
I delete 'em both, I'm so indecisive (woo)
Next gyal tryna attack man, goin' on crazy but I think I like it (woo)
More time, I lose my head but then I get stressed 'cause it's so hard to find it
Think I got time for a side chick? 
No way, this not ridin' in my whip (skrrt)

I said, "Say my name" (say it)
First class flight to L.A, as soon as I land, bill a paper plane (uh)
Soon touch back in the ends
One-ten on the M, tryna' take a chase (skrrt-skrrt)
Big fat stack in my bag, when I un-zip that, finna make it rain

Cuh, when we run down, it's rain 
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain 
She said, "Wagwan, what's goin' on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain 
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain
She said "Wagwan, what's goin' on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain
