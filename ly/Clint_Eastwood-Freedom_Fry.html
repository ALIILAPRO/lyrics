		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin' 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare

Intangible, bet you didn't think so
I command you to, panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes

Picture you getting down and I'll picture too
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional, mystical, maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy

Lifeless to those a definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one talkin' psychic
Among those possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics without it you make it
Allow me to make this child like in nature
Rhythm you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every sprouting tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes

I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fucking enterprise now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russell not his muscles
But percussion he provides

For me I say God, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor

Bust a few rhymes motherfuckers
Remember what the thought is
I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on
