		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh I'm looking on the same old star
I'll be there for you - but you're so far
Please come back to me - I can't love a memory
You're the nearest thing to heaven girl
Baby just for you, I'll fly around the world
Oh everything I'll do, I do it just for you

My sexy, sexy lover, oh tell me there's no other
There's no other, oh deep in your heart
My sexy, sexy lover, I want to be your cover
There's no other, who's breaking apart
Oh my sexy little lover, swear there is no other
I'll feel alone, when I'm coming home
Oh my sexy little lover, tell me there's no other
When I'm down, need you all around

I'm not a man who wants to be alone
I can't love you at the telephone
Oh baby you and I, we're flying one mile high
Oh nobody knows how I feel tonight
I would die for you, if you're by my side
More than you will know, oh babe my love will grow
