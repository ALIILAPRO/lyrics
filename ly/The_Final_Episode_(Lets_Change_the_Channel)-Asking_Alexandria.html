		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my god
Oh my god
If only he knew
If only he knew
If only he knew about the world
Without the bullshit and the lies

We could've saved him
They could've saved me
But instead I'm here drowning in my own fucking mind
And I'll be damned if you're the death of me

Blood and ink stain the walls
Silently with bloodied knuckles, carry on
Hoping it's not too wrong
You said the nights were far too long
Honey, it's just the start of it

Oh my god
If he only knew
Oh my god
If only he knew if only he knew
If only he knew
Just stand up and scream the tainted clock is counting down
You gave in to me would you say the nights are far too long now?

Oh my god (oh my fucking god)
The tears that stain my cheek must me look weak
I wear them proudly, I wear them proud

Just stand up and scream the tainted clock is counting down
You gave in to me would you say the nights are far too long now?

Your knife my back
My gun your head

Your knife my back
My gun your head

You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby you scared?

You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby you scared, you scared
You scared, you?

You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby
You need a doctor baby you scared?
