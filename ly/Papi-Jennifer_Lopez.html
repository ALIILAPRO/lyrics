		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let all the heat pour down
I'm good as long as he's around
He let's me wear the crown
I do my best to make him proud

Now all my super ladies
I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air air air
Whoa oh oh oh
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi, move

My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He'll make sure that I glow
I'll make sure everybody knows
Now all my super ladies
I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air air air
Whoa oh oh oh
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air air air
Whoa oh oh oh

Step up, step up
Let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock
It go all out
If If he rocks
Tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi

Llégale, llégale
Suéltate el pelo
Levantate, cai, asegúralo
Ve por todas
Si el es lo maximo
Asota baldosa
Baila para tu papi

Now all my super ladies
I got my baby, if you got your baby, baby

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body,
Dance for your papi

Put your hands up in the air, dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air,

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body,
Dance for your papi

Put your hands up in the air, dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air,
