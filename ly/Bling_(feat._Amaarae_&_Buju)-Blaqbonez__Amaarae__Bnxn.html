		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They like the boy 'cause he's shining
Too many girls when they sight me
They say, "I love you 'cause you're sexy" (sexy)
Yeah, but me I know that they're lying (lying)

Bling, bling, bling, bling (bling, bling, bling, bling)
Mh, ding, ding, ding, ding (no, they no wan let me go)
Bling, bling, bling, bling (me I no dey shaye go)
Ding, ding, ding, ding (ooh, yeah)

I been dey think say e don do (yeah)
But she say she no, no wan go (yeah)
Every day telling me, "Bonjour" (yeah)
'Cause the money sweet like banku o (yeah)
I been dey think say e don do
But she say she no, no wan go
Every day telling me, "Bonjour"
'Cause the money sweet like banku o

So I put a Ferragamo when I buss it down
So I put a Ferragamo when I buss it down
'Cause her coochie and her booty fit kill a man
That's why she no want to go, she want to stick around
But she still that she loves me 'cause I'm sexy
And I tell her that she lying, now she vexing
She be screaming, I be screaming, we be reckless
But I know that she be liking make up sex and

I see dem shifting the goal post (see dem shifting the goal post)
They no fit play me, they don't know (no fit play me, they don't know)
'Cause a man come from the ghetto ('cause a man come from the ghetto)
But na the street wey dey convo (but na the street wey dey convo)
Yeah, I see dem shifting the goal post (leave me)
They no fit play me, they don't know (leave me)
'Cause a man come from the ghetto (from the ghetto)
But na the street wey dey convo (ohh)

Bling, bling, bling, bling (bling, bling, bling, bling)
Mh, ding, ding, ding, ding (no, they no wan let me go)
Bling, bling, bling, bling (me I no dey shaye go)
Ding, ding, ding, ding (ooh, yeah)

I been dey think say e don do (yeah)
But she say she no, no wan go (yeah)
Every day telling me, "Bonjour" (yeah)
'Cause the money sweet like banku o (yeah)
I been dey think say e don do
But she say she no, no wan go
Every day telling me, "Bonjour"
'Cause the money sweet like banku o

If you wanna talk to me, be like say na me wey I don do
If I go crazy, you go dey crazy dey follow me o
But no dey do me shekpe, shekpe, sheke, prr, skrrt
But no dey play me football, no dey just dey throw me
Although you dey lie me but you never dey vex me
Boy, when you sex me, love the way you sex me, oh no, no
Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling
Baby, watch me do my thing

Any time she dey for holiday-day

To the music wey dey play on

Bling, bling, bling, bling (bling, bling, bling, bling)
Mh, ding, ding, ding, ding (no, they no wan let me go)
