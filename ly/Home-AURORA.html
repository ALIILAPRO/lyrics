		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in the moment again
Stuck where the road has no end
Keeping the thought in our minds
One day life will be kind

We are not alive
We are surviving every time
We are not alive
Only dreams inside our minds

We are home
We are home
Home
We are home
We are home
Home

Endless days of complaint
Forcing the light to our veins
Keeping the hope in our minds
One day life will be kind

We are not alive
We are surviving every time

We are home
We are home
Home
We are home
We are home
Home

Wrapped inside a cocoon made of flesh and bones
Doesn't really matter where you come from

We are home
We are home
Home

Calm again, calm, calm, calm again
I feel warm again
I'm reborn again
I am warm inside, for a little while
I'm fine?

We are not alive
We are surviving every time

Wrapped inside a cocoon made of flesh and bones
Doesn't really matter where you come from
We are home
We are home
Home

Wrapped inside a cocoon made of flesh and bones
Doesn't really matter where you come from
We are home
We are home
Home
