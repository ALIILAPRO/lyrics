		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and finally found
The somebody who could make me be true
Could make me be blue or even be glad
Just to be sad just thinking of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
Baby, it had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
