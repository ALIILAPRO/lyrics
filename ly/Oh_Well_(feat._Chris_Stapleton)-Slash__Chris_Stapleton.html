		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't help about the shape I'm in
I can't sing, I ain't pretty, and my legs are thin
Don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to

Oh well

Now when I talked to God I knew he'd understand
He said, "Stick by me, and I'll be your guiding hand
Don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to"

Oh well

Now when I talked to God I knew he'd understand
He said, "Stick by me, and I'll be your guiding hand
Don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to"
