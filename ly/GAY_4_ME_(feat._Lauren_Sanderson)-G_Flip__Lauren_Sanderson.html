		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's lemon lime bitter with me
Her temp is at forty degrees
I told her but she didn't believe
That I kept my hands clean
I ain't bloody scum

And now that I've left out the gate
She's telling me our sex was so great
And I know that she masturbates
To the memories we made
And thinks of me cause she knows, oh

I don't wanna play all these silly games
She don't wanna, she don't wanna stay
Then she go and say, oh
Let's mess around (let's mess around)
Then she go down
Oh oh

She said she's only gay for me
And I don't know what to believe
Yeah, she said she's only gay for me
Gay for me
Oh oh

She said she's only gay for me
And I don't know what to believe
Yeah she said she's only gay for me
Gay for me

She's coming up kissing on me (woo)
I know your momma wouldn't agree
You said I make you feel so complete
But you're in between
From what you are and what you've known

And now that I've left out the gate
She's telling me our sex was so great
And I know that she masturbates
To the memories we made
And thinks of me cause she knows, oh

I don't wanna play all these silly games
She don't wanna, she don't wanna stay
Then she go and say, oh
Let's mess around (let's mess around)
Then she go down
Oh oh

She said she's only gay for me
And I don't know what to believe
Yeah she said she's only gay for me
Gay for me
Oh oh

She said she's only gay for me
And I don't know what to believe
Yeah she said she's only gay for me

She said she's only gay for me

I don't wanna play all these silly games
She don't wanna-I don't wanna play all these silly games
I don't wanna play all these silly games

Yeah, she said she's only gay for me (I don't wanna play all these silly games)

I don't wanna play all these silly-
Oh oh
