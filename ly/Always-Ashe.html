		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if staying with me 
Isn't the best way to keep you happy?
And if letting you go
Is the best way to show that I love you, I will

I'll be broken when you're gone
But won't hold you if it's wrong

I don't care what people say
You know I won't force you to stay
Don't want you to go but I'll be okay
And I'll love you always

And I don't know if you'll ever come back
But I won't ever ask, 'cause that's selfish?
Yeah, and I've come to terms I might never feel, whole again

I'll be broken when you're gone
But someday we'll both be moving on

I don't care what people say
You know I won't force you to stay
Don't want you to go but I'll be okay
And I'll love you

One last time, for the very last time
We'll forget that it's over tonight
One last time
If you leave, I'll find my way
Just say you won't forget me, babe
I'll be right here, not far away

I don't care what people say
You know I won't force you to stay
Don't want you to go but I'll be okay
And I'll love you always
