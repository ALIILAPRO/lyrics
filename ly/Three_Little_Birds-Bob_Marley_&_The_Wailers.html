		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Singing' don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Rise up this mornin'
Smiled with the risin' sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying, (this is my message to you)

Singing don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Singing don't worry (don't worry) about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Rise up this mornin'
Smiled with the risin' sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying, this is my message to you

Singing don't worry about a thing, worry about a thing, oh
Every little thing gonna be alright, don't worry
Singin' don't worry about a thing, I won't worry
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Singing don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright, I won't worry
Singing, don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Singing don't worry (worry) about a thing, oh no
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
