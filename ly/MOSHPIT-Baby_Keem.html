		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I got a sense for a moshpit
Likes on the gram make a bitch think she poppin'
Ay, and I keep a cock for a thick bitch
Beat around the bush, I keep a mop for a misfit

Ay, doin' soul searchin' with the demons
Murder in July, my mama made me mind my business
I don't fuck with my ex on Instagram
Cancelled out my life, it's efficient for attention
Bitch my grandma loves me, so a nigga straight
I don't need a loud bag, Baby Keem stay patient, uh
Always looking out for the fake
Add a stranger to my list, of familiar faces (faces)
Gang, gang, gang, I live a lifestyle (yeah yeah)
Your bitch wanna fuck me, want the dick cause I'm famous (yeah, uh)
Baby Keem got you niggas shook
Ten trap phones cause the feds takin' notice
Bitch I had a long night, where you at ho
Lettin' her in my life and she got me losin' focus

Yay, think I got a sense for a moshpit
Likes on the gram make a bitch think she poppin' (yeah)
Ay, and I keep a cock for a thick bitch
Beat around the bush, I keep a mop for a misfit

Hello?
Bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
Stupid bitch

Stupid bitch, top when I'm hot it's a tandem
Fake niggas drop, let they hoes call me handsome
And I don't fuck with a snake, he's an actor
Started getting paid, now my jersey's in the rafters
Take cover when I take off on you
Pimp shit ain't losin', they get my payoff on you, uh
That's how I floss
Three nigga round me when I shop
Pull up, I got one night off
I'ma hit it then your blocked, eh

I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro

Look, I know I'm wrong
We're both wrong
Just call me back Keem
