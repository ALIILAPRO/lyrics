		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm falling down
Will you pick me up again?
When I'm too far gone
Dead in the eyes of my friends

Will you take me out of here?
When I'm staring down the barrel
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I can not see your face
Take me out of here 
Take me out of here 
Take me out of here 
Take me out of here 

All I believe and all I've known
Are being taken from me back at home
Yeah do your worst, when worlds collide
Let their fear collapse, bring no surprise

Take me out of here

Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me

Just stay where you are
Let your fear subside
Just stay where you are
If there's nothing to hide

Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
Feed the fire
Break your vision
Throw your fists up
Come on with me
