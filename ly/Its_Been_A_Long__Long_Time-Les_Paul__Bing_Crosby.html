		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time

You'll never know how many dreams
I dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you

So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time

You'll never know how many dreams
I dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you

So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Long, long time
