		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo we turning this one out for me my homeboys They Homeboys and
Homegirls and anybody that think they got em and anybody whos lost
anything you are just as much as a life behind 1

As a child you see the world as being a
Playground going round kids in
the hood Everything is all good
It's understood on that big-wheeler
But when you making it they can't feel you
Rolling dice and then to one point they trying to kill you
Fear no man but God is still watching what they
Doing is hard I swear
this life thing is getting so
Confusing
Keep you in your mind and maintain that's the kind that remains
The longest on the planet dummies get swept up off the ground
Believe half of what you see and none of what you here
Look around one by one your Homeboys dissapear its clear
That the snakes stay among us but who's in the best position to run up
Your player Hatin friends that watched you come up
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Bad enough you had to hurt him
On top of that you called the case
Stupid look on your face mad at yourself
Cause your peers shouldnt of been in the streets in the first place
Ohhhhhhh....

[Chorus] Who's real who's fake you'll never know
God help distinguish friend or foe (friend or foe)

Mamma always warned me of busters
She Said they get you killed and have you wearin orange colors
Moms put it on my mind over and over again
Boy you be stuck like Chuck everytime for
Putting your faith in men
I got's to check myself
I'm seeing what they doing to me
Starting to get shady myself messing
round in this community
Can't even trust your broad you made your
Factor in this drama
I learned that first hand by my babies momma
That's why I'm going never take em serious
Got a heartache and a pocket
And for being curious got me Furious
Ghetto ways is hard to let go
Comin out that ghetto
ones thats clappin
They the same ones thats pullin you back and
You'll never know
People are so unpredictable
It's best to get what you can get and go
Pack up then solo
Plenty in the picture claiming to be all in with you if in you
But if you all aint with me come and get me

Never say what someone wont do
Only if you will always stay true
Jealousy is always among you
Play it cool don't be a fool (Who's who) [x2]

Turn to the music industry as a way out
Spend to much time in jail for the enemy
But now I'm trying to stay out in the ??
To win it but now I'm tripping
On how these so called
Thugs and G's is lettin these people pimp them
Now who would have thought that it would be the same
In the rap game like my old game
My crowd , it is the only thats changed
It's a shame how this world can't be trusted
No matter the occupation or location
So called friends will have you busted and disguisted
In the meantime play it cool don't be no fool
Until you can rely and ??
Tired of being sick and tired of feeling Mutual
But I gots to go because I'm late for a funeral
[chorus until fades]
