		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a fallen angel feathers in the air
Outstanding greatness
But whispers in despair like a lonely eagle
Soaring through the sky
Don't let them fool you
Pull you through the ground

I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
Give me a life sign
Give me the warmth of your hand
I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
If it doesn't even matter
What is the meaning of it then?

Like a lonely ranger
Running through the night another stranger
You gamble or you fight
Through dust and ocean faults in our stars
Silent echoes shadows in their hearts
I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
Give me a life sign
Give me the warmth of your hand
I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
If it doesn't even matter
What is the meaning of it then?
What is the meaning of it then?

I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
Give me a life sign
Give me the warmth of your hand
I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
Give me a life sign
Give me the warmth of your hand

I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
Give me a life sign
Give me the warmth of your hand
I throw you a lifeline
I throw you a lifeline, my friend
If it doesn't even matter
What is the meaning of it then?
