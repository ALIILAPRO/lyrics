		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need the air in these lungs
Don't need the rain or the sun
I just need your arms and permission to fall
For I need you most of all

I don't need these eyes, they're too blind to see
Don't need more time or love songs to sing
I just need your arms and permission to fall
For I need you most of all

Most of all
On these lonely nights, how I need you
Most of all
In shadows on walls, how I see you
It's only in dreams that I meet you (ah)
Don't wanna wake, but I need to (ah)
Still, I need you most of all

It's only in dreams that I meet you (ah)
Don't wanna wake, but I need to (ah)
Still, I need you most of all

I don't need the stars for wishes to speak
Don't need the world or what heaven could bring me
I just need your arms and permission to fall
For I need you most of all

For I need you most of all
