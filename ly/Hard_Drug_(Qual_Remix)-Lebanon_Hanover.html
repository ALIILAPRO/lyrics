		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Opening maps to see how far away we are
It's mental the distance that separates us
Space out with a coffee in your peculiar
Living room with a gathering charme
No women gather but you
Have a cigarette or two
You know it blows me away like a hard drug

Chain smoking heavy drinking is all I can do
So hard to find a person in life like you
It's everyday life we are used to it
But today it kills me that you're not in it
It is really a mess to
See how grey things are
Collecting pictures and objects that unite us
Take me out to the most subvеrsive club
Of your giant sparkling city
I am gathering too
Scrolling through bootmarkets with you
It's cold turkеy from a very hard drug

Chain smoking heavy drinking is all I can do
So hard to find a person in life like you
It's everyday life we are used to it
But it crucifies me that you're not in it
