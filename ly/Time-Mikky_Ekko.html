		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, the streets are empty where we used to run
And the cars are all on fire
Yeah, we fall like leaves in the garden of Eden, Eden

Now remember how it felt being in the sun
When I heard the ancient choir
And the dead of night like an angel singing, singing

Time doesn't love you anymore
But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
Honey, we can run forever, if forever's what's in store
Oh, time to take me home

On a tree in the garden I carved your name,
An word is spelled desire
Like an ocean deep with the waters even, even

And your love pours down like a waterfall
And I can't escape the tide
Here's my hand, baby take it or leave it, leave it

Time doesn't love you anymore
But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
Honey, we can run forever, if forever's what's in store
Oh, time to take me home-ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Now we're too young to recognize
Nothing stays the same
Promise I won't be the one to blame

'Cause time doesn't love you anymore
But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
Honey, we can run forever, if forever's what's in store
Oh, time doesn't love you like I love you
So take me home-ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Let me hear you say, let me hear you say
