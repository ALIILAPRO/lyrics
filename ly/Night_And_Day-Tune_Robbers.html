		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night and day
You are the one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you day and night

Night and day
Why is it so?
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearnin' burnin' inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life makin' love to you
Day and night, night and day

Night and day
You are the one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you day and night

Night and day
Why is it so?
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
Silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend life makin' love to you
Day and night, night and day
