		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain 
Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain

Call me raider, call me wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me, time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
Of the man, none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
Or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge, that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back, the simple fact is
That I'm all that, and I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me
Now you know who's raw
As if you didn't know before
I know what I want, and I want it now
I want you, and then I want a little more

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain

Mr. Wrong
Mr. Wrong
Mr. Raider

Girls all over the world
They hope and pray, and die for men like me
'Cause I'm the one, begotten son
That breaks the mold, get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you wanna grab and hold and squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite?
Please, oh baby, please
You beg, you want, you say you got to get some
Caught up in the charm that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish to pick the worm on the hook of my line
Yeah, I keep many
Females longing for a chance to win my heart
With S-E-X and plenty

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain

I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
