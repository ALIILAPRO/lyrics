		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There you go (pop a Party pack)
Still runnin' (runnin') from all of (all your) your problems (problems)
Shawty turned to the runnin' man (runnin' man)
Soon as she (soon as she) faces (faces) drama (drama)

You ain't gon' keep bringin' up the past (bringin' up the past)
You ain't gon' keep turnin' your back (keep turnin' your back)
I won't keep standin' for it
What be goin' through your mind? (Goin' through your mind)
Stayin' out past five (stayin' out past five)
And you know you gon' get checked for it

Respect's what I need, but don't get
All that I do is resent you, now (whoa, whoa)
Respect ain't so hard to give
But you don't even attempt to figure yourself out (yourself out)
When in doubt, you run
When in doubt, you run, oh (yeah, yeah)
When in doubt, when in doubt, you run

Domino
Look at the domino (domino) effect that (effect that) is happenin' (happenin')
Thinkin' 'bout gettin' even, but I ain't even inspired to get that low (inspired to get that low)
I just wanna know what we're waitin' for, baby

I won't keep bringin' up the past (bringin' up the past)
I won't keep tryna run it back (tryna run it back)
I won't keep standin' for it (lack of respect)
What be goin' through your mind? (Goin' through your mind)
Stayin' out past five (stayin' out past five)
And you know you gon' get checked for it (lack of respect)

Respect's what I need, but don't get
All that I do is resent you now, oh-whoa (lack of respect)
Respect ain't so hard to give
But you don't even attempt to figure yourself out (lack of respect)
When in doubt, you run
I know it, babe, better than anyone
When in doubt, you run, oh (yeah, yeah)
When in doubt, oh
When in doubt (when in doubt)
You run
