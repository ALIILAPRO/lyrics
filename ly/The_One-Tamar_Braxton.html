		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know very well who you are
You're the only one
You've got my heart
And you had a few
Boy one too many
But I'm the only one to wake you up
(It was all a dream)

I reminisce the way we kissed it felt so personal
You took the chance to win my love and now you know
(It was all a dream)
And I don't even know one baby
Without you I'm incomplete
My love is just like the bar
Put it all on me

I don't want nobody else
Baby all need is you
(You"re the one I want)
And I don't want nobody else
Baby all need is you
(You're the one I want)

You know very well you're a star
'Cause I don't go that far
Look where we are
And it ain't none like you one in a million
But I'm the only one to count you
(It was all a dream)

I reminisce the way we kissed it felt so personal
You took the chance to win my love and now you know
(It was all a dream)
And I don't even know one baby
Without you I'm incomplete
My love is just like the bar
Put it all on me

I don't want nobody else
Baby all need is you
(You"re the one I want)
And I don't want nobody else
Baby all need is you
(You're the one I want)

I reminisce the way we kissed it felt so personal
You took the chance to win my love and now you know
And I don't even know one baby
Without you I'm incomplete
My love is just like the bar
Put it all on me

Put it all on me
Put it all on, put it all on
Put it all on me
