		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll miss knowin' what you're thinkin'
And hearin' how your day has been
Do you think you can tell me everything, darling?
But leave out every part about him
Right now you're probably by the ocean
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets further from LA

Maybe it's supposed to be this way

But, oh, my love
I wanna say I miss the green in your eyes
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say I wish that you never left
Oh, but instead I only wish you the best
I wanna say without you, everything's wrong
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say I wish that you never left
Oh, but instead I only wish you the best

Well, I can't help but notice
You seem happier than ever now
And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow

Maybe I only brought you down

But, oh, my love
I wanna say I miss the green in your eyes
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say I wish that you never left
Oh, but instead I only wish you the best
I wanna say without you, everything's wrong
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say I wish that you never left
Oh, but instead I only wish you the best

But, oh, my love
Oh-whoa
Oh, my love
Oh-whoa

Wish I could say it's something I really mean
But I want you happy whether not it's with me
I wanna say I wish that you never left
Oh, but instead I only wish you the best
I wanna say without you, everything's wrong
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say I wish that you never left
Oh, but instead I only wish you the best
