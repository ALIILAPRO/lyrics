		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She likes the way I am, yeah, oh my
She likes the way I am, yeah, yeah
Yeah (she likes the way)

Uh, tired for the bad lil' bitches in the city and it's all on me
Time, no time when the love so blind that you're all I can see
Know the night won't be the same if you don't leave with me
Ass up, head down, every turn your dress down
Know I like

I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it (she likes the way)

Good ass girl in a bad ass city
Got the itty bitty titty but the ass come with it
Got your ho but now the flash come with it
Lookin' single in the club but you hopin' that a man don't get it
And she pullin' up, late night, no tees, play fight
Big jaw, grey white, fuck 'til the daylight
Put her to sleep 'cause I don't need no Xan
And she fuckin' with me then she gon' need both hands, yeah
Big penthouse, spend another ten thou'
Nothin' gettin' rent out, money get sent out
Good brain, good head, get the sense out
Then I make it rain in the bed, pull a tenth out
She likes the way I fuck shit down
And I likes the way, I ain't gotta call her whenever I'm in town
And she know when to pull up
Pull up on the block, throw the hood up
The bucktan, boy, woodgrain with the foot up
Call me when you need somebody to work on that body the way that he should've, yeah
I pull up AM, Scotch color grey Benz, all whole darker than Ray-Bans
And I'm still on that ass like spray tan
I would get it poppin' with you or your eight friends, but, look

I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it

She likes the way I am, yeah, oh my
She likes the way I am, yeah, yeah
