		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the bottom
Just surviving
Reaching for the truth
Such a longing
The distance driving
The nail straight through

Ooh, ooh
Just try to hold steady
The world's getting heavy
Ooh, ooh
When you can't hold the weight
Any longer

Cry for help
Cry like rain
Let it fall down your face
Let the dam break
Cry for help
Ease the pain
When you can't hold the weight
It's okay, yeah
To cry for help

In the still
Of the darkness
The light shines through
Shows the sorrow
And the burden
Inside you

Ooh, ooh
Just try to hold steady
The world's getting heavy
Ooh, ooh
When you can't hold the weight
Any longer

Cry for help
Cry like rain
Let it fall down your face
Let the dam break
Cry for help
Ease the pain
When you can't hold the weight
It's okay, yeah
To cry for help

There's no telling
If these walls could talk
What they'd say
Yeah, they've seen it all
The best in me
And where it all went wrong

At the bottom
Just surviving
Reaching for the truth

Cry for help
Cry like rain
Let it fall down your face
Let the dam break
Cry for help
Ease the pain
When you can't hold the weight
It's okay
Cry for help
Ooh, ooh
Cry like rain
Cry like hell
Ooh, ooh
Cry like rain
