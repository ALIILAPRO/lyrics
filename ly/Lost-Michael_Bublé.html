		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't believe it's over
I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I'd only knew
The days were slippin' past
That the good things never last
That you were cryin', mm

Summer turned to winter
And the snow, it turned to rain
And then the rain turned into tears upon your face
I hardly recognized the girl you are today
And God I hope it's not too late
Mm, it's not too late

'Cause you are not alone
I'm always there with you
And we'll get lost together
'Til the light comes pourin' through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When your world's crashin' down
And you can't bear the thought
I said, babe, you're not lost

Life can show no mercy
It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy, but you're not
And things have seemed to change
There's one thing that's still the same
In my heart you have remained
And we can fly, fly, fly away

'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together
'Til the light comes pourin' through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When the world's crashin' down
And you cannot bear the cross
I said, baby, you're not lost

Mm, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I said, baby, you're not lost
I said, baby, you're not lost
Ooh, yeah-yeah
I said, baby, you're not lost
