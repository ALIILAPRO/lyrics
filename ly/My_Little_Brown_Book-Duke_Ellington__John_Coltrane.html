		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""My little brown book With the silver binding How it keeps reminding me Of a memory That's haunting me. In some quiet nook I go thru its pages And peruse this ageless tale Of a love that failed To ever become true. On this page is the date Of that fateful night at eight When I found you were no longer in love. After that there's nothing more Just a dark and futile door That shuts out the stars above. In my little book I inscribed your heart vow But since we're apart now This and that last sweet kiss Is all that's left of you Is all that's left of you.""
