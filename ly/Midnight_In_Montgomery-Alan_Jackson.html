		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Midnight in Montgomery
Silver eagle, lonely Road
Was on my way to Mobile
For a big New Year's Eve show
And stopped for just a minute
To see a friend outside of town
With my collar up, I found his name
And felt the wind die down
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat
Took me by surprise
Wearin' shiny boots, a nudie suit, and haunted, haunted eyes
He said, "Friend, it's good to see you
It's nice to know you care"
Then the wind picked up, he was gone
Was he ever really there?

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right
You'll hear his song
Smell whisky in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singin' there

Well, I climbed back on that eagle
Took one last look around
Red tail lights, shadow moves slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passin' by
I can hear that wistle moan'
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right
You'll hear his song
Smell whisky in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singin' there
He's always singin' there

Well, Hank's always singin' there
