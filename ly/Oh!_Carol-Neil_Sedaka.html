		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you

If I could take my pick of all the girls I've ever known
I would come and pick you out to be my very own

There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you

A heart that's true and longs for you is all I have to give
All my love belongs to you as long as I may live

There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you

I never will forget the way you kiss me
When we're not together, I wonder if you've missed me

'Cause I hope and pray the day will come when you belong to me
Then I'm gonna prove to you how true my love can be

There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you
