		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At night I pace the floors
Tile by tile, step by step
'Til I reach a wall
No use in forging on
I try wholeheartedly
But still end up on your lawn
'Cause I'm still waiting on my invitation

I shouldn't have ever gone in the truck
The whole ride writing in your condensation
I shouldn't have ever been calling it love

At night I take the calls from telemarketers
In hopes of hearing your drawl
I let them blather on
Without a thought I surrender my credit card
'Cause I'm still combing through missed connections

I shouldn't have ever followed you up
I'm out here, swimming in the wrong direction
I shouldn't have ever been calling it love
(I'm still grieving)

Am I still giving off the wrong impression?
I shouldn't have ever dialed you up
And I'm still lifting all your old expressions
I shouldn't have ever been calling it love

I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
