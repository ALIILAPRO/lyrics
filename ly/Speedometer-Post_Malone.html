		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just bought a new Lamborghini
That SOB goes two-twenty-five
You called my phone, said you wanted to see me
I couldn't think of a better reason to drive

Led pedal
For your lovin' I would run all the lights
Won't let go
And I can't wait to push my speedometer

Push my, push my, push my, push
Speedometer
Push my, push my, push my, push
Speedometer

Turn the lights off
And put the record on
That you showed me that makes you so horny
Let's make a baby tonight

Led pedal
For your lovin' I would run all the lights
Damn, uh-oh
Yes, I know how fast I was goin', please, officer

Push my, push my, push my, push
Speedometer
Push my, push my, push my, push
Speedometer

My speedometer
Speedometer
My speedometer
Push my, push my, push my
Push my, push my, push my, push
