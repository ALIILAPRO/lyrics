		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe one day I'll fall in a bookstore
Into the arms of a guy
We'll sneak into bars and gaze at the stars
Surrounded by fireflies

Oh, I'd like to sleep in till two on a Sunday
And listen to the bluebirds sigh
Get soaked in the rain and smile through the pain
Slow dance under stormy skies

Maybe I'm just old fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck, no one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love

Oh, maybe I'm just old fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck, no one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love
