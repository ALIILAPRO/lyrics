		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
I wanna spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
It don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

Let's get together, baby
