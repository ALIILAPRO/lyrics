		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what I think
I think that you are dope
Like really dope
They may disagree
but I think
you're something special
They might disagree
but I think
you're something new
Don't you let them
bother you with their futile
frail opinions
I think you're really
one of a kind
You're one of a kind
I think you're really good at
doing what you do
beautiful as the sky even
if you feel blue
A fly soul you got it
I think I feel grounded
cause you're so solid
And nobody
nobody can take your shine away
I got a bone to pick
Cause many want a counterfeit
Cause many want another hit
of beauty in a tighter fit
escape inside the visual
The money and the physical
stuck inside the visible
it's lookin' like a ritual
If you only felt
what I feel about you
Then maybe you wouldn't need
what they say you do
And I see you fightin'
tooth and nail
I hope it all goes well
And I hope that you feel it now
That you're worth
much more than you think
They may disagree but I think
you're something special
They might disagree but I think
you're something new
Don't you let them bother you
with their futile
frail opinions
I think you're really
one of a kind
You're one of a kind
Aw yea just one of a kind
And you can't say nothin' else
You're the star in your movie
And I don't take it lightly
You gotta give yourself more
credit for all that you've done
For all the little battles
you've won
So sit back relax
you've earned it
No need for stress
cause you're worth it
I'll take care of the rest
And I wanna say well done
well done
And I hope that you feel it now
That you're worth
much more than you think
They may disagree but I think
you're something special
They might disagree but I think
you're something new
Don't you let them bother you
with their futile
frail opinions
I think you're really
one of a kind
You're one of a kind
Aw yea just one of a kind
You're one of a kind
I'll give you the time
The best part is that you are mine
You're mine you're mine
you're mine yes you are mine
You're one of a kind
yes you are
There is nobody
like you in the world
So special
So beautiful
So wonderful
So precious
So lovely
So worthy
One of a kind you are
one of a kind
