		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once I fall in love then I'll be happy
But then you fall in love and there's still a hole
Once I get some money it'll all be easy
But then you get that money, you still feel broke

Once I get a little older, I won't worry
Then you get older and it don't feel like it should
I'm thinking once I learn to grow right where I'm planted
Maybe that's when life starts getting good

Once I get a car that don't stall in the morning
I can make it anywhere I want, just wait
But I can see it right now sitting in my driveway
Afraid if I take it out, I'll chip the paint

Once I get a house that I can hang my hat on
I bet I'll want to build a bigger one if I could, yeah
I'm thinking, once I learn to grow right where I'm planted
Maybe that's when life starts getting good

Oh, getting good
Getting good
Life starts getting good
I'm thinking maybe that's when life starts getting good

That's when life starts getting good, oh
Oh yeah

I'm afraid of both my parents dying
I call my dad, he answers right away
And I didn't hear a word 'cause I was thinking
About what hasn't happened yet but will someday

And we hang up the phone before I know it
I'm crying over the conversation my fear took
I'm thinking once I learn to soak up every moment
I'll realize my life's already good

Already good
Already good
Life's already good
I'll realize my life's already good
Thank God that my life's already good
