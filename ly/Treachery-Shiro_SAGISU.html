		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell that you've never been true to me
I can smell that you're acting so fearfully
I can hear what you're hoping I want to hear
I can feel the alarm bells are ringing in me
I can touch but I know you don't feel a thing
I can pray but I know you commit a sin
I can sense now it's all become clear to see
You're no good and you mean no good, treacherously

I can tell that you've never been true to me
I can smell that you're acting so fearfully
I can hear what you're hoping I want to hear
I can feel the alarm bells are ringing in me
I can touch but I know you don't feel a thing
I can pray but I know you commit a sin
I can sense now it's all become clear to see
You're no good and you mean no good, treacherously

I can tell that you've never been true to me
I can smell that you're acting so fearfully
I can hear what you're hoping I want to hear
I can feel the alarm bells are ringing in me
I can touch but I know you don't feel a thing
I can pray but I know you commit a sin
I can sense now it's all become clear to see
You're no good and you mean no good, treacherously
