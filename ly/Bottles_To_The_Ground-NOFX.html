		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know it when it's over
Door are closing feel the sober staring at you
You know you better take one more good look

One more round then it's bottles to the ground
Smashing of the glass what a super sonic sound
You gotta pull the plug when it's time to die
Whoa whoa whoa, bottles to the ground

There's a suitcase on the side walk
There's some records in a milk crate
She'll be staying
You'll be throwing whiskey over one lip

One more round then it's bottles to the ground
Smashing of the glass a perfect imperfect sound
You gotta pay the piper when the rats are gone
Whoa whoa whoa, bottles to the ground

One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 

One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground 
One more round then it's bottles to the ground
