		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel so high
You've been switching up and telling me lies
I've been waiting for you to change (la-la-la-la-la)
Fight or flight
But I'll stay with you tonight
There's a lot of things I can't explain (la, la, la, la)

Baby call me one more time
Moving fast, left me behind
There's a lot of things that I could say

I could take us anywhere (take us anywhere)
Trail your face into my head
There's a lot of things I can't forget
I could take my memories (take my memories)
And paint your picture in my dreams
There's a lot of things that I regret (la, la, la, la)

Ooh
Ooh

I could take us anywhere (take us anywhere)
Trail your face into my head
There's a lot of things I can't forget
I could take my memories (take my memories)
And paint your picture in my dreams
There's a lot of things that I regret (la, la, la, la)

Ooh
Ooh
