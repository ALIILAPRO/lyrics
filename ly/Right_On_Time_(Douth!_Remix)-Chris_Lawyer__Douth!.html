		  First beat is right on time
Right on top like they say

Time [4x]
Top like they say
Time [3x]
That first beat is right on time
Time [3x]
Top like they say
Time [3x]
That.. [?x]
Time [4x]

Top like they say
Time [3x]
That first beat is right on time
Time [3x]
Top like they say
Time [3x]

That first beat is right- they say

That.. [?x]

That first beat is right on time


That.. [?x]

That first beat is right on time
Right on top like they say
That.. [?x]
[2x]

That first beat is right on time
Time [3x]
Top like they say
Time [3x]
That first beat is right on time
Time [3x]
Top like they say
Time [3x]
That.. [?x]
Time [4x]
Top like they say
Time [3x]
That first beat is right on..

That..
