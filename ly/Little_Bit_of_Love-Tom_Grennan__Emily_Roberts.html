		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love

Lately I've been counting stars
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart
It's something that I didn't want for you
But I'm stepping on broken glass
And I know this is my final chance
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you

I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathing
These awful wounds ain't healing
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love
A little bit of love

Lately I've been wakin' up
In that dream you stay calling your name
Stayed up too late just thinking of you
Now I'm knocking on every door
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two
Has it been that long?
I guess time just flew

I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 
'Cause I've needed a little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathing
These awful wounds ain't healing
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love
A little bit of love

I tried to fly but I used my wings too soon
Now everything got me thinking of you
I tried a million times to cut you loose

I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 
'Cause I've needed a little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathing
These awful wounds ain't healing
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love
A little bit of love
