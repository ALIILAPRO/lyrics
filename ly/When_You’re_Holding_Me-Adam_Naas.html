		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so hard to say goodbye when you're leaving me
I tried to say goodbye but you're holding me
The silence in the night you left in me
I can feel it on my mind when you're holding me
It's so hard to say goodbye when you're leaving me
I tried to say goodbye but you're holding me
La suite des paroles ci-dessous
The silence in the night you left in me
I can feel it in my mind when you're holding me
Now show me, show me how much you hate
How much you don't need me
For how many days you hated sleeping next to me
Seven years are the paining on you
And i'm so stupid why you put this hook
Drink your beer and let's see why you need me to do
I'm telling you, i'm telling you
Even louder than the worse I believe to be true
I'm trying, crying, dying because of you
Show me, show me how much you hate
How much you don't need me
For how many days you hated sleeping next to me
Oh oh oh oooooh
Ooooh oh oh
Ooooh oh oh
Ooooh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
