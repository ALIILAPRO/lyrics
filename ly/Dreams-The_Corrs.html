		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now here we go again 
You say you want your freedom 
Well who I am to keep you down 
It's only right that you should 
Play the way you feel it 
But listen carefully to the sound 
Of your loneliness 
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad 
In the stillness of remembering what you had 
And what you lost 
And what you had 
And what you lost 

[Chorus] 

Thunder only happens when it's raining 
Players only love you when they're playing 
Say women they will come and they will go 
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know 

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions 
I keep my visions to myself 
It's only me 
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and 
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell? 
Dreams of loneliness 
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad 
In the stillness of remembering what you had 
And what you lost 
What you had 
And what you lost 

[Chorus] 

Thunder only happens when it's raining 
Players only love you when they're playing 
Say women they will come and they will go 
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
