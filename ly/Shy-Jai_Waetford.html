		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time you walk into the room
Got me feeling crazy, shock my heart, boom, boom
Any other boy would stare 
But me I look away 'cause you're making me scared

Trying not to breathe one, two, three
Trying not to freak when you look at me
Gotta make a move but I freeze
You don't have a clue what you do to me

Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
I feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy
Ohh

Rejection is a word that I don't wanna know
But a girl like you could kill a boy real slow
A million words stuck up in my head
Waiting to be said but my tongue is stumbling

Trying not to breathe one, two, three (whoa)
Trying not to freak when you look at me (whoa)
Gotta make a move but I freeze
You don't have a clue what you do to me

Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
I feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me

Girl, you take me high
I feel like I can fly
But I fall out of the sky
When I look into your eyes
Oh
Ohh

Oh, girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
I feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me

Girl, you make me shy
Ohh
Girl, you make me shy
Can't even talk to you
Girl, you make me shy
