		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so violent
Can we stop fighting?
For once, I'm tired
I know, you're tired
I'm still waiting, for you, baby
I don't understand
I don't have a plan
I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand
I'm still, I'm still
Waiting, waiting 
For you, for you
Baby, baby
I don't, I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand, baby
You're so violent
Can we stop fighting?
For once, I'm tired
I know you're tired

I'm still waiting for you, baby
I thought you were getting me, I give up
I know sometimes it gets hard
I said sometimes, it's slayer
Got cash, got K, got the molly
Just took your bitch, and she doesn't even know why

I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand, baby
I'm still waiting, waiting 
For you, for you
Baby, baby
I don't, I don't understand
I don't, I don't understand, baby

You're so violent
Can we stop fighting?
For once, I'm tired
I know you're tired
