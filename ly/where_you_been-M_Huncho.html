		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Quincy tell 'em)

Yeah, woo, yeah

And they wonder where I've been
Tryna rectify my sins, I got plenty of em'
I can get the shooters down here without saying nun'
Anytime they open cases get a case closed
Fly these birds by myself avoiding plain clothes
Don't tell me shit, I'm the baker I just make dough
Snub nose in the side of the Lamborghini doors (ooh, yeah)

They talkin' drills probably fire drills
I'm talking killers they get sentenced they don't get appeals (free)
Anticipated my own journey, I'm still on the rise
Still hold the Glock from time to time just to get a feel
I don't want to shout no rappers 'cause they weird
I dare them to put money on my head, I'll wait
No refunds or exchanges in this shit, okay
29 thousand for a brick, today
8 bags for the Cali this ain't mini shit
Worked hard for this money they didn't give me shit
Excuse me if I'm antisocial, I don't really rate you pricks
I just put a house on my wrist
Quarter-mill' to my mom, but she wants more time with her son
'Cause she sees the badness in my eyes, ganja in my lungs
She's praying that God gives some guidance to her son
I'm still thuggin' with a mop, I'm like the fucking don
Sold O's on the block

Never been shy
Racks in my pocket don't do pocket knives
Wagon with no tints, that's just how I live my life
Let them see the face with no mask so they can realize
I've been doing this from time, I don't really compromise
I made music, sold packs, had a debt all at the same time
Don't disrespect, this ain't the same grind
I got to work, I didn't sit around, I don't waste time
Turn the bando to a studio, now it's a gold mine

And they wonder where I've been
Tryna rectify my sins, I got plenty of em'
I can get the shooters down here without saying nun'
Anytime they open cases get a case closed
Fly these birds by myself avoiding plain clothes
Don't tell me shit, I'm the baker I just make dough
Snub nose in the side of the Lamborghini doors (ooh, yeah)
