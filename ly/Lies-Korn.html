		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd like to search inside 
For the things that you will hide
What's the problem? Can't you seem to
Search through these problems that haunt and taunt you?

I smile
While you're afraid
You run
While your soul pays

Do you ever see outside your fears?
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fear?
Do you ever see outside your fears?
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fear?

I'd like to search inside 
For the things that you will hide
What's the problem? Can't you seem to
Open your body, let me touch you

Do you ever see outside your fears?
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fear?
Do you ever see outside your fears?
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your fear

I'd love you to see the life you have disguised
The world of things that hurt you, kept all these useless lies
I want you to fear, fill you on up inside
Once I took you in, I'll throw you out next time

I tried
You win
My life
Is ripping your heart out and destroying my pain (go)

Do you ever see outside your fears?
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fear?
Do you ever see outside your fears? (I'm fine)
Thinking about your life (I'm fine)
Thinking about your inner fear? (I'm fine)

Do you ever see outside your fears?
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fear?
Do you ever see outside your fears?
Thinking about your life
