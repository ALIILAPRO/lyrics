		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this
And you know whose thing this is, better say it then
You know you came for this
And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this
And you know I'm top five, champion level, I'm major list
You know you came for this

And you know I brought so much pleasure, pain came with it
Bit you know I'm made for this
And you know being this way is what made me rich
Can't make things switch now
If I can make it hit, I can take a hit, yeah

But you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this
And you know whose thing this is, better say it then
You know you came for this

You see me on Shade Room, famous, it's dangerous
You know how crazy fake it get, I know how crazy my baby get
But you didn't train for this, broke down and prayed for this
I'm having my way with this, in a big Jeep wagon, to the bank with this
And you didn't, yeah, train for this
You hopped on a plane for this
You whip lanes and lane for this
'Cause you know I'm top five, champion level, all day with this
You can't stay away from this

And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this
And you know whose thing this is, better say it then
You know you came for this, you know you can't resist
And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this, you know, you know
And you know I'm top five, champion level, I'm major list
And you know you can't forget, you know you can't forget

Now I know what you think
I know when you drink, you more aggressive with your expression
Let me know what you need
I think I know a recipe to make you think there's an extra me, yeah

If you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You on fire, I ignite it
I advise it, yeah, but you invited
I know you like it, it's like I'm psychic
I know you not my side bitch, no, you my sidekick, oh, oh
I know you Robin, I know, I know, I know you Robin
The way it fit, like God designed it
The way I stick and move, stick and move, Mike Tyson, oh

You didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this, you know, you know
And you know I'm top five, champion level, I'm major list
You know you came for this
