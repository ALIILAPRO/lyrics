		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh huh, it's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you girl
Aye

Hey, baby even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
I want you 
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to
I want you 

Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you 

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you 
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you 
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you 

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (ooh, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (ooh, woah)
I got one less, one less problem

It's Iggy Iggz, uh
What you got?
Smart money bettin', I'll be better off without you
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know
But I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo
So don't be dumb
I got ninety-nine problems
But you won't be one
Like what!

(Mhm, yeah) one less, one less problem
(Mhm, yeah) one less, one less problem

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders (one less, one less problem)
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya (babe)
I got one less problem without ya (no, babe)
I got one less, one less problem (ooh)
One less problem without ya (ooh, baby)
I got one less problem without ya (yeah I got)
I got one less problem without ya (oh)
I got one less, one less problem (oh)
One less problem without ya (uh, hey)
I got one less problem without ya (without you)
I got one less problem without ya (I got one less, one less yeah)
I got one less, one less problem (problem, yeah)
