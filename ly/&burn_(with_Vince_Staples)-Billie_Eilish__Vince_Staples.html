		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once (that's better)
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, all I see is him right now
Him right now

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
(Thanks)

Your love feels so fake
My demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow them out
Blow them out

I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

7-4-2008
I still remember that
Heaven sent a present my way
I won't forget your laugh
Packing everything when you leave
You know you coming back
Wanna see me down on my knees
But that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down
But that's stubborn baby, leading a war
We droned down on each other
Tryin' to even the score
We all been found guilty in the court of a order

And I'll watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

Watch your car, watch your car burn
I won't forget your laugh (go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn)
You know you coming back, you know you coming back
(Watch your car, watch your car burn)
Tryin' to even the score (go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn)
Found guilty in the court of a order
