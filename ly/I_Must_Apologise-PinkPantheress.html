		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never wanted to cast doubt in your mind
I'm not acting the way I think you'd like
We went for dinner and now you're acting paranoid
If only you knew the way I felt inside on that night

Your paranoia, it happens all the time
And that's 'cause lying's a big problem of mine (just a problem for me)
But I still do it and now I'm by myself again
I tell so many that I can't see them end, so I said

If I could, I would make amends
Today I wrote a list of them
The way it starts, the way it ends
I signed my name in marker pen (yeah)

I must apologize
Before I end the night

It's not a game I want to change
These days it doesn't feel the same
The way it did some years before
I've lost so much, I'll lose some more

I'm not able
To tell you what you need, it's a shame 'cause
They say I should be honest more, one day, I'm sure
I'll figure out the reason I was telling lies for

(I must apologize)
(Before I end the night)
