		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A lonely room and empty chair 
Another day so hard to bear 
The things around me that I see remind me of 
The past and how it all used to be 

From souvenirs to more souvenirs I live 
With days gone by when our hearts had all to give 
From souvenirs to more souvenirs I live 
With dreams you left behind 
I'll keep on turning in my mind 

There'll never be another you 
No one will share the worlds we knew 
And now that loneliness has come to take your place 
I close my eyes and see your face

From souvenirs to more souvenirs I live 
With days gone by when our hearts had all to give 
From souvenirs to more souvenirs I live 
With dreams you left behind 
I'll keep on turning in my mind

From souvenirs to more souvenirs I live 
With days gone by when our hearts had all to give 
From souvenirs to more souvenirs I live 
With dreams you left behind 
I'll keep on turning in my mind
