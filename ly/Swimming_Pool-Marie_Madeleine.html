		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drunk, I'm walking with you
Next to the swimming pool
Cold concrete burns my feet
In the early night heat
Five o'clock, you and me
Glass fall crushed on the floor
My cold feet red bleeding
I don't care, keep singing

Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Falling, feeling, swimming, swinging
Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Falling, feeling, swimming, swinging
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Singing, sinking, dying, diving in the cold heat of the pool
Falling, feeling, swinging, swimming
Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Falling, feeling, swinging, swimming
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Falling, feeling, swinging, swimming in the cold heat of the pool

You (you) teased me, I (I) want more
I (I) would restart (start)from here
I (I) feel like I'm (I'm) a whore
What (what) am I doing (ing), my dear?
I'm lost and I don't know
Where I am, what I do
You're just a little girl
I'm just lost in your world

Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Falling, feeling, swinging, swimming
Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Falling, feeling, swinging, swimming
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Falling, feeling, swinging, swimming
Singing, sinking, dying, diving
Falling, feeling, swinging, swimming
Loving, leaving, pulling, pushing
Singing sinking dying diving
Loving leaving pulling pushing
Falling feeling swinging swimming in the cold heat of the pool

In the cold heat of the pool
In the cold heat of the pool
