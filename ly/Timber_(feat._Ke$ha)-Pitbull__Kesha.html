		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's goin' down, I'm yellin' timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget

Ooh-ooh (timber), ooh-ooh (timber)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (it's goin' down)
Ooh-ooh (timber), ooh-ooh (timber)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (it's goin' down, woo)

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs (timber)
Face down, booty up (timber)
That's the way we like to what (timber)
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will (timber)

Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down

It's goin' down, I'm yellin' timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
It's goin' down (it's goin' down), I'm yellin' timber
You better move (you better move), you better dance (you better dance)
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget (you won't forget)

Whoa-oh-oh (timber), whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (timber)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (it's goin' down)
Whoa-oh-oh (timber), whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (timber)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (it's goin' down, woo)

Look up in the sky, it's a bird? It's a plane?
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumpin' like LeBron, now Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, why?
'Cause it's about to go down

Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's goin' down (oh-oh-oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's goin' down

It's goin' down, I'm yellin' timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
It's goin' down (it's goin' down), I'm yellin' timber
You better move, you better dance (you better dance)
Let's make a night (let's make a night) you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget (you won't forget)

Whoa-oh-oh (timber), whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (hey, timber)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (it's goin' down, Pitbull)
Whoa-oh-oh (timber, oh), whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (timber)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (it's goin' down, woo)
Whoa-oh-oh (timber), whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (timber, come on)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (it's goin' down)
Whoa-oh-oh (timber), whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (you won't forget)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (timber)
