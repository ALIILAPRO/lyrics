		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come and waste my mind, dear
Come and waste your life here
Come and waste my mind, dear
Can't believe you're mine still

Attached to the wall, your chain and your ball
That animalistic, those violent thoughts in your head
I want 'em all
So take your fear and waste with me
Don't go put nothin' on
There's nothing to defy
When it's just you and I
You be my suicide
Come make me feel alive

Come and waste my mind, dear
Come and waste your life here
Come and waste my mind, dear
Can't believe you're mine still

Keep track of it all
Replay every fault
My words are fake, are you proud of me?
'Cause I choke before I talk
So plan your theft
there's nothing left
And if the feeling strong and if the feeling right
When it's just you and I
You be my suicide
Come make me feel alive

Come and waste my mind, dear
Come and waste your life here
Come and waste my mind, dear
Can't believe you're mine still
