		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow me, I can't let go
It's a cold wind that blows
Slow me, I've got to go
I've become so hollow

I was waiting for answers
I was waiting for signs
Covered in danger
Are we dead or alive?
It's all ricochets
In moments of chance
Ocean inside
It's the rhythm of a dance

Slow me, I can't let go
It's a cold wind that blows
Slow me, I've got to go
I've become so hollow

Everyone's right
And everyone's wrong
Nobody knows how long we've been gone
See, wars have no endings
And the kids are so cruel
And people burn people
Just like people love to do

Slow me, I can't let go
It's a cold wind that blows
Slow me, yes, I can see
The more I get, the more I need
Slow me, I've got to go
I've become so hollow

We run, we run, we run another day
In America (I know, I know, I know, I know)
We run, we run, we run another day
In America (I know, I know, I know, I know)

I love to fly, watch me fly over you
I love to die, watch me die over you
I love to fly, watch me fly over you
I love to die, watch me die over you

Slow me, I can't let go
It's a cold wind that blows
Slow me, yes, I can see
The more I get, the more I need
Slow me, I've got to go
I've become so hollow
Hollow, hollow (yeah)

We run, we run, we run another day
In America (I know, I know, I know, I know)
We run, we run, we run another day
In America (I know, I know, I know, I know)
