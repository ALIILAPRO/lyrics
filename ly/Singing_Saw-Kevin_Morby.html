		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up the hill past the houses
I sang a song then I came
Back down the mountain
All the while, big moon above me
Old coyote, laughing at me he went

Up the hill past the houses
I sang a song then I came
Back down the mountain
All the while, big moon above me
Old coyote, laughing at me he went

Thought I saw a singing saw
Cutting down a willow
Thought I saw a singing saw
Cut down a song tree
Thought I saw a singing saw
Cutting down a willow
Then I saw the singing saw
Come singing after me

Got a song book in my head
Up the hill and I went rid of it
Got a song book in my head
Past the houses so I could put it down
I got a song book in my head
Up the hill so I could get rid of it
Got a song book in my head
Past the houses so I could put it down

Thought I saw a singing saw
Cutting down a willow
Thought I saw a singing saw
Cut down a weeping tree
Thought I saw a singing saw
Cutting down a willow
Then I saw the singing saw
Come singing after me

And eat me and eat me
And eat me
