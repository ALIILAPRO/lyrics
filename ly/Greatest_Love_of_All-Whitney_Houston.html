		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I'll live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all

I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I'll live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all

And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love
