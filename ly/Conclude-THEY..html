		  Ayy
Damn
That's crazy
(Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We've been together so long, girl (Oh yeah)
It's like we grew up together (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
And I don't know what changed
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
These days I just don't feel the same (Oh yeah)
Feel like we should talk less

I think we both got too much pride
To say we knew this shit the whole time
Still healing from the old lies
But I can't imagine seeing it from your side
Heard your nigga wylin' on the west side

Call it how you see it
Looks can be deceiving
Look at how you treated
Too deep in her feelings

What do we do?
Girl, there's something I need
That I just can't get from you
What do we do?
What do we do?
Girl, we fucked it all up
And there's nothing left to prove
What do we do?
I guess we conclude, yeah

Still got a lotta pieces that we gotta pick up
But there ain't no going back girl, the damage is done
I don't know what to say
Don't know what to feel
'Cause I don't really know if its real
Tried to keep it cool
Played me like a fool
After all that we been through

What do we do?
Girl, there's something I need
That I just can't get from you
What do we do?
(I guess we conclude)
What do we do?
Girl, we fucked it all up
And there's nothing left to prove
What do we do?
I guess we conclude (yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah (guess we conclude)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
