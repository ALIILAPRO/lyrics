Me's a freaky gyal
Feeling like Omarion in like 2003
Freaky gyal
In the rain video, nigga, got my shirt off (yeah)

Ned's Declassified, bitch, I'm fried (yeah, yeah)
In the club with a damn survival guide (water)
Toxic, said I'm like the cyanide (yeah)
An alien in a pod, no tide (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Burnin' up, vampire, UV light (um)
Made 50k, like a feather, this shit light (shit light)
My dog in jail, Ben Franklin, send a kite
Goulash, she eatin' good tonight (yeah, yeah)
In the Gulag, nigga, we can fight (we can fight)
Take your tool off, nigga, can you fight? (Can you fight?)
Ice on Pluto, my future looking bright (bright)
The last line a metaphor, read it back (man)

You need neuter, nigga, I'm a tutor (tutor)
Pull up on 'em with the cheese, got the Gouda (Gouda)
Don't invite me anywhere, I'm a looter (yeah, yeah)

On my Spanish shit, bitch, I need sombrera (so-sombrera)
In the strip club, Rihanna, need umbrella (an umbrella)
'Cause I make it rain, bitch, check the weather (make it rain)
In my bag like a chapstick, fella (wa-water)
And I'm with my dogs like my name Cruella (wa-)
Back in the day, been had guts, cigarillo (cigarillo)
I know she blow pipes, seen her play the Cello
Bitch, I'm a legend, chilling with a Mike Dean at a Bootsy Bellow (huh?)
What can I tell you? 
I like Starbucks sipping on bean, vanilla (what you say?)
Go together? No, but we can Iggy, Carti tether (haha)
Not a Mayweather, but I'll send a nigga to the nether (man)

You need neuter, nigga, I'm a tutor (tutor)
Pull up on 'em with the cheese got the Gouda (Gouda)
Don't invite me anywhere, I'm a looter (yeah, yeah)
I'm the boogey man
