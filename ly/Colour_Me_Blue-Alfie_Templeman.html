		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was just wondering if you're alright
You look so lonely in the street light
You could be, you could be, somebody else with me if you want
I could be, I could be anywhere else with you

We were just dancing 'round to last night
Said, "Is this it?" And I said, "Damn right"
You could be, you could be somebody else with me if you want
I could be, I could be anywhere else with you

Doo, doo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Doo, doo, ooh-ooh-ooh

Do you want me to come around?
Pick you up when you're feeling down
I could be, I could be someone with you
Color me, color me, color me blue
Do you want me to come around?
Pick you up when you're feeling down
I could be, I could be someone with you
Color me, color me, color me blue

I was just thinking 'bout the good times
We used to spend out in the sunshine
You could be, you could be doing it now with me if you like
I could be, I could be doing it wrong but you could make it right

We were out late to watch the sunset
Something nostalgia doesn't forget
You could be, you could be somebody else with me if you want
I could be, I could be anywhere else with you

Doo, doo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Doo, doo, ooh-ooh-ooh

Do you want me to come around?
Pick you up when you're feeling down
I could be, I could be someone with you
Color me, color me, color me blue
Do you want me to come around?
Pick you up when you're feeling down
I could be, I could be someone with you
Color me, color me, color me blue

Do you want me to come around? (want me to)
Pick you up when you're feeling down
I could be, I could be someone with you
Color me, color me, color me blue (color me blue)
Do you want me to come around?
Pick you up when you're feeling down
I could be, I could be someone with you
Color me, color me, color me blue
