		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look so good
All of you
I'll take you to the bathroom and get creative
I can't lose
All my senses are heightened when I see you move
Yeah
All my senses on my top floor, surfaced
Baby, you get everything you wanted, purchased
I'll spend all my money on you 'cause you're worth it
Tell me girl what you want
Take you shopping, Yves Saint-Laurent
Ohh Na-naa
No one can have this
None of your girls got it like that
You have such an advantage
Ohh and they know that
Yeah
Came out naked right of the bathroom
Baby, I just want to see you give me top
Top-top suck it off like a vacuum, yea
One time for the girl that just love me so much she got me on her tattoo, yeah
Lick her like Absolut
Baby girl, it's your advantage, I'm in love with the truth
All my senses on my top floor, surfaced
Baby, you get everything you wanted, purchased
I'll spend all my money on you 'cause you're worth it
Tell me girl what you want
Take you shopping, Yves Saint-Laurent
Ohh Na-naa
No one can have this
None of your girls got it like that
You have such an advantage
Ohh and they know that
All my senses on my top floor, surfaced
Baby, you get everything you wanted, purchased
I'll spend all my money on you 'cause you're worth it
Tell me girl what you want
Take you shopping, Yves Saint-Laurent
Ohh Na-naa
No one can have this
None of your girls got it like that
You have such an advantage
Ohh and they know that
