		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

I got woodgrain on my Damier Buckle (uh)
Cool quarter mill' in my Goyard duffle (yeah)
I won again so you still gotta shuffle
Born with the drip and just learned how to hustle (hus')
Look at your bitch through these Dior bifocals (look)
I get me some head, she bend that shit over (yeah)
They say lately I been lookin' like dollars (yeah)
Pinstripe high waters, I dress like a golfer (drip)
We ride in foreigns, ain't no more Impalas (foreigns)
They ain't have the new born but I got baby bottles (ah)
Shoppin' at Barney, I drip like a model (yeah)
Watch how I drip when I hit that Met Gala (yeah)
Codeine I sip with my lip, don't get splattered (sip)
Doctor told me I got lean in my bladder (mm)
Run through this cash like family don't matter (cash)
I got your back, feel the same pain together (yeah)
Pop off the tag of my Palm Angels sweater (yeah)
Baby blue Jag made my mom feel better (yeah)
Fucked a snow bunny at my show at Coachella (yeah)
VVs damn they pointers in my bezel (yeah)
We move too fast, it get slimy as ever (slime)
Life is too grimy, I watch for the devil (grime)
It's a Rolls Royce, and it comes with umbrellas (ooh)
2018 and that Porsche is Carrera (hey)

Goyard pouch (hey)
Racks in the quarter ounce (hey)
Two accounts (hey)
Large amounts (ooh)
Shop around (hey)
Designer down (ooh)
Drip or drown (hey)
Drip or drown, yeah (ooh)

Killin' these hoes, need to call paramedics (kill)
New Fendi runners, I feel athletic (yeah)
Run that shit up, bought my partner a Patek (hey)
Blowin' this cash, it was times we ain't have it (yeah)
Got twenty-one bitches, I must be a savage (yup)
Cook in the kitchen, the dope smell like acid (yup)
Pourin' this Hi-Tech, I'm sippin', relaxin' (yeah)
Vibes in LA, Gunna fuckin' the baddest (vibes)
FN ain't plastic, put him in a casket (uh)
I wiped his nose quickly, pass him a napkin (slime)
Got an addiction, in love with this fashion (yeah)
Prayin' for all of my bros like we Catholic (pray)
Lifetime of hats 'cause you always be cappin' (hey)
Niggas ain't eatin', stop cappin', you ain't fastin' (cap)
Can't get no sleep 'cause my life is all action (yeah)
See how shit happened, I made it in rappin' (yeah)

Goyard pouch (hey)
Racks in the quarter ounce (hey)
Two accounts (hey)
Large amounts (ooh, yeah)
Shop around (hey)
Designer down (ooh)
Drip or drown (hey)
Drip or drown, yeah (ooh)
