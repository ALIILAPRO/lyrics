		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah no what's wrong with me, I got no vision see
I was the target of a notion of submission see
Oh yeah they needed me, Yeah I was the target see
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me
Need no
Need no alibi
Honestly
I tell no lies
Wanted to stick an office worker inside of me
But I kept breaking free they could not capture me
I pulled maneuvers that were closer to savage see
Bad bad
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me
Bad bad
Come again I tell no lies
So now you understand I was a wanted man
The opposition and the bug of a shiny hand
But ah no this I see there's nothing wrong with me
There's no deadbeat regime rider inside of me
Need no
Need no alibi
Honestly
I tell no lies
Tried to stick and office worker inside of me
Need no
Need no alibi
Honestly
I tell no lies
Wanted nothing stuck in me
Bad bad
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me
Bad bad
Wanted nothing stuck in me
