		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friend, old friend, it's 4 AM
What are we doing in the street?
I don't want to buy fried chicken
I wish that I was going to sleep
And I don't want to kiss you
Underneath that flashing sign
What's the hurry? We're not ready
We've got plenty of time

Maybe you will get married
Maybe fall in love
Could you make me fall asleep
When you're holding me?
Try set me on fire
Try set me on fire
Try set me on

There's someone else but I twist all of
His words and he twists mine
So I'll have to let him go
We sometimes fit, but we always lie
And he thinks we could make it work
But only when he's drunk
You think you could help me swim
But I've already sunk

So maybe you'll get married
Maybe fall in love
Could you go on and fall asleep
When you're not holding me
Go get set on fire
Go get set on fire
Go get set on

Friend, I am a slow, slow mover
Friend, I am a slow, slow girl
Trying to be kind, kind, kinder
Crawling in another world

And maybe one day we'll get married
Maybe fall in love
Could you make me fall asleep
When you're holding me?
Try set me on fire
Try set me on fire
Try set me on fire
Try set me on fire
Try set me on fire
Try set me on fire
Try set me on
