		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For so long, I was out in the cold
And I thought myself to believe every story I told
It was fun hanging on to the moon
Heading into the sun
But it's been to long
Now I wanna come home

I came so close to the edge of defeat
But I made my way in the shade
Keepin' out of the heat
It was fun shooting out of the stars
Looking into the sun
But it's been to long
Now I wanna come home

Home
Where there's nothing but sweet surrender
To the memories from afar
Home
To the place where the truth lies waiting
We remember who we are

For too long,I was out on my own
Everyday I spent trying to prove I can make it alone
It was fun hanging on to the moon
Heading into the sun
But it's been to long
Now I wanna come home

Home
To the place where the truth lies waiting
We remember who we are
For so long, I was out in the cold
But I thought myself to believe every story I told
It was fun hanging on to the moon
Heading into the sun
But it's been to long
I wanna come home
But it's been to long
I wanna come home
But it's been to long
I wanna come home
