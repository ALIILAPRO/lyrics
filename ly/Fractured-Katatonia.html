		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Knew I would fall if I tried
So I held back for a while
You pushed me so hard, I had to go
I tried to be strong, then I failed 

I would like to say this
Just in case you didn't know

Well your soul is fractured
I know what it's like as well
I have sold my soul
I traded it for hollow gold
