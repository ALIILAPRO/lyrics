		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's wrong?
You've been askin' but I don't have an answer
How come?
I'm still thinkin' let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old, will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that shit
And stallin' only goes so far when you've got a head start

'Cause we could stay at home or watch the sunset
But I can't help from askin', "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feelin' lonely, you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?

Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by your side
If you could tell me how you're feelin'
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
Holdin' on for so long

'Cause we could stay at home or watch the sunset
But I can't help from askin', "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feelin' lonely, you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie? (Yeah, oh)
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?

(Oh)
(Oh)
