		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that one day I'll be that one
Thing that makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
It's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day

Birds outside will sing me a song tonight
I know that it's right on time, time
Twee-da-da-da
Life flies by the moon and the midnight sky
Is guiding me to your side, side

I know that one day I'll be that one
Thing that makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
It's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day

Can we run away to a place
That children play in the grassy fields
Twee-da-da-da
I know they're tellin' you things that you put in your head, head
Promise that you are better off without them

I know that one day I'll be that one
Thing that makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
It's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day

One day I'll be that one (one, one, one)
Thing that makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day (one, one, one)
The feel of a perfect way
If it's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day

Ooh
One day
Ooh
One day
