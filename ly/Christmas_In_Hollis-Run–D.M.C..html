		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was December 24th on Hollis Ave in the dark
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer

But then I was illin' 'cause the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, twelve 'o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn

I picket the wallet up then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease

But I'd never steal from Santa, 'cause that ain't right
I was going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, 'cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and all the dough was for me

It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees

Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog

The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols (Christmas carols)

Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin', the orchid's out
And that's what Christmas is all about

The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
