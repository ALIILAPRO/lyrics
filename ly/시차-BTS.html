		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah (oh, yeah)

Twenty-four 누구보다 더 빨리 어른이 된 것만 같아
My life has been a movie all the time
해 뜨는 곳으로 달렸어 every single night
누구의 내일에 가봤던 것도 같아

온 세상이 너무 컸던 그 소년
Keep on runnin' errday, mic 잡아들어
Friends ridin' subway, I'll be in the airplane mode
전 세계를 rock on, I made my own Lotto
But 너무 빠른 건지 놓쳐버린 흔적이
Don't know what to do with
Am I livin' this right?
왜 나만 다른 시공간 속인 걸까?

Oh, I can't call ya (oh)
I can't hol' ya (I can't)
Oh, I can't
And yes, you know, yes, you know
Oh, I can't call ya (I can't)
I can't touch ya (I can't)
Oh, I can't
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time? 

(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) yeah
(Finna find my time) 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)(oh, yeah)
Finna find my time yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Someday finna find my time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) (oh, oh)

Oh, I think I was in yesterday
'Cause everybody walk too fast
나도 모르게 커버린 어린 나
(길을 잃어버린 어린아이처럼)
This got me oh just trippin'
서성대는 이 느낌
Don't know what to do with
Am I livin' this right?
왜 나만 다른 시공간 속인 걸까?

Oh, I can't call ya (yeah)
I can't hol' ya (I can't)
Oh, I can't
And yes, you know, yes, you know
Oh, I can't call ya (I can't)
I can't touch ya (I can't)
Oh, I can't
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time? 

(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) yeah
(Finna find my time) 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)(oh, yeah)
Finna find my time yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Someday finna find my time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) oh, yeah

때론 나의 숨 막힐 때면
모자 눌러쓰고 계속 달려
Yeah, I don't gotta know where I go
Even if it's opposite of sun
One time for the present (one time)
Two time for the past (two time)
Happy that we met each other
Now til' the very end (ah-ah-ah)

Oh, I will call ya
I will hol' ya
Oh, I will
And yes, you know, oh, yes, you know
Oh, I will call ya
I will touch ya
Oh, I will
And you know
Can I someday finna find my time? 

(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) yeah
Can I someday finna find my time? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)(oh-whoa)
(Finna find my time) my time (yeah)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, yeah, someday finna find my time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) oh-oh

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, hah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-hah
Ah-ah-ah
