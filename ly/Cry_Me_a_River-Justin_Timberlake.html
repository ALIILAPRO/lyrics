		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
For you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river (yeah, yeah)

You know that they say that some things are better left unsaid
And it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it (yeah)

You don't have to say (don't have to say)
What you did (what you did)
I already know (I already know)
I found out from him (uh)
Now there's just no chance (no chance)
For you and me (you and me)
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone (all alone)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (when you call me on the phone)
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy (I'm not like them baby)
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn (it's your turn) to cry

So cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (yeah, yeah)

Oh (oh!)
The damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh (oh!)
The damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh (oh!)
The damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh (oh!)
The damage is done, so I guess I be, leaving

You don't have to say (you don't have to say)
What you did (what you did)
I already know (I already know)
I found out from him (uh)
Now there's just no chance (no chance)
For you and me (you and me)
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (you can go on and just)
Cry me a river (yeah, yeah)

Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (come on baby, cry)
Cry me a river (I don't wanna cry no more, yeah yeah)

Cry me a river
Cry me a river, oh
Cry me a river, oh
Cry me a river, oh

Cry me a river (cry me, cry me) oh
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me) oh
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me) oh
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me) oh
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me) oh
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me) oh
Cry me a river (cry me, cry me)
