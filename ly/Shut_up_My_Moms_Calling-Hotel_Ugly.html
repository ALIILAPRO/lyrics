		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna rewind
I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feelin' so lonely
Even when you come through
I can tell that it isn't you
So baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you, but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were layin' in the same sheets
But lately, you've been actin' like you hardly know me

Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home

I just wanna rewind
I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feelin' so lonely
Even when you come through
I can tell that it isn't you
So baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you, but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were layin' in the same sheets
But lately, you've been actin' like you hardly know me

I've only recently began to fall
I feel the need to go and waste it all
I tried to numb away the pain
I hope someone is watchin' me, watchin' me, watchin' me

Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
