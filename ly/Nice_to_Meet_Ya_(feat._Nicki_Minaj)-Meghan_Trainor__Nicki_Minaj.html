		<p>
		  (Nice to meet ya, ooh) mmh
(Nice to meet ya, ooh)
(Nice to meet ya) Meghan Trainor
(Nice to meet ya) let's go

I used my makeup to hide (hide)
Tellin' you
There ain't nothin' I haven't tried (tried)
Changed my hair 
But I couldn't change up my mind (my mind, mind, mind)

You know I been tryna work it (yeah, yeah)
You know ain't nobody perfect (yeah, yeah)

Go ahead, go talk about me (me)
You don't know 
The half of the shit that I've seen (seen)
Go ahead and tell them 
Whatever you heard (whatchu you heard)

I look different on the surface (yeah, yeah)
You know ain't nobody perfect (yeah, yeah)

I am blessed by the Heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough
Just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you, but

I am blessed by the Heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough
Just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you
But I'm just what I wanna be

(Nice to meet ya, hey)
(Nice to meet ya)
(Nice to meet ya)
(Nice to meet ya)

I used to care way too much (much)
Filtered myself
I thought I wasn't enough (enough)
Now I'm givin' myself 
Nothing but love (but love, love, love)

'Cause I know that I am worth it (yeah, yeah)
I know ain't nobody perfect (yeah, yeah)

I am blessed by the Heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough
Just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you, but

I am blessed by the Heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough
Just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you
But I'm just what I wanna be

(Nice to meet ya, hey)
(Nice to meet ya)
(Nice to meet ya)
(Nice to meet ya)

Brrrt
Who you gon' call when you ain't got the? Uh
Me and Meghan run up in the spot like, uh
I pop off 'cause I am the reignin' champ
Please, no comparisons, 'cause you know they can't
Had to cut the grass, there were snakes in the camp
They know I'm the billy, I be laughin'
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
One minute I'm nice, the next a monster (brrrt)
My guesthouse alone cost like three tickets
And that Rolls truck and that paint job real wicked
Used to dumb, dumb myself down for these chickens
Now when dem, dem talk, I smile it be crickets

Boom, I turn every head when I walk in the room
Pretty in real life, hit my pics with the zoom
A ten when they rate her like tomb
Elevated to the penthouse
We ain't stoppin' anytime soon (I'm)

Blessed by the Heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough
Just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you
But I'm just what I wanna be

(Nice to meet ya) oh, oh, oh
(Nice to meet ya) ohh
(Nice to meet ya) ohh
(Nice to meet ya)
