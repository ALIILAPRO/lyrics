		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
I start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel a funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
I start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel a funk coming over me

Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
I start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel a funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
