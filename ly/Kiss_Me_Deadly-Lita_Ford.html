		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid I got in a fight uh-huh
It ain't no big thing
Late for my job and the traffic was bad
Had to borrow 10 bucks from my old man uh-huh
It ain't no big thing

I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story would be alright uh-huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me oh yeah

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

Had a few beers getting high
Sitting watching the time go by uh-huh
It ain't no big thing
Nothing to eat and no T.V.
Looking in the mirror don't get it for me uh-huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me oh yeah

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

You know I like dancing with you
Dancing with you, come on

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me
Come on pretty baby kiss me
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
