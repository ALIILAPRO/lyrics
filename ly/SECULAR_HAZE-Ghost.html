		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know that the fog is here omnipresent
When the diseases sees no cure
You know that the fog is here omnipresent
When the intents remain obscure
Forevermore

Weave us a mist, fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable wall-less maze
A secular haze

You know that his son is near omnipotent
When she sees eye to eye with spear
You know that his son is near omnipotent
When youth and innocence disappear
Forever lost

Weave us a mist, fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable wall-less maze
A secular haze

He is divinity omniscient
Seeing the world revolve with spite
The surge of humanity oblivious
To the divine whom bringeth light
Let there be night

Weave us a mist, fog weaver
Hide us in shadows, fog weaver

Come, mist eternal
Come, mist eternal
Come, secular haze
