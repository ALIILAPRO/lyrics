		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (All day, all day)

I don't know why, I don't know how
Thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
Seen you look at strangers too many times
The love you want is of a different kind

Remember when we felt the sun?
A love like paradise, how hot it burned
A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
And when you walked, you always turned every head

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day, domino dancing)

Thought that when we fought I was to blame
Now I know you play a different game
I've watched you dance with danger, still wanting more
Add another number to the score

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day, domino dancing)

When you look around you wonder
Do you play to win?
Or are you just a bad loser?

(All day, all day)
(All day, all day)

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
(All day, all day)

I don't know why, I don't know how
Thought I loved you but I'm not sure now
I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark
And now a storm is breaking within my heart

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day, domino dancing)

(All day, all day)
(All day, all day)

(All day, all day)
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) 
(All day, all day)

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day) Domino dancing
(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day, domino dancing)

(All day, all day) Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
