		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh lord don't let me out don't let me be no stranger 
I am no prisoner I know there is no danger 
Oh lord don't let me out don't let me be no stranger 
I am no prisoner I know there is no danger 

Oh when you came into this world 
You were a lonely mixed up girl
You know you gotta go so low 
Don't listen what they told 
You gotta follow your own road
Don't leave her hanging all alone

Oh lord don't let me out don't let me be no stranger 
I am no prisoner I know there is no danger 
Oh lord don't let me out don't let me live in anger 
I am no prisoner I stay for the remainder

There was a time I had so other 
I never knew no place called home 
You know we gotta face the cold 
Tell god nowhere to go 
You know I'm hanging on 'til dawn 
Oh lord my time will surely come 

Oh lord don't let me out don't let me be no stranger 
I am no prisoner I know there is no danger 
Oh lord don't hold me down don't let me live in anger 
I am no prisoner I stay for the remainder
