		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It doesn't hurt me
You wanna feel how it feels?
You wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You wanna hear about the deal I'm making?

You (if I only could be running up that hill)
You and me (if I only could be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby

So much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?

You (if I only could be running up that hill)
You and me (if I only could be running up that hill)
You and me won't be unhappy (if I only could be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh, ooh

Come on baby, come on, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on angel, come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill

If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill

If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
