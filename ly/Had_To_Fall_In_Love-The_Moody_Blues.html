		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What mattered to me was the right to be free
Like I'll be someday
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way

The places I've seen and the roads in between
Make me wonder why
I'm searching for my dreams up in the sky

I heard the call
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall
And I had to fall in love with you

The face that I've known seems so lost and alone
When you're far away
I'm comin' for you baby right away

The places I've seen and the roads in between
Make me wonder why
I'm searching for me dreams up in the sky

I heard the call
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall
And I had to fall in love with you

What mattered to me was the right to be free
Like I'll be someday
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way
