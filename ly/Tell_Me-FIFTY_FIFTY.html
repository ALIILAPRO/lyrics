		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me how you like it with the lights off

Ah-yeah, ah-yeah, ah-yeah, ah-yeah
Tell me, tell me, tell me now
Ah-yeah, ah-yeah, ah-yeah, ah-yeah
Tell me, tell me, tell me now

어떤 이끌림에 우리 서로 
묘하게 끌려온듯 right
이런 낯설은듯 어색함이
I see you trying
Just speak to me honestly say what you like (like)
궁금해 난
You can run away from me tomorrow

한 편의 무비 같은 순간 속에 갇힌 나
평소 관심 없던 일들이
You're not even my type, but I like ya
자꾸 힐끗힐끗 내 맘을 들켜
Tell me everything that you like

Looking at you, liking how you watching me, ah 
눈을 뗄 수 없겠지 you've never seen
늘 쑥스럽던 내 모습도 oh no, oh no
오늘만큼 이 느낌에 빠져볼래

Would you do it like that (yay)
Could you do it like that (yay)
Will you tell me like that (how?)
Tell me like you've never told a lie

Would you do it like that (yay)
Would you do me like that (yay)
Can you tell me like that (how?)
Tell me like you've known me your whole life 

Tell me like you know me
Do whatever does you right, then show me 
We so high 여긴 paradise
이 순간이 real 지금 다른건 잊어 
이끌린 feel 홀린듯이
이미 우린 좀 더 깊이 I don't care, baby
You got a look like you so undecided
Make some mistakes and let go what you hiding (hiding)

한 편의 drawing 같이 펼쳐지는 starry night
더욱 깊어지는 느낌도
You're not even my type, but I like ya
감당할 수 없어도 그게 좋아
Tell me everything that you like

Looking at you, liking how you watching me, ah 
눈을 뗄 수 없겠지 You've never seen
늘 쑥스럽던 내 모습도 oh no, oh no
오늘만큼 이 느낌에 빠져볼래

Would you do it like that (yay)
Could you do it like that (yay)
Will you tell me like that (how?)
Tell me like you've never told a lie

Would you do it like that (yay)
Would you do me like that (yay)
Can you tell me like that (how?)
Tell me like you've known me your whole life 

화려하게 펼쳐진 이 자유로운 내 모습들이
If you want it, if you want it 
Tell me how you like it with the lights off
이런 두근거리는 느낌
더욱 떨려오는 느낌 찾아
Tell me how you like it with the lights off

Lookin' at you likin' how you watching me, ah 
Play me like a movie that you've never seen 
'Cause you're on my mind all of the time, oh no, oh no
Play me like a movie that you've never seen 

Would you do it like that (yay)
Could you do it like that (yay)
Will you tell me like that (how?)
Tell me like you've never told a lie

Would you do it like that (yay)
Would you do me like that (yay)
Can you tell me like that (how?)
Tell me like you've known me your whole life
