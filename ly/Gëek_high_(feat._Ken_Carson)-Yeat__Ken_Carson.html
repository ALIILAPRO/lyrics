		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, real geekers
I just pulled up with the mob, I just pulled up with the team, yeah (yeah, real geekers)
I just pulled up with the mob on me, got a team, yeah (yeah, real geekers)
I hit up Eliantte, I need diamond rings (yeah, real geekers)
I pop a Tesla, it's helping the climate
I just been geeked up like twenty-four-seven, yeah, twenty-four-seven
Your baby gon' pull up on me, she suck dick, it's like heaven, yeah, it's like heaven
I pour in the 7-Eleven double cup, on my drankie, yeah, drankie
First thing I did in the morning when I woke up 
Took a cranky, then I got to the junkie, yeah

It's a geek-out when it get to the weekend
Fuck that, nah, every day I been tweakin'
You better say all that shit if you mean it
I'm on the side of the Benz (skrrt)
Couldn't decide if I'm fuckin' my thottie or fuckin' her friends (yeah)
We on this side, we don't think 'bout winnin' 
All we do is count up these bands (GOONTEX)
I told these lil' broke boys to go fuck off, got they advance in my hands, yeah
I like to wake up and geek up, go straight to the sky 
I don't got no plans, yeah (nah)
Tapped in with the fashion and I pulled up to fashion week
I been out in France, yeah (yeah)
I don't give a fuck what you sayin', give fuck 'bout the critics 
I don't care who impressed, yeah (fuck 'em)
I just pulled up with a YFM hoodie and Issey Miyake the vest, yeah
I gotta call up my main vibe, yeah, she suck dick the best (uh)
I just be geekin' up, so I don't gotta worry, I don't gotta stress (uh), yeah, ah-ah

I just pulled up on your ho, boy, don't tweak
I just pulled up on your gang and they ain't do nothin' to me
He talkin' down on my name but ain't got more money than me
If he talkin' down on my gang, my twizzies gon' pull up and tweek
My twizzies gon' pull up and tweek
If you run, we gon' shoot at your feet
If you run, we gon' shoot-
Put that pussy lil' boy on a tee, turn him to a tattoo
Now it's R.I.P. you, I skrrt off in that coupe
I pulled up with the gnats, I pulled off with your boo
I'm a Rockstar, I rock out, and I do whatever I wanna do
I'm sippin' on drank, I'm sippin' on juice
I popped a G5 to give me a boost
I get high, I don't get tired, I fuck her 'til she loose
Think I need a massage, think I need a masseuse
My bank account sayin' I don't like savin' hoes
I'm gettin' too much money, you know I can't lose

Yeah, real geekers (yeah)
I just pulled up with the mob 
I just pulled up with the team, yeah (yeah, real geekers, I just pulled up with the mob)
I just pulled up with the mob on me, got a team, yeah (yeah, real geekers, mob)
I hit up Eliantte, I need diamond rings (yeah, real geekers, diamonds floss)
I pop a Tesla, it's helpin' the climate
I just been geeked up like twenty-four-seven 
Yeah, twenty-four-seven (geeked up, geeked up, geeked up)
Your baby gon' pull up on me, she suck dick
It's like heaven, yeah, it's like heaven (she sucky, sucky me up)
I pour in the 7-Eleven double cup 
On my drankie, yeah, drankie (I'm pourin' up this lean, uh)
First thing I did in the morning when I woke up 
Took a cranky, then I got to the junkie, yeah

Just pulled up with the mob, I just pulled up with the team
I just pulled up with a freak and she wanna come home and geek
With my twizzy
Yeah
