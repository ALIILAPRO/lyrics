		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train, New York City, it rains
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinkin' about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
I missed that train, New York City, it rains
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow
Tokyo, snows
Go to watch the show, curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

Mind over matter
Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me (Fly to east L.A.)
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
And if the world don't break
And when the seasons change, will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
