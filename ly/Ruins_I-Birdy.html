		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet surrender comes
After the dawn
We knew it was over long before
Don't look over your shoulder as you go
Dreams we made like grains of sand
You built me up to tear me down
Awakening on broken ground
Don't look back for me, can't sant save you now

It's a cold, cold life
We'll never be the same again
I was blind
Now I'm seein' through it
It's a cold, cold life
You'll never see me again
You and I
Will lie in ruins

Wavin' your white flags through the smoke
You tell me you want me, I know you don't
Leave it behind, give up the ghost
Don't look over your shoulder as you go
So how long have you known?
When you were beside me, was I alone?
So how long have you known?
How I see you now, it's cold

It's a cold, cold life
We'll never be the same again
I was blind
Now I'm seein' through it
It's a cold, cold life
You'll never see me again
You and I
Will lie in ruins

Ruins
Ruins
Ruins
We'll never be the same again
Ruins
Ruins
Ruins
We'll never be the same again
Ruins
Ruins
Ruins
We'll never the same again
You and I
Will lie in ruins
