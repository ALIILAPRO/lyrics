		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long time (long time) we shouldn't left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to 
(Step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, freaky, freaky)
It's been a long time (time) we shouldn't left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to 
(Step to, step to, step to, step to, freaky, freaky, freaky, baby girl, uh)

What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give it up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in?
Now would you be yourself or play a role?
Tell all the boys or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off or would you stay? Oh

And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (again, again)

I'm into you, you into me
But I can't let it go, so easily
Not 'til I see, what this could be
Could be eternity, or just a week
You know our chemistry, it's off the chain
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thang, we'll see how it goes, ohh

And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
(Yeah) then dust yourself off, and try again (again)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (hey)
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed, ooh)
You can dust it off and try again (try again)
Dust yourself off and try again (yeah), try again

See you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first day
What about the next day? 
Huh, huh, huh, huh
I said, you don't wanna throw it all away (yeah)
I might be buggin' on the first day
But what about the next day (yeah)? 
Huh (huh), huh, huh (huh), huh (ohh)

And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (again, again)

And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed, yeah)
Then dust yourself off (you can), and try again (again)
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed, ohh)
You can dust it off and try again (again)
Dust yourself off and try again (yeah), try again (again, again)

And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed, no)
Then dust yourself off, and try again (again)
You can dust it off and try again ('gain), try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed, baby)
You can dust it off (yeah) and try again (yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (again, again)

It's been a long time (time) we shouldn't left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to 
(Step to, step to, step to, what? Step to, step to, freaky, freaky)
It's been a long time (time) we shouldn't left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to 
(Step to, step to, step to, what? Uh, Step to, step to, freaky, freaky)
(It's been a long time)

And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again 
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (again, again)

It's been a long time (time) we shouldn't left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to 
(Step to, step to, step to, what? Step to, step to, freaky, freaky, woo)
It's been a long time (time) we shouldn't left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to 
(Step to, step to, step to, what? Step to, step to, freaky, freaky)
We out
One more thing
The new millennium, baby
And we out
You guess who it is
