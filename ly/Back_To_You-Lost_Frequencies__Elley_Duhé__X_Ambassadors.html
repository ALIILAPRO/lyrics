		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard a million tales before I came to you
One after the other said, "Time's the only cure"
When love is forever gone
It disappeared like stars at dawn
And every road that I've been on

It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you

I walked a million miles before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head, sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddest song
But it was nothing until you came along
'Cause every road that I've been on

Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you
It leads me back to you

I sold a million lies before I came to you
Guess none of us could read the lie behind the golden truth
Trust can't be counted on, it's as crooked as the Amazon
'Cause every road that I've been on

It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you

I've been lookin' for a trouble, trouble
I've been lookin' for a trouble, trouble
I've been lookin' for a trouble, trouble
I'm lookin' for you

I walked a million miles before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head, sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddest song
But it was nothing until you came along
'Cause every road that I've been on

Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you

Every road that I've been on
Leads me back to you
