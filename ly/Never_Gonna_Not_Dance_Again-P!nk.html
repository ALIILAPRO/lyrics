		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If someone told me that the world would end tonight
You could take all that I got, for once I wouldn't start a fight
You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun
My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love

But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do
Is throw away my dancin' shoes and
Oh, Lord, don't try me, really, not tonight
I'll lay down and die
I'll scream and I'll cry
We've already wasted enough time

I'm never gonna not dance again
I'm never gonna not dance again
Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records
There go all of my clothes
Never gonna not dance again (oh)

D-D-D-D-D-dance, I'm gonna dance, bruh
D-D-D-D-D-dance, I'm gonna dance

I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance)
I got all good luck and zero fucks, don't care if I belong, no
If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb
We're never getting younger, so I'm gonna have some fun

'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do
Is throw away my dancin' shoes and
Oh, Lord, don't try me, really, not tonight
I'll lay down and die (I'll lay down and die)
I'll scream and I'll cry (I'll scream and I'll cry)
You know that I'm starting a fight

I'm never gonna not dance again
I'm never gonna not dance again
Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records
There go all of my clothes
Never gonna not dance again (yeah)

D-D-D-D-D-dance, I'm gonna dance, bruh
D-D-D-D-D-dance, I'm gonna dance
D-D-D-D-D-dance, I'm gonna dance, yeah
D-D-D-D-D-dance

I'll lay down and die
I'll scream and I'll cry
You know that I'm starting a fight (fight)
I'll lay down and die
I'll scream and I'll cry
We've already wasted enough time
We've already wasted enough time

I'm never gonna not dance again
I'm never gonna not dance again
Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records
There go all of my clothes
Never gonna not dance again (hey, hey)

I'm never gonna not dance again (never gonna not dance again)
Dance again (so let the music play 'til the end)
Dance again (never gonna not dance again)
Dance again (so let the music play 'til the end)
(Dance again)
I'm never gonna not dance again
(Dance again)
(So let the music play 'til the end) let it play
(Dance again) I'm never gonna not dance again
(Dance again) (so let the music play 'til the end) come on, come on
(I'm never gonna not dance again)
(So let the music play 'til the end) yeah, yeah
I'm never gonna not dance again
So let the music play 'til the end

Why'd it stop?
