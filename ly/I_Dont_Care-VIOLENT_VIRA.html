		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  SCREAM
Take it from me boy
You don't wanna know what I did
To combat my conscious
Left unconscious
All my enemies
Take it from me boy
You don't wanna know
Where the blood
On the carpet came from
I forgave them
With the love I gave
And I
Know I'm not
Going anywhere
That's not downstairs
And I
Should tell you
That I'll miss you
But I simply just don't care
I'll miss you
Give me the worst of it all
Cause I'm ready for my downfall
Getting ready for my demise
But I know I'll be okay
From that look in your beautiful
And I
Know I'm not
Going anywhere
That's not downstairs
And I
Should tell you
That I'll miss you
But I simply just don't care
Care
You know I come from the mistakes I've made
The damage that I'll have to pay
I'd do it all again
For only you
And I
Know I'm not
Going anywhere
That's not downstairs
And I
Should tell you
That I'll miss you
But I simply just don't care
I just don't care
I just don't
Care
