		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear voices in my head
They council me, they understand
They talk to me

You got your rules and your religion
All designed to keep you safe
But when rules start getting broken
You start questionin' your faith
I have a voice that is my savior
Hates to love and loves to hate
I have the voice that has the knowledge
And the power to rule your fate

I hear voices crying
I see heroes dying
I taste blood that's drying
I feel tension rising

I hear voices in my head
They council me, they understand
They talk to me
They talk to me
They tell me things that I will do
They show me things I'll do to you
They talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Talk to me!
They talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Talk to me!

All the lawyers are defenseless
All the doctors are diseased
And the preachers all are sinners
And police just take the grease
All you judges, you are guilty
All the bosses, I will fire
All you bankers will have losses
Politicians are all liars

I see darkness falling
I hear voices calling
I feel justice crawling
I see faith has fallen

I hear voices in my head
They council me, they understand
They talk to me
They talk to me
They tell me things that I will do
They show me things I'll do to you
They talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Talk to me!

I hear voices crying
I see heroes dying
I taste blood that's drying
I feel tension rising

I hear voices in my head
They council me, they understand
They talk to me
They talk to me
They tell me things that I will do
They show me things I'll do to you
They talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Talk to me!
They talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Talk to me!
