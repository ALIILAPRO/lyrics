		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  DA got that dope

I been drinkin' i had way too much
And I'm mad that you wrong
 don't give a fuck
Runnin' up your phone, hit me up
II don't like them bitches all I see is us
And my diamonds all litted up
Cash in my lap, pick it up

Yeah, we hit the Goyard store, lit it up
(Lit it up) cartier rings, pick it up (yeah)
Sometimes I don't trust your love
Why you always interrupt? (yeah)
Tossin' hella bags in your whip, hold up
(Hold up)
I just pull up at events, showin' up
(Showin' up)
Five, four, three, two, one, now I'm done
I can't talk when you on Patrón (Patrón)
And you all litted up (Litted up, littled up)
She just won't give it up (Give it up)
I can't trust what you be on
You just only want my love

I been drinkin' i had way too much
And I'm mad that you wrong, don't give a fuck
Runnin' up your phone, hit me up
II don't like them bitches all I see is us
And my diamonds all litted up (Ice)
Cash in my lap, pick it up

And you rockin' Audemaurs, had to ice you up
Ayy fuck the price, it's love, ayy (yeah)
Ride me 'til I nut
You so crazy, drive a nigga nuts (yeah)
Tossin' hella bags in your whip, hold up
(Hold up)
I just pull up at events, showin' up
(Showin' up)
Five, four, three, two, one, now I'm done
I can't talk when you on Patrón (Patrón)
I'm in Mexico faded (Faded) , uh
Said you wanna make a baby
You just talkin' that crazy
Slurrin' and slayin'
Poppin' this painful, sleepin' on Quaaludes
You ain't the same (Uh)
I'm not insane (Uh) , She can't relate (yeah)
My mind on the pace, quarter milli days
Add it up, count it up, throw it in her face

I been drinkin' i had way too much (Ha)
And I'm mad that you wrong, don't give a fuck
Runnin' up your phone, hit me up
II don't like them bitches all I see is us
And my diamonds all litted up (Ice)
Cash in my lap, pick it up

Yeah, we hit the Goyard store, lit it up
(Lit it up) cartier rings, pick it up (yeah)
Sometimes I don't trust your love
Why you always interrupt? (yeah)
Tossin' hella bags in your whip, hold up
(Hold up)
I just pull up at events, showin' up
(Showin' up)
Five, four, three, two, one, now I'm done
I can't talk when you on Patrón (Patrón)
