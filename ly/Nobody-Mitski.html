		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people

Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much, too?
Did its people want too much?

And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright

And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small 
And big and small 
And big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody (nobody)
(Nobody, nobody)

Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no
