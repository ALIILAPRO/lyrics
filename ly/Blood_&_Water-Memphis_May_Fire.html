		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to think that I deserved this
Tried my best but never perfect
I was helpless and you knew it
You like to think you're a martyr but you're just abusive so now
I'm not afraid to admit that there's nothing left
I know you'll try to manipulate me again
But I've come to grips with the fact that
What's dead is dead
What's dead is dead
What's dead is dead

I bet that this is what you wanted
I can't believe you got the best of me again
I thought that you were being honest
And now I wish I would have never let you in
Yeah, I know it's my fault, I love deep then lose it all
I guess I wanted to believe it
But blood's not thicker than water, after all

All the years spent with the vermin
Left me so sick, always searching
I learned that trust is rarely worth it
You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent
You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent
What's dead is dead
What's dead is dead
What's dead is dead

I bet that this is what you wanted
I can't believe you got the best of me again
I thought that you were being honest
And now I wish I would have never let you in
Yeah, I know it's my fault, I love deep then lose it all
I guess I wanted to believe it
But blood's not thicker than water, after all

You fooled me once, twice, never again
This is cut ties, no goodbye, (nail in the coffin)
This is the nail in the coffin
You fool me once, twice (never again)

I bet that this is what you wanted
I can't believe you got the best of me again
I thought that you were being honest
You were never being honest

I bet that this is what you wanted
I can't believe you got the best of me again
I thought that you were being honest
And now I wish I would've never let you in
Yeah, I know it's my fault, I love deep then lose it all
I guess I wanted to believe it
But blood's not thicker than water, after all

Blood's not thicker than water, after all
