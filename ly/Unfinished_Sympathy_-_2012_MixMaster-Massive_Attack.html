		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I've imagined love before
And how it could be with you
Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?

You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more

The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching
Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?

You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more

Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part, hey

I, I, I
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part

Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part

Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part

I don't know where this one came from

I don't know where this one came from
I don't know where this one came from
