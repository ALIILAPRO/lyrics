		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lyin' cheatin' hurtin that's all you seem to do
Messin' around with every guy in town
Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new
Always the same playin' your game
Drive me insane trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it won't be long
You'll look for me but baby I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to you woman

Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do want you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say 'cause I'm goin' away to stay
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talkin' all around
Watch out woman, no longer
Is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me woman
But it's coming back home to you

Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
