		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that it's time
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end
Now that it's real
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend
I want to know, do I stay or do I go
And maybe try another time
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting?

Now that I've tried
Now that I've finally found that this is not the way
Now that I turn
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away
I want to know, do I stay or do I go?
And maybe finally spit the rhyme
And do I really understand the under-netting?

Yes, and the morning has me looking in your eyes
And seeing mine, warning me
To read the signs carefully

Now that it's love
Now that the candle's falling smaller in my mind
Now that it's here
Now that I'm almost not so very far behind
I want to know, do I stay or do I go
And maybe fall another side
And do I really have a song that I can ride on?

Now that I can
Now that it's easy, ever easy all around
Now that I'm near
Now that I'm falling to the sunlights and a song
I want to know, do I stay or do I go
And do I have to do just one
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason?

Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes
And seeing mine, warning me
To read the signs more carefully

Now that I smile
Now that I'm laughing even deeper inside
Now that I see
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied
It's now I know, but do I stay or do I go
And it is finally I decide
That I'll be leaving 
In the fairest of the seasons
