		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's in love with the money and she's married to the game
If theres bottles on the house she'll take off her wedding ring
Got a husband at home but she said she wants to stay
Ima do some damage Ima break her back in, hoe
She'll leave everything behind
To get passionate for one night with me
She addicted to me like she doing lines
And I'll give it to her Ima rock her mind yeah
Poppin bottles in the club with you
I know you really love 1942
Don't tell your nigga bout anything we do
I like bad bitches, bad bitches yeah I like bad bitches
Bad bitches yeah I like bad bitches
Bad bitches yeah I like bad bitches
She'll do whatev, she'll do whatev, she'll do whatever for
For a nigga with some money
Or a little bit of fame
I'm that nigga baby so let's just play this game
Ima show her everything
I can do without putting a wedding ring
All she wanna do is smoke and fuck with me, yeah
Ima fuck her ima love her
I'm tryna be the man of her dreams
Tell me do you love me babe (I love you baby)
I'm like tell me do you love me babe (I love you baby)
I'm like tell me do you love me babe (I love you baby)
Tell me do you love me babe (hello)
If she wanna spend it, ima let her spend it
(I love you baby)
I love bad bitches like her
I love bad bitches like her
She's in love with the money and she's married to the game
If theres bottles on the house she'll take off her wedding ring
Got a husband at home but she said she wants to stay
Ima do some damage Ima break her back in
