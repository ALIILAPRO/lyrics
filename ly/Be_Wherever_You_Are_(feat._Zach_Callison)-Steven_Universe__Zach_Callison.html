		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Isn't this such a beautiful night?
Whoa, we're underneath a thousand shining stars
Isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different?
Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are?

Look at this place, look at your faces
I've never seen you look like this before
Isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different?
Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are?

Look at this place, look at your faces
They're shining like a thousand shining stars
Isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different?
Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are?

Why don't you let yourself just be somewhere different?
Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be whoever you are?
