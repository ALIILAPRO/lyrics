		  Ha, ha, ha
Pump it
Ha, ha, ha
And pump it, pump it
Pump it, pump it
Pump it, pump it, pump it
Turn up your radio
Blast your stereo right
Ha, ha, ha (pump)

Dude wanna hate on us (dude)
Dude need to ease on up (dude)
I know why they hatin' on us (why?)
'Cause the guys so fabulous (what)
I'ma be real on us (come on)
Nobody got nothin' on us (no)
Girls be all on us from london back down to the us-s-s

We rockin' it (contagious)
Monkey business (outrageous)
Just confess, your girl admits that we the shit
F-r-e-s-h, we fresh
D-e-f, that's right, we def (rock)
We definite
B-e-p, we reppin' it, so

Turn me up (turn it up)
Turn me up (turn it up)
Turn me up
Pump it
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it
Come on, baby, just

Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
And say (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Say (oh-oh, oh-oh), yo, yo
Turn up your radio
Blast your stereo right now (ha)
This joint is fizzlin'
It's sizzlin' right

Ha, ha, ha
Turn up the radio
Blast your stereo right
Ha, ha, ha
Pump it
