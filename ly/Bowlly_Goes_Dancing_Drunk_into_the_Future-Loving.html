		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe you could talk freely
Speak to me for once so truly
For once so truly
I could know
Just where you're going
Just where I'm standing
That would really be something

In most ways on most days
I am clearly disappearing
I am clearly disappearing
At the thought of our nearing
An end

This morning I awoke
And read the words
That you wrote
They were different from what you spoke
They were different from what you spoke
And it was there you declared
Our love is unfair

Maybe you could talk freely
Speak to me for once so truly
For once so truly
For once so truly
I could know
Just where you're going
Just where I'm standing
