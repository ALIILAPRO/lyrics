		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh God, not this again)

'Cause I've been up for four nights
Living like a low life
I don't even know who I am anymore
Driving through the red lights
Couldn't read ya stop signs
Yelling at my face and your slamming the door

We blamed it on our youth
But it's all because of you
We blamed it on our youth
But it's all because of you

'Cause it's all starting to feel like a bad dream now
And I can't wake up
And I can't wake up
'Cause it's all starting to feel like a bad dream now
And I can't wake up
And I can't wake up
'Cause it's all starting to feel like (feel like)

I'm walking down a hallway
Am I going the wrong way?
I don't even know who I am anymore
'Cause I've been running backwards
I've been sleeping on a mattress
In the middle of these four walls
Twenty-three missed phone calls

We blamed it on our youth
But it's all because of you
We blamed it on our youth
But it's all because of you

'Cause it's all starting to feel like a bad dream now
And I can't wake up
And I can't wake up
'Cause it's all starting to feel like a bad dream now
And I can't wake up
And I can't wake up
'Cause it's all starting to feel like (feel like)

We blamed it on our youth
But it's all because of you
We blamed it on our youth
But it's all because of you
