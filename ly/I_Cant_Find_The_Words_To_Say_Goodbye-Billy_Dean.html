		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't say I don't love her
Still I can't pretend
My heart is torn just knowing that
I'm losing my best friend
If it's easier said than done
Then someone tell me why
Though I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye

I can tell her that I'm sorry
And hope she'll understand
And she'll have to do with someone else
All that we had planned
I'd rather her hear the truth
Than hurt her with a lie
So I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye

I know I have to go
There's no other way
But goodbye is not what I
Can bring myself to say

I can tell her "see you later"
But then I might be wrong
This voice inside is driving me
To find where I belong
I know I must leave her now
Everytime I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye
Don't know why
I can't find the words to say goodbye
