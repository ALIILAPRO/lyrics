		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right now, sound
Hitmaka!

Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch

Draco hold how many what your friends say
Yeah, I keep making moves like sensei
Don't nobody move, that's what I say
FN blow the cherry off your sundae, ooh
I'm a full time finesser, ain't no chancing it
Hundred hanging off my neck like a chandelier
I got moves to make, I got somethin' in the wraith
Selling candy bars, sound like me when I was eight (whoo)

Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch

Balenciaga book bag, OG gas in the pouch
Double G slippers, Prada rugs in the house
Baby girl, what you gonna do for this clout?
You gon' bust it open, put this (ooh) in your mouth
Drip-drop, she gonna suck on the tip-top
Lip-locked, Trojan smile, I need a big sock
Do it for the game, never for for the fame
Bitch, I lie and cheat (yeah)
This shit in my veins
Whoo

Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch

Ten bands on my feet
Hundred bands on my wrist
You ain't ready for this shit, no
You ain't ready for this clout
Ay, keep my name out your mouth
Are you stupid?
Are you dumb?
Are you stupid? Psh!
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth
You ain't ready for this clout
You ain't ready for this clout, no

Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Smash for the clout
Dash, I'm out
Mashin' for the clout
TT, GT for the clout
Ooh, hop out
Draco on the couch
