		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I am pretty and important

That must mean Iʼm pretty important
Or am I a narcissist

I think I should get a grip

Every single human on the planet earth
is full of shit

No wonder weʼre killing it
The system is killing it

System we ainʼt forget about you
I just think Iʼm better than you
System we ainʼt forget about you
I   just think Iʼm better than you

Donʼt tiptoe over the fax

You were a no-show I counted you absent
Solo you play your own tracks

I know you donʼt love me like that
Uhh huh

Everybody wants to be somebody
Baby keep talking to me
Everybody wants to be somebody
Iʼm just trying to get myself paid

Donʼt need your love
I can love myself

When I see my reflection
I donʼt see nobody else

I guess it is what it is
I guess it is what it is
yeah

I guess it is what it is
I guess it is what it is


yeah

No way Iʼm going outside now
I donʼt even want to be me
Letʼs ride away

Ima  get to the bag now

I donʼt even wanna be me
Do to much

Ok

Lock it up
Ok

Pull it up
Ok

Back it up
Do to much
Ok

Lock it up
Ok

Pull it up
Ok

Back it up

Everybody wants to be somebody
Baby keep talking to me
Everybody wants to be somebody
Iʼm    just trying to get myself paid

If I am pretty and important

That must mean Iʼm pretty important
Or am I a narcissist

I think I should get a grip

Everybody wants to be somebody
Baby keep talking to me
Everybody wants to be somebody
Iʼm    just trying to get myself paid

I just think Iʼm better than you
I just think Iʼm better than you
