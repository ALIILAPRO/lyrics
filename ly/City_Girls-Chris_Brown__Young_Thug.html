		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Finally got a reason I could stay home
Pretty little thing for me to wait on
Fuckin' you all day until the day gone
California King, now we can play on (play on, yeah)
Girl, you know I like it when you lick it and you shake it
In my face and I can't take it (take, take-take, oh no)
FaceTime makes me anxious
And she look so good, I can taste it

Ride me, don't stop it
You should be in tropics tannin' your body, yeah
'Til it get dark, milk chocolate
You should be famous, movies like Nia, Lathan
You know I've been the best man, yeah

Back keep flowin', hit the gas, keep goin'
Yeah, them girls on tour, goin' city after city
Real ass bitch, give a fuck 'bout a nigga
If she did, then she won't be goin' city after city
Brand new Benz, never asked her how she get it
Made a couple racks, I never asked her how she did it
City girls love to have fun in the city 
City girls love to have fun in the city (yeah)

City girl like to let you fuck on her titty (on her, ayy)
City girl like to let you blam on her titty (titty)
City girls like to stare and act so saddity
I know city girls like a nigga dark skin and pretty (oh)
All I wanna do is have fun in the city (all I want to do)
All I want for you to do is leave your friends and get missin' (oh)
All I wanna do is keep it real with your pimpin', baby (real, okay)
Long as you don't switch up when you blow and get your millions, ayy
Bad, bad bitch, feed her Percocets and Adderall (bad, bad)
Hotel sex, got the concierge makin' calls (yeah, bad, bad bitch)
Keep it simple with you, everything you want is boss (yeah, yeah, want it all)
Let you shop, my bank account, you get your Black Card (yeah, yeah, on God)
I don't know where I'd be if I didn't fuck, with you, baby (yeah, yeah)
Is you in this picture? I don't see nothin' but you, baby (yeah, yeah)
Bad, bad baby, she from Singapore
You ain't got a ring, you get one for Easter, yeah (hey)

Back keep flowin', hit the gas, keep goin'
Yeah, them girls on tour, goin' city after city
Real ass bitch, give a fuck 'bout a nigga
If she did, then she won't be goin' city after city
Brand new Benz, never asked her how she get it
Made a couple racks, I never asked her how she did it
City girls love to have fun in the city
City girls love to have fun in the city

Finally, I wanted to be faithful
Usually I wouldn't even say so
I swear she can give the Devil a halo
I know she only tryna get a bankroll
I don't mind, I don't mind
You can't get anybody to stop me, yeah
You ain't got anybody, you got me, yeah-yeah

Ride me, don't stop it
You should be in tropics tannin' your body, yeah
'Til it get dark, milk chocolate
You should be famous, movies like Nia, Lathan
You know I've been the best man, yeah (ooh)

Back keep flowin', hit the gas, keep goin'
Yeah, them girls on tour, goin' city after city
Real ass bitch, give a fuck 'bout a nigga
If she did, then she won't be goin' city after city
Brand new Benz, never asked her how she get it (oh-oh)
Made a couple racks, I never asked her how she did it (oh-whoa)
City girls love to have fun in the city (yeah)
City girls love to have fun in the city (oh-oh)

City girls love to have fun in the city
City girls love to have fun in the city
(Hahahahaha)
