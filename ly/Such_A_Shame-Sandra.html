		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Such a shame to believe in escape 
A life on every face 
And that's a change, till I'm finally left with an eight 
Tell me to react, I just stare 
Maybe I don't know if I should change 
A feeling that we share... 
It's a shame 
(Such a shame) 
Number me with rage, it's a shame 
(Such a shame) 
Number me in haste, it's a shame 
This eagerness to change 
It's a shame... 
The dice decide my fate and that's a shame 
In these trembling hands my faith 
Tell me to react, I don't care 
Maybe it's unkind if I should change 
A feeling that we share... 
It's a shame 
(Such a shame) 
Number me with rage, it's a shame 
(Such a shame) 
Number me in haste, it's a shame 
This eagerness to change 
Such a shame... 
Tell me to react, I don't care 
Maybe it's unkind, I should change 
A feeling that we share... 
It's a shame 
(Such a shame) 
Number me with rage, it's a shame 
(Such a shame) 
Number me in haste, it's a shame 
This eagerness to change... 
Such a shame...
