		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem it slouched 
And then it must've caught a good look at you

Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you
The best of you
Honey, belongs to me

Ain't it a gentle sound, the rollin' in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby? ain't you my baby?

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby 
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you
Held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies

Ain't it warming you, the world gone up in flames?
Ain't it the life you, you're lighting of the blaze?
Ain't it a waste they'd watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby? ain't you my babe?

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby 
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby 
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby 
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
