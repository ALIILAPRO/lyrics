		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This should be heavenly, heavenly
Is there no remedy, remedy?
'Cause I've been baring blunt teeth
I'm breathing heavily, heavily
I see a legacy, legacy that's sinking
Oh, it beggars belief

I'm standing beneath the meteor
Disaster's breaking down my door
I should be moving mountains
The arrow buckles in the bow
They said it's time to go to war
Yeah, I've heard it all before
I should be moving mountains
But I'm like fire in the snow

Bathing in gasoline, gasoline
Living in quarantine, quarantine
It's colder in the furnace
Nobody's evergreen, evergreen
Stare at the murder scene, murder scene and focus
On nothing but the surface

I'm standing beneath the meteor
Disaster's breaking down my door
I should be moving mountains
The arrow buckles in the bow
They said it's time to go to war
Yeah, I've heard it all before
I should be moving mountains
But I'm like fire in the, a fire in the

Snow, snow, snow, snow

Another God on the radio
Says we're stuck in a tailspin
The pilots have vertigo
They're lost in the undertow
The arrow buckles in the bow

They said we pushed the last domino
Before the apocalypse
We've all got a stone to throw
Why? I will never know
Yeah, we're like fire in the, a fire in the snow

I'm standing beneath the meteor
Disaster's breaking down my door
I should be moving mountains
The arrow buckles in the bow
They said it's time to go to war
Yeah, I've heard it all before
I should be moving mountains
But I'm like fire in the, a fire in the snow
