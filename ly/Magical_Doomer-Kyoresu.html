		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleeping again, fading again
I'm waking up with a numb mind
Smoking again, thinking again
The numbness turned into unease
Drinking again, crying again
My apathy's been here a long time
But that will change
My fate is decided
A miracle happened and I made up my mind
I will transform into a magical girl
I will defy my own nature
I will transform into a magical girl
And my vodka bottle will turn into a magic wand 'cause
I will transform into a magical girl
That's how I'll meet your expectations
I will transform into a magical girl
That will give me a chance to rise
I got lost in my own world
I shut myself in my home
I have enough social activity going to smoke
I've been working so hard
And I've been lazy as fuck
Another-other day in bed whatever-ever ugh
Better that anyone else
Worse than anyone else
I don't know which one is my real self my mood swings like crazy
But that doesn't matter now
All that is meaningless now
Even a Russian doomer can hope for a future
I will transform into a magical girl
I'll fight against my own depression
I will transform into a magical girl
And my vodka bottle will turn into a magic wand 'cause
I will transform into a magical girl
I'll save a lonely generation
I will transform into a magical girl
Let me cast a spell on you now
I take my bottle
I feel my power
Why don't I try some of my magic spells on you
Return to monkey
Wear fashion panty
Hahaha gosh dude now you look so damn cursed
Davai sygraem
Juguemos juntos
Let's play together this game we're all in
I'll charge my AK
Aim to the sky and
I'll shoot and scream
Tak suka blyat ne otstavat
My head is spinning, I'm tired of volatility
Sometimes I wonder if there really is a place for me
Even so, I decided to stay true to myself
Loud or low, all my states are still me and that is okay
I will transform into a magical girl
It's my committed declaration
I will transform into a magical girl
And my vodka bottle finally will actually help me
I will transform into a magical girl
I will not lose to hesitation
And with my powers and my frail will to mend
I'll prove that nothing is doomed yet
