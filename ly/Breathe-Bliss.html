		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time for everybody 
Listen to the sound 
And all the lonely people 
Live beneath the ground 
Don't listen to another 
Just listen to yourself 
Only changes can happens 
When you change yourself 
I want run 
I want hide 
I only want to live 
To live my life 

Breathe of pain 
I'm the ruler of my world 
Breathe in peace 
I'm the ruler of the world 

I courage of conviction 
In everything you do 
Course every little action 
Only falls on to you 
And I don't want excuses 
To hear your bitterness 
There's far to many people 
Who want to give their best 
I want run 
I want hide 
I only want to live 
To live my life 

Breathe of pain 
I'm the ruler of my world 
Breathe of pain 
I'm the ruler of my world 
In this light 
In this life 
In this love 
All come back to you
