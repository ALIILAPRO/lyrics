		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's about time that I fucked yo bitch
I put in my time and I got myself rich
And I took a couple lines and I made em to hits
She knowing my sign but she don't wanna dip
Unless it's skinny
She gon make it pop like Remy
I be in her gut like henny
She be thick like Jenny
Goin one round nah many
Spitting f's out like Fendi
Ima break it all down
Level the plains
But ima be up in my plane without shame
And I'm bringing the ruckus the roughest
I'll murk all you puppets
Your debt is now due
Hear the audible trumpets
Preceding my entry
Pop pop
Gun shot to yo sentry
What you think we came down here friendly
I can see all the green and the envy
It's fake love
Thats enough
Ridin my coattails and my nuts
Cause my capital greater
They storming the crater
For anything at all
The atoms and crumbs
Crash landed
I managed to lose some of my baggage
Them bandits can have it
They gon get hit red handed
Fuck a third eye
And yo birds eye
They will learn why
They cannot contain me or surround I got that turbine
Survive
You won't survive
When she earn my
Time and now it's tickin
She gon put my hand on her thigh
Carjacked
Get back on the tarmac
Fuck a carfax
Get slapped by my large sack
Bar packed
Till I clap with the AK
If you wanna fight me know it's gonna be a melee
Girl unbuckle my belt
Follow my lead
And leave yo cells
Gon free yo self
Don't see yourself
I'm really gonna take you to yo real self
Shawty wanna go and get up under sheets
Under my skin
No way no where
Scarlet letter on her back without care
But I don't really notice cause I'm pulling her hair
Gonna go in like I came from famine
Gonna head out like I'm playing backgammon
Never gave a fuck
Talking bout me, can't stand him
But why she on my pole
Like a shake junt dancin
Fake punks, ain't one, take none
Ray gun, ray charles, can't stun
Miss me with that bullshit
Cause I'm all out of patience

She just wanna stay young
But this shawty, she ain't mine
They just wanna play dumb
I ain't wasting any time
I been waitin say something
All these opps they on my line
They stay on that pay phone
I got money on my mind

She just wanna stay young
But this shawty, she ain't mine
They just wanna play dumb
I ain't wasting any time
I been waitin say something
All these opps they on my line
They stay on that pay phone
I got money on my mind

She just wanna stay young
But this shawty, she ain't mine
They just wanna play dumb
I ain't wasting any time
I been waitin say something
All these opps they on my line
They stay on that pay phone
I got money on my mind

Nothing is forever
