		  Bad habit

Lil' mama wanna pay for the dick
That nigga lame 'cause he pay for his chick
(Check, please)
Bitch mad, wanna cry 'cause I hit
Tellin' on your mans, this shit ain't it
(Check, please) ayy, yeah, put her out there
Now your man's gon' put
Choppers on his headstone
Check the info, I'm poppin' presidential
Fuck a TED Talk, I'm finna let my bands talk
(Check, please)
Ayy, this ain't MTV, lil' bitch
She just wanna fuck
Google me and see I'm rich
Let her keep the check
It get drippy cause I'm next
(Check, please)
Gang, gang, gang, it get drippy where I live
First of all, I'm sellin'
Out the motherfuckin' crib, ayy
Jackie Chan a nigga if he
Really want the dips, ayy
'Nother customer, I wanna cram, lil' baby
He keep comin' back
He say the Xan' go crazy (Check, please)

Check, please (yeah)
Think I spent too much on a neckpiece
No backseat gas up the foreign, it got acne
I run the city, I'm the next guy
She let me fuck with my eyes closed
Keep a bad bitch with my eyes closed
She a bad bitch with a white nose
