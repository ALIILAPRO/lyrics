		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it, I don't need it
I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side
You can love it or you can leave it
Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right

Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand
While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand
And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained
'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain

There's no denying it, you've never had control

I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out

I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid
I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did)
So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin

If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere
Cause in the end I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear

There's no denying it, I've always had control

I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out
(Inside out)

How you've turned me inside out
Inside out
Inside out
How you've turned me inside out
I'm inside out
So inside out

I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out
Inside out
