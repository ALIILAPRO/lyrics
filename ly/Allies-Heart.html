		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In troubled times
It's hard to get straight answers
Between the lines
That border wrong or right
The homeland cries
It struggles with confusion
But this feelin' still remains
Like shelter from the rain

We live of faith
In the hands of those who guide us
And tear the page
On the fear we left behind
We set the pace
For every born survivor
Don't turn the other way
When I need to hear you say

Allies with our backs against the wall
I will answer when you call
And take on the odds
For what we believe is true
Allies in a world of too much choice
I only need your voice
To tell me you care
I'll be anywhere for you, allies

We search our hearts
To justify the reason
And draw the line
To meet somewhere halfway
If faith is blind
Through darkness it will guide us
'Cause the spirit still remains
With the keepers of the flame

Allies with our backs against the wall
I will answer when you call
And take on the odds
For what we believe is true
Allies in a world of too much choice
I only need your voice
To tell me you care
I'll be anywhere for you, allies

Allies with our backs against the wall
I will answer when you call
And take on the odds
For what we believe is true
Allies in a world of too much choice
I only need your voice
To tell me you care
I'll be anywhere for you, allies
