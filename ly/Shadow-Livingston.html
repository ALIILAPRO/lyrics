		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One foot in the ground
One foot in the grave
Don't you dare make a sound, shh
Hear you from a mile away
Run from the town
All you need is your name
And the sweat on your brow
And the blood running through your veins

Don't think twice
You'll be dead in a second
Turn your eyes
From your hands to the heavens
Kill your pride
Turn your fear to a weapon
And don't you forget it

Oh
Don't you let them take control
Don't you let them break your soul
It's not the devil at your door
It's just your shadow on the floor

One eye on the clock
One eye on the mirror
Take a step through your thoughts
Is it getting clearer
If they follow you whenever night falls
Will you still listen to my call
Who do you trust or no one at all
Or knowing it all

Don't think twice
You'll be dead in a second
Turn your eyes
From your hands to the heavens
Kill your pride
Turn your fear to a weapon
And don't you forget it

Oh
Don't you let them take control
Don't you let them break your soul
It's not the devil at your door
It's just your shadow on the floor
(It's just your shadow on the floor)

Tell me that you hate me, yeah
I heard it all before
There's a life here for the taking
Is it mine or is it yours
All I am is what you make me
You're on both sides of the wall
It's not the devil that you're facing
It's your shadow on the floor

(It's just your shadow on the floor)
