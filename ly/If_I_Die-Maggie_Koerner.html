		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I die before I live I swear to God I'll become the biggest sin
If I die, if I die

What would the weight of the world say today if she had a voice to give?
cnd how much more can we try to ignore if we have a choice in how to live? 

If I lay, if I should die I'd go down in a wall full of flames
If I lay, I'll go away to the mountain, I'm gonna bury this hole in our hands

If I die before I live I swear God I'll become the biggest sin 
If I die, if I die

Have you ever wondered what you look like inside?
You don't seem that different from me 
Oh we're all flesh and bone til there's blood on the concrete 
If I was born on a ledge I'd have learned how to fly
If I was born in the sea I'd dip my head real low and I'd let out this cry 

If I die before I live I swear God I'll become the biggest sin
If I die, if I die
If I die before I live I swear God I'll become the biggest sin
If I die, if I die
