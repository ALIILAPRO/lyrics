		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wind in my face, hound at my heels
At the end I'm winning this race, only then can I chill
But 'till then, don't ever try to stagnate the magnate
When it's money on the line, never make the bag wait
I just add weight to the bag until the bag break
That holy swag make the cash get the gas face
In the first place, I got no mothafucking business coming in last place
My birth place taught me not to stop
I'm more advanced than my classmates
I came into the game on a fast break and I'm gang gang like Billy Bathgate
The protagonist, and I narrate in the same slang that Philly has
I can't stop
If I don't work than I won't eat
Time keeps running like a river, it don't cease
In the mind of a super nigga it's no peace
Can't stop running like I'm ducking from police, stop
Cooley High they trying to do me like Cochise
The flow so obese, it's springing a slow leak
I keep a crowd satisfied bringing 'em cold heat
I'm gratified winning bling bling and no gold teeth
Yo, stop, you know the cameras is gon' see
My hammers ain't for brandishing if Canons is on me
Please, you ain't fucking with no amateurs homie
Philly ain't known for cheesesteak sandwiches only, stop
Yo, I'm at the top where it's lonely
I got everybody mean mugging like Nick Nolte
But nah, I won't stop, won't drop, won't retire
I am my own supplier, selling goods to the buyer
The torch to the higher, the storm that's on fire
The data translator, each jawn I'm charting higher
They requested my IG, I replied 'deny'
Tell me I'm in the top 3, they ain't never lied
Stop through in that pink king, the Paris with a ride
The car's two to five, the doors suicide
Testing the GOAT will be your suicide
No matter which corner of the globe you reside
215, dumb shit aside
When it comes to the job getting done, what am I?
The god of the microphone
Praise the Lord, if anybody disagree with me then raise your sword
I'm Agent Orange, poisonous amazing poems
And the band keeps raging on

Listen to me I won't
Don't stop, nope I don't quit
I don't stop, I don't quit
