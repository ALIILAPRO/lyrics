		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to hear you call my name
I want to feel your touch on me again
When you're gone I can't go on
Nothing feels the same

No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you

I wanna hold you in my arms
I want to feel our bodies moving as one
When you're gone I can't go on
Without you, I am done

No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you

I need your love
I needed your love

No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
No I won't forget you, won't forget you
I will never let you go
