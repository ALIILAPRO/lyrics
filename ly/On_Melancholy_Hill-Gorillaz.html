		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ohh)

(Ahh)

Up on Melancholy Hill
There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day
Of another dream

Where you can't get what you want
But you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

(Ahh)

So call in the submarines
'Round the world we'll go
Does anybody know, love
If we're looking out on the day
Of another dream?

(Ahh)
If you can't get what you want
Then come with me (me)

Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits the manatee, love
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

(Ahh)

When you're close to me

(Ahh)
(Ahh)
