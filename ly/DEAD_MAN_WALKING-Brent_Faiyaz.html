		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drop the roof and let the smoke clear (smoke clear, smoke clear)

Drop the roof and let the smoke clear (smoke clear)
I got diamonds doin' toosie slides in both ears
Dice rollin' on the Las Vegas strip tonight
Slip that on and we might miss the fight
Fuck a knot, I keep the guala in my shorty bag
You know she one of mine, when she tattoo that ass
I'm a lover boy
She love the toys (yeah)
Keep it comin', you a rider
This that roll myself a J and count my figure shit
This that steppin' out, I feel like I'm that nigga shit
I dropped thirty on this room, we ain't gon' sleep for shit (yeah, yeah)
If I catch you nodding off, then it's gon' be some shit

But you can do what you wanna
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna
Be who you wanna be
A young stunner (stunner)
'Til I D-I-E (Lord, help me)
You can do what you wanna
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna
Be who you wanna be
A young stunner (stunner)
'Til I D-I-E (yeah)

Fuck it, I just run it up before I go
Would you tell the world my secrets if I let you close?
MIA
Missing in action
'Cause these days no "Kumbaya"
Niggas be blastin'
Livin' in the midst of
This shit might drive you mad
Feeling pretty mixed up
But this life shit ain't all bad (she work)
Bloody, bloody murder
There ain't no second chances (shit cray)
(Let's fuck)

Tell her, just do what you wanna
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna
Be who you wanna be
A young stunner (stunner)
'Til I D-I-E (Lord, help me)
You can do what you wanna
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna
Be, who you wanna be
A young stunner (stunner)
'Til I D-I-E (yeah)
