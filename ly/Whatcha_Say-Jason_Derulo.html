		  Wh-wh-wh-what did she say?
Mm whatcha say?
Mm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mm whatcha say?
(Jason Derulo)
Mm that it's all for the best?

Of course it is

I was so wrong for so long
Only tryin' to please myself
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else

Oh, no, I know I should've treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever
So let me in
(Let me in)
Give me another chance
(Another chance)
To really be a man

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me girl

Mm whatcha say?
Mm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mm whatcha say?
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)
Mm that it's all for the best?
Of course it is

Mm whatcha say?
Mm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mm whatcha say?
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)
Wh-wh-wh-what did she say?

How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go?
And ooh, what I'd do for one chance
I just gotta let you know

I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you were meant to be together
So let me in
(Let me in)
Give me another chance
(Another chance)
To really be a man

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me girl

Mm whatcha say?
Mm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mm whatcha say?
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)
Mm that it's all for the best?
Of course it is

Mm whatcha say?
Mm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mm whatcha say?
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)
Wh-wh-wh-what did you say?

Girl, tell me whatcha say, I
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha say, I
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right, girl

Tell me, tell me whatcha say, I
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha say, I
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
(I just didn't know what to do)
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So baby watcha say?

Mm whatcha say?
Mm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
(Well of course I did, baby)
Mm whatcha say?
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)
Mm that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
(Well, of course it is)

Mm whatcha say?
Mm that you only meant well?
(Whatcha say?)
Well of course you did
Mm whatcha say?
(Whatcha say? Whatcha say?)
Wh-wh-wh-what did you say?
