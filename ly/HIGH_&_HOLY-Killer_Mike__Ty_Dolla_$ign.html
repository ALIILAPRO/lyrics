		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Real niggas, it's my honour to pay you homage
And extend the same respect to all your baby mamas
'Cause streets is trifled
We carry rifles, granny carry Bibles
We carry hatred for our rivals, same as Cain and Abel
Killed his brother 'cause God showed him favour
Mankind killed his own saviour
Man will kill his neighbour (Do it again)
Man will kill his neighbour
They say, "It's in our nature"
They say, "We're children of a lesser god" and treat us hateful
Shit it's so disgraceful
I stay prayed and faithful
I apologize if I've ever spoken distasteful
Words in front of elders, sittin' at the dinner table
I rightened up and tightened up and God showed me favour

Blowin' smoke up at the Heavens, count my blessings, tryna find atonement
My life's a testimony, that's why I stay high and holy
That's why I stay high and holy (I stay high and holy)
Blowin' smoke up at the Heavens, count my blessings, tryna find atonement
My life's a testimony, that's why I stay high and holy
That's why I stay high and holy

Men have died for dollars, men have killed for pennies
But too few have made a difference 'fore life is finished
Like, did you love a woman? Did you raise a child?
Did you show some love? Did you give a smile?
Well, you made the suffer when you didn't deserve it
You fucked up, that's okay, bruh, ain't nobody perfect
They say, "Get right with God 'cause the devil lurkin'
Lay your worries down, give God all your burdens"
My brother's in the fire and to save him's my desire
Our ambitions often could conspire to go higher
God bless those that confess and God damn the liars
Quoted like I wrote it, Micheal father of Ania

Blowin' smoke up at the Heaven, count my blessings, tryna find atonement
My life's a testimony, that's why I stay high and holy
That's why I stay high and holy (I stay high and holy)
Blowin' smoke up at the Heaven, count my blessings, tryna find atonement
My life's a testimony, that's why I stay high and holy
That's why I stay high and holy

I stay high and holy
I stay high, high and holy
High and holy
