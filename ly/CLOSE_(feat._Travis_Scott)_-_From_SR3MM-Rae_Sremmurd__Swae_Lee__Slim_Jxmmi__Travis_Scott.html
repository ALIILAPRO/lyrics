		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  30, you a fool for this one
Oh, C-L-O-S-E
Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

One rope in the chain, yeah, lightin' propane, yeah
Dousin' the flame, yeah, bounce for some change, yeah
Gang can't be tamed, yeah, ice in our veins, yeah
Somethin' feels strange, this cup is dangerous
Somethin' ain't right, dawg (yeah), we in too easy (yeah)
Been here all night, dawg, really, I'm tweakin', yeah (it's lit)
Lookin' to pipe some, ass in the party, look like a pageant (pop it)
If we gon' fight some, beat it and dash it, lawyer do magic (alright)

Lowrider, my avenue (ooh)
But that truck's not up my avenue (no)
You cried and said, "Look what you made me do" (you made me do)
It's not my fault that I don't wanna end up screwed (screwed)
And everything I'm tryna say, you beat me to it (to it)
And all the ups and all the downs, we have been through it (through it)
Now you're C-L-O-S-E (you're too close)
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (you're so close)

C-L-O-S-E (it's ruined)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
C-L-O-S-E to me (it's ruined)
I mean, seriously, can I breathe?
C-L-O-S-E
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (yeah, C-L-O-S-E)
You're so C-L-O-S-E (yeah) (Jxm, ayy)

You know I'm a dog and I can't control it
Wanna settle someday but not at the moment
I'ma stack up the cake like Obama told me
Niggas smile in your face and they're not your homie (too close)
Makin' me claustrophobic
Bust down the AP and wet the Rollie
Stop callin' me "brother," you barely know me
Don't tell me you love me, you gotta show me (show me you love me)
I'm so anti (Jxm), gotta get paid to go outside (woo)
Blowin' on the strong like "How High" (blowin' on strong)
Haters still watch from the sideline (haters still watchin')
Sremm and La Flame on the incline (incline)
Mixin' up brands, it's drip time (drip)
Stuck to the plan, had to get mine (get mine)
Stayed down and it paid off big time

So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries

C-L-O-S-E (ooh)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (you know)
C-L-O-S-E to me (you made me do)
I mean, seriously, can I breathe? (Ooh)
C-L-O-S-E (through it)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (through it)
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (you're too close)
You're so C-L-O-S-E (you're so close)
