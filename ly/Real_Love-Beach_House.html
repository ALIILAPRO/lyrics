		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met you somewhere 
In a hell beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room 
That frightens you when they go boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom

The color you say is black is the one you might lack
In the size of your eyes, is there a righteous prize?

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I met you, I met you

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh

There's something wrong with our hearts
When they beat pure, they stand apart
In the black room, the light, watch the seabird fall
Real love, it finds you somewhere with your back to it

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
I met you, I met you

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh

We know, we know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn
We know, we know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn
We know, we know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn
We know, we know
We belong by the stream, into the dawn
