		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't take it personally, this is not about you
I begin to slide inward and throughout to
Shatter the static silencing my mind
Find the rhythm and set course to collide

Don't take it personally
My hands are disappearing
Dissolving in a tear
I am not needed here

Starting to feel something, I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something, will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something? I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin, look at me now

It's Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

I used to dream about killing certain people
Dreams that sew me up like sleeping with a needle
Those feelings that I had were building up to something
I feel a schism in the rhythm now I'm running

My hair is liquifying
My tastebuds are igniting
It's true I am evolving
It's all relative

Starting to feel something, I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something, will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something? I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin, look at me now

Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

Intra, intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra, intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
