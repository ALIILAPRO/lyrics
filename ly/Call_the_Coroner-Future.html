		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He always has been the largest, you know, drug kingpin, uh, out there
(Say fuck the drug test, gon' pass my gas mask)
I think he's responsible for, for hundreds of quantities of drugs moving it into the United States
(Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked)

I wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious
Sometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious
I got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo
I come through poppin' it off, call the coroner
You see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras
I'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball
Pink shirt on me just to match my diamonds
NASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'
Big dawg but I feel just like a giant
Withdrawals, pass my cup, I think I'm dyin'

Say fuck the drug test, go'n pass my gas mask
Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked
Super like Goldie Mack, hoe caught an asthma attack
Hoes gettin' their toes tagged, kill 'em dead at Hermes
Turn up on purpose, I have her nervous
I don't have no stylist, make my own purchase
Low top my Gucci, I was wrapped in turban
Knew she was a hoochie, I had to murk it
Now I got power, I feel like Curtis
I gave her Pucci, I felt like she was worth it

I wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious
Sometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious
I got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo
I come through poppin' it off, call the coroner
You see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras
I'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball
Pink shirt on me just to match my diamonds
NASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'

Say fuck the drug test, go'n pass my gas mask
Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked
Say fuck the drug test, go'n pass my gas mask
Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked
(The WIZRD)
