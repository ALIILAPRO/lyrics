		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Repress and restrain
Still the pressure and the pain
Wash the blood off your hands
This time she won't understand

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control

You're working so hard
And you're never in charge
Your death creates success
And you'll build and suppress

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control

Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control
