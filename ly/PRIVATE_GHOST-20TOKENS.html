		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
Treat me right if you don't wanna
Haunt you for the world you burned, I
Wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
Wanna die next to your door
Wanna die
I wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
Treat me right if you don't wanna
Haunt you for the world you burned, I
Wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
I just can't anymore
Kill me or let me go
This life means nothing to me
This life means nothing to you
You just chewed up all my dreams
And stuck by words with no truth
My heaven can't take you, oh no
My hell can't make you my own
My mouth is full of razors
Give me a slap and pick them off the floor
I wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
Treat me right if you don't wanna
Haunt you for the world you burned, I
Wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
I just can't anymore
Kill me or let me go
Tell me you love me
Then tell me I'm nothing
But I swallow this
But I swallow this
Ask me to stay
Then throw me away the next day
But I swallow this
But I swallow this
I wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
Treat me right if you don't wanna
Haunt you for the world you burned, I
Wanna die next to your door
And to be your private ghost
I just can't anymore
Kill me or let me go
