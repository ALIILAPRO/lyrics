		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see my clothes on the floor
And that's how you know I'm home
And I know it's been a while
But I won't be here for long
I tell you
Where I stayed and what's been going on
And it's bittersweet
Cause I wish you could've seen
And by the way
If I go it doesn't mean I didn't wanna stay
Cause if I need space
Doesn't mean hate
Doesn't erase
All the things I said I'd do
And if I need time
Doesn't mean I'm
Saying goodbye
And when it's falling all around me
And I don't know what to do
I think about you and it's alright
So if I need space
Doesn't mean hate
Doesn't erase
Us
I know I
Said this last time
I'll say it again out of guilt
When things slow down I'll be back
But they never will
I feel the years slip away
I can tell it's movin' fast
And it's so fleeting so we save it in a photograph
And by the way
If I go it doesn't mean I didn't wanna stay
Cause if I need space
Doesn't mean hate
Doesn't erase
All the things I said I'd do
And if I need time
Doesn't mean I'm
Saying goodbye
And when it's falling all around me
And I don't know what to do
I think about you and it's alright
So if I need space
Doesn't mean hate
Doesn't erase
Us
When it rains in Highland Park
When I'm walking after dark
When I see your favorite car
I miss you
When I see a shooting star
Are you looking back at all
Are you there cause afterall
I miss you
Cause if I need space
Doesn't mean hate
Doesn't erase
All the things I said I'd do
And if I need time
Doesn't mean I'm
Saying goodbye
And when it's falling all around me and I don't know what to do
I think about you and it's alright
So if I need space
Doesn't mean hate
Doesn't erase
Us
(saying goodbye)
So if I need space
Doesn't mean hate
Doesn't erase
Us
