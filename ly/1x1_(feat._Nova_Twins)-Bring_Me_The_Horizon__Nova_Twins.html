		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Put me out of my misery)

Disconnected from the world again
No, the sun don't shine in the place I've been
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit

So I ask myself, when will I learn?
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn
I'm scared that I'm never gonns be repaired

Put me out of my misery
My mind feels like an archenemy
Can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most
Holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories
And they're killing me one by one

Sabotaged myself again
Got a brain like a hurricane
Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends
And I don't even care, no

Oh, got me sinking to a dark place (outta love)
Evil twin under the staircase (oh, my god)
Think I'm looking at a long night
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

Terrified (terrified)
I am numb (but I'm numb)
Annihilation never looked so good
Shut up
Hush your mouth, you talk too much

Put me out of my misery
My mind feels like an archenemy
Can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most
Holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories
And they're killing me one by one

And I'm starin' into the void again
No one knows what a mess I'm in
The voices in my head say I'm just being paranoid
But it's bad for my health
How much I hate myself
I suffocate, the weight
It pulls me underneath

Put me out of my misery
My mind feels like an archenemy
Can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most
Holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories
And they're killing me one by one
And it's killing me one by one
And they're killing me one by one
