		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am on a lonely road and
I am traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be?
Oh, I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh, I love you when I forget about me
I wanna be strong, I wanna laugh along
I wanna belong to the living
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want, do you want, do you wanna dance with me baby?
Do you wanna take a chance on
Maybe finding some sweet romance with me, baby? Well come on

All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
Wanna renew you again and again
Applause, applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses my mind see-saws
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me, baby?
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy
The greed is the unraveling it's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I wanna have fun, I wanna shine like the sun
Wanna be the one that you want to see
I wanna knit you a sweater
I wanna write you a love letter
I wanna make you feel better
I wanna make you feel free, hmm hm hmm hm
Wanna make you feel all free
I wanna make you feel free
