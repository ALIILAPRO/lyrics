		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Lil' Boat and Quavo

I believe in you
They told you you can't show them folks, you do
Every bitch in the world posts us in their room
But I fuck with lil' shorty 'cause she vacuum
Suck me in the living room

Look at the rocks
Ice on my watch (yah!)
When I'm on the block (block)
I run from the cops (cops)
Damn, did I forget to mention
All these racks on me, playin' tennis
Write my name in the World Guinness
Take them back to the beginnin'
Take them back to the beginnin'
Back before Lil Boat was winnin'
Back before I had a million
Back before I was car stealin'
These niggas act like they feel me
If I got caught slippin' on my soap
I'm sure these niggas'd try to kill me
She said, "How rich are you?" I'm filthy
I perfect all my craft
Shoot a nigga like Shaft
I sell a million-dollar slab (M&M)
Then put your bitch in a cab (bitch)
Do a show out in Rio
I just do it for the Migos
First time I met a migo
I walked away with a kilo (kilo)
Got a brick, Shaq free throw
Hit the pot with the people's elbow
Never go out like Nino (ayy)
I'm in the water like Nemo (ayy)
Who that is with the mink on? (ayy)
Look at my paper, Kinko's (ayy)
Shoot at the block then reload
Shoot at the block then reload
Ball so hard, free throw
Bitch curl like a Frito (yeah)
Twenty bands, that's for every show (yeah)
Got an Asian bitch, she loves egg rolls
Got a Black bitch with an attitude
When I tell her no, she just neck-rolls
Got a big sack and it's so big
Boy I swear to God I just can't fold

I believe in you
They told you you can't show them folks, you do
Every bitch in the world posts us in their room
But I fuck with lil' shorty 'cause she vacuum
Suck me in the living room
I believe in you
They told you you can't show them folks, you do
Every bitch in the world posts us in their room
But I fuck with lil' shorty 'cause she vacuum
Suck me in the living room

She treat a nigga like a boss
I call my shooter, take him off
Hit the button on the nos
Young nigga taking off (yep)
Got a shotty sawed off (yep)
I'm 'bout to fuck her jaws off (yep)
Put your bitch on pause
They call me Quavo J Crawl
Middle finger to the law
Did what it takes to be boss
Did what it takes to be boss
Ayy
This for my niggas who don't ever take a loss
This for my niggas locked up behind bars
This for my niggas who need an extra push
They hated me like Bush
But I'mma still rise, woah
And I put that on my guys
R.I.P. to all my soldiers in the sky

I believe in you
They told you you can't show them folks, you do
Every bitch in the world posts us in their room
But I fuck with lil' shorty 'cause she vacuum
Suck me in the living room
I believe in you
They told you you can't show them folks, you do
Every bitch in the world posts us in their room
But I fuck with lil' shorty 'cause she vacuum
Suck me in the living room

Ayy, drop my top on my foreign (foreign)
Ain't no phones, no recording (no recording)
Got my guap in the morning (guap)
In that coupe, Jeff Gordon (skrrt, skrrt)
