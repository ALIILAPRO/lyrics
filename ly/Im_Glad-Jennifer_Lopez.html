		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby when I think about
The day that we first met (the day that we first met)
Wasn't lookin for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time

I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

I dig the way that you get down
(You get down for 'bout)
And you still know how to hold me
(And you still know how to hold me)
Perfect blend, masculine (can't get enough now)
I think I'm in love, damn finally

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time

I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

I'm glad that you turned out to be
That certain someone special
Who makes this life worth living
I'm glad you're here just loving me
So say that you won't leave
'Cause since the day you came I've been glad

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time

I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad
