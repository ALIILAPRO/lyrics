		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walk around like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can't say no
Go out the way to make the coin available
That's what I call love
The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

But the time, it'll come, to not be there when somebody needs you
You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia
One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)

They idolize and praise your name across the nation
Tap the feed and nod the head for confirmation
Promise that you keep the music in rotation
That's what I call love (that's what I call love)

But the time, it'll come (but the time, it'll come)
To not be there when somebody needs you (when somebody needs you)
You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia (they don't remember)
One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody

Heavy is the head that chose to wear the crown
To whom it's given, much is required now
Heavy is the head that chose to wear the crown
To whom it's given, much is required now

I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
Love gon' get you killed (love gon' get you killed)
Uh, I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
Uh, I can't even please myself (I can't even please myself)
Uh, I thought a new car would help (I thought a new car would help)
Uh, but when that new car get old (but when that new car get old)
Uh, I'm sure to want something else, I-I-I

I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)
Can't please
