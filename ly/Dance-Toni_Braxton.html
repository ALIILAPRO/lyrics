		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dance, dance, just dance
I'll get over you, baby

Found out just the other day
You were giving it away
I found out just the other day
And I ain't tryna make you stay
You told me that you'd never hurt me (hurt me)
Made me believe I was your only

I don't give a damn 
I just wanna dance the love away
I don't really care
I just wanna dance the love away
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance, just dance
I'll get over you, baby
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance 
Just dance, just dance, just dance, dance
I just wanna

I'll get over you
Dance
I'll get over you

I just found out yesterday
All your friends were telling me
I just found out yesterday
Everybody knew my man
You promised me I was your only
Tonight you'll see I won't be lonely

I don't give a damn 
I just wanna dance the love away
I don't really care
I just wanna dance the love away
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance, just dance
I'll get over you, baby
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance 
Just dance, just dance, just dance, dance
I just wanna dance

I'll get over you
Dance
I'll get over you

Watch how I get over you (gonna get over you)
DJ can you help me to (help me)
Turn it up so I can move
(Five, four) right now, don't stop
(One, two, three) I just wanna dance

I don't really care
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance, just dance
I'll get over you, baby
I just wanna dance, dance, dance, dance 
Just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance
Just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance
Just dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
I just wanna 

I'll get over you
Dance
I'll get over you

I just wanna dance

I'll get over you
Dance
I'll get over you

Dance
