		  Doosh
My Docs go
Doosh
Boot to your face and your mush goes
Doosh
New track at the show and the crowd go
Doosh
Drop an LP and the sales go
Woosh
Brand new sound and the space goes
Doosh
Step it up a gear and the place goes
Crowd so dense gonna make you
Push
Anybody fucking with The Hell goes
Doosh
T.H.E.H.E.L.L
Black Mist, man I gonna make you spell
Smoke that kush and the squad like
Quell
Eyedrops in so your mum can't tell
I need everybody in this fucking place
To Doosh
Doosh
My crep go
Doosh
Boot to your face and your mush goes
Doosh
New track at the show and the crowd go
Doosh
Drop an LP and the sales go
Woosh
Brand new sound and the space goes
Doosh
Step it up a gear and the place goes
Crowd so dense gonna make you
Push
Anybody fucking with The Hell goes
Doosh
Yeah
Which one of you gonna catch my Doosh
When I'm on a level gonna shift that tush
Yeah might grab lips gonna make them
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I've been known to bring that Doosh
Watch that puddle, gonna make it sploosh
Don't fuck about or kick that mush
Eenie
Meenie
Miney
Doosh
Doosh
My Docs go
Doosh
Boot to your face and your mush goes
Doosh
New track at the show and the crowd go
Doosh
Drop an LP and the sales go
Woosh
Brand new sound and the space goes
Doosh
Step it up a gear and the place goes
Crowd so dense gonna make you
Push
Anybody fucking with The Hell goes
Doosh
Jab cross
Hook cross
Doosh cross
Uppercut
Doosh
Two hits of charge in your mush, uppercut
Doosh
Knee followed up by an elbow
Mai Tai dickheads with a roundhouse
Doosh
Doosh Doosh Doosh Doosh Doosh
Doosh
My Docs go
Doosh
Boot to your face and your mush goes
Doosh
New track at the show and the crowd go
Doosh
Drop an LP and the sales go
Woosh
Brand new sound and the space goes
Doosh
Step it up a gear and the place goes
Crowd so dense gonna make you
Push
Anybody fucking with The Hell goes
Doosh
