		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What were you thinking?
I guess I'll never know
See your eyes blinking
Pupils begin to grow

Drilling you softly
Pulling you in
Making your mind up
What's sick or a sin

Open up now, let it all go
I'm quite certain, say it ain't so
You're corrupted by 
Some sick fuck, oh, no

Open up now, head in the sky
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

What you've been taking
It makes you talk real slow
How come I'm thinking
You'd be the last to know?

Choking you gently
Gaining control
Hand you the shovel
To dig your own hole

Open up now, let it all go
I'm quite certain, say it ain't so
You're corrupted by 
Some sick fuck, oh, no

Open up now, head in the sky
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

Choking you gently
Gaining control
Hand you the shovel
To dig your own hole

Open up now, let it all go
Ah-ah-ah
Open up now, let it all go
Ah-ah-ah

Open up now, head in the sky
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

You breathe in but can't breathe out
