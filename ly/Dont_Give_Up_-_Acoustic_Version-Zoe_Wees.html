		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you ever feel like the teardrops just won't dry?
They just won't dry, they just won't dry
Smiling in a crowd when all you wanna do is cry
You wanna cry, you wanna cry
Do you ever feel? Do you ever feel alone?
Alone, alone, alone, alone
Do you ever feel like there's just nowhere to go?
Nowhere to go

When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Got you feeling low
When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Don't give up, no, no

(Don't give up, no, no)
(Don't give up, no, no)

Dancing with the sun but there's thunder in your mind
Thunder in your mind, thunder in your mind
You gon' be okay
I know it's hard but you'll survive
Yeah, you'll survive, yeah, you'll survive
Do you ever feel? Do you ever feel alone?
Oh no

When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Got you feeling low
When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Don't give up, no, no

Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, no, no
Don't you give up, no, no, no

Keep running through the clouds
You're gonna make it out
You're gonna make it out
You'll keep flying
When the world turns upside down
And you're falling to the ground
And the ocean's in the sky
Don't give up, no, no
