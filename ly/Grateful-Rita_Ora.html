		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There were a lot of tears I had to cry through
A lot of battles left me battered and bruised
And I was shattered, had my heart ripped in two
I was broken, I was broken
There were a lot of times I stumbled and crashed
When I was on the edge, down to my last chance
So many times when I was so convinced that
I was over, I was over
But I had to fall yeah
To rise above it all

I'm grateful for the storm
Made me appreciate the sun
I'm grateful for the wrong ones
Made me appreciate the right ones
I'm grateful for the pain
For everything that made me break
I'm thankful for all my scars
'Cause they only make my heart
Grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful
Grateful

I was sinking, I was drowning in doubt
The weight all of the pain was weighing me down
Pulled it together and I pulled myself out
Learned a lesson, learned a lesson
That there's a lot you gotta go through, hell yes
But that's what got me strong, I got no regrets
And I've got only love, got no bitterness
Count my blessings, count my blessings, yeah
I'm proud of every tear, yeah
'Cause they got me here

I'm grateful for the storm
Made me appreciate the sun
I'm grateful for the wrong ones
Made me appreciate the right ones
I'm grateful for the pain
For everything that made me break
I'm thankful for all my scars
'Cause they only make my heart
Grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful
Grateful

There is nothing I would change
That even one mistake I made
I got lost, found myself, found my way

I'm grateful for the storm
Made me appreciate the sun
I'm grateful for the wrong ones
Made me appreciate the right ones
I'm grateful for the pain
For everything that made me break
I'm thankful for all my scars
'Cause they only make my heart
Grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful, oh
Grateful

You know that I'm grateful
You know that I care
No time for the wrong ones
I'll always be there
Grateful
Woah (Grateful, grateful, grateful)
I'm grateful, oh yeah (Grateful, grateful)
Oh, I'm grateful, yeah
