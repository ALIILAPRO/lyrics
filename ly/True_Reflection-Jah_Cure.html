		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dah da da da dah die
Dah da da da dah die


Behind these prison walls
Doing my paces, doing my time
Spending my restless nights
Visioning faces, oh they are crying, crying
Prison a no bed a roses
The levity it makes mi bawl
I wish that Jah could come and take us back in time

[Chorus:]
Cause I swear that I can be a better man
Yes I swear if only you could understand
The faith in me shall set me free reflection
The faith in me shall set me free reflection

Dah da da da da dah die


Behind these metal bars
To Jah Jah I'm chanting
I pray for love devine
I'm oh so sorry a man
Deeply I'm hurting
The price ordained to be mine
Impossible to see the changes that I have made in my life
All they see is just the boy I left behind

[Chorus:]


Dah da da da da dah die


Don't judge me wrong
Cause now I'm stronger than I was before
I was young and unwise
Didn't you hear my cry
Impossible to see the changes that I made in my life
All they see is just the boy I left behind

[Chorus:]
Cause I swear I can be a better man
I swear if only you could understand
I swear I can be a better man
And I swear I swear
The faith in me shall set me free reflection
The faith in me shall set me free
The faith in me shall set me free

Mmmmm mmmmmm
The faith shall set me free
Set me free free yeah
Freeee .
