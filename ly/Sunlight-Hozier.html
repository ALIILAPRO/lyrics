		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night for
Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
But whose heart would not take flight
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

I had been lost to you, sunlight
Flew like a moth to you, sunlight oh sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight (sunlight, sunlight)
But it is sunlight

All the tales the same
Told before and told again
A soul that's born in cold and rain knows
Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
At last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain, oh my
Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was something foreknown to me, sunlight oh sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight (sunlight, sunlight)
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight (sunlight, sunlight)
But it is sunlight, sunlight

All these colors fade for you
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colors fade for you
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight

Each day you'd rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad happily
With wax melted, I'd meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight (sunlight, sunlight)
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight (sunlight, sunlight)
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight (sunlight, sunlight)
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight (sunlight, sunlight)
But it is sunlight

Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
