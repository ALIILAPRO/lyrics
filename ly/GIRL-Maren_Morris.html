		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

What you feel is natural (natural)
You don't gotta put up with this anymore (anymore)
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (oh)
Tell me, what you waitin' for?

Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, don't lose your halo
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, oh

Girl, don't you stop your cryin'
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl, won't you stop your cryin'? (Won't you stop your cryin'?)
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay (everything's gonna be okay)
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay (everyone's gonna be okay)
Baby girl

Everyone's gonna okay, baby
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo
