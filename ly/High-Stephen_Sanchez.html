		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull you underneath the slumber
Into the light before the thunder
Tell me, is there any wonder about where we stand?
Little Honey, in the summer
Fell in love with Hunter
Oh, I can't have it

I'm gonna get you so high
It's gonna send you reeling
Baby, gonna feel it
Baby, gonna feel it
Gonna go down all night
It's gonna get you kneeling
Baby, can you feel this?
I'm gonna make you feel this
I'm gonna get you so high

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I couldn't let go of the sonnet
Look how out of hand it's gotten
Is it wrong for me to want this?
Well, baby, all I do is want it
And if I knew that I could have you
Don't you know that I'd be glad to show it?

I'm gonna get you so high
It's gonna send you reeling
Baby, gonna feel it
Baby, gonna feel it
Gonna go down all night
It's gonna get you kneeling
Baby, can you feel this?
I'm gonna make you feel this
I'm gonna get you so high

Ooh-ooh, ooh

I'm gonna get you so high
It's gonna send you reeling
Baby, gonna feel it
Baby, gonna feel it
Gonna go down all night
It's gonna get you kneeling
Baby, can you feel it?
I'm gonna get you so high
