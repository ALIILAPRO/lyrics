		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is that a voice calling me softly?
Nothing in here is quite how it seems
Is that a whispers touch on my fear?
Am I awake or lost in old dreams?

Everything's so cold
The air is so still
There should be nothing here to see
Is this a warning?
Like in the black book
There can be no one else but me

I see a darker shade of darkness
I hear a shadow hide in the light
I feel a suffocating tension
Within a terrible desire

Everything's so cold
The air is so still
There should be nothing here to fear
But I am breathing
A child's laughter
Can any part of this be real?

Everything I work for
Everything I long for is always just too far
Everything I hope for never comes to be
Everything I bleed for burns a scar on me
Everything I fight for leaves a bitter taste
Everything I cry for laughs into my face
Everything I scream for barely knows my name
Everything I'd die for will die just the same
In here, with me

Is this the truth of your forgiveness?
Are you the stranger stood at my door?
Are you the end of things come calling?
Are you the answer that I've wished for?

Everything's so cold, the air is so still
And there is nothing here but me
If I belong here, and this is mercy
Then there is no place I'd rather be

Everything I worked for
Everything I longed for was always just too far
Everything I hoped for never came to be
Everything I bled for burned a scar on me
Everything I fought for left a bitter taste
Everything I cried for laughed into my face
Everything I screamed for barely knew my name
Everything I died for died just the same
In here, with me
