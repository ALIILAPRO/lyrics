		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a circle on a paper
High, a planet in the sky
From the dust which will not settle
Hours is the time you lie

Trace your finger in the cluster,
Found the cause which is called must
Remember now that you are nothing,
Though others say that you must suss,
You must suss
You must suss
You must suss
You must suss
You must suss
You must suss
You must suss
You must suss
You must suss...
