		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, mm hmm, listen

When I was up
You would always come around
But when I needed a friend
Oh, you could never be found

I got a hole where
My heart used to be
I wouldn't treat a dog, no, no
The way you treated me

When time was good, Lord
All your loving was the same
But when the going got rough
You hardly knew my name

You locked me up and
You threw away the key
I wouldn't treat a dog, oh my Lord
The way you treated me

Got me crying for
A love that I needed
Begging like a dog for a bone

Although I spent all
Of my time pleading
You turned your back
And you leave me

One of these old days
Lord knows, and it's true
Just when you need me the most
I'll walk right out on you

And you'll say as you're
Begging down on your knees
Bobby, I wouldn't treat a dog
No, no, no, the way you treated me
The way you treated me

I wouldn't treat a dog, no, no
I wouldn't do it to you
I wouldn't treat a dog, no, Lord
The way you treated me

Oh, I wouldn't do it
I couldn't do it
