		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make money mage
While I sharpen my blades
Skin seeing veins I was born in the caves
I seen the skeleton digging up graves
I think the reaper remembered my face
Scream oh my gosh
While she take off her top
Latex her boots while she licking me off
Tell me she goth and she loves all my songs
Stir up my cauldron and drink till I'm off
Hit them up slow
Rub her she whispers and moan
She wants to straddle my bones
Wants to call on my phone
Cuz' I'm getting this money and selling out shows
I just been drifting days
I want a piece of the reigns
Demons want money and riches and fame
Go sell your soul for the same
I see your energy watching you change
Florida boy south see him run up his house
Think I'm a threat got some grills in my mouth
Pull up that bank two accounts
I'm just burning this money
Make more than I count
In my sleep I make pounds
No I wont look at you fake
Pussy boy make mistakes
Your opinion is lame
Got no more I can say
Let it bang let it spray
To the walls let it graze
Bullet fuck up your day
Make money mage
While I sharpen my blades
Skin seeing veins I was born in the caves
I seen the skeleton digging up graves
I think the reaper remembered my face
Make money mage
While I sharpen my blades
Skin seeing veins I was born in the caves
I seen the skeleton digging up graves
I think the reaper remembered my face
