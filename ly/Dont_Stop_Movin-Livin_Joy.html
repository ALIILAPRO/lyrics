		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Oh yeah...
You've got to
Oh yeah
Oh yeah... 
You've got to get it right

You can do anything that you want to do
With your mind body and soul
Do it, prove it to yourself and say
I want (I want)
I will (I will)

I can do anything
It's a difficult world and you have to prove
That you're ready and you can do it
Nothing in this world can stop you
I know I can I will forfill my dreams

Don't stop movin'
Keep it up
Keep on movin' get it right
Yeah you've got to get it right

Oh yeah oh
Don't stop movin' 
I it's your life
Keep on movin' get it right
Yeah you've got to get it right

You can be mystical magical
Physically phenomenal
Good to go
Not slow
Feel the heat and let it flow

You've got to get it right.
