		  Summer too hot

I blew it all on her, I get it right back
She put it all on me, I couldn't pipe that
She love when I pull on it when it's tied back
You know it's hard to get up out it, I get sidetracked
Shake something, left, right, control it
You know who to call if you're horny
Ride on it, greenlight me (greenlight, greenlight)

Why'd you tell your friends that you really don't dance? (Don't dance)
But I know that you can
Fuckin' up your plans, we about to get nasty
Better hold up them glasses

Summer too hot not to fuck it up
Is the mood right? Is it wet enough?
I gotta a new ride, guess I leveled up
Let me wet it up just a few times
Summer too hot, had to double up
Shawty too fire with the bubble butt
We should both slide on the regular
Summer too hot, it's irregular

Shawty she discreet
She don't want her business in the street
Be my little secret
Baby, be my little freak
Oh, we can on a weekend
Do somethin' different, got my attention
Eight figures, fuckin' with a rich nigga
Big picture, more than just a night with you
Don't switch up, girl, when the lights hit ya
Them diamonds gon' dance (oh, yeah)

Why'd you tell your friends that you really don't dance? (Really don't dance)
But I know that you can (I know you can)
Fuckin' up your plans, we about to get nasty
Better hold up them glasses (oh, girl, baby)

Summer too hot not to fuck it up
Is the mood right? Is it wet enough?
I got a new ride, guess I leveled up (baby)
Let me wet it up just a few times (too)
Summer too hot, had to double up (too)
Shawty too fire with the bubble butt (girl, we should both)
We should both slide on the regular (yeah)
Summer too hot, it's irregular

I wanna get this rocket off the ground, babe
You're so beautiful, it's hard to behave
I can't start this fire without your flame
And I know you feel the same
Come on, take that shit off

Summer too hot not to fuck it up (oh)
Is the mood right? Is it wet enough? (wet enough)
I got a new ride, guess I leveled up
Let me wet it up just a few times
Summer too hot, had to double up
Shawty too fire with the bubble butt (girl, we should both slide)
We should both slide on the regular
Summer too hot, it's irregular (summer, summer way too hot)

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Summer too hot, oh
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Summer too hot
