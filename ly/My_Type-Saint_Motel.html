		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And take a look around the room
Love comes wearing disguises
How to go about and choose?
Break it down by shapes and sizes
I'm a man who's got very specific taste

You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type

When there's loving in the air
Don't fight it, just keep breathing
I can't help myself but stare
Double check for double meanings
I'm a man who's got very specific taste

You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type

You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
