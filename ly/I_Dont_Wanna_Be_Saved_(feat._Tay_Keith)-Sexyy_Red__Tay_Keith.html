		  (Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
I don't wanna be saved, bitch
I don't wanna be saved

Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I ain't tryna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved (bitch)

It's your girl Sexyy Red, don't trust me, 'cause I ain't shit
Don't try to post me on your 'Gram, niggas weird and sneakin' pics (weirdo)
Keep our business on the low, you run your mouth just like a bitch (lame ass)
I play ball, I ain't no lame, whatever you on, shit, I'm with it (on foenem)
Put your trust in that man, goofy ho, you's a sucker (goofy)
I got love for my nigga, that don't mean that I'ma trust him
Went through my baby daddy phone, that lil' sneaky motherfucker (bitch)
That's why I do whatever I want, I don't care if they was brothers (so?)
You thought your boyfriend was faithful, but he fuckin' all the hoes (wrong)
Homegirl, don't be surprised, get your lick back, he won't know
To ever think that he was faithful, I'm convinced that you just slow (dummy)
One thing you gotta know for sure is all these niggas gon' go (Sexyy)

Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I ain't tryna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved (bitch)
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I ain't tryna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved (bitch)

If you lookin' for Big Sexyy, you can find me on the block (Northside)
Ain't no nigga up on me 'cause I'm cheatin' off the top (on God)
My favorite motto fuck these hoes, buy some clothes, and get some guap (cash)
Got my heart broke at sixteen, that shit turned me to a thot
Me and you, we hella different, I'm a player, ho, you weak (bitch, you weak)
You fell in love with that nigga, whole time, that be my freak (freak ass)
We be flippin' all these niggas, he my flavor of the week (yup)
I ain't gotta do too much, he gettin' groovy off the weed

Don't trust me, I'ma break your fuckin' heart
Dog-ass bitch, I keep it real from the start
It's a mind game, you gotta play this shit smart
I just keep it cool, I don't overstep my part

Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I ain't tryna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved (bitch)
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save me, I ain't tryna be saved
Don't save me, I don't wanna be saved (bitch)

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
