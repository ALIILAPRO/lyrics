		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sure you had it right
Down in that foggy wood
We're turning ashes into gold here
Don't you go and get annoyed

With the mercury risin'
The fire just started
Now you wanna switch the song
Well, we don't have to get along

It's hard to sing it
Looking down on mirrors
I see it playin' back again
With little pieces of the boy
I'm out of pocket, non-co-operator
Hold that thought for a minute

You just want me to jump both feet down
Into the bottom of the river with you
It's not a question you can answer
And the second you believe it, it's true

I guess you got bargained down
By the time I saw you it was clear
Did you let it out at all?
Did you let it out at all?

You want me to jump both feet down
Into the bottom of the river with you
It's not a question you can answer
And the second you believe it, it's true

I'm already gone
But I'm looking forward to singing along
I'm already gone
But I'm looking forward to singing along

An open silence held in vain

Both feet down into the bottom of the river with you
It's not a question you can answer
And the second you believe it, it's true

You want me to jump both feet down
Into the bottom of the river with you
It's not a question you can answer
And the second you believe it, it's true
