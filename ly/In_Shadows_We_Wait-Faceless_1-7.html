		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cigarettes and heat
i got what they need
drop it like it beef
rollin out the quey
turn into to a beast
living through my beats
vilfify my dreams
they can't find a lie to peice
past their shit i see
cola with the ice
bodies left to freeze
roll up lookin nice
poisoned chemically
choice apothecry
nevered wanted light
lines are all i need

mm killa
coming back
i gone make it raw
hunnids stack
mm killa
gone attack
silent in the car
gun it rack

homless left to scrap
for days they never had
doulbe dice
heavy dash
till consious
on the dash

i been
roaming
wanna spazz
two shots into
my past
those rocks
i got attatched
intoxed they talkin bad
yuh

you see me
you see me
i know what the truth is
all you spit is useless

yea you see
you see me
how i hold them clueless
biting but they tootheless

i just slide through the wastes that i find
hear it coming like a fire
ash an ember on my eyes aye

i just climb through the days so divine
killa feeding on they hide
know my death is they design

i just slide through the waste that i find
i'll be hunting with the dire
while they enter on a dime aye

i don't mind passing bodies passing time
i'ma devil i'ma die
i'ma fill up on the rise aye
