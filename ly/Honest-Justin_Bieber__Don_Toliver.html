		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
Honest (honest)
You're modest, I like it (I like it)
You stay down and you the baddest (baddest)
Find you in the cut, I copped it (I copped it)
Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (with me from jump)
It's twenty-three when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that's your song (and that's your song)

Off top, you the sun in my morning (in my morning)
I tried to get away, but it's boring (but it's boring)
You're my safe haven I needed all along (all along)
And you're my dime piece
And I can't take less than one (less than, you the)
You the (whew, yeah, yeah)
You the one (you the one)
Trinity, you like three in one (three in one)
Ratio, ten to one (ten to one)
You get spicy (you get spicy)
I like that cajun on you (yeah)
On occasion, that's your testimony (that's your testimony)
I like that hazel on you (like that hazel on you)
I look straight in your eyes, holy matrimony (yeah)

Honest (honest)
You're modest, I like it (I like it)
You stay down and you the baddest (baddest)
Find you in the cut, I copped it (I copped it, yeah)
Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (with me from jump)
It's twenty-three when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that's your song (and that's your song)

Yeah, honest (honest)
Spicy, I like it (yeah)
FaceTime me the weed, I just might buy it
Throw it back on the couch, I just might try
Ooh, spicy (yeah, yeah)
Damn that booty thick, I like it (yeah)
Hey, Justin B (yeah)
I know you don't do this often
But this here sneak and geek (sneak)
Fuck that McLaren
I'm ridin' the Jeep (yeah)
I got in the club with all of my thugs
I'm packing that Pistol Pete (yeah, yeah) 
Better watch your mouth
Gotta pick a side before you jump and leap (leap)
I was sellin' the nickels and dimes and dubs
But crack in my sock, it ain't me
But, baby, I like it (I like it)
I'ma pull that double-R to your crib just for once
It's twenty-three when you get dunked (twenty-three when you get dunked)
Me and JB, we smokin' skunk (ooh)

Honest (honest)
You're modest, I like it (I like it)
You stay down and you the baddest (baddest)
Find you in the cut, I copped it (I copped it, yeah)
Honest (honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (with me from jump)
It's twenty-three when you get dunked on (splash)
I put it in and that's your song (and that's your song, hmm)

Ooh, honest
