		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
Jump in the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
You don't wanna [?]
You don't wanna [?]

Smokin' it back to back, uh
Fuck all your platinum plaques, uh
I don't see nothing, boy, fuck a discussion
I'm creepin' up through the back, uhh
Coke white skin (Skin)
Buggy eyed Benz (Benz)
I don't want your bitch but I bet she gon' fuck my friends
Amen
Check mate
Take your life then I skate
'Sean O'Haire' with that iced neck, looking like a ring (Ring)
Live in effect ('fect)
Fuck around and get wrecked (Wrecked)
When she see a skull, all she think about is SESH (What)
Skeleton gang (Gang)
Death up on my brain (Brain)
If you in my range, I'ma bang, that's a stain
I'ma boogie to the left, I'ma groove to the right
Monster mash on the gas, green light, outta sight
Baby, it's my party, I'ma die if I want, bitch
Action when I'm yellin', read the script and play your part bitch
Somewhere in the dark bitch, dwellin', just a carcass
Headstone, here lies Bones, the prince of darkness

In the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
Jump in the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
You don't wanna [?]
You don't wanna [?]
