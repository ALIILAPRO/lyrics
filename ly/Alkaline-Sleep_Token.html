		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every once in a while something changes
And she's changing me
It's too late for me now, I am altered
There is something beneath

She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The objects of my desire

Ooh, let's talk about chemistry
'Cause I'm dying to melt through
To the heart of her molecules
'Til the particles part like holy water
If anything, she's an undiscovered element
Either born in hell or heaven-sent
But either way I'm into it

She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The objects of my desire

Not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The objects of my desire
