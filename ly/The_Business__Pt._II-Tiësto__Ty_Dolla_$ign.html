		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

Let's get down to business
Girl, you've been on my wish list
Way more than bad, you're vicious
Pussy clean, delicious
Won't doubt it, I know you 'bout it
Bottega, she like my outfit
Broke boy, no, can't be around it
When there's big business, I hit my accountant

Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
It's been a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

Shorty get down, yeah, she don't play up
She don't downgrade, better get your weight up
How I last this long, stay prayed up
Now she chiefing with a Taylor, she wanna blaze up
Made a hundred mill', I couldn't keep my grades up
Upgrade my bitch, still I never change up
Upgrade my whips and my crib and my key
Let's just get down to this business, you dig?

Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
It's been a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, down, down to business

Dreams we had don't ever fall away
But we can't live 'em if we stay the same
I can't do this for another day
So let's get down, let's get down to business

Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Ooh, yeah, let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
It's been a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

Ooh, yeah, yeah
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
