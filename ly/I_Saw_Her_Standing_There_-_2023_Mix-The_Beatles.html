		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
Ooh, when I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Ooh, when I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went, "Boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went, "Boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
