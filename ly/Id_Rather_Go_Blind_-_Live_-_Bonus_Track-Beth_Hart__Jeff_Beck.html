		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something told me that it was over, baby, yeah
When I saw you, when I saw you and that girl
And y'all was talking
 
Something deep down
Something deep down in my soul said, "Go on, go on and cry girl"
When I saw you, when I saw you with that same person
And y'all was walking around
 
And I'd rather, I'd rather be a blind, girl 
Baby, yeah, yeah
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me 
Baby, don't leave me, I don't wanna see you go
 
'Cause you see I love you so much
And I don't wanna watch you leave me
Don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
And another thing is, one more thing is
I just don't, I just don't wanna be free
Scared to be by myself
 
I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
About your sweet kiss and your, your warm embrace
Hmm your warm embrace, hmm your warm, warm embrace
 
When I look down in the glass that I held to my lips
And I saw the reflection of the tears rolling down my face
That's when I knew I love you and I couldn't do without you
And I'd rather be a blind, girl
 
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babe, no babe, oh, oh
Oh babe, all day sitting up
Sitting up thinking about you
 
Myself, I don't wanna see you leave
Please don't go, oh babe, no babe, oh babe
I'd rather be a blind, girl
 
Something told me that it was over, baby
When I saw you, when I saw you and that girl
And y'all was talking
 
Something deep down in my soul said, "Go on, go on and cry girl"
When I saw you, when I saw you and that girl
And y'all was walking by
 
And I'd rather go blind, I'd rather go blind
I'd rather go blind, babe
Than to see you walk away, walk away
Don't walk away
'Cause I'd rather go blind
