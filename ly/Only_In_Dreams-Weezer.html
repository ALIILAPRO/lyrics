		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't resist her
She's in your bones
She's in your marrow
And your ride home
You can't avoid her
She's in the air (in the air)
In between molecules
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams

You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, "hey baby
I just might take the chance"
You say "it's a good thing
That you float in the air
That way there's no way
I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces"

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams

Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
