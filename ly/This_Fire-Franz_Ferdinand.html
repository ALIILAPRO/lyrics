		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes boring a way through me
Paralyze, controlling completely
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're gonna to burn it, I'll burn it, I, I, I'll burn it down

Eyes burning the way through me
Overwhelm, destroying so sweetly
Now there is a fire within me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
Then I'm, I'm out of control and I burn

Oh, how I burn for you
Burn, oh, how I burn for you
Burn, how I burn
How I burn, oh, how I

This fire is out of control
I'm gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're gonna to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're gonna to burn it, I'll burn it, I, I, I'll burn it down
