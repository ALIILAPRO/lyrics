		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me burning, let the morning away
I like the vibe that you showing my way

You make me burning, let the morning away
I like the vibe that you showing my way

I know that you not afraid of the truth girl
I know you wan them for show what to do

Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right in to it and we do it alright,
People singing, people dance until the sunlight
Yes we gonna do it all night

Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right in to it and we do it alright,
People singing, people dance until the sunlight
Yes we gonna do it all night

Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right in to it and we do it alright,
People singing, people dance until the sunlight
Yes we gonna do it all night

My head is spinning, going round and round
The way your body movin' way in on down
So i'm running baby, running to you
Come show me what you do

Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right in to it and we do it alright,
People singing, people dance until the sunlight
Yes we gonna do it all night

Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right in to it and we do it alright,
People singing, people dance until the sunlight
Yes we gonna do it all night

Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right in to it and we do it alright,
People singing, people dance until the sunlight
Yes we gonna do it all night
