		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the waves
On your way, on your way
To go with me
Pina Colada in your hand
Lets be free
Feel you in the breeze
The wind in your hair
Take a walk, with me
Lets be free

Chasing the summer
Can you feel the breeze?
In your hair
And the sand on your toes
Be free, be free

Chasing the summer
Wind in your hair
Take a walk with me
Sand in your toes

Don't you worry now
Chasing the summer
Can you feel the birds, wind in your hair
Sun in your face, sun in your face

Chasing the summer
Don't you worry now
Don't rush
Chasing the summer
Don't you worry now

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah

Don't you worry now
Chasing the summer

Chasing the summer
