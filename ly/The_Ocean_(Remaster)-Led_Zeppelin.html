		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball, uh uh, uh uh, yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, I play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing about the good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way

I don't know, oh oh, yeah'

Ooh, yeah

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing about the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah!

It sure is fine!
Ah blow my mind!
When the tears are goin' down! 
Yeah! Yeah, yeah

Oh so, oh so, oh so good!
Oh so good!
