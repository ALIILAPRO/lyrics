		<p>
		  Once more (ooh, ooh)

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted

Repeat the cycle everyday, I gotta start with a drink
My life been getting sorta crazy, and I don't wanna think
I look myself right in the mirror and I don't even blink
Then I get angry, take the rest and pour it right in the sink
I know where this road goes
Alcohol ain't my friend but I keep drinking 'cause these demons roam
And follow me round everywhere I go
It clouds my mind and soul, it turns my heart cold
But I keep drinking 'cause it makes me feel like I'm not alone
I'm having problems, my pride won't let me reach out
Looking at this bottle having nothing but doubt
Don't wanna drink but it keeps coming around and around and around

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted

I know I needa quit (I needa quit)
I gotta do better (I gotta do better)
Example to these kids (example to these kids)
'Cause they're watching when I'm there
But I'm scared (scared)
'Cause I been chasing the man that I am when I start to drink
He's cocky, confident man, he don't give a damn what you think
This world is beating me down, and it's pushed me right to the brink
I take a shot every time because man, it helps me escape
I'm taking care of these people but no one takes care of me
I wanna talk to somebody but I feel no one relates
I need better now
I think I've lost my way
I'm having battles with faith, it's painted right on my face
I hope better times are coming, no chase but I'm still running
I gotta take control, and I won't stop for nothing
Dear god this is my test, promise that I do my best
Just help with this pain I feel, and pressure that is on my chest

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize (recognize-ize-ize)
I got wasted

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinking 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
