		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord, I’m so tired in this fight
 Tired of waking up with no end in sight
 I feel I’ve got so little left
 I know that I’ve come to the end of myself
 
 Help me hold on
 Cling to You till I see the sun
 
 Held by Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re lifting my heart as I lift my hands
 Safe in Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re healing my heart as I lift my hands
 
 Water the garden of my life
 With every sorrow, every tear that I’ve cried
 Redeem this winter for Your good
 Lord, show Your power as only You could
 
 Help me hold on
 I’ll cling to You till I see the sun
 
 Held by Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re lifting my heart as I lift my hands
 Safe in Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re healing my heart as I lift my hands
 
 Even in the darkness
 Even when it’s hardest
 You are faithful and You bring the dawn
 On every mountain
 I’ll sing it even louder
 You are faithful and You bring the dawn
 
 Even in the darkness
 Even when it’s hardest
 You are faithful and You bring the dawn
 On every mountain
 I’ll sing it even louder
 You are faithful and You bring the dawn
 
 Held by Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re lifting my heart as I lift my hands
 Safe in Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re healing my heart as I lift my hands
 
 Held by Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re lifting my heart as I lift my hands
 Safe in Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re healing my heart as I lift my hands
 
 Held by Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re lifting my heart as I lift my hands
 Safe in Your love
 I sing alleluia
 You’re healing my heart as I lift my hands
