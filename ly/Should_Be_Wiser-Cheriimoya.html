		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should be wiser
I should be wiser
Should be wiser
I should be wiser by now
Stressin‘ over bullshit I‘m stressed out
In me there’s a void that I try to avoid
In me there’s a piece that has been destroyed
I should be wiser by now
Stressin‘ over bullshit I‘m stressed out
In me there’s a void that I try to avoid
In me there’s a piece that has been destroyed
The viciousness of others should have softened my heart
But I feel bitter instead
I guess I’m not that smart
Over the years I’ve closed my heart
Oh I should have silenced my ego and my pride and continued to be kind
Even if I felt played and blamed and misunderstood
played and blamed and misunderstood
I should be wiser by now
Stressin‘ over bullshit I‘m stressed out
In me there’s a void that I try to avoid
In me there’s a piece that has been destroyed
I should be wiser by now
Stressin‘ over bullshit I‘m stressed out
In me there’s a void that I try to avoid
In me there’s a piece that has been destroyed
Should be wiser
I should be wiser
Should be wiser
Damn I should be wiser
