		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your middle fingers up
Take a shot, throw it up and don't stop
I'm, I'm, I'm living that life on the dark side

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Every psycho in the scene
Hands up and follow me saying (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Empire of the freaks, all drinks on me

Just another night in my pitch black paradise
Don't wanna cry, so I gotta get paralyzed
My body is my weapon, so I keep it loaded
'Til I'm all over the place like my head exploded
Don't waste your prayers, they can't save us
Lifestyles of the sick and dangerous

Put your middle fingers up
Take a shot, throw it up and don't stop
I'm, I'm, I'm living that life on the dark side
Like the 27 Club, headshot
We don't wanna grow up
I'm, I'm, I'm living that life on the dark side
Life on the dark side

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Every psycho in the scene
Hands up and follow me saying (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Empire of the freaks, all drinks on me

I'm in a cave of man-made misery
Digging a grave for myself and my enemies
Of all the dark things that keep me wasted
You're the sweetest I've ever tasted

Put your middle fingers up
Take a shot, throw it up and don't stop
I'm, I'm, I'm living that life on the dark side
Like the 27 Club, headshot
We don't wanna grow up
I'm, I'm, I'm living that life on the dark side
Life on the dark side

Just another night in my pitch black paradise
Don't wanna cry, so I gotta get paralyzed
Don't waste your prayers, they can't save us
Lifestyles of the sick and dangerous

Put your middle fingers up
Take a shot, throw it up and don't stop
I'm, I'm, I'm living that life on the dark side
Like the 27 Club, headshot
We don't wanna grow up
I'm, I'm, I'm living that life on the dark side
Life on the dark side

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Every psycho in the scene
Hands up and follow me saying (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Empire of the freaks, all drinks on me
