		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I toss and turn when I sleep at night
Too many things on my mind I can't change and I see
Shadows on the walls of the cave tonight
Gimme fire, help me rewire my primitive mind

Seems like the blind is leading the blind
Help me to revive
Quiet these voices that dim my eyes

Put a light on me
Anything to make me believe
That it's not so dark in the deep of my heart
Oh, will you put a light on me? Yeah
Put a light on me
Anything to make me believe
That it's not so dark in the deep of my heart
Oh, will you put a light on me-e-e? Yeah

Do I believe in the things I do? (Alright)
Am I the driver or passenger sitting next to you?
Don't think that I wanna know the truth
Just let this fire burn higher up in the back of my mind

Seems like the blind is leading the blind
Help me to revive
Quiet these voices that dim my eyes

Put a light on me
Anything to make me believe
That it's not so dark in the deep of my heart
Oh, will you put a light on me? Ooh
Put a light on me (oh-oh ooh)
Anything to make me believe (oh-oh ooh)
That it's not so dark in the deep of my heart (oh-oh ooh)
Oh, will you put a light on me-e-e? Yeah (oh-oh ooh)

Ooh yeah, alright (oh-oh ooh)
Ooh yeah, alright (oh-oh ooh)
Ooh yeah, alright (oh-oh ooh)
Ooh yeah (oh-oh ooh)

Put a light on me
Anything to make me believe
That it's not so dark in the deep of my heart
Oh, will you put a light on me? Ooh
Put a light on me (oh-oh ooh)
Anything to make me believe (oh-oh ooh)
That it's not so dark in the deep of my heart (oh-oh ooh)
Oh, will you put a light on me? (oh-oh ooh)

Put a light on me, yeah (put a light on me)
Anything to make me believe (yeah)
That it's not so dark in the deep of my heart (not so dark, not so dark)
Oh, will you put a light on me? Yeah
