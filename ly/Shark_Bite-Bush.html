		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been such a long time
Nice to meet you again
Eyes stared in the mirror
Saw my instinct again
And my body was empty
Like my feelings were gone
You took all my fingers
And got me all wrong

Take me down to the water
Where the sun shines blue
Take me down to the water
I wanna climb inside of you

These are the days for the rest of our lives
We are the ghosts 'cause we have survived
Engine's on, sharp like a samurai
I want you, I know your shark bite

The earth is a madhouse
This planet's so screwed
It warms like a fire
And the forests we lose
I'm a slave to your bible
Kiss like infinite night
Never knew I was missing
My love, you are a shark bite

Take me down to the water
Where the sun shines blue
Take me down to the water
I wanna climb inside of you

These are the days for the rest of our lives
We are the ghosts 'cause we have survived
Engine's on, sharp like a samurai
I want you, I know your shark bite

We are the freaks, it's so warm inside
We are the freaks, it's a beautiful life
We are the freaks, we are ten thousand lights
We are the freaks, we are the freaks, we are the freaks

No regret, because I wanna do
No regret, because I wanna do
No regret, because I wanna do
No regret

These are the days for the rest of our lives
We are the ghosts 'cause we have survived
Engine's on, sharp like a samurai
I want you, I know your shark bite
I want you, I know your shark bite

We are the freaks, it's so warm inside
We are the freaks, it's a beautiful life
We are the freaks, we are ten thousand lights
We are the freaks, we are the freaks, we are the freaks
