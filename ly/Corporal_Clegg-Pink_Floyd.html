		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg 
He won it in the war, in 1944
Corporal Clegg had a medal too 
In orange, red, and blue 
He found it in the zoo

Dear, dear, were they really sad for me? 
Dear, dear, will they really laugh at me? 

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin

Corporal Clegg, umbrella in the rain 
He's never been the same 
No one is to blame 
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream 
From Her Majesty the queen 
His boots were very clean

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him 
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin
