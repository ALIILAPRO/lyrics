		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day-day in the life
Let's see if you really trap
Turn off the autotune
Let's hear how you really rap, haha
Send a, send a location
Come burn a boy if you're bad, let's see
Your dad left home from young
And you ain't done shit for your mom, aw man, aw man
How are you relying on man like gyal? You're mad
You mussa mad
You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag
Can't keep track, been in the trap
It's hard, I can't keep up (keep up)
Selling them party drugs
I'm the one that got the party turnt

Everyone say they T (they T)
Fascinated by the trap
I might put the bando on Airbnb (B)
Leave me a good review, next time you come
Get some get one for free (who's that?)
Who's that with her hair on fleek?
She made me beat my horn, it's peak
I try stay low in the Jeep, low-key (discrete)
The Feds ain't dumb, they know wah gwan
But the young G's too na√Øve
Little bro got nicked two times this week
Freedom's priceless, not cheap
Fu-fuck you, pay me
Got a booking fee plus V-A-T (V-A-T)
R.I.P. A1, it's sad that he didn't see eighteen

Day-day in the life
Let's see if you really trap
Turn off the autotune
Let's hear how you really rap, haha
Send a, send a location
Come burn a boy if you're bad, let's see
Your dad left home from young
And you ain't done shit for your mom, aw man, aw man
How are you relying on man like gyal? You're mad
You mussa mad
You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag
Can't keep track, been in the trap
It's hard, I can't keep up (keep up)
Selling them party drugs
I'm the one that got the party turnt

Bro-bro said I'm going all dumb
I won't leave that trap alone
Come like I'm young in love
Got a toxic relationship with Stacey
But she won't cut me off
Can't be breaking even no more
Brodie, I must see prof'
(Came to the) came to the bando healthy
Left with a dusty cough
Lo-lo-loving the goldish rose
Like the England rugby top
These bitches lie, relationship advice
Don't trust these thots
Everyone talk gun 'pon beat
But inna real life, no gun beat off (hahaha)
Keep the convo brief, say no more my G
Don't you know that talk is cheap?
Like my gyaldem short and sweet
Wah you mean, wah you mean, can you sit on my face?
She listens to too much DBE
Everyone got PTSD, how come now everyone sip on lean?
Don't you know that I grind two fours?
I'm on 24's like Christmas Eve
Bro why you act surprise?
I told you this and you didn't believe
Can deal with the trap being dirty
Can't deal with the dirty D's
If the yard I'm in gets spun
I won't come home 'til I'm thirty three

Day-day in the life
Let's see if you really trap
Turn off the autotune
Let's hear how you really rap, haha
Send a, send a location
Come burn a boy if you're bad, let's see
Your dad left home from young
And you ain't done shit for your mom, aw man, aw man
How are you relying on man like gyal? You're mad
You mussa mad
You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag
Can't keep track, been in the trap
It's hard, I can't keep up (keep up)
Selling them party drugs
I'm the one that got the party turnt

You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag
(You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack)
(Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag) (Frosty)
