		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  how to feel alive when you're not in love
how to take a joke when you've had enough
how to spend the night when you just lie awake
when the hands won't move
the night is gone but day won't break

I've been fighting
the writing on the wall
but no one said you would be ageless
no one promised you'd be famous
I've been fighting
the writing on the wall
but no one said you would be ageless
no one promised you'd be famous

how to see the light when the curtain's drawn
how to break a leg when you missed the call
how to spend the night when you just lie awake
when the hands won't move
the night is gone but day won't break

I've been fighting
the writing on the wall
but no one said you would be ageless
no one promised you'd be famous
I've been fighting
the writing on the wall
but no one said you would be ageless
no one promised you'd be famous

I've been here before
sitting by the riverbed
changing all the rules
until there was nothing left
I've been here before
sitting by the riverbed
changing all the rules
until there was nothing left

I've been fighting
the writing on the wall
but no one said you would be ageless
no one promised you'd be famous
I've been fighting
the writing on the wall
but no one said you would be ageless
no one promised you'd be famous
