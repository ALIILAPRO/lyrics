		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And we're at it again, I turn around another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'

Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood
Between the red and white and blue
But it's too deep for you to see 
And everyone eventually will take the step 
'Cause it's in sight you take the left I'll take the right 
I fell the hate you've built for me and I say pay attention baby)

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease

But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life in judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forgot
How to speak how to ask all the questions

The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do 
From on the outside looking in 
Your government is listenin' to push you on the story of immortal father 
Mortal son give them your mind 
And all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)

If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell 
And your future's a fuckin' disaster can't you see
Don't give them all the power 
When your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact 
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done 

With no place to hide and having no place to
Running away from condition
I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system

Most would claim I live a lie 
When pointing out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has its side
They live together vote 
But most won't read between these lines

Please help us, please save us 
Of course they have control, we're all the same
Up on the cross
Crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends

It won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder 'bout how you sold you mind
Body and soul
Looking at the fields so green 
I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow 
But decisions you have made will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact 
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide 
And having no place to run

You've fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dyin'
How it ends I'll never know
Just live you life blind like me
