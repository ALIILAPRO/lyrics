		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky, yeah
You must be famous
This is how you live your life, different city every night, yeah
You must be famous, famous

I'ma be on the TV mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say "Oh my God"
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
That's mind blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
You can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like "Thank God, fuck fame and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV mama

Welcome to your name in lights (woo!)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
You must be famous (yeah, oh my God I must be famous)
This is how you live your life (yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer, "don't let me make these bitches famous"
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twistin' life up when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives, ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself unless I ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass and I heard, "Can you look this way?
Can you look this way?"
Flash! I must be famous

Welcome to your name in lights (yeah!)
All the lighters in the sky (you must be famous)
You must be famous (I'ma be on the TV mama!)
This is how you live your life (yeah, yeah)
Different city every night (oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

You probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
You wish that I was in your shoes, I'd take them off 'cause life's a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we shine deep
You can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like "Thank God, fuck fame and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars gleam
I was your main man, 'til i went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV mama

Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (oh my God, I must be famous)
This is how you live your life
Different city every night (oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

I'ma be on the TV mama (famous)
Kiss my motherfuckin' ass
