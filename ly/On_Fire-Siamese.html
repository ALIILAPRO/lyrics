		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me was I led on? 
Like a bird in a cage
Did you dangle hope in front of me 
Did you know it wasn't meant to be

Cause you were so convincing
You stole all of my sympathy
I'm done with being what you need
Now everything is finally clear to me.

Look me in the eyes
And preach to the choir
Preach to the choir
Say all your goodbyes
Cause down to the wire
You're still a liar?
On fire

As I was being led on
Like a ship lost at sea
Please can you finally tell me
Now our colors start to freeze

Cause you were so convincing
You stole all of my sympathy
I'm done with being what you need
Now everything is finally clear to me.

Look me in the eyes
And preach to the choir
Preach to the choir
Say all your goodbyes
Cause down to the wire
You're still a liar?
On fire
