		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your hair's under my pillow, so I sleep (so I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (Nastylgia) (at-at my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe (believe, believe)
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me?

I hope a trap boy's your type (why?)
'Cause I don't have a nine-to-five (alright)
I get that your standard's high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (literally)
When I write my rhymes
You say you don't like that line, I'll switch it (calm)
You said you don't like my life
You said you don't like my guys, you're tripping (you're tripping)

I followed you
I followed you today, I was in my car (alright, alright)
I wanted to come see you from afar (at-at my feet)
If you turned around and saw me I would die
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me?

Bad one and she photogenic (alright)
Instagram got a lot of impressions (uh-huh, uh-huh)
She think I might cheat and I don't need love
But I need some thug affection (literally)
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
Man, I got 21 questions (like 50)
In the trap with the cats domestic
She doin' lashes, somethin' cosmetic
They shot their shot, she read it
They slid in her DM with somethin' generic (huh)
She don't even like going out
Got a new outfit but nowhere to wear it (alright)
She think that I'm being disloyal
When I'm in the street with a couple of killys
(You ain't gotta) You ain't gotta worry 'bout none of these hoes
I'm grown, I'm done with these bitches
(Done with these bitches, done with these bitches)

Your hair's under my pillow, so I sleep (so I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (at-at my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe (believe, believe)
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me?

I hope a trap boy's your type (why?)
'Cause I don't have a nine-to-five (alright)
I get that your standard's high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (literally)
When I write my rhymes
You say you don't like that line, I'll switch it (calm)
You said you don't like my life
You said you don't like my guys, you're tripping (you're tripping)

Trap boy's your type
'Cause I don't have a nine-to-five (do you wipe them just for me, me, me, me, me?)
I get that your standard's high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (I'm pleading on my knees, knees, knees, knees, knees)
When I write my rhymes
You say you don't like that line, I'll switch it (it's your touch that I need, need, need, need, need)
You said you don't like my life

When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for
