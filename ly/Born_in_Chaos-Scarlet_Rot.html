		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The fire grows!
As the wind screams through the house!
Ashes of memories pile on the soil!
The flames, a beautiful glow!
Beneath the treasures of my family's stone!

The floorboards crumble as chaos penetrates this home

Melting flesh, a bubbling sound you won't forget,
Your family's stench, an aroma you'll smell till death.

Slowly but surely the bodies become slimy,
Dripping off the bone, the flesh becomes one with the fire

The smoldering fragments of your loved ones
The flickering flames, the smoke of your memories

The flesh becomes one!
A bubbling sound you'll never forget.
The flesh becomes one with this home.
