		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes you wonder if we're ever looking back
At a picture of 2019
And saying, "That's the way, the world, it used to be
Before our dreams started bursting at the seams"

We're out here and we're ready
We're here and we're ready
To livestream the apocalypse
I don't care if it's pretty
The view's so pretty
From the deck of a sinking ship
Yeah, oh

'Cause everything is lit except my serotonin, yeah
Everything is lit but my lightning bolt brain
Everything is lit

But baby, please, I just need someone to hold me
Even though you don't even know me
Oh, I'm going neon in the night time

Oh, what a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive

They say that I should try meditation
But I don't want to be with my own thoughts (own thoughts)
It never felt that much like medication
And I just want to be your cherry on top

We're out here and we're ready
We're here and we're ready
To livestream the apocalypse
And I'm going on and on and on
Make me like a charm on your necklace
Oh, your necklace

Oh, 'cause everything is lit except my serotonin, yeah
Everything is lit but my lightning bolt brain
Everything is lit

But baby, please, I just need someone to hold me
Even though you don't even know me
Oh, I'm going neon in the night time

Oh, what a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive

What a time to be alive
To be alive

When, when, when I said, "Leave me alone"
This isn't quite what I meant
I got the quarantine blues
Bad news, what's left?
So it seems the vulture's getting too full to fly

Oh (oh), what a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive

What a time to be alive 
(What a time, what a time to be alive) what a time to be alive
(What a time, what a time to be alive) what a time to be alive
(What a time, what a time to be alive) what a time to be alive

Sometimes you wonder if we're ever looking back
