		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in a dead zone

Wait, I can still hear a heartbeat
Faint but now we're holding off the grim reap
Push, it's just a little too late
Do not, do not resuscitate

We keep kicking the can
We keep beating the man
We try and keep it alive
Are we calling for help?
We don't have any bars
Should we follow the stars?
Do you know where we are?

Everything around is dying
Tell me why we keep on trying (oh)
Living in a dead zone (oh)
Living in a dead zone
When I open up my eyes I
Wonder if it's for the last time (oh)
Living in a dead zone (oh)
I don't wanna go on living in a dead zone

(Clear), now we're following the flatline
Fear, once again we're on the dark side
Pray but it's a little too late
Give up before you suffocate

We can't give up the ghost
We can't leave it alone
We dig it out of the ground
It was never alive
Now the connection is lost
And the radio's dark
Do you know where we are?

Everything around is dying
Tell me why we keep on trying (oh)
Living in a dead zone (oh)
Living in a dead zone
When I open up my eyes I
Wonder if it's for the last time (oh)
Living in a dead zone (oh)
I don't wanna go on living in a dead zone

No sign of life
No sign of life (clear)
No sign of life (clear)
No sign of life

Everything around is dying
Tell me why we keep on trying

Everything around is dying
Tell me why we keep on trying (oh)
Living in a dead zone (oh)
Living in a dead zone
When I open up my eyes I
Wonder if it's for the last time (oh)
Living in a dead zone (oh)
I don't wanna go on living in a dead zone

Living in a dead zone
I don't wanna go on living in a dead zone
