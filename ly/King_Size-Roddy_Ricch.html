		  (Sonny goin' crazy)
Woo, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Sleep on a king size (uh-huh), wet like the springtime (uh-huh)
Colossal ring size (uh-huh), still rock the C-side (uh-huh)
Can never be broke, rather count money in the meantime (uh-huh)
That's not my ho, shit, I just fuck her in between time (uh-huh)
Go fully loaded, Maybach ridin' in my free time (woo)
I pour some soda every time I need some me-time
Go Nipsey blue, Louis Vuitton pants from Ita'
Southside, Northside, Westside, Eastside (it's Ricch)

Black Marni slides, all fur on my feet (fur on my feet)
My nigga drove, 'cause I was in the backseat, too deep (backseat too deep)
We talk expensive (yeah, yeah), Rollie face Tiffany (yeah, yeah) 
It's new condition, Richie, I'm infamous (yeah, yeah)
They never seen my vision, I was too ambitious (too ambitious)
Put stones in Christ's face, 'cause I knew Jesus listenin'
She ain't on gold diggin', but she can keep a pension
Over-possessive, but she like to be with bitches (hey)
Every time I see her gotta rat-tat-tat
Keep me some pistols that go bat-bat-bat-bat (bat-bat-bat-bat)
My cousin got rich off of crack-crack-crack
My lil' niggas got some ha-ha-ha-hats (yeah, yeah)
Check my wrist, my rings a check, check my earrings, that's a check
This the really rich effect, she wanna give the dick a peck
Birds slidin' in the 'Vette, I don't hide, I just vex
I just chased the whole bag, I take pride in my Nike Techs

Sleep on a king size (uh-huh), wet like the springtime (uh-huh)
Colossal ring size (uh-huh), still rock the C-side (uh-huh)
Can never be broke, rather count money in the meantime (uh-huh)
That's not my ho, shit, I just fuck her in between time (uh-huh)
Go fully loaded, Maybach ridin' in my free time (woo)
I pour some soda every time I need some me-time
Go Nipsey blue, Louis Vuitton pants from Ita'
Southside, Northside, Westside, Eastside (it's Ricch)

Ayy, Westside Vs, do it for the team
Hoppin' out, squeeze, 'til Double O free
I ride 'round with them babies, five-hundred on my chain
I got number one hits, but I can't go out, like Lil Zane
Hey, made this shit off pain
I pull up the V12s, I be slidin' in the rain
I got new bracelets, but I can't never change
Interior Spider-Man, I ride with Mary Jane
Still antisocial, I don't talk a lot
I drop the top, Roddy hot, biggest yacht
Grab a pot, serve a lot, I don't never fuck with SWAT
Outside, everyday, we on gangster, imitate
Yellow tape 'em, out of state, lot of Glocks, I don't fade

Sleep on a king size (uh-huh), wet like the springtime (uh-huh)
Colossal ring size (uh-huh), still rock the C-side (uh-huh)
Can never be broke, rather count money in the meantime (uh-huh)
That's not my ho, shit, I just fuck her in between time (uh-huh)
Go fully loaded, Maybach ridin' in my free time (woo)
I pour some soda every time I need some me-time
Go Nipsey blue, Louis Vuitton pants from Ita'
Southside, Northside, Westside, Eastside (it's Ricch)

Southside, Northside, Westside, Eastside
Southside, Northside, Westside, Eastside
