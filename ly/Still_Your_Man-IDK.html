		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's somethin' 'bout a woman that make you feel like you special
That's why all the love that's in your heart align at the right time
Your presence was just a vessel
And now all the presences is flooded bezels
I flawless the diamonds on precious metals
Those meddlin' kids be runnin' around the house for you is what I settled
You is where my heart beat stopped
It was plenty other women in line, I can't lie
And to tell the truth, most of 'em was fine
Huh, but I could see it in your eyes 
You a different type of vibe, you a different type of time
Huh, the small hands sittin' on 6 o'clock 
For the shit that I used to have but I'm never lookin' behind
I always look at here, but you always look to the side
Your eyes be on three or nine (it was)
You put your focus on a nine-to-five before a guy
And I feel it, baby
But if we talkin' babies, I ain't fuckin' with a nanny or a sitter
I would rather have the one I'm with with 'em
And lately women talkin' 'bout, "That shit is like prison"
But bein' rich enough to watch 'em grow to me is winnin'
My thoughts never change, said that shit from the beginnin'
But you can't put your guards down pimpin'
Huh, sometimes the women get the worst advice
Huh, some of your friends created our demise
Uh, can they stomach that? No
I don't think they could 'cause they really full of crap
But when shit hits the fan
Are they still fan?
Huh, am I still your man?
It's funny 'cause the ones shit-talkin' be the ones that be tryna steal your man (it was)
