		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What does it take
When you hear the sound?
And feel the weight
Of time running out
I'm not afraid
If it's too late now
It's my mistake
Sorry if I let you down

Even if I gotta take the long way home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Heaven knows that life is just a one-way road
The worst is over now
Can't nothing keep me down
Even if tomorrow and the next day never come
I'm full of love and titanium
Full of love and titanium

Have I been replaced
Or am I still the same?
Have I overstayed?
Dammit, it was worth the pain
I'm not afraid (not afraid)
If it's too late now
It's my mistake
Sorry that I let you down

Even if I gotta take the long way home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Heaven knows that life is just a one way road
The worst is over now
Can't nothing keep me down
Even if tomorrow and the next day never come

If my whole world falls apart
I'll still see you through the dark

Full of love and titanium
Full of love and titanium
