		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up on the mountain
Caught on the rail line
Up on the mountain
Caught on the rail line

My brother, let the heart just beat
Drink your wine, smoke your weed
My brother, let the heart still beat

And wear your silver lining
Wear it close to your skin

But if it's the drugs, the women, the wine, the weed
The love that took everything I own
Just take it oh oh oh

And tell the ones you love you love them
Teach only what you know, and oh
You better know it well

We drove from coast to coast
Down in New Orleans
Where the levees broke

You were tripping
I was driving
You were running
I was hiding

And you know I know how that feels
Don't get cheated, kid
Just sweep from your heels
And if you get carried away
Let the music play you through the pain

And wear that silver lining
Wear it close to your skin

But if it's the drugs, the women, the wine, the weed
The love that took everything I own
Just take it oh oh oh

And tell the ones you love you love them
Teach only what you know, and oh
You better know it well

Up on the mountain
Caught on the red light
Up on the mountain
Caught on the rail line
