		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

You talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing out things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I gotta make clear
I can't say, baby, where I'll be in a year

Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, must've got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie sets your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling her things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
Yes it did

Stand in the front just a shakin' your ass
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand
