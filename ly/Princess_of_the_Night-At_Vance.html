		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waitin' for such a long time
I didn't care there was nothin' left to lose
Couldn't find the sense of my life
Until the day when you appeared

From the moment you've entered my world
You made me turn around
And you stole my heart away
But now you've gone
My life's just dark and grey
So here is what I say

When the sun comes down on you
I'll be by your side
(And) when the evening's there
You'll be my princess of the night

Time moves on and I can't make it stand
Never cared for me and you've just let it end
What have you done you've thrown it all away
Now my heart is empty and there's nothin' left to say

From the day that you've captured my heart
You filled me up with love
Made my dreams come true
So now you've gone
And there's no eternity
So here is what I say

When the sun comes down on you
I'll be by your side
(And) when the evening's there
You'll be my princess of the night

Let me take your hand
And lead you to the promise land
I'll be next to you
Cause you're my princess of the night
