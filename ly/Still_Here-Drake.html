		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doin' well, dawg
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me
Yeah

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dawg
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dawg
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dawg
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dawg

How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hunnid questions
I can't fuck with you no more 'cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where your bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dawg
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dawg
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dawg
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dawg

Oh, and I'm back, dawg
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dawg
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that he don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of 6's but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, and now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dawg
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dawg
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dawg
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still

Wow, all praise to the most high up
