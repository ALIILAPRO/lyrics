		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You held my hand and then you slipped away
And I may never see your face again
So tell me how to fill the emptiness inside
Without love, what is life?
And anyone who knew us both can see
We always were the better part of me
I never wanted to be this free
And all this pain, when does it go away?

Then every time I turn around
And you're nowhere to be found
I know

I gotta long long way to go
Before I can say goodbye to you
Oh, I gotta long long way I know
Before I can say goodbye
To all I ever knew, to you
To you

From memory there is no hiding place
Turn on the TV and I see you there
In every crowd there's always someone with your face
Everywhere, trying not to care

Then every time I turn around
And you're nowhere to be found
I know

I gotta long long way to go
Before I can say goodbye to you
I gotta long long way I know
Before I can say goodbye
To all I ever knew

To you I wish you everything
And all the best that life can bring
I only hope you think of me sometimes
Oh, and even though I feel the pain
I know that I will love again
The time will come
Oh, and I'll move on

I gotta long long way to go
Before I can say goodbye to you
Oh, I gotta long long way I know
Gotta long way to go
Before I can say goodbye
Before I say goodbye
To all I ever knew
To all I ever knew
I gotta long way to go
Before I say
Say goodbye, say goodbye
But I wish you the best girl
Oh and all of the rest to you
