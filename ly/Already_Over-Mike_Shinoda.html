		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bruises, broken in pieces
Spread out 'til they didn't exist
Losing sight of what's decent
And too righteous to know what you did

Maybe it's just survival
Optimistic but blind
Maybe it's just denial
Out of sight, out of mind

But it's already over and I don't even know
Looking for a window that I already closed
No matter how much I want it, how bad I've tried
Nothing's there on the other side
It's already over

Floating in between places
Somewhere that the signal won't work
Hoping you could be nameless
Washed off of the edge of the earth

Maybe you're just entitled
Unaware of your crime
Maybe it's just denial
Out of sight, out of mind

But it's already over and I don't even know
Looking for a window that I already closed
No matter how much I want it, how bad I've tried
Nothing's there on the other side (other side)
It's already over

Maybe it's just denial
Out of sight, out of mind

It's already over and I don't even know
Looking for a window that I already closed
No matter how much I want it, how bad I've tried
Nothing's there on the other side
Over and I don't even know
Looking for a window that I already closed
No matter how much I want it, how bad I've tried
Nothing's there on the other side
Much I want it, how bad I've tried
Nothing's there on the other side (other side)
It's already over
