		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't get to roll no weed, ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might prolly say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with Promethazine 'cause every time

I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47s, MAC-11s, Glocks, and .9's
And all these pussy niggas hating tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-Shirt and his family's traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot 'em, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he had teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told 'em "it's too late my friend, it's time to say goodbye"
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47s, MAC-11s, Glocks, and .9's
And all these pussy niggas hating tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (on my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)

Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm a animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch, I'm a murderer (yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy (grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Murder on my mind, whoa-oh
I got murder on my mind (on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

Wake up in the morning I got murder on my mind
AK-47s, MAC-11s, Glocks, and .9's
And all these pussy niggas hating tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind (murder on my mind)

Young Nigga World, bitch
