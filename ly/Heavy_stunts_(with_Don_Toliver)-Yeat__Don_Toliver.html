		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh, hey
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah (hold on)
No, you is not mine (uh, uh, woah, woah)
No, you is not
I'm not the two, I'm not the three

My bitch bad (huh-huh)
My money fat (huh-huh)
And I won't talk 'em, I'm goin' brick, I'm goin' cray'
Bitch, I'm the one, I'm not the two, I'm not the three
Like the check when it bounce, leavin' it, when it in
How you gon' talk to me?
You on the sideline, you is not mine
Yeah, you a dumb lil' cunt
No, you is not mine
Yeah, you a dirty lil' bitch (ha)
No, you is not fine
I made a whole lot motherfuckin' money, yeah, 'cause it's all mine (yeah)
I do a whole lot of motherfuckin' shit, yeah, 'cause it's my time
I do a whole lot, whatever I want
Chop his head off, shoot him with gun
I like head, I like the money
I like the big bag, I like the one (woah, woah, woah)
You do what I said, you do what I said, you do what I said, yeah
We chop off his head, we chop off his head
We chop, we chop, we chop, we chop
I start a riot in this bitch (yeah-yeah)
Yeah, we could slide in this bitch
And I could slide in that bitch
1-7-5 in this whip
And I would never crash out
See, that's difference between you and me
You would pass out

Uh, uh, uh, hey
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah (hold on)
No, you is not mine (uh, uh, woah, woah)
No, you is not (I'm not the two, I'm not the three)

Uh, who that? The boy, that big old sipper (woo)
Got racks out, it's bustin' out my zipper
In a Suburban with a big box, shipped off, it's gone (yeah)
Overseas, with a lil' bad baby, Chanelly and all (hey, yeah)
She bustin' down in the strips, it's reggaeton
Double C, get waitin', I'm out, when she gettin' it on (woo)
All these hoes were poppin' the mollies
Pulled off on a Harley (err), why these hoes wanna top me
Why all my fans wanna crowd me? Tell me how this soundin'
We trappin' out the Downey (we chop-), on top of the mountain
My diamonds got from drownin' (we chop-)
Ha-ha, this shit a big-big business, smoke you down like a cigar

My bitch bad (huh-huh)
My money fat (huh-huh)
And I won't talk 'em, I'm goin' brick, I'm goin' cray'
Bitch, I'm the one, I'm not the two, I'm not the three
Like the check when it bounce, leavin' it, when it in
How you gon' talk to me?
You on the sideline, you is not mine
Yeah, you a dumb lil' cunt
No, you is not mine
Yeah, you a dirty lil' bitch (ha)
No, you is not fine
I made a whole lot motherfuckin' money, yeah, 'cause it's all mine (yeah)
I do a whole lot of motherfuckin' shit, yeah, 'cause it's my time
I do a whole lot, whatever I want
Chop his head off, shoot him with gun
I like head, I like the money
I like the big bag, I like the one (woah, woah, woah)
You do what I said, you do what I said, you do what I said, yeah
We chop off his head, we chop off his head
We chop, we chop, we chop, we chop
I start a riot in this bitch (what?)
Yeah, we could slide in this bitch
And I could slide in that bitch
1-7-5 in this whip
And I would never crash out
See, that's difference between you and me
You would pass out (uh-huh)
