		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintery fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
