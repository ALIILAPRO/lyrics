		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do better, who better?
You better? Been around
Like hella propellers
Wanna know who you with
Don't tell him
Come on fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your bodysuit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nothin' but magic bae
I'll be swinging it back and forth, 'til you in your casket, bae
Mm, girl you want my best side, mm
Bet you from the West Side, mm, mm

Now I just wanna know
Don't just sugar coat
Or say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you wanted more
We open door, hit the couch, then on floor
I cut it all, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you asking me
No limit when I'm in it, got a master piece
I'm hoping I don't get a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my mast to sea, mm
Throwing out the peace sign, mm
Girl, I'm from the East Side, mm, mm
Girl, you want my best side, mm
Bet you from the West Side, mm, mm

Now I just wanna know
Don't just sugar coat
Or say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Now I just wanna know
Don't just sugar coat
Or say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down is honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that friendly to you, but there's magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the wintertime, hey, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raised you, you raised me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I can take the weight up off your shoulder blades and try to store the pain inside of me
Like, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you, God sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Counting your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your strain, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in Matrix
Before I had you this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed, it grows some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessin' that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heartbeat, and you smart
'Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord
Bet she from the West Side, mm
And she see my best side, mm, mm

Now I just wanna know
Don't just sugar coat
Or say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
