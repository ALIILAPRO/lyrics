		  VERSE 1

I said oh my god those are pretty eyes
she said thank you boy that’s a pretty smile
then a summer day turned to summer nights 
it was daffodils it was butterflies
and I always thought it would be like that
and it can’t go cold when it feels like that
but July turned to December 
I guess nothin good lasts forever, no

CHORUS

Please don’t cry when I call your phone
Please don’t lie gotta say it so
Baby we lost our magic
Now we’re just so damn tragic

Up so high now we’re feelin’ low
Need some space gotta be alone
Baby we lost our magic 
Now we’re just so damn tragic 
Now we’re just so damn tragic

VERSE 2

Remember when we said we’ll make it through no matter what
The only thing we wanted was to be together but
I guess that things change, people change, feelings change, I changed, you changed now that we don’t feel the same

I wish it wasn’t so dramatic, yea
Because we really thought we had it all
I know our shadows never liked the shade
But we gotta face the dark to get to brighter days, yeah

CHORUS

Please don’t cry when I call your phone
Please don’t lie gotta say it so
Baby we lost our magic
Now we’re just so damn tragic

Up so high now we’re feelin’ low
Need some space gotta be alone
Baby we lost our magic 
Now we’re just so damn tragic 
Now we’re just so damn tragic

Up so high now we’re feelin’ low
Need some space gotta be alone
Baby we lost our magic 
Now we’re just so damn tragic
