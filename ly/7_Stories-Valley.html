		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would say the things that I was feelin'
If it could change the reason for you leavin'
I've tried to make some sense of all the pieces
Talkin' to my shadow on the ceilin'

(Ooh)
Please just pull the car off to the shoulder
You don't wanna tell me that it's over
Is it over?

You can call me in the middle of the night
You can leave before I wake up in the mornin'
And it could feel so wrong
But I will still hold on
You always run away from everything you love
And you can tell me seven versions of the story
And it could feel so wrong
But I will still hold on

(Ooh)
But I will still hold on
(Ooh)
But I will still

And even when I'd tried I would go and fuck it up
Did you need a little space? Did I ever give enough?
There's nothing left to say though, we're on a tight rop

(Ooh)
Please just pull the car off to the shoulder
You don't wanna tell me that it's over
Is it over?

You can call me in the middle of the night
You can leave before I wake up in the mornin'
And it could feel so wrong
But I will still hold on
You always run away from everything you love
And you can tell me seven versions of the story
And it could feel so wrong
But I will still hold on

(Ooh)
But I will still hold on
(Ooh)

The ending always works out for the author
So would you ever write another chapter?

Will we run away and start another life?
I'll be your broke-ass modern prince charming
And it'll feel so right
And we'll never press rewind
But I woke up in the middle of the night
Had a dream you were callin' sayin' sorry
But I got no missed calls
Do you miss me at all?

I wish that I can stop myself from feeling
It's over now, and I still can't believe it
