		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, time won't wait for you
Keeps on ticking away
Burning up every day

She was sleeping at the bus stop
Heaven away
But our magic in her blue eyes
Told me she had left her daze
So I have to chat her wisdom
And there was no doubt
I told her I was sitting lonely on request fault
Future's gonna catch out

[Chorus]
She said, 'Time won't wait for you.'
So do all the things you wanted to
Better hurry up, take it in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been sublime
And love won't change you boy, it's true
I can tell you till my face blue
Every second screams, listen to your dreams
Oh, cause you just can't stop the pop

On a brick that I was banging, over my head
But the sweet rings on my feet now
Where they once were made of lead
Do you hear the message in the music now
I hear it too
You know, you got your history in the making now
Slowing down won't get you through, no no

[Chorus: x2]
