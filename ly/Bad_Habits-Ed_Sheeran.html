		  (One, two, three, four)

Ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)

My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Falling over everything to reach the first-time spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)

My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you
