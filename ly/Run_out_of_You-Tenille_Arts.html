		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the back of the closet
Grey sweatshirt that ain't mine
Your cologne still on it
And I know it's fading with time
But I need it, so I breathe it in

Bottle of tequila
We brought back from Mexico
I take a shot when I need ya
But I never lose control
'Cause I know when
It's gone, it's gone

I've found just enough to get me
Through all these lonely nights
Gettin' by on the high I get from, what you left behind
But I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I run out of you

Johnny Cash on vinyl
You brought me "The Man in Black"
I lay down that needle
It can't take another scratch
It's spinnin', and I'm holding on

I've found just enough to get me
Through all these lonely nights
Gettin' by on the high I get from, what you left behind
But I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I run out of you

These feelings, they won't burn out
So I run to what keeps you around

I've found just enough to get me
Through all these lonely nights
Gettin' by on the high I get from, what you left behind
But I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I run out of you

No, I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I run out of you
Ooh, ooh
