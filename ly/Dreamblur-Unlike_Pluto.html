		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see
There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see
Something about you I can see

It's hard to see
What you really had when you didn't know you had it
Set the dove free
I let it fly away, yeah, let it fly away from me

With high speed
You never could come, no, you never could come right back
Forget me
How could I move on from what we had?

There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see
There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see
Blind is love, it's sink or swim
There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see
Something about you I can see

As time went on
Nothing competes with the feelings we had
Take me back, I had to break away

With high speed
You could never come, no, you never could come right back
Forget me
How could I move on from what we had?

There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see
There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see
Blind is love, it's sink or swim
There is something about you
Only I can see, I can see

Something about you I can see
Something about you I can see
