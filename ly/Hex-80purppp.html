		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  East and the West, I'm rackin' up all my bread, uh
Power on me, I'm feelin' just like a Tesla
Too much tree, the smoke is makin' my chest hurt
Girl on me, I'm thinkin' I should arrest her
Ayy, I'm thinkin' I should I should've rest
All night long, she puttin' me to the test
Got a lot on, I'm tryna take off the rest
Cleanin' up my lines, this ain't nothin' but the best

Hey girl, you're the cutest that I see
So bright, I'm not usin' my Visine
Gotta get it likely or I'm endin' my life, see
So beautiful, like outta my dreams
Hey boo, I'm hollerin' at you
Not rude, I'm just tryna be yo' dude
So what I gotta do just to see how that ass move?
So beautiful, sorry to be crude

Yo, B, I'm makin' the next move
You know me, I'm nothin' but just smooth
Low seats, I'm settin' the right mood
All these other rappers, they talkin', they just food
Hey, I'm talkin' to just you
You talkin' to one dude
You rockin' with one dude
And if I get it right then I'll turn off the lights soon

Hey girl, you wanna be my world
Get showered with diamonds and some pearls
Not tryna make you my night girl
I'ma treat you right like I'm a knight, girl
Hey fam, I'm tryna be your man
Me talkin' to you is God's plan
No, I don't want a one night stand
Take you 'round the world, just grab on my right hand

Yeah, I'm done, yup
You know I fuckin' lowkey fell asleep again, man
I didn't touch it
I think it fell
