		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got you under my skin
I've got you, deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I'd tried so, not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well 
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know, little fool
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 
But each time that I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats how it yells in my ear 

Don't you know, little fool
You never can win 
Why not use your mentality
Step up, wake up to reality
But each time I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop just before I begin 
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you under my skin
