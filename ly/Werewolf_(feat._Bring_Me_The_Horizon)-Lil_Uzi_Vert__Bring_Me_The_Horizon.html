		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Deep down I'm jealous of the daywalkers)
(When night time comes)
I stare at the moon
(And I turn into stalker)
(Witness me)
Whoa
Ah

Got bare bad bones in my backpack
I burnt through all of my nine lives (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'll never get past the borderline
You think you know me well
But how well do you know Hell? (Whoa)
Nowhere left to go now but underground

And this darkness has become a haven
I'm going deeper underground, can't face it

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Picked up where you left off
I pray on my knees to my protector
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Get off to the blood that was left on the scene, it was destined
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it

And this darkness has become a haven
I'm going deeper underground, can't face it
Better off dead in the ground, don't see you around, so long
And, yeah, the shadows have become a haven

(Deep down I'm jealous of the daywalkers)
(When night time comes)
I stare at the moon
(And I turn into a stalker)

And (witness me) this darkness has become a haven
I'm going deeper underground, can't face it
Better off dead in the ground, don't see you around, so long
And, yeah, the shadows have become a haven

Witness me (witness me, witness me, witness me)
