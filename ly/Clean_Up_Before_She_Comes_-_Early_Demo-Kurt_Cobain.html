		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Living in a dusty dump
Living in a dusty dump

Something in her eyes
Seems to be the smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs

I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
I must be getting old (I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
I must be getting old (I'm starting to eat my vegetables)

Something in her eyes
Something like smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs

Clean up the dusty dump
Living in a dusty dump
Living in a dusty dump
Living in a dusty dump
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Living in a dusty dump

Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs

I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
I must be getting old (I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
I must be getting old (I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
I must be getting old (I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
I must be getting old (I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
I must be getting old (I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
I must be getting old (I must be getting older)
(I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
(I must be getting older)
(I'm starting to eat my vegetables)
