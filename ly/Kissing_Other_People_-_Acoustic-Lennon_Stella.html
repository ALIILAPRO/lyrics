		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know the club shuts down
When the lights come on
You know the game is done
When somebody wins
And when the days get cold
Put away your summer clothes
Don't have to ask yourself
"When did it end?"

But how do you know?
How do you really know
That you're not holding on anymore?

Kissing other people
Oh yeah, that's how I know that your love is gone
That's how I know I'm really moving on
'Cause I don't feel guilty kissing other people
Oh yeah, losing myself in a new someone
That's how I know I'm really moving on
'Cause I don't feel guilty kissing other people

And now we're talking less
All the doors open
You know you're at the start
When you're diving in
And I'm going out
And it feels so different now
You can't begin again
Until it ends

But how do you know?
How do you really know
That you're not holding on anymore?

Kissing other people
Oh yeah, that's how I know that your love is gone
That's how I know I'm really moving on
'Cause I don't feel guilty kissing other people
Oh yeah, losing myself in a new someone
That's how I know I'm really moving on
'Cause I don't feel guilty kissing other people
Kissing other people

Yeah, that's how you know
That's how you really know
That you're not holding on anymore

Kissing other people
Oh yeah, that's how I know that your love is gone
That's how I know I'm really moving on
'Cause I don't feel guilty kissing other people
Oh yeah, losing myself in a new someone
That's how I know I'm really moving on
'Cause I don't feel guilty kissing other people
