		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy

Wait Papa, sorry but I'm a big girl
Wait Papa, get lost, get lost
He walked and flipped everything in my world
Wait Papa, you get busy or get busy or get busy

Oh oh, I got to love him, I got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave and I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I...

Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy

Hey Papa, he ain't like everyone thinks
Wait Papa, get lost, get lost
No bad boy, whenever he is with me
Wait Papa, you get busy or get busy or get busy

Oh oh, I got to love him, I got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave and I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I...

Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

You know well I'm here to stay
Boy, oh, boy, start coming my way
From now on, nothing's the same
And you're the only one to blame
You know well I'm here to stay
Boy, oh, boy, start coming my way
From now on nothing's the same
And you're the only one to blame

Oh oh, I got to love him, got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave and I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I...

Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, Mama!
Yes, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it
