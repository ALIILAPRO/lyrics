		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

What is love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
When is love you live
I'll make a stand, I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold
When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
And there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain, yeah

Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

When it's love you make
I'll be the fire in your night
And it's love you take
I will defend, I will fight
I'll be there when you need me
When honour's at stake
This vow I will make

'Cause when it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
Don't lay our love to rest
We could stand up to the test
We got everything and more
Than we had planned
More than a river that run the land
We got it all in our hands

'Cause when it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
When there's someone that you want
Someone that you need
Let's make it all, all for one and all for love
