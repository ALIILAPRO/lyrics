		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)
Let's go, let's go
(I been ballin')

Yeah, blacking out off them pills
Getting around, feelin' a bit different (black out)
My bitch telling me to slow down
But I don't feel like listening (shut up)
Pull out the ice, so white (white)
Put 'em in the trance
Paranoid blick right by me
I can't take no chance, no, no, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance

I'm at the crossroad, guns out, down to die a martyr
But if I reach for a quickdraw you won't see tomorrow
When I get high they see my eyes and they see horror
Bitch, shut the fuck up, I pour this cup up and walk on water
Huh, I just might jump off the roof, shirt off I hang out the coupe
Yeah, 24K on my tool, Lucifer up on a keypad
Huh, I spent a mil' on my rehab, I'ma need ten just to relapse
Huh, she know when I leave I'm gon' be mad, cup, it stay dirty like gleesh checks
Yeah, up in the wild, wild west, I'm on my Buffalo Bill shit
Yeah, Felipe Espinosa, Virgin Mary told me kill shit
Yeah, fucked up since a legend, now I'm on my hundred mil' shit
Yeah, mirror, mirror on the wall, baby, tell me who the realest
Huh, all these drugs got me fearless, full of hurt, but I'm tearless
Ain't nobody on my level, look around, but I'm pill-less
Real geek, I'm a chemist, missin' boy with that girl
All these thots get this molly, I get by a whole purse
Pussy stains on my staff, standin' ten thousand feet
On my money, do the math, prolly never had a chance
Another friend in a grave, another opp I gotta stain
And it's just another day that I'm

Yeah, blacking out off them pills
Getting around, feelin' a bit different (black out)
My bitch telling me to slow down
But I don't feel like listening (shut up)
Pull out the ice, so white (white)
Put 'em in the trance
Paranoid blick right by me
I can't take no chance, no, no, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance, patna
I can't take no chance, I can't take no chance

No chance
Patna
No chance
No chance
