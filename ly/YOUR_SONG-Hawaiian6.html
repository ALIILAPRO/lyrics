		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uhhh The orange sky.
I hear a church bell sound.
And all the birds
begin to take flight.
This bird in the old days
carried LOVE AND PEACE.
This bird will
fly up to the bright red sun.
It rained yesterday.
So sad was the rain.
And I still don't know
what I want to do.
I was closed in a shell
of myself was full.
I was very uneasy.
It rains today.
I'm chased and run around
for time and life.
It's very hard to live.
Reality I'm fighting.
Every day repeating.
All day but I don't
have no umbrella.
Please notice one thing.
There's not a rain
which doesn't stop.
I wish I could just break out.
In this world you stand.
Before you there's a road.
So look and lift your face.
Swing your fist.
You're free. Raise voice.
You sing your song,
you sing your song.
You sing your life,
you sing your freedom song.
You sing your song,
You sing your song,
You sing your life,
you sing your freedom song.
Uhhh

Please notice one thing.
There's not a rain
which doesn't stop.
I wish I could just break out.
In this world you stand.
Before you there's a road.
So look and life your face.
Swing your fist.
You're free. You're free.
Raise voice.
You sing your song,
You sing your song,
You sing your life,
you sing your freedom song.
You sing your song,
You sing your song,
You sing your life,
you sing your freedom song.
The orange sky.
I hear a church bell sound.
And all the doves fly
through a vapor trail.
If even it seems that
the rain won't stop.
Even if the rain
will never stop.
Even if you don't
have no umbrella.
I can't sing your song.
your song.
I can't sing your song.
