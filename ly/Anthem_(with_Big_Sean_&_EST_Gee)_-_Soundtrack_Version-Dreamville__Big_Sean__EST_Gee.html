		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told you, told you, told you, told you
Anthem (anthem)
For me, for me, told you
Anthem (anthem)
For me, for me, told you
Anthem (anthem)
For me, for me
Blackened teardrop, teardrop (ayy, ayy)

Why would I ever trip on my spot when I earned it?
Y'all act in discernment
They prolly gon' talk about tonight at the next sermon
Difference is you do it on purpose, and me, I do it for a purpose
Just know as long as I'm up, that it's never your turn in
Look, they must've forgot that I'm my daddy's son (whoa)
And if I'm after then, they have to run, okay, you had a run
Difference is we the ones that run it
Discipline is the difference 'tween who got it and who want it
They rather count me up than count me in
Always count on me, y'all boy's counterfeit
They rolling with the punches, boy, I countered it
Y'all really judging me and I can't honor it
See, I was born in the ashes so of course I rise
I'm in that state of mind, for real, y'all just borderline
I wake up to look inside my daughter eyes
And realize I'm immortalized

Born in the ashes so of course I rise
There's diamonds on my gold
They must've forgot that I'm my daddy's son (whoa)
We the ones that run it
Born in the ashes so of course I rise
There's diamonds on my gold
They must've forgot that I'm my daddy's son (whoa)
We the ones that run it (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I been under fire so long, but heat made a shiner out of coal
There's diamonds on my gold
Loyalty take a toll on my soul but I can't fold
Red snow made my heart cold
Up close on his clothes like I'm tryna scan a barcode
Demon hit the gas, pipe sound like Pop Smoke
I wasn't nervous or nothin', I seen it and locked in on
Come from where a hot stove could heat up your house cold
Can't buy tobacco but head of his household
Pack chrome stale faced, they all say he act grown
Survivor's over tap phone, hit up his back bone
You gotta know the trap code, don't run 'til the pack gone
Fighting for my life or choose to end up a sad song, yeah
Fighting for my life or choose to end up a sad song, yeah
