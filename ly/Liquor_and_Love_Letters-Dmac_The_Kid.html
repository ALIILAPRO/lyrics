		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at what we got right here
This one go out to not only the fellas of the world
But the hoes too
Put your hands high in the sky if you ever was done dirt
Left in the mud
Sing this shit to the top of your lungs
We got a fuckin anthem now yuh heard
An anthem on some enough is enough type shit
You're done dealin with it
Get ready
Life, ref it with you
Is you beneficial (hmm)
How many men was with you
Bitch is you official (hmm)
Sure it's times you'll get me tight
But I would never hit you
But when I get you tight you'll leave again
Again I'll miss you
I think you need some time to yourself
Before your lies could get me time again
Confined in a cell, bind like a spell
Honestly, nah, listen
That won't happen again
What point is it alright to get the crackin the whip
She throwin hooks and jabs at my chin
I'm battlin sin, bafflin shit
Honey Jack in the swig
Ain't headed back to the crib
Hit up the side and if she got no time
I'll fap and then dip
Before I ever think to ask you for shit
Had you a kid
The dad ain't even glad for his sixth
Left something good on your own just to see how crappy it gets
Factual biz
Drives you mad on the fritz, uh
Now it's the thing to top my whole what makes me happiest list
Bitch
To wish you'd stay was just an understatement
Why would I want you here when I know you hate it
Every time we talk, yo I was so berated, degraded
This shit is fuckin over now, I'm glad we didn't make it
Make it, make it
Said this shit is fuckin over now, I'm glad we didn't make it
Make it, make it, make it
I said this shit is fuckin over now
You can go and walk out proud
Are you ready
You broke my heart, you used to cheat
You had me hella depressed
Man I just wanted all your love
That was all I request
Man you was way too busy hoein
Had no time to invest
The way you treat me blew my mind
You had me hella distressed
Look you was wastin all my time
I wasn't love infatuated
Said he treated me like shit
You always lie, manipulated
You know I used to drive you crazy
Wasn't love, was captivated
Then that love had went away
And now it's dead and liquidated
You had my heart, deflated it
And now I'm feelin betrayed
You came and raided my life
Your love, I tried to evade it
But now my love is gone and faded
Now my heart feel sedated
I really wish I never met you
Hate the fact that we dated
You took all my fuckin time
Took it from me, confiscated
You was the only one I wanted
It was you I nominated
I dealt with all your fuckin lies
And all the shit I tolerated
Things could've been way different
But you made it complicated
To wish you'd stay was just an understatement
Why would I want you here when I know you hate it
Every time we talk, yo I was so berated, degraded
This shit is fuckin over now, I'm glad we didn't make it
Make it, make it
Said this shit is fuckin over now, I'm glad we didn't make it
Make it, make it, make it
I said this shit is fuckin over now
You can go and walk out proud
