		  I can't take a loss (can't take a loss) (We The Best Music)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good
(Another one)
(DJ Khaled)

I can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Can't take a loss
I can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, hey
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, hey

My family's straight
Got the chip, I been holdin' my weight
Copped the 'Rari like, "Pardon my ways"
New RM with the skeleton face
Where I came from, man
The mud turned Roddy a boss
Keep the smoke like exhaust, ayy
Never fucked with the law
Got the Cullinan cross, ayy
Nigga, this not a draw, ayy-ayy
But I'm still standin' tall, ayy-ayy
Free my niggas 'hind
Free my niggas 'hind the wall, ayy-ayy
We got rich off of holdin' notes
2022, rollin' Ghosts
Half a mil', I got shows on shows
Leave the festival rollin' dope

I can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Can't take a loss
I can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, hey
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, hey

Had make sure the fam good, hey
The Bentley Mulsanne wood grain
That Rolls Royce a Phantom road rage
Niggas hate when they ain't good
Back of the Benz, smokin' Backwoods
I crank up the engine, it sound good, hey
We was broke, now the fam good, ayy
In the hood eatin' canned goods, hey
I stay high 'cause I know I could
Bought a Vivienne Westwood, hey
Yes, it's good girl, you know it's all paid
Diamonds twinklin', dancin' a parade
Money and we can ball, Balmain
No more losses, nah, not again
Had my feet on the hardwood
I'm good long as the fam good, hey

I can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Can't take a loss
I can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, hey
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, hey

I can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Long as the fam good, fam good, then we good, ayy
Can't take a loss (can't take a loss)
