		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ayy man, where the fuck is Mario Judah?)

I'm a big dog, big bear, nigga, I'm a lion
I'm the predator of the prey that is hiding
Oh my, oh my, I have found you, nigga
Don't you run from me, lil' nigga
You are not fast enough
You are not brave enough
You are out of luck
Now it's time for you to die very rough

You have been warned
There is nowhere to run
You will pay the price
I will take your life
There's no running back
Now your loved ones are so sad
You had a choice, but you failed

I'm a big dog, big bear, nigga, I'm a lion
I'm the predator of the prey that is hiding
Oh my, oh my, I have found you, nigga
Don't you run from me, lil' nigga
You are not fast enough
You are not brave enough
You are out of luck
Now it's time for you to die very rough

(Ayy man, where the fuck is Mario Judah?)
