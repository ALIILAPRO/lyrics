		  Uptown
Montana a.k.a. Young Wepa
Uptown

Ooh, don't get got
Heard you got a bad rep, baby, don't ya? (Woo)
I could be a lot
Don't you ever say I never warned ya (Ayy)
Who's better? Show me now
Who been in my bed and 'round your homies
Oh, I could be a lot
If you don't believe me, I can show ya

Don't go thinkin' you can use me (Woo)
It don't take too much, you could lose me
Best believe I'm comin' true with a new ting
Oh, you ain't been the only one
I send shots like an Uzi (Baby)
Even in plain sight, don't care who see (Baby)
Best believe I'm comin' through with a new ting
Oh, you ain't been the only one, babe

Think you need some medicine
I could be your medicine, yeah
Think you need some medicine
Give you a taste of what you give out
Think you need some medicine (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I could be your medicine, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Think you need some medicine (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Give you a taste of what you give out (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Ooh, don't get got
Heard you got a bad rep, baby, don't ya? (Ayy, ayy)
I could be a lot
Don't you ever say I never warned ya (Ayy)
Who's better? Show me now
Who been in my bed and around your homies
Oh, I could be a lot
If you don't believe me, I can show ya

Don't go thinkin' you can use me (Hey)
It don't take too much, you could lose me (Hey)
Best believe I'm comin' true with a new ting
Oh, you ain't been the only one (Hey)
I send shots like an Uzi (Baby)
Even in plain sight, don't care who see (Ayy, hey)
Best believe I'm comin' through with a new ting (Ayy, ayy)
Oh, you ain't been the only one

Think you need some medicine
I could be your medicine, yeah
Think you need some medicine
Give you a taste of what you give out
Think you need some medicine (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I could be your medicine, yeah (Montana)
Think you need some medicine (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Give you a taste of what you give out (J. Lo down, baby, Uptown, baby)

Touchdown, baby, b-bust down, baby (Ayy, ayy)
They drive you, Uptown, baby (Yeah)
Shawty, you Heaven-sent, yeah, my medicine
Movin' on up, George Jefferson (Ayy, ayy)
South Bronx where it happen
On a yacht catchin' fish, we don't get catfished
Never seen it, magic; horse and carriage (Ayy, ayy)
Sicker than your average, the ladies be the baddest (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
I know, yeah, drip drip out (Woo)
Montana a.k.a. Young Wepa (Wepa)
Saucy, ooh, drip drop (Woo)
Top-top off the roof, a flip-flop (Flip-flop)
Montana

Think you need some medicine (Montana)
I could be your medicine, yeah (Woo)
Think you need some medicine (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Give you a taste of what you give out (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Think you need some medicine (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I could be your medicine, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Think you need some medicine (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Give you a taste of what you give out (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
