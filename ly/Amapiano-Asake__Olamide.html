		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dem know, dem know
Ololademi Asake
Tune in to the king of sounds and blues

Amapiano, diano
It's a big vibe, all the girls dem know
Steadily, steadily
Heavily, we are getting lit
Amapiano, diano
It's a big vibe, all the girls dem know
Steadily, steadily
Heavily, we are getting lit

They see me coming dem dey shout hallelujah
Every day ibi be like a new year
Overseas dey wan chop me like suya
Ọmọ I no fit dull for this dunya

Dia so greasy o, greasy o
It dey dance like Chris Breezy o, easy o
Ọmọ my wrist e dey cold, e dey freezy o
Dem no dey call me Mr. Money for no reason o

As e dey go, Amapiano
We go show
We go let dem know
Na we dey run the town and any show
Bigger than any woes, stronger than any foes
Badman flows, put dem on their toes
On the low, the girl dem know
My gbedu shut down Southy, Jamo
Colorado, pass me the fat jumbo

Amapiano, diano
It's a big vibe, all the girls dem know
Steadily, steadily
Heavily, we are getting lit
Amapiano, diano
It's a big vibe, all the girls dem know
Steadily, steadily
Heavily, we are getting lit

Yeah
Oju kan
Ọ kan ni giran
Bad bitches wọn ti wọle, ṣe ri wọn? Eh
Turn me up, oya carry on
Shake your caravan for the Don Corleone
What the fuck? Get down on the floor
I can never fall, R.I.P to 44
I'm trading all of my sorrow now for my peace
I'm glad I made it out the belly of the beast
From the ground up, nigga, stand up
See the fandom, we no dey do random
Moët & Chandon it never, never done
I'm telling y'all better get the memorandum
One thing I know I'm happy I know
Amapiano, all of my P I know
No mercy I know, Italiano
Lucky Luciano, killing beat is all I know

Amapiano, diano
It's a big vibe, all the girls dem know
Steadily, steadily
Heavily, we are getting lit
Amapiano, diano
It's a big vibe, all the girls dem know
Steadily, steadily
Heavily, we are getting lit

As e dey go, Amapiano
We go show
We go let dem know
Na we dey run the town and any show
Bigger than any woes, stronger than any foes
Badman flows, put dem on their toes
On the low, the girl dem know
My gbedu shut down Southy, Jamo
Colorado, pass me the fat jumbo
