		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Peace be with you
I'm the melody in your ear
I'm right there with you
I'm right there with you

Hold me against the dark
I will never run for cover
Oh, how it feels to love
Oh, how it feels to live forever
Leave the world behind

In the darkness, I lead
In the eye of all seeing
I'm the god of your heap
In between the worlds we fly
I'm a sentient being
I'm the thoughts that you keep
I'm the hope that you seek
Leave the world behind

How does it feel to be young?
How does it feel loved?
How does it feel to breathe?
How does it feel to leave here?
How does it feel to leave here?
Leave the world behind
