		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Artificial death in the West East
Pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe
She shoot pussy through your chest you die

There was a artificial death in the West East
All pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe
G-O-D, she shoot pussy through your chest you die

Where you runnin' now?

I'm barely there I'm everywhere
Heavy thin air Sahara mascara smeared end of an era
Tracks on Hera's peacock thighs china white 
Skies ivory of my leper eyes
Tone of sighs off nylon lips
Where you runnin' now?
In fishnet wet guise of gimp horizon slit 
Bled like my wrist I suck it dry
Which nipple's mine read the signs still can't decide
At your own risk, at your own risk
Don't touch me bitch, don't touch me bitch
Where you runnin' now?
Accustomed to these satin glitches drippin from my casket's inners
Charmer play me out the basket last image I saw was splintered
My reflection wasn't in it, in slow motion I give in
Where you runnin' now, where you runnin now?
Hopeless premonitions
Tomorrow didn't come some say it's hiding 
But they're the ones who've hidden
Euphoria followed by visions of peasants eating pigeons
Where you runnin' now, where you runnin' now?

There was a artificial death in the West East
All pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe
G-O-D she shoot pussy through your chest you die

Where you runnin' now?

Watching me watching me watch them watch me

Hole in this platinum ship of fools nomadic rule concept no rules
Mobile shrine of this destitute wasteland mute
Screaming at me winking at me like I love it
Fucking wit me fuck it

My star gate in a vacuum monitors eye view
This valley is an urn this valley I'm wading through
Where you runnin' now?
Feel like I'm chasing after me feel 
Like dead weight in a sea of Vaseline
All that can't be seen watching me watching me watch them watch me
Try not to dwell on my cell my empty shell shedding me
Where you runnin' now?
Artificial death in the west east
Pyramids on deck shine
Where you runnin' now?
No matter where I turn shut down shut down
Everyone's a runaway, where you runnin' now?

There was a artificial death in the West East
All pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe
G-O-D she shoot pussy through your chest you die

Watching me watching me watch them watch me

There was a artificial death in the west east
All pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe
G-O-D she shoot pussy through your chest you die
