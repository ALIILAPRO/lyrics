		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We met in December
I knew it by June
I'd want this forever, I'll never surrender
It's gotta be you
I've spent a lifetime
Hiding the truth
That even the darkest of days and the bad times
Are better in two's

You're like sunshine after rain
When the sky's the perfect shade of blue
Because heaven's just a place
Ain't a saint that's compares to you

I'd give you the world, take it all from me
Whatever you want you can have for free
I would give anything and everything
If anything's left, it's yours to keep
I'd give you the world, take it all from me
Whatever you want you can have for free
I would give anything and everything
If anything's left, it's yours to keep

If I had it my way
Our love would be like a song
And everybody would scream it to feel what we felt
That's the closest they'll come

You're like sunshine after rain
When the sky's the perfect shade of blue
Because heaven's just a place
Ain't a saint that's compares to you
I finally believe in fate
Almost feels like it was made for us
Yeah, 'cause you don't want me to change
And I'm feeling like I'm safe for once, for once

I'd give you the world, take it all from me
Whatever you want you can have for free
I would give anything and everything
If anything's left, it's yours to keep
I'd give you the world, take it all from me
Whatever you want you can have for free
I would give anything and everything
If anything's left, it's yours to keep

I'd give you the world, take it all from me
Whatever you want you can have for free
