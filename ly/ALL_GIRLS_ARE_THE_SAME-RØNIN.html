Valentine in December
You said you love me but you don't remember
My name, you cause me pain
All girls are the same

I don't love you now
All girls are the same

I don't need you now
All girls are the same

All of these demons they're dancin' inside
I don't know whether to live or to die (die)
But I keep fighting that feeling inside
I'm gonna ride, gonna ride 'til I die

Sorry my homies I left to the side
Do you ever think of suicide?
Fuck all this pain you can see in my eyes
You fucking around, you gone pay with your life

Valentine in December
You said you love me but you don't remember
My name, you cause me pain
All girls are the same, yeah

I don't love you now
All girls are the same

I don't need you now
All girls are the same

All of these demons they're dancin' inside
I don't know whether to live or to die (die)
But I keep fighting that feeling inside
I'm gonna ride, gonna ride till I die

Sorry my homies I left to the side
Do you ever think of suicide?
Fuck all this pain you can see in my eyes
You fucking around, you gone pay with your life

I don't love you now
All girls are the same

I don't need you now
All girls are the same
