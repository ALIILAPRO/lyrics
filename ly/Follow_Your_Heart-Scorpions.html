		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever climbed the mountain? Have you ever crossed the sea? Take a look around the corner And listen to your heartbeat Have you ever touched the rainbow Take a ride in the ferris wheel It takes one step to start a journey It's up to you, to make it real This is the time for yourself to be free You gotta follow your heart This is the time in your life and it's never too late To see the light in the dark You gotta follow your heart Walking far away horizons You will never walk alone You'll be at home where your heart is A million miles away from home This is the time for yourself to be free You gotta follow your heart This is the time in your life and it's never too late To see the light in the dark You gotta follow your heart Show me the way, who knows the way This is the only road to go Life brings me down, life takes me up And only, only heaven knows This is the time for yourself to be free You gotta follow your heart This is the time in your life and it's never too late To see the light in the dark You gotta follow your heart You gotta follow your heart
