		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just hold me down
Don't tear me up babe
You're my whole world
But it don't spin babe
You left me lone
And you don't care babe
Do you know how it feels
Look at someone get chills

Your body in a rise
You feel it in your thighs
They say that I'm bad, you say I'm not that type of guy
Friends start talkin' like they got wires on em
That shit made me hit rock bottom
Don't compare me I'm not like him
I got green on my mind like I'm CeeLo
But you know I'm hard like a beetle
Can't win my heart with a deep throat
I love her I wonder if she knows
I'll still hold your ass down
Even though I know that you ain't changed at all

You broke me down
You tear me up babe
You're my whole world
But it don't spin babe
You left me lone
And you don't care babe
Do you know how it feels
Look at someone get chills

You said you fell in love with the way that I been walkin' on beats
And you said that I don't need percussion
My voice is percussion
You don't even think bout a hater discussin'
I run it up heatin' I'm hot out of the oven
We smoke it up cause I got drugs in abundance
Know I can hit it but still I'm reluctant (Uh huh)
Cause I know that I dumped it, dumped her
40 I dump it (Dumped it)
Roll it and thump it
If she don't like this then it's fuck it, yea
Guess I am who I am, yea
Rackies on me I'm the man, yea
Said they want it on demand
Girl stop actin' like a fan

You broke me down
You tear me up babe
You're my whole world (Uh huh, uh huh)
But it don't spin babe (Spin baby)
You left me lone (You left me lone)
And you don't care babe
Do you know how it feels
Look at someone get chills
