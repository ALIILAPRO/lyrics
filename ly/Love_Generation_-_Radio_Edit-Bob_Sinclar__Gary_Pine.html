		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From Jamaica to the world
It's just love, it's just love, yeah

Why must the children play in the streets?
Broken hearts and faded dreams
Peace and love to everyone that you meet
Don't you worry, it could be so sweet

Just look to the rainbow, you will see
Sun will shine 'til eternity
I've got so much love in my heart
No one can tear it apart, yeah

Be the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be the love generation
Come on, come on, come on, come on, eh

Be the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be the love generation
Ooh yeah

Don't worry 'bout a thing
Gonna be alright
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Gonna be alright
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Gonna be alright
Gonna be, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna be alright

It's all love, you know?
It's all love
From I and I to everyone
Got to love, well, we got to love, yeah
There's no need to cry, yeah
Got to love, well, we got to love, yeah
Got to live that love
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Come on

Be the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be the love generation
Come on, come on, come on, come on, eh

Be the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be the love generation
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah

Be the love generation
Ooh yeah
It's all love, you know?
Be the love generation
Got to love
Got to love, well, we got to love, yeah
Yeah
