		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a man
Trying to understand
The reason I'm lost in this world
Tonight
I was blind
I just couldn't see the signs
Caught in your web of lies

It's too dark to sleep
Too late to pray
Too hard to reach
Too much to save

You were once a friend to me
Now you are my enemy
Passion turns to hate and you make
Hate worth fighting for
I will re-write history
And you will not exist to me
On the day you crossed the line
I found out love is war

Life goes by
Faster than lightning strikes
Crashes before you can say
Goodbye

Too scared to run
Too proud to hide
Too far to fall
Too high to climb

You were once a friend to me
Now you are my enemy
Passion turns to hate and you make
Hate worth fighting for
I will re-write history
And you will not exist to me
On the day you crossed the line
I found out love is war

I laid down my defenses
I opened up the door
I gave you what you wanted
I couldn't give you more
And I gave you everything
You said it's all or nothing
To you it's just a game
A game you're never losing

You were once a friend to me
Now you are my enemy
Passion turns to hate and you make
Hate worth fighting for
I will re-write history
And you will not exist to me
On the day you crossed the line
I found out love is war
You were once a friend to me
Now you are my enemy
Passion turns to hate and you make
Hate worth fighting for
I will re-write history
And you will not exist to me
On the day you crossed the line
I found out love is war
Found out love is war
