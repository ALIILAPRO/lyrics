		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought I could rolled the dice
Thought I could paid the price
Saying it won't take me
Could I escape in time if I realize
But I gamble it all on numbing fees
They said to have a little fun
But now the damage done
Is creeping into every day
Shoulda slowed the dose
Too late now
I'm living in a ghost town
Fate arrive
Take what's mine
I know I walked in sin
Addiction governing
Place and time
Not in mind
I feel them breaking in
Temptation always wins
I hear you calling out my name
Don't worry I've always been this way
I thought I'd take back everything
And say I was out
But here you are now
Think you were here all along
Cause that taste been a chase
Even when nothing is wrong
Can't tell where logic has gone
So I fall on your face
Following your pace
The vices hit the light
I see her at the door
Offerings I might like
Fate arrive
Take what's mine
I know I walked in sin
Addiction governing
Place and time
Not in mind
I feel them breaking in
Temptation always wins
I hear you calling out my name
Don't worry I've always been this way
I thought I'd take back everything
And say I was out
But here you are now
