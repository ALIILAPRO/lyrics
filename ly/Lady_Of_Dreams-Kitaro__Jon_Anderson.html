		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save me a place
In the heart of your hearts
When you think of love
Never forsake me

Wanting and dreaming you
Each time I think of you
Lying naked beside me

Only a Lady of Dreams
She will bring magic
To sing to your heartstrings

Only a Lady of Dreams
Come alive, you are all
That I desire

Save me a place
In the heart of your hearts
When you think of dreams
Never forsake me

Wanting and holding you
Each time I come to you
Lying naked beside you

Only a Lady of Dreams
Could there be magic
To sing to your heartstrings

Only a Lady of Dreams
Come alive, you are all
That I desire

Something tells me
This is love that surrounds
Only a fool
Without wisdom can see
Blind as I am
In your eyes
My Lady of Dreams

Blind as I am
In your eyes
My Lady of Dreams

Save me, save me
A place in your heart
Tears escape from me
When we're apart
Please dream of me now
My Lady of Dreams

My thoughts and wishes
Are all the surrounds
Mysteries hold you
Then fly you away
You know you are my life
My Lady of Dreams

You know you are my life
My Lady of Dreams

Save me a place
In the heart of your heart
When you think of love
Never forsake me

Wanting and dreaming you
Each time I think of you
Lying so naked beside me

Only a Lady of Dreams
Could there be magic
To sing to your heartstrings

Only a Lady of Dreams
Come alive, you are all
That I desire

Something tells me
This is love that surrounds
Only a fool
Without wisdom can see
Blind as I am
In your eyes
My Lady of Dreams

Blind as I am
In your eyes
My Lady of Dreams
