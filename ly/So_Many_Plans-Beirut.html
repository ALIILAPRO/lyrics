		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And we had so many plans
Leap from the sill, see where we land
We had so many plans
Safe from the wind, head in the sand

And we had so many friends
This had to end, it had to end
And we had so many friends
Maybe we'll see them again

We sat so long, we sat too long
We sat too long through the night
We said "Au revoir", we said "Au revoir"
We said it all in one night

We had so many plans
This had to end, this had to end
We had so many friends
This had to end, this had to end

We sat so long, we sat too long
We sat too long through the night
We said "Au revoir", we said "Au revoir"
We said it all in one night
