		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby

Take a break and roll the sticky, let's get high (see)
Not too great at relationships, at least I try (uh, uh)
Patient, baby, gotta make a couple rounds (yeah, you know, oh)
'Fore I make it back to you to settle down (yeah, yeah)

Don't blame yourself for all the shit you see me do
I'm gettin' used to bein' loved, girl, the right way
My nigga pulled up at the stu', said he got two
I said, "I'm cool," he looked at me, like, "Nigga, you crazy" (yeah, yeah)
My heart start beatin' to the drum, bump-boop-boop-boop
I sang this tune, I wrote for you, ayo DJ, play me (ayy DJ, turn that shit on for me)
Play me this song to set the mood, she want the truth
It's ninety proof, I hide behind the faders (take it now, take it now)

Take a break and roll the sticky, let's get high (take it now, take it now, oh)
Not too great at relationships, at least I try
Patient, baby, gotta make a couple rounds (gotta make a couple rounds, oh)
'Fore I make it back to you to settle down

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I got a real one, if I was broke, she never would leave me, no
I got a real one, if I was broke, she never would leave me, no
I got a real one, if I was broke, she never would leave me, no
I got a real one, real one, real one, real one (yeah, uh)

I bought a condo and it's cozy, my neighbors nosey as fuck
They see a young nigga walked in with his kids
They don't know who he is, they just know that he up
No chain or no Rollie, I move around doley, untouched
Not 'cause I'm hard, because I got God
I heard that you blowin' up fast, but I think it's better to slowly erupt
That money was burnin' a hole in my pocket
That ninety proof burned a lil' hole in my gut
We walked in the function, they jaw got to bumpin'
My dawg got to rushin' like Soviet pup
Roof-roof, nah, nigga, don't shoot, shoot
Two-six, we got loose screw
Shit was turnt like a Rubik's cube
I don't really do the cameras, I be low in Los Angeles
You niggas ain't never gon' see me, I might as well be in Canada
You niggas ain't ever gon' be me, it's best to stay in your parameters
You know they gon' G-O-A-T me, I spell it out for you like Fabolous
'Bout to go pull up on RiRi, and not for the feature, Ben Franklin note
You ain't finna catch me in the type of places everybody go
I know exactly what my hands is for, to carry a lot of dough (oh-oh)
I had a pot to piss, I hopped the fence, can't sit around and plot no more

(Take it now, take it now)
Take a break and roll the sticky, let's get high
(Take it now, take it now)
Not too great at relationships, at least I try
Patient, baby, baby gotta make a couple rounds (gotta make a couple rounds)
'Fore I make it back to you to settle down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I got a real one, real one, real one, real one
