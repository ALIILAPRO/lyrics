		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone, all of them
Everyone said, "Don't go that way"
So, of course, to that I said
"I think I'll go that way"

And I left the door open to the dark
I said, "Come in, come in, whatever you are"
But it didn't want me yet

Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said, "Take it all, whatever you want"
I didn't know that I was numb
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take

Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again
