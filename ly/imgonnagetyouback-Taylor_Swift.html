		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lilac short skirt
The one that fits me like skin
Did your research
You knew the price goin' in

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standing at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
You're mine

Small talk, big love
Act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin
That you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can take the upper hand and touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you 'til the end

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
Pull you into the closet
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
You're mine

I can feel it comin', hummin' in the way you move
Push the reset button, we're becoming something new
Say you got somebody, I'll say, "I got someone too"
Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leaving here with you

Bygones will be bygone eras fadin' into gray (fadin' into gray)
We broke all the pieces but still want to play the game (oh)
Told my friends, "I hate you but I love you just the same"
Pick your poison, babe
I'm poison either way

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
I'm gonna get you back
