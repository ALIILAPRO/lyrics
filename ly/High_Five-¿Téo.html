		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I
That's a lot of winning, baby, high five
Talk to me nice, don't speak lies
You just need a diamond in the right size, yeah
Heard you Malibuing at the high tide
Slow groove moving and it's so nice
I've been making moves since '05
So I ain't gotta worry, girl, I'm too alive Yeah

Mhhh, on another level, baby mhh
Mhhh, this another level, baby mhh
Mhhh, I can feel it coming baby mhh
Mhhh, I'mma keep it coming baby mhh

Girl you got me feeling
Feeling something different
Got me talking, riffin'
Feeling something's clicking
Say you love nobody and yet you feel so naughty
If I taste your body, you finna call me daddy
I'mma drop them rubber bands while I'm looking at you dance ohh
One touch put me in a trance
Now you got me feeling with my hands
Feeling like nobody understands, ay

Girl, I'm on your block we can head out
She a frikitona, tryna pull me to the bed now
And If she keep the booty swinging, I'mma have to lay it out
I'm willing to get down, mami

You and I
That's a lot of winning, baby, high five
Talk to me nice, don't speak lies
You just need a diamond in the right size, yeah
Heard you Malibuing at the high tide
Slow groove moving and it's so nice
I've been making moves since '05
So I ain't gotta worry, girl, I'm too alive yeah

The plot thickening
Water on my baby looking like she at a christening
Just because you talking don't mean I'm always listening
Light pollution but there's still stars at the Michelin
How we get to this again?
Uh yeah
Okay, Uh uh uh uh
She like everything so clean
I like anything Jobim
Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars, the whole scene
Mami, please, come and just surrender the tease
I can see what's on your mind, so let me handle them needs
I say "mami, go and tell your friends that you found me"
Run around the block and tell your mami
She don't need to worry when you 'round me
That's why I'm saying ma

You and I
That's a lot of winning, baby, high five
Talk to me nice, don't speak lies
You just need a diamond in the right size, yeah
Heard you Malibuing at the high tide
Slow groove moving and it's so nice
I've been making moves since '05
So I ain't gotta worry, girl, I'm too alive
