		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big T-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big T-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent (ayy, ayy)
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilot (ayy)

Put it in perspective
Bitch, I got everything I wanted and some extra
I am not the type for turnin' into a detective (no)
Got two of my own phones, barely even check 'em
Uber Eats the food, I don't call, I just text it
Cashed out on bail, my lil' bitch got arrested
Flexed out my Lexus, no backseats and no besties (shit)
I checked it, no guest list, so don't text me
Ayy, two pistols, .30's in the clip, these akimbos
Open hand, smack him in his lip, bitch, I'm Kimbo
You be throwin' cash in the strip
My lil' bitch suckin' dick for the free
I got a bitch but a bitch ain't got me
I know she trip when I dip, so I creep
These bitches pillow talkin' 'bout me like I'm sleep
But she ain't know this Gen-3 was in my motherfuckin' tee

Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big T-shirt, Billie Eilish
Propped up, fuckin' her from the back on an island
Heard they talkin' crazy on my name, now they're silent
Mile high, run that shit back

Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big T-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big T-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilot
