		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up with it, girl, rock with it, girl (Sia)
Show dem it, girl (bada bang-bang)
Bounce with it, girl, dance with it, girl
Get with it, girl (bada bang-bang)

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, I put my makeup on
It's Friday night and I won't be long

'Til I hit the dancefloor (bada bang)
Hit the dancefloor (bada bang)
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby (just you and me)

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus' tek control
I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get out of control

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

'Til I hit the dancefloor (bada bang)
Hit the dancefloor (bada bang)
I got all I need (you see)
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby (just you and me)

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus' tek control
I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get out of control

Me and you, girl, you and me
Drop it to di floor and mek me see your energy because (I love cheap thrills)
Me nah play no hide and seek (woo)
Wan' fi see di ting you have a mek me feel weak, girl (I love cheap thrills)
(Free) cah any time you whine and kotch it
Di selector pull it up, a put pon repeat, girl (I love cheap thrills) (hey)
Me nah touch a dollar inna mi pocket
Cah nuttin' in this world ain't more than what you worth (I love cheap thrills)

I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus' tek control
I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get out of control, oh, oh, oh

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus' tek control
I don't need no money
You worth more than diamond, more than gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get out of control

La, la, la, la, la, la, la (I love cheap thrills)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (I love cheap thrills)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (I love cheap thrills)
La, la, la, la, la, la (I love cheap thrills)
