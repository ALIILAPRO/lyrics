		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No this is not my guitar
I'm bringing it to a friend
And no I don't sing
I'm only humming along

Up here in the air
I'm just mumbling at the clouds
Wanting to be known
While I pass the lonely hours

I came down from the room
I saw you in the rain
Laughing with some people
Hair dripping down your face

Your calm hypnotic eyes
Your Scandinavian glow
I felt them like a flame
Candle in my cold bones

Tonight you were my muse
As I belted and I strummed
Trying not to drown
In the helicopter drone

Alesund

From the crowd I heard
You sing a pretty line
Was it there so much longer
That I wanna cry

I thought about it long
Had you repeated in my ear
"I couldn't place a thought
without you being so close"

Alesund

Should've played it then
From the intro to the end
When they offered me the stage
At the bar we landed in

But I turned and walked
Away from all the fun
And back into the black
Seaside night of Alesund

Alesund
