		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo, did this shit in one take
Ayo

Check my bankroll ayo 400k for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django
Interior look mango shotgun grape he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll neck all gold like kayo corp
We aim at dorks get out the way yo
Keep them bucks in banks like yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded yall be dilute watered down
I'm big mac I'm quarter pound you chicken nugget
Fuck it travel bag Balenciaga 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin' flower boy is buzzin'
Grammy-nominated tell yo cousin ain't nobody fucking with him

Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go
I stick to the plan that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man that's for sure

Uno the shoe red with the blue look like a flag what the fuck it do
Golf be the set no more OF like Ron Artest bitch we aim for your neck
Give a fuck about you or your respect yeah that way
Fuck your accolades but I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me brush I've been making waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade but that's 92 I'm 91
Watts riot in my blood nigga whats up and that pussy pink like the drink in my cup
Lemonade yeah its minute maid I been getting paid pockets gaining weight
Your bank statements on Mary Kate but that's up to you

Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go
I stick to the plan that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man that's for sure

Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowing clear of acne diamonds see through so holographic
Red ones look like Aidan Mackey spent dinero like taxi driver
Handmade is that thing with tires but I rode the bike
And vill tail behind me and he got the cannon like he bagged Mariah
Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon no violence and my guy mixed like jambalaya
Man fuck with the fam we in Japan bitch you're a bum see you dont understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends t where you been? Bitch im in bel air been looking for land
Need a spot in the hills not the beach need a pool
Just to cool it I do need the grass not the sand
Got enough rocks, see check my hand
And I got crack watch how I talk
And it's still wolf gang bitch watch how I bark
Wallace still tripping on shit that I bought
But, I really do not care the cost cause okra

Man, now they go
I cut off some friends
