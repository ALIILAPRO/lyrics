		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eight, seven, six, six, six
Five, four, three, two, one, zero

Yeah
I'm a popstar threat and I'm not dead yet
Got a super dread bet with an angel drug head
Like a dead beat winner, I wanna be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
It's evil sonic, it's pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities its all I want to be

If you're 555, then I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
But if you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this and I bleed for you
Still you look at my face like I'm somebody new
Toy, nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine because you're made of everything I'm not

If you're 555, then I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
Well if you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic? Yeah

Heretic, yeah

Thirty seconds, sixteen, eight, four, lemme tell you why
I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest
They're listening, clamoring
All the money in the world can't buy me
Go ahead, lie to me
Tell me again how you're tortured
I want to know how you fallowed your orders so well
You're full of shit
You had a dream, but this ain't it

If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666

If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Heretic, yeah
