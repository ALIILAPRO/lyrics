		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two heartbeats, never in time
Two lovers over enemy lines
I know we're broken but don't wanna believe it

You're so close to saying the words
Way past the point of any return
It's such a shame and I don't wanna believe it

Oh, if I could go back to that evening we met
Trembling hands as I'd ask for your number again
You saw me different then
Oh, when I held your heart in my hand

So, if you're gonna leave me
Just leave me slowly
Let's make it last
Just one more dance
Before the moment's passed
I'd rather that you lay here
Than leave me lonely
So stay for a while
Just one more mile
Before we say goodbye

Two shadows of the people we were
So close to finding heaven on earth
It's such a shame and I don't wanna believe it

Oh, if I could go back to that evening we met
Trembling hands as I'd ask for your number again
You saw me different then
Oh, when I held your heart in my hand

So, if you're gonna leave me
Just leave me slowly
Let's make it last
Just one more dance
Before the moment's passed
I'd rather that you lay here
Than leave me lonely
Stay for a while
Just one more mile
Before we say goodbye

(Yeah)
(Ah-ah)

Oh, I'd kill to go back to that evening we met
Trembling hands as I'd ask for your number again
You saw me different then
Oh, when I held your heart in my hand

So, if you're gonna leave me
Just leave me slowly

(If you're gonna leave) So, baby, if you leave me
(Leave me slowly) Just leave me slowly
Let's make it last
Just one more dance
Before the moment's passed
(I'd rather that you lay here) I'd rather that you lay here
(Than leave me lonely) Than leave me lonely
Stay for a while
Just one more mile
Before we say goodbye

(If you're gonna leave, leave me slowly)
Stay for a while
Just one more mile
Before we say goodbye
