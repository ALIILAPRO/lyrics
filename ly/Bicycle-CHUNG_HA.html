		<p>
		  Get up 빙빙 도니
I know it 너의 떨림
미로 속 그 끝에 넌 (ya ah ya ah ya)
이제 빨리 move it
Uh 계속되는 멈칫
Te amo, I'll give you more

I'm up here say ya ya ya
따라와 faster ya
호흡을 뱉어 so hard
내 방식 그대로 찢고 나가
더러운 시선 신경 쓰지 마
미친 척 밟아 let's go on a ride
Get on my bike, let's go

Get out of my way-ah!
보여줄게 how I like it
Do it my way-ah!
And it goes like broom broom broom broom

Get out of my way-ah!
고갤 들어 날 봐 face it
Do it my way-ah!
And it goes like broom broom broom broom

I'm getting higher
You're tripping lower
And when I say it's done, it's freaking over
And I ride it, I ride it
You like it when I ride it, I ride it, I ride it
Gimme that

My sweat's dripping down my back
I got ice decorating my neck
I'll be the strongest thing don't miss it
'Cause I'm the baddest queen
I'm sicker than all of them
Gossipin' low keys don't bring me no fun
Come on, I'll slay you from tip o' my tongue
You wanna know? and no what she likes?
Sit back and watch me ride

I'm up here say ya ya ya
따라와 faster ya
호흡을 뱉어 so hard
내 방식 그대로 찢고 나가
더러운 시선 신경 쓰지 마
미친 척 밟아 let's go on a ride
Get on my bike, let's go

Get out of my way-ah!
보여줄게 how I like it
Do it my way-ah!
And it goes like broom broom broom broom

Get out of my way-ah!
고갤 들어 날 봐 face it
Do it my way-ah!
And it goes like broom broom broom broom

I'm getting higher
You're tripping lower
And when I say it's done, it's freaking over
And I ride it, I ride it
You like it when I ride it, I ride it, I ride it
Gimme that (oh oh oh yeah)

Ride ride ride it (bicycle!)
You know how I like it (bicycle!)
Ride ride ride it (bicycle!)
You know how I like it

설레던 그 눈빛
타오르는 공기
Again alright with me (ya ah ya ah ya)
벅차오른 순간
몸을 숙여 다시
Together one, two, three

Get out of my way-ah!
보여줄게 how I like it
Do it my way-ah!
And it goes like broom broom broom broom

Get out of my way-ah!
고갤 들어 날 봐 face it
Do it my way-ah!
And it goes like broom broom broom broom

I'm getting higher
You're tripping lower
And when I say it's done, it's freaking over
And I ride it, I ride it
You like it when I ride it, I ride it, I ride it
Gimme that
