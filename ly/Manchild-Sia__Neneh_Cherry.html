		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it the pain of the drinking or the Sunday sinking feeling? Oh
The car never seems to work
When it's late, your girlfriend's on a date
And the hero with her in your dream in your sleep seemed like you
Turn around, ask yourself
Turn around, ask yourself

Manchild, will you ever win?
Manchild, look at the state you're in, yeah

Could you go undercover and sell your brand new lover?
Could you be someone else for a night?
Maybe someone else will love you
You'd sell your soul for a tacky song
Like the one you hear on the radio
Turn around, ask yourself
Turn around, ask yourself

Manchild, will you ever win?
Manchild, look at the state you're in, yeah
Manchild, he will make you cry
Manchild, manchild, manchild

From Monday down to Friday
You're working on another man's car
Or is it in the factory?
It doesn't matter where you are

Just turn around and ask yourself, is this communication?
Accentuate the positive and give some illustration
See, manchild, you're no one, you turn the microphone on
Control communication when I'm kicking it and so on
To the point that I need the air that I breathe
Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive
For the meantime another mean rhyme (I keep on saying it)
I know what the time is and the crowd will keep on playing it
Through the speaker boxes, loud's my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles and words in steady doses
Enough R-E-S-P-E and C-T
Respect yourself, express, no stress, the mic is easy
Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe
(Ask yourself)

Manchild, will you ever win?
Manchild, look at the state you're in, yeah
Manchild, he will make you cry
Manchild, manchild, manchild
He's the apple of your eye

Once bitten, twice shy, why don't you bite me again?
Just take it in right and go tell your friend (tell your friend)
Are you ready for the words? I turn the microphone on
A figure of speech to reach you at the back and so on
The style I'm stimulating dance floors
Raise your body temperatures now and this demands for
Power's in the amp', you know loud's my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles, words in heavy doses
