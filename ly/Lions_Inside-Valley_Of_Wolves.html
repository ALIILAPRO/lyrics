		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you leave me to my own device
I never had to compromise
This city's like a jungle
Gotta make it mine 
Put my fears right out of sight 
Beat the hustle better get it right 
In a game where the strong survive
Only the strong survive 

These chains will not hold me down 
They'll break and fall to the ground 
Cant tame these lions inside 
The power is reigning like
Thunder ready for a fight 
These lions inside 
These lions inside 

Yeah these lions inside 
Yeah these lions inside 

I had to learn to be the hero 
Started only here from zero 
In a city like a jungle I had to get mine 
Never give, you gotta take 
Be the catapult to storm the gates 
Cause a champion is never giving in 
Seeing thru to till end of days 
Till end of days 

These chains will not hold me down 
They'll break and fall to the ground 
Cant tame these lions inside 
The power is reigning like
Thunder ready for a fight 
These lions inside 
These lions inside 

These lions inside 
Can’t tame these lions inside 

The ground that they're walking ain't cutting thru this skin 
Huntin’ down their prey till the bitter end 
The ground that they're walking ain't cutting thru this skin 
Huntin’ down their prey till the bitter end 
The ground that they're walking ain't cutting thru this skin 
Huntin’ down their prey let the games begin 

These chains will not hold me down 
They'll break and fall to the ground 
Cant tame these lions inside 
The power is reigning like
Thunder ready for a fight 
These lions inside 
These lions inside 

Can’t tame these lions inside 
Can’t tame these lions inside 

The ground that they're walking ain't cutting thru this skin 
Huntin’ down their prey till the bitter end 
The ground that they're walking ain't cutting thru this skin 
Huntin’ down their prey let the games begin
