		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Substantial and Nujabes still doin' this
And it's infinite
Hydeout promo, let's get into it, uh

Waiting for the clouds to part
Waiting to be out of the dark
If our future's bright, then the present is a overcast
And we want it to be over fast, let's shine

Got to get above the clouds without a aircraft
That is without a doubt such a rare task
Finding it hard to grin or just share laughs
So you vent when that drum hat and snare clash
No plan B, plan A is weak
Mentally and physically drained
And you can't sleep
Rent's a month overdue as of last week
A shadow of your future self below a vast peak
While people walk past like they can't speak
Ignored coz without rich shit, you're piss poor
Quit more drowning your spirit, with liquor
And victor, isn't a realistic picture
But you still take the shot and develop it
For the hell of it, and pray when you'll wake you'll be relevant
And put your best on, you're no longer worse off
Slaving at a job you hate, for a jerk off
You just wanna be kissed by the sun
Where your daughter's always safe in the midst of having fun
Having some will more than due when you used to having none
Disregard the chatter from know-it-all's who haven't won, while you're

Waiting for the clouds to part
Waiting to be out of the dark
If our future's bright, then the present is overcast
And we want it to be over fast, let's shine

Parents couldn't do the job they signed up fo'
Gave you life, but they should've gave you much mo'
Won't judge, but I surely won't applaud them
They lost, and somebody gotta' raise their child for them
Now you're in and out of various households and juvy
Cross Paths of ghetto fab to the white collar and boushi
Who answer the call of duty, or is it truly for a check?
But regardless of they motives, they feel you owe them respect
You don't know how to act like you got a part in a movie
But lack direction
How do you show love, if you never had affection
Dying slow brah, like you got a bad infection
Ain't no band-aid for man-made self-hate
It heal slow, but I'm not sure of you'll wait
Education is the medication, to get yourself straight
The war within you reached a stalemate
But good gotta win in the end, or else jail waits
Broken soul cell mates, Followed by hell's gates
For Bad apples sell failure waits in the belly of the beast
And it's never gonna cease till you chose to elevate
I'm ready when you are to celebrate, till then I'll be

Waiting for the clouds to part
Waiting to be out of the dark
If our future's bright, then the present is overcast
And we want it to be over fast, let's shine
