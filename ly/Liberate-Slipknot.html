		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Liberate, my madness (one of me, all of you)
Liberate, my madness
I just want to
Liberate, my madness (one of me, all of you)
Liberate, my madness

Section off myself
Put a wall up/what the hell have I done
Keep the dog at bay
Survive by saving me
Values and the game
Not a fuck-up, not a part of your lie
I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond!

Stand off of the shit
Back off or I'll spit
So soft, you forgot
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out
Liberate my madness

Liberate, my madness (one of me, all of you)
Liberate, my madness
I just want to
Liberate, my madness (one of me, all of you)
Liberate, my madness

I am not ashamed
What is vital, isn't always humane
You can break in vain
But you can't break away
Even in my face
Lotta bullshit, not a lotta the truth
I can't see from here
But I can smell your fear

Back off of the shit
Stand off or I'll spit
So soft, you forgot
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out

Saved, you're such a slave, I don't expect a name
you don't care, I wasn't witness
I can't be a part of a system such as this
Hard eyes, glow right, in my, darkness, again
With the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness
Fuck this, how long have I had this?
I don't need this, outta my business
Insert, engage, betray, my god

Fraud
Fraud
Fraud

Liberate, my madness
Liberate, my madness
I just want to
Liberate, my madness
Liberate, my madness
