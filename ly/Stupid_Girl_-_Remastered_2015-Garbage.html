		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You pretend you're high
Pretend you're bored
Pretend you're anything
Just to be adored
And what you need
Is what you get

Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in faith
Don't believe in anything
That you can't break

stupid girl
stupid girl
All you had you wasted
All you had you wasted

What drives you on
Can drive you mad
A million lies to sell yourself
Is all you ever had

Don't believe in love
Don't believe in hate
Don't believe in anything
That you can't waste

stupid girl
stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake it

Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in pain
Don't believe in anyone
That you can't tame

stupid girl
stupid girl
All you had you wasted
All you had you wasted

Stupid girl
Stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
I can't believe you fake it

Stupid girl
Stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake it

Stupid girl
