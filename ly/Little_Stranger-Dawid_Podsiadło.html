		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey there, little stranger
There're questions I need to ask
How do you say, I'm sorry?
How can you earn back somebody's trust?

You must think I'm crazy but I get it that it's hard
You see there's a person I've really hurt

Hey there, little stranger
You're right I don't even know your name
Such a mysterious creature
I've stumbled upon my way

What is the answer, can you tell?
I swear I feel like I've never felt
I look around and there's no one here
Don't tell me you're just another one of my dreams

The walls are crushing the windows open and I fall
Flying through all the mistakes I have done
I see it clearly, oh, all of the disappointed faces
I see the damage I've caused in their own spaces

I was a liar, I was not worth of being trusted
I was a mugger, mugged closest people stole their hearts and
Now I know that's why I am alone
Hey, little stranger, thank God, you're finally home

I think you've got me in a place you wanted to
You were meeting me, I was not meeting you
It's time to act, only one thing left for me
I need to wake up from my flawless dream

Hey there , little stranger
I think I get it now
