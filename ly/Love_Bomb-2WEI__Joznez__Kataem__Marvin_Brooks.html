		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your hands in the air
And your weapons on the ground
Put your hands up in the air
We gonna murder with this sound
We gonna drop a love bomb
We gonna drop a love bomb
And blow you away
 
I hold it down, ain't no holding back or holding up
Hold up a trophy cup, a simple toast don't hold enough
Blowing up
Can't reverse the damage so you know it's us
Try to reach, all I know is speed, all you know is dust
Way too different fabrics that we cut from, I don't fold for nun'
My story gon' need an award and yours need a coroner
I kill that then build stacks
You got real will, but it still lasts
I can't relate
You a gas can to a lit match
Might blow you away
 
Check the evidence
Living in yo preference
Could've had it too if only you just put a bet on him
Guess it's finally setting in huh
They upset again huh
Got em pressed, coming in heavy as the pressures been
Imma make em sound it out for those days I was counted out
5, 4, 3 seconds till they all without a doubt
Imma make em hesitate to hate it when that record play
3, 2, 1 show some love cause you know we bout to detonate
