		  Run it up

He told me throw it back, abow (yop, abow)
So I sit this motherfucker on his lap, abow (yop, yop, yop)
Boy, come and make this ass fat (yop, yop)
And no, we can't talk if you ain't spendin' racks (yop, yop, yop, racks)
And yes, I'm Ms. Nasty From the Back (yop, abow)
Then I turn around and threw it in his lap, abow
Then I turn around and threw it in his lap

I'm like, "Baby, take your phone out and record me" (record me)
Watch it on the road, you know that make me horny (make me horny)
I got 'em toppin', rode the dick just like some Forgis (yeah, yeah)
Blowin' up my phone, these other bitches boring
The way I throw it back, I'm knowin' that my shit look gorgeous (damn)
Slob on his knob, make that dick enormous (mwah)
He tryna come and see me while I'm tourin'
I'm a rich bitch, so a broke nigga can't afford this (ayy)

Throw it back, throw it back, don't know how to act
Throw it back, throw it back, don't know how to act
Make him work for it while it clap, clap, clap
Then I turn around and threw it in his lap, abow

He told me throw it back, abow (yop, abow)
So I sit this motherfucker on his lap, abow (yop, yop, yop)
Boy, come and make this ass fat (yop, yop)
And no, we can't talk if you ain't spendin' racks (yop, yop, yop, racks)

Look back at it
Got him hooked on this pussy like a crack addict
Make that nigga lose his breath like he asthmatic
I don't want no minute man, he a Jack rabbit, that's a red flag
Ass fat, I could barely fit in these jeans
Make a wish, he say he want the girl of his dreams
Ass fat, I could barely fit in these jeans (ayy)
Make a wish, he say he want the girl of his dreams (huh? Run it up)

Haha, I don't want no cheap nigga, you know my name is Kash
Money make me cum and he been waitin' on this ass (that's right)
If he play games, I play with his heart (period)
Booty on the ball, watch me break his ass apart (ayy)
This a new weave, keep your hand up out my head (mane)
Told 'em bring the hookah, they brought bands out instead (Kash)
If looks could kill, they'd drop a band on my head (hahaha)
They like, "How you look good in some sneakers and sweats?"
I hate niggas that be cappin', that go Mitchell & Ness
It's givin' bougie, these bitches gotta give it a rest (girl, give it a rest)
And it's obvious that these bitches obsessed (you in love)
Now, look back at it while I'm lookin' in your soul (abow)
Put your hands on my neck, I like my niggas in control (abow)
Dick so bomb, got me talkin' like I'm Spanish (ooh)
Come here, Papi Chulo, come and talk me out my panties (papi Chulo)

He told me throw it back, abow (yop, abow)
So I sit this motherfucker on his lap, abow (yop, yop, yop)
Boy, come and make this ass fat (yop, yop)
And no, we can't talk if you ain't spendin' racks (yop, yop, yop, racks)
And yes, I'm Ms. Nasty From the Back (yop, abow)
