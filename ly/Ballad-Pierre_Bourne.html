		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

If this what love is (yeah)
If this what love is
Then I don't want it
I don't want it
I'll ignore it
You adore wastin' time
I can't afford it
What's more important?
You sure are gorgeous

Worried 'bout your ex
Worried 'bout your ex
You should be worried 'bout what's next
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Worried 'bout your ex
Worryin' got you stressed (hey)
Hurry, don't get left (hey)
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

You overthink a lot (ay)
My feelings you forgot (ay)
You forgot all the time (yeah)
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Pullin' up to your spot (yeah)
That's like an hour drive (huh)
I come to you a lot (hey)
I'm fuckin' you a lot (wait)
I'm lovin' you a lot (skrrt, skrrt)
I don't wanna stop (uh)
Baby, you're my rock (uh)
Baby, you're my rock (uh)
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Baby, you're my rock (skrrt, skrrt)
I don't wanna stop
Lookin' at my watch
How much time I got? (wait)
Sex is on the clock (skrrt, skrrt)
Grab the Magnum box (ay)
Hit her from the side
She said that's her spot (wait)
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Hit her in my condo
She might send the drop (wait)
I can't trust these thots (wait)
Flyin' out a lot (wait)
Sellin' box and top

If this what love is (yeah)
If this what love is (yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Then I don't want it
I don't want it
I'll ignore it
You adore wastin' time (yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
I can't afford it
What's more important?
You sure are gorgeous

Worried 'bout your ex
Worried 'bout your ex
You should be worried 'bout what's next
Worried 'bout your ex
Worryin' got you stressed (hey)
Hurry, don't get left (hey)
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Damn Pi'erre, where'd you find this?
