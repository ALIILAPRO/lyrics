		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something 'bout the simple sound of morning
That let's me know that I'm alive
The way the sun is painting every corner
All of my fears start to subside
There was a time
When all the boys got to know you
That was the time of your life

But now the fault lines on my face
Are pushing you away
So, oh my darlin', I am leaving you tonight

There's something 'bout the simple sound of morning
That makes me feel we could survive
We used to lock ourselves inside the bedroom
But that was before we came to lie
Now if I make one mistake
Will you just drive the car away
And come back in the middle of he night

And though the fault lines on my face
Are telling me to stay
Oh, I am leaving without saying goodbye

Oh, I am leaving you without saying goodbye
