(One, two, three, go)

I think I'm ready for ya
You take me higher, get me to cloud nine
Go up to the light
Yeah, you can say all you want
It doesn't matter 'cause we'll shine tonight
I won't let you go

So, baby, give me more
Don't leave me dancing on my own
Yeah, you can pull me on
And I can make your body glow
'Cause you, you and I, I will run the show
In this moment, you're all I want

Hold me until the end of time
'Cause we are written in the sky
Get close to my lips
Lock you up in my kiss
Tell me you will be mine tonight
You will be mine tonight

Be my lover
Be my lover

Now let me do it to ya
You got my heartbeat beating like a trump
I'll show you how it's done
Yeah, you can take all you want
Do what you like 'cause I'm all yours tonight
Love my body right

So, baby, give me more
Don't leave me dancing on my own
Yeah, you can pull me on
And I can make your body glow
'Cause you, you and I, I will run the show
In this moment, you're all I want

Hold me until the end of time
'Cause we are written in the sky
Get close to my lips
Lock you up in my kiss
Tell me you will be mine tonight

Be my lover
Be my lover
Be my lover

Caught in a moment, it's just you and me
Where have you been all my life?
Come be my lover and take me away
Touch me and turn up my heart
Yeah

Get close to my lips
Lock you up in my kiss
Tell me you will be mine tonight
You will be mine tonight

Be my lover
Be my lover
Be my lover
Be my lover
Be my lover
