		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to our freak show, come meet my monsters
Oh, such a fine collection of stranger things

My patience running thinner on this melting clock
Cerebrum jailed with thoughts most would consider rot
To think you're any different from an animal
A creature sick as you should be put down
But I can't help myself

Ooh-na-na-na-na, ooh-na-na-na-na
Ooh-na-na-na-na, ooh-na-na-na-na

Welcome to our freak show, come meet my monsters
Oh, such a fine collection of stranger things

Please, don't hide your imperfections
Nature took two tries to make the man in white
No, I don't mind, you are a beauty
Not temptation, you're my creation

Freak o' Friday night, know I'm the main attraction
Basket acrobat, they wanna see some action
Tinkering with my design, twist and tame my feral mind
Play with me 'til you've found another toy
Let me be your freak show, I could be your favorite monster
Rattle my whole cage, remind me why I can't be fostered
Let me be your freak show, I could be your favorite monster
Lock me up, don't let me out 'cause you know I can't help myself

Ooh-na-na-na-na, ooh-na-na-na-na
Ooh-na-na-na-na, ooh-na-na-na-na

Welcome to our freak show, come meet my monsters
Oh, such a fine collection of stranger things

You're wasting, you're wasting all
Of your time finding a cure when there's no disease
You're wasting, you're wasting all
Of your talent on an audience that sees a freak

Ooh-na-na-na-na, ooh-na-na-na-na
Ooh-na-na-na-na
Can't help myself

Welcome to our freak show, come meet my monsters
Oh, such a fine collection of stranger things
