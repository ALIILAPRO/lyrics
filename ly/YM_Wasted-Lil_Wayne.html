No Ceilings
Uh

Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President got 'em in the White house naked
Look at the clock and it says right now
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money, baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti matte black, where they do that at?
South Beach Miami, hoe I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose and I'm higher than Geronimo
And I got them tools, tell them boys it could get mechanical
Now pop that pussy like a .44
I turn her round and bend her over like a low blow
It's Young Money, baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put the other niggas on a hiatus
Beat your bitch with the pump if she deny data
'Cause I'll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I'll make my girl cum first then I'll arrive later
I shake you pussies up, I'm her vibrator, haha
Keep getting money like hell yeah
This shits so good it don't even smell bad
And you can tell dad, that I'm a motherfucker
You niggas best not slip, Ice Road Truckers
Light pole barrel, chopper stupid long
New Orleans nigga, I get Super Dome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me
We on, nigga, let-let them hoes know
Young Money lay 'em down like old folks
You coming with it, we coming for it
Plenty to go around, now watch the money orbit
Real shit people, now just absorb it
I try to pay attention but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag I need an ad for it
And I don't like to brag, so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it global warming
If we gon' do it, dawg, lets do it now
I am more animal than the zoo allowed
Put me in the wild, I'll be there for a while
You niggas little league, call 'em Curacao
Energizer money, it keep going
I'm laid up, I'm free throwing
Who rebounding? Who gives a shit
Fuck dat, I got twenty seven years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your missus
You are local news, I'm 60 minutes
I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office, guess I'm fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still ice in our crosses, keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F baby, the F is for forensics
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
Okay, you doing your thing
Well, things change, you plain Jane
I'm diverse, I save the world second
And I get high first
I'm a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise, where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like grandma's pussy
I'm always good, like grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time ticker
I'm always strapped, Vietnam, nigga
We are fine nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes
I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
Young Money, baby
And the building grows as we look up
Where did the ceilings go?
