		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one loves me
No one loves me
No one loves me
Nobody loves me
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do
Nobody loves me
Nobody loves me
Nobody loves me
No one loves me
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do
Love 'til infinity

Love evolving
Love evolving
Love evolving
Love evolving

Our love's forever, our love's evolvin'
My heart is rushin', I feel like Stalin
Baby, ain't no pausin', ain't no stalling
Always all the time around you I'm revolving
All day, hey, bae, you running through my mind like you be joggin'
Foreplay replay, eat it up like I be starvin'
Don't trip on the bullshit, ain't no problem we ain't solvin'
Mercy, mercy, let's get-get it on like Marvin
Sexual healing, plant my seed inside your garden
Ed Sheeran, 'cause I'm in love with your body and your Dolly Partons
I'm sharing my thoughts, my mind, my body, my heart and soul with you
And I just gotta let you know

No one loves me
No one loves me
No one loves me
Nobody loves me
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do
Nobody loves me
Nobody loves me
Nobody loves me
No one loves me
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do
Love 'til infinity

My chick is a dime, my chick is a bad bitch
We dine all the time, eat out like a savage
I'm on her bottom, she stay on top like an attic
Wordplay, okay, hey I'ma beat it up, do damage
She got what I need so stay in the punani like a habitat
And she gonna have my kid like a cabbage patch
Go to work like a doctor and this is the aftermath
That's sex education, I gave it to her after math
Girl, our relation is kinda like chemistry
I like your equation, I like your symmetry
Yeah, I love your mood, your ways, your energy
I'm feeling you, you feelin' me, you killin' me

No one loves me
No one loves me
No one loves me
Nobody loves me
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do
Nobody loves me
Nobody loves me
Nobody loves me
No one loves me
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do, do, do
The way you do
Love 'til infinity

My chick, hot chick
Fly love with the wings on it
Lifed her, wifed her
So bad, put the ring on it
Put the house, put the keys on it
She loves when I throw that D on it
Uptown downtown
6-9, honey, I be on it
She like when I send that freaky text, hot sex on the DM
I got three kids with her, you know their mom when you see 'em
When in Rome, no Trojan needed, Coliseum
She's my heart, my art and my muse in my museum
Let me frame this love shit
Feelin' like Prince on the dove shit
Started off on the club shit
Now we over here on the next level hug shit
XO, XO, love infinity on it
Love is golden, golden showers
Black Eyed Pea on it, done
