		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love (your love)

There's a limit to you care
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare?
There's a limit to your care

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

There's a limit to you care
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare? (There's a limit to your care)
Is it truth or dare? (There's a limit to your care)

There's a limit to your care
So carelessly there
There's a limit to your care

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion (like a waterfall in slow motion)
Like a map with no ocean (like a map with no ocean)
There's a limit to your love
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love (your love)
