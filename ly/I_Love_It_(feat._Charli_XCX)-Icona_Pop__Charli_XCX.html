		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care, I love it
I don't care

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care, I love it
I don't care

You're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way
You want me down on Earth, but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch
You're from the '70s, but I'm a '90s bitch

I love it
I love it

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care, I love it
I don't care, I love it, I love it
I don't care, I love it
I don't care

You're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way
You want me down on Earth, but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch
You're from the '70s, but I'm a '90s bitch

I don't care, I love it
I don't care, I love it, I love it
I don't care, I love it
I don't care, I love it, I love it
I don't care
I love it
