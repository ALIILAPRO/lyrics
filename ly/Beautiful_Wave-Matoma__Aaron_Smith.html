		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got used to losing all I knew was cuts and bruises 
Then you brought me 'round
Tired of staying up like I'm a shipwreck on the rocks 
Yeah, I was coming down
'Cause I fell in your arms, no air in my lungs
Somehow you just brought me back to life again 
I really, really don't know how

I see the sun rising in your face
I feel the blood running through my veins
I can't forget, no, I won't replace
Because you're numbing all the pain
Can we dive a little deeper?
'Cause I really wanna feel ya
I see the sun rising in your face
Like I'm drowning

Taken by a beautiful wave
Taken by a beautiful wave
Taken by a beautiful wave
Dive a little deeper
'Cause I really wanna feel ya
I see the sun rising in your face
Like I'm drowning
Taken by a beautiful wave

Had a million secrets wrote them down on tiny pieces 
Then I opened fire
Shooting down the satellites and praying that the stars align
Don't leave me high
Can I fall in your arms? Stay here in my heart
Somehow you just brought me back to life again 
The first time that I called you mine

I see the sun rising in your face
I feel the blood running through my veins
I can't forget, no, I won't replace
Because you're numbing all the pain
Can we dive a little deeper?
'Cause I really wanna feel ya
I see the sun rising in your face
Like I'm drowning

Taken by a beautiful wave
Taken by a beautiful wave
Taken by a beautiful wave
Dive a little deeper
'Cause I really wanna feel ya
I see the sun rising in your face
Like I'm drowning
Taken by a beautiful wave

Taken by a beautiful wave
Taken by a beautiful wave
Taken by a beautiful wave
Dive a little deeper
Cause I really wanna feel ya
I see the sun rising in your face
Like I'm drowning
Taken by a beautiful wave

Taken by a beautiful wave
Taken by a beautiful wave
