		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pussy nigga, pull up, crash out about your bae (boy, you pussy)
Lil' bitch, come dance battle with my drac' (brrt)
You been fucked your bag up when you punched Ri' in the face
Talking about fashion week, you sparing who?
Come punch me in my face (pussy)
It ain't nun' but a fade, you know you lost to Frank (Frank Ocean?)
Niggas ran in your house, tied up your aunt 'cause you ain't pay (auntie)
This bullet got your name (Chris)
Don't ever bring up Take, pussy (DJ Durel, pussy)

You know half of y'all niggas some hoes out here (pussy)
I'm talking 'bout like, these niggas bleed once a month, type shit
Bitch

I call your ho for pussy, (brrt) I hit your ho for pussy (brrt)
I did a favor coming to save you but you gon' owe me, pussy (owe me)
I'm on the edge, don't push me (don't), you work with the feds, you pussy (12)
Commit a crime and ain't did no time, can't fake it, we know that you pussy (we know it)
Pussy, (you) pussy, (you) pussy, (you) pussy nigga
Time after time, I pull up and wipe me a lil' baby nose (pussy nigga, wipe it)
Dropping a dime and pillow talking to these bitches and hoes (pussy nigga, drop it)
Glitter ain't gold (pussy nigga, naw), you been exposed (exposed, pussy)

Lil' boy wanna die 'bout some coochie? (Bow)
You still fucked up 'bout Karrueche? (Damn)
You tried to beat up Teyana, (no cap) but Usher wouldn't let you do it (Usher)
The cocaine got 'em, your honor (white), bipolar disorder, no wonder
You was the greatest, nigga, you fumbled, going out sad, I'm watching you crumble
Why they got Quavo out here going back and forth with a singer that turned to a junkie?
Never got light skin versus brown skin, nigga finna divide the country (go)
Nigga, you ain't been in the trenches
We stomping the yard, you know how that ended (stomp)
Want smoke with me? OHB mean fighting over hoes and bitches (OHB)
Who gassed you up to put that out?
Yeah, that was shitty, nigga (on God)
I can take a model bitch and make a Saweetie, nigga (bitch)
Crackhead Michael Jackson, bitch, you better beat it, nigga
I'm still fucked up about Takeoff, I want who did it, nigga (uh)
But that's some real street shit, back to the industry (for real)
Where your baby mamas at? Know they got plenty tea (nigga, fuck that)
Pussy, every time you see me, keep that energy (keep that energy)
Can't believe I gotta beat you 'bout some women beef

I call your ho for pussy, (brrt) I hit your ho for pussy (brrt)
I did a favor coming to save you but you gon' owe me, pussy (owe me)
I'm on the edge, don't push me (don't), you work with the feds, you pussy (12)
Commit a crime and ain't did no time, can't fake it, we know that you pussy (we know it)
Pussy, (you) pussy, (you) pussy, (you) pussy nigga
Time after time, I pull up and wipe me a lil' baby nose (pussy nigga, wipe it)
Dropping a dime and pillow talking to these bitches and hoes (pussy nigga, drop it)
Glitter ain't gold (pussy nigga, naw), you been exposed (exposed, pussy)
