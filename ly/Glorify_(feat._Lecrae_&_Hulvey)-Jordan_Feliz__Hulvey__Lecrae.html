		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

You gave a heavenly breath
And now it's air in our chests
That's why we're singing it back to You (back to You)
For every battle You've won
For everything that You've done
And everything that You're gonna do (gonna do)

Seen too much to ever doubt it
Feels so good, I wanna shout it
Yeah, when I really think about it
All I wanna do, all I wanna do is

Glorify Your name
We came to glorify Your name
That's why we came (that's why we came)
That's why we came (that's why we came)
To lift Your name
Come on and sing (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Glorify Your name
We came to glorify Your name
That's why we came (that's why we came)
Yeah, we were made (yeah, we were made)
To lift Your name
All the church sing (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

So let Your glory be heard
Until it covers the earth
Don't wanna wait for the rocks to shout (rocks to shout)
We got a reason to praise (ay)
This is the song of the saved (ay)
No, we ain't gonna turn it down (turn it down)

Every day we got a reason
'Cause church ain't only on the weekend
Yeah, when I get that kind of feeling
All I wanna do, all we wanna do is

Glorify Your name
We came to glorify Your name
That's why we came (that's why we came)
That's why we came (that's why we came)
To lift Your name
Come on and sing (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Glorify Your name
We came to glorify Your name
That's why we came (that's why we came)
Yeah, we were made (yeah, we were made)
To lift Your name
All the church sing (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Every day, every day, we're gonna
Glorify, glorify
Every day, every day, we're gonna
Glorify, glorify
Every day we got a reason (every day, every day, we're gonna)
'Cause church ain't only on the weekend (glorify, glorify)
Yeah, when I get that kind of feeling (every day, every day, we're gonna)
Oh, I gotta sing

Glorify Your name
We came to glorify Your name
That's why we came (ay)
That's why we came (ay)
To lift Your name
Come on and sing, come on and sing
Glorify Your name
We came to glorify Your name
That's why we came (ay)
Yeah, we were made (ay)
To lift Your name
All the church sing (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

Every day, every day, we're gonna
Glorify, glorify
Every day, every day, we're gonna
Glorify, glorify
Come on and sing
Glorify Your name
We came to glorify Your name
