		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Going down like a dead man walking
One step from a body in a coffin
Just one, one of the fallen
Waking up to a blood moon, howling
Can't drown it out, even with the medicine
Tearing through me like a bullet of adrenaline

Arms heavy, face down on a death bed
Blame the gods while choking on the violence
In the end, silence is deafening

Can you hear the crowd like a thousand sirens?
In the night like thunder striking
The sickness is rising, the angels are crying
That's the sound of a world on fire

Stressed out, head trauma, took a beating
Takes more than a pill to numb the feeling
Bang, bang, no mercy for the healing
Oh, twenty dead without a fight, without a reason
Twenty more in a cop car, bleeding
All tryna win a war without a meaning

Can you hear the crowd like a thousand sirens?
In the night like thunder striking
The sickness is rising, the angels are crying
That's the sound of a world on fire
World on fire
World on fire

Arms heavy, face down on a death bed
Blame the gods while choking on the violence
In the end, silence is deafening

Can you hear the crowd like a thousand sirens?
In the night like thunder striking
The sickness is rising, the angels are crying
That's the sound of a world on fire
Fire

Yeah, can you hear the crowd like a thousand sirens?
In the night like thunder striking
The sickness is rising, the angels are crying
World on fire (world on fire, world on fire, yeah)
World on fire, world on fire, world on fire)
The sickness is rising, the angels are crying
That's the sound of a world on fire
