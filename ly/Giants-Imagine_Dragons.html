		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You take a hit of anything
To escape it all or suffocating
The sharpen blade of reality
Sometimes it wanna hurt me
I know it's hard to hear but I'm 
Waitin' for the new year
Don't wanna waste my life chasin' white
Try to swim towards the light

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety 
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la) got so tired of feelin' numb
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la) but take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety 

Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly I'm killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to the ceiling
Always rock 'n' roll 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'
Now I'm shaking your knife, sweating the sheets out
Grinding my teeth out but still the world will glamorize it all

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety 
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la) got so tired of feelin' numb
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la) but take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety 

If I could leave one thing for you
It's exactly what not to do
I'm so proud of you

Take a look what I've become
Oh, take a look what I've 

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety 
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la) got so tired of feelin' numb
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la) but take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
