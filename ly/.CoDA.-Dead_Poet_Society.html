		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right babe, you listen, I'm done, yeah, I'm leaving
I'm getting weak, feeling tweaked out and faded
God help you, darling, 'cause my love is drying up

You feel so lovely when you touch me
But I can't do this anymore
Your nails on my back feel that summer sadness
Baby, it's too late to talk
I feel like we're drifting apart

Talk shit, babe
Say it like you wanna leave
You love me like cocaine, yeah
Don't lie, get it right
Need me every night
You love me like cocaine

I heard your friends say that you think you're better off
Don't pretend to love me when you're feeling alone
I need to know the truth, 'cause you're talking like you're fed up

I feel like we're drifting apart

Talk shit, babe
Say it like you wanna leave
You love me like cocaine, yeah
Don't lie, get it right
Need me every night
You love me like, you love me like
You love me like cocaine, yeah
You love me like, you love me like

I don't want you, darling, I don't want you, darling
I don't want you, darling
You don't love me, darling, you don't love me, darling
You don't love me, darling
I don't love you, darling, I don't love you, darling
I don't love you, darling

Talk shit, bitch
Say it like you wanna leave
You love me like cocaine, yeah
Don't lie, get it right
Need me every night
You love me like, you love me like
You love me like cocaine, yeah
You love me like, I love you like
