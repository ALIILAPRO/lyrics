		  (This call is from a federal prison)

Uh, yeah, we ready at any time
Got me racin' for yo' heart, the beat is the finish line (line, line)
Uh, we ready at any time (yeah)
When yo' loyalty in question, the love is on the line (this call is from a federal prison) 
(The love is on the line)
Uh, we ready at any time (the love is on the line)
Got me racin' for yo' heart, the beat is the finish line, uh (bang, bang)
We ready at any time
When yo' loyalty in question, your love is on the line (the love is on the line)

(This call is from a federal prison)
Well, when me and you first got back in contact
I had eight years, but
Startin' next year, in 2023, my release date will be like 2028
So that's like five years or so or change maybe (oh shit)

We ready at any time
Got me racin' for yo' heart, the beat is the finish line (I wasn't ready)
Uh, we ready at any time
When yo' loyalty in question, the love is on the floor

I have people in my life now, as far as my friend Jason, which the world call IDK
I shielded you away from the stuff that I was goin' through 
As far as bein' a high ranking Blood member
Some people got bills, some people got habits 
Or some people got expectations
Expectations to me is a habit because you got to provide that
And if you don't, you basically nobody
