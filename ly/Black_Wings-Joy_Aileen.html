		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything's cold, I cannot breathe.
Darkness and fear, it's been foretold.
I couldn't hide; they put a sword in my hand.
They said it's my faith to protect our land.

I'll be strong, I'll be brave, but what if I fall?
There's a fog creeping in, surrounding us all.

'Cause the evil did strike and the black wings did fly.
And silence fell when the first blood was spilled.
Am I ready to fight? Am I ready to die?
'Cause Alduin has to be killed. 

Lost in the woods, I heard them shout.
Can't let them know how I'm filled with doubt.
In High Hrothgar he said it's all up to me.
But what if I can't set Skyrim free?

There's a fire in the sky, surrounding us all.
I'll be strong, I'll be brave, but what if I fall?

'Cause the evil did strike and the black wings did fly.
And silence fell when the first blood was spilled.
Am I ready to fight? Am I ready to die?
'Cause Alduin has to be killed.  

Everything's cold, I cannot breathe.
