		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm

I don't bother anyone
Nervous when I stand
Choking on the circumstance
Only smoking second hand (mhm)
Cut us open an' spread us out (mhm)
Dry us in the sand (mhm)
Lay the fibers side by side (mhm)
And you'll begin to understand (mhm)

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me, coming for me

Mhm (I know it's over), mhm, mhm

I don't bother anyone
Never make demands
Choking on the circumstance
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance (mhm)
Seems like all I'm worth is what (mhm)
I'm able to withstand (mhm)
Sooner I can realize (mhm) that 
Pain is just a middleman

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me

I see no volunteers
To co-sign on my fears
I'll sign on the line

Alone, I'm gonna change my circumstance
I know I need to move right now 'cause

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me (only smoking second hand)
I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me, coming for me

Like a little splinter buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out, but when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in
When your body's screaming out, trust your mind's listening
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As a shadow cast upon the ground, where you'll eventually
Lay forever, but the day goes on, the sun moves behind you
You get taller, bolder, stronger and the rearview only blinds you

Mhm, mhm, mhm
