		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember I'll always love you
You

And I la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love you
And I la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love you

My guess, I hope that our memories stay
And just know that whatever you do
I hope you love me too
And my heart beats
Stuck in a daze of our thoughts
And watching me grow to be new
I hope you love me too

So my darling, so my darling, so my darling
When our hairs are turning grey
Won't even remember our younger days
So my darling, so my darling
My baby, my boo
You are my best friend
You are my best friend
Remember I'll always love you
You

And I la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love you
And I la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love you

Remember the first day we met, it was you
Talking to miss and I came and saved you
Then our friendship just suddenly grew
Started talking and then it all blew
Then we went down our separate ways
Felt really empty and everything changed
We reunited, it felt just the same
Now we love in a different way

So my darling, so my darling, so my darling
When our hairs are turning grey
Won't even remember our younger days and
So my darling, so my darling
Baby, my boo
You are my best friend, you are my best friend
Remember I'll always love you
Ooh, ooh

Remember I'll always love you
(Always love you)
And I la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love you

So my darling, so my darling, so my darling
When our hairs are turning grey
Won't even remember our younger days
So my darling, so my darling
My baby, my boo
You are my best friend, you are my best friend
Remember I'll always love you
