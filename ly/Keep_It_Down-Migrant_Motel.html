		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got you stuck in my teeth 
I’ll show you what to believe 
Tracin my face with your nails 
I’ll let you know when to breathe 
Your skin is getting me high 
There’s thunderbolts in your thighs 
I’ll wear you like a tattoo
And tell you what you can do

You shoot me up through the clouds 
I’m a hero in your mouth 
I’m the sickness you found 
I’m the fever you’re about 
While I throw you around
You’re gonna scream
Shh, girl keep it down

The scars you leave on my back
A painting of your attack
You're biting down on my fist
I know you cannot resist

You shoot me up through the clouds 
I’m a hero in your mouth 
I’m the sickness you found 
I’m the fever you’re about 
While I throw you around
You’re gonna scream
Shh, girl keep it down

You shoot me up through the clouds 
I’m a hero in your mouth 
I’m the sickness you found 
I’m the fever you’re about 
While I throw you around
You’re gonna scream
Shh, girl keep it down
