		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sit there like some silly girl
If you wait too long it'll be too late
I'm not telling you something new
There ain't no time to lose
It's time for you to celebrate

So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (Get up, little girl)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (It's time, your world)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (Your life, your choice)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (It's time, live it up)

On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

You don't have the luxury of time
You have got to say what's on your mind
Your head lost in the stars
You'll never go far
It's time for you to read the signs

So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (Here comes, my hand)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (Take it, you can)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (The time, is now)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (I'll show, you how)

On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

Say what you like
Do what you feel
You know exactly who you are
The time is right now
You got to decide
Stand in the back or be the star

Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (Here comes, my hand)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (Take it, you can)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (The time, is now)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat (I'll show, you how)

I can't keep waiting for you
Anticipating that you've
No time to lose
I can't keep waiting for you

Here's a impromptu I want you
I'm going to tell you what I want to do to you
Your girlfriend she wants to
Beautiful
Just flew in from Paris
Voulez vouz?
And the city that don't snooze
Smooze amongst the whose who's
And I use my celeb to get this one home
Why everything that feel so good gotta be so wrong?
Gimme room now
I'm like a vampire on the full moon now
And I don't know about you now
But I think I wanna try something new now
See what it do now
And when you sat down
Uh, cause you was losing your breath now
Uh, cause you be doing it to death now
She be doing E to F now
What's left now?
Mr. West now
Can you get any more fresh now?
I think I just did, just now
Talking my shit, that's how
I'm a professional, I admit that
Flashing lights show I live that
Fame is a drug, wanna hit that?
'Cause I know exactly where to get that
Did you get that?

Get down, beep beep, gotta get up off a your seat
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up off a your seat now

On and on
The beat goes
On and on

'Cause they know exactly where to get that
Did you get that?

Let's go, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat

On and on
The beat goes
On and on
The beat goes
On and on
On and on
On and on
