		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you felt in my arms
Our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm
I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark
And my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Is your heart just preconditioned for brevity?
I don't mean to accuse you of refusing longevity
But I cannot excuse you for abusing my empathy
My empathy

I can take rejection
But you gave the impression
That this was the inception
Of something real

The way you felt in my arms
Our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm
I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark
And my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How you could look me in the eye
And tell me that you love me
When you knew it was a lie
I was headed for Kentucky
When you called to say goodbye
How did I not see it coming?
Now I don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Maybe I'm the one to blame, I have a tendency
For always ignoring my brain when it says to me
That someone's been manipulating my empathy
My empathy

I can take rejection
But you gave the impression
That this was the inception
Of something real

The way you felt in my arms
Our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm
I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark
And my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How you could look me in the eye
And tell me that you love me
When you knew it was a lie
I was headed for Kentucky
When you called to say goodbye
How did I not see it coming?
Now I don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

The way you felt in my arms
Our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm
I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark
And my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
