		  Do it all, do it all, do it all, I can't
Do it all

I can't do it all (I can't), no, I can't do it all 
I'm way better off when you don't get involved
Try to play it cool but I just can't pull it off
Friday, it's "fuck me", Saturday, she take it all (take it all)
One day I'm nothing at all, next day, she want it all (want it all)
Take your dependin' on me back where you came from
'Cause I can't pull it off, no, I can't pull it off (I can't)
I can't do it all, no, I can't do it all (I can't)

Don't need that shit, I'm all that I need
We in the backseat, she wanna ride me
Her walls, I'm in, she all that I see
She off a x pill, I'm smokin' my weed
My eyes, they turn red, put all the visine 
She cursin' me out, tear up the hotel 
Infecting my skin, she poison ivy

You ain't what I need
Yeah, you too hard to read

I can't do it all (I can't), no, I can't do it all (nah)
I'm way better off (better off) when you don't get involved (get involved)
Try to play it cool but I just can't pull it off (can't pull it off)
Friday, it's "fuck me", Saturday, she take it all (take it all)
One day I'm nothing at all, next day, she want it all (want it all)
Take your dependin' on me back where you came from
'Cause I can't pull it off, no, I can't pull it off (I can't)
I can't do it all, no, I can't do it all (I can't)
