		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start
You say it's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
You gave me everything and nothing (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come running (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)

I wish you would, I wish you would (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish, I wish, I)

2 AM, here we are
See your face
Hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
You gave me everything and nothing (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)

(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish I, I wish I)

I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)
