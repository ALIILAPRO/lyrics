		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate how I need you to breathe
Feel so high, now I can't see
Sinking under, losing sleep
Set me free, just please don't leave

I need you to stay
I need you to stay

I hope I occupy your mind
No one deserves you, yeah you're mine
Only with you I feel alive
If you leave me here, I'll die

I need you to stay
I need you to stay

Don't go, I'll lose my faith
Don't go, forget god's name
Don't go, stay in my veins

I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you to stay

I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you to stay

Don't go, I'll lose my faith
Don't go, forget god's name
Don't go, stay in my veins

I need you to stay
