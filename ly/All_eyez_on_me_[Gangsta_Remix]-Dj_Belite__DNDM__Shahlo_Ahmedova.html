		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high (all eyes on me)
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high

Hey, to my nigga Pac
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high

These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep yo' head up, nigga
Make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hos is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money motherfucker
Let's get rich and we'll kick it (all eyes on me)

Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high (all eyes on me)
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high

Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas, tryna sound like us
Saying they ready for the funk but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of hell is where them cowards goin'

Well are you still down nigga? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by

Until I die, live the life of a boss player
'Cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later
The future's in my eyes
'Cause all I want is cash and things, a five-double-o
Benz flauntin', flashy rings, uh

Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It's seems my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money brings bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me

We got foe niggas and low riders in ski masks
Screamin', "Thug life" every time they pass, all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high (all eyes on me)
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high

Hey, to my nigga Pac
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
'Cause he been gettin' high (all eyes on me)
