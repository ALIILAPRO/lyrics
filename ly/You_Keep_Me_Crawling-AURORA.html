		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I keep
If I keep forgiving
Maybe I'll believe
That you never meant for life to hurt for me
Maybe I'll recover if you set me free

But why does it make me feel
Like I am weak and small?
Why do I keep begging
Like the animal?
Maybe it's because I need to serve someone

So you keep me crawling on my knees
Oh, you keep me crawling on my knees
Oh, you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord, you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord, you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord, you keep me crawling
Oh, you keep me crawling
Lord, you keep me crawling

If I keep
If I keep confessing
Maybe I'll believe
That you never meant for love to hurt for me
Maybe you could feel a little sympathy

But why do I make you feel
Like you are big and strong?
Why do you keep hunting
Like an animal?
Maybe it's because you need to own someone

So you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord, you keep me crawling on my knees
Oh, you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord, you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord, you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord, you keep me crawling
Lord, you keep me crawling
Lord, you keep me crawling
Lord, you keep me crawling
Lord, you keep me crawling on my knees

If I stop
If I stop believing
Maybe you will see
Giving into love should never hurt for me
Giving into love should set me free
