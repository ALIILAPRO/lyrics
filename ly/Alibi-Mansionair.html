		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haven't seen you 'round
Got me in a craze
And going through an awkward faze
I hate the taste it leaves us
I know your light's gone out
But are you still awake?
Stuck inside a downhill haze
You seem so out of reach now

You're one step in and out again
It's useless
It was everything and the colours spin
We lose it
Thought you'd be my alibi

Alibi
Alibi
Alibi

So you're lying on my couch
But you want to give it space
I'm slipping into your disdain
Don't be so cold and reckless
Well, maybe you're too proud
I can see it in your face
Oh, the silence could have cut the air

You're one step in and out again
It's useless
It was everything and the colours spin
We lose it
Thought you'd be my alibi

Alibi
Alibi
Alibi

You're one step in and out again
Alibi
You're one step in and out again
Alibi
It's useless
It's useless
