		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It makes me feel nervous
You have that look in your eye
Oh, what takes over?
What is it that holds you tight?

And you can tear it up
Oh, no one tears it up like you
Oh, you can rip it up
Oh, no one rips it up like you

When you're in the half light
It is not you I see
And you live a half life
You only show half to me

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sometimes I join you
Let you wash over me
When we're in the darkness
Only the blind can see

And you can tear it up
Oh, no one tears it up like you
Oh, you can rip it up
Oh, I can rip it up like you

When you're in the half light
Oh, it is not you I see
And you live a half life
You only show half to me

And can you shake it off?
Ooh, can you shake it off for me?
When you're in the half light
I don't like the half I see

What possesses you?
Ooh, what possesses you?
Ooh, what possesses you?
Ooh, what possesses you?

When you're in the half light
Ooh, it is not you I see
You live a half life
You only show half to me

Can you shake it off?
Ooh, can you shake it off for me?
When you're in the half light
I don't like the half I see
No, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
