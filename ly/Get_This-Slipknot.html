		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like a fuckin' thing! Music sucks dick 
Suck the snot end off the tip of my prick 
You fucking cunts, get up off of my back 
I don't wanna do a show with your shitty 
Fuckin' band, You suck, they suck, guess what, get fucked 
I can't think of any other words to say but fuck 
Don't drag our opinions, our opinions are great 
It's new school face motherfuckers I hate 

Local bands (suck these nuts) 
U.S. bands (suck these nuts) 
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts) 
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts! 
Go! 

Don't berate me
Cause you can't stop me 
From breakin' your face
It's you I'll erase 

It's Hate
Muthafucker
Hate
Muthafucker
Hate 

Local bands (suck these nuts) 
U.S. bands (suck these nuts) 
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts) 
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts! 
Go! 

Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great? 
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great?

[Repeat: x26]
Get this or die! 

Local bands (suck these nuts) 
U.S. bands (suck these nuts) 
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts) 
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts! 
Go!
