		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Ayy, they say that I died but I ain't seen no light (ain't seen no light)
All of this darkness, all these demons
Hope these percs gonna get me right (let's get it)
I keep reachin' my hand out
Hopin' the drank gon' hold me tight (hold me tight)
I keep gettin' my heart broke
Hopin' that she gon' love me, sike (let's go)
Black out on another flight (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Right back where I started, yeah
Spillin' my heart out on the mic (let's get it)
I can't figure this out, no
I don't see no end of sight (okay, okay)
Fillin' my veins up with that shit, took a trip to paradise
They could help me if they wanna, guess I'm throwin' tall advice (yeah)

Thinkin' about my brother and I'm wondering if he thinking of me
Last time that I seen him, he was dead, since then, I ain't sleep (I can't sleep)
Is this shit my fault? Did I leave him? What could I done different?
They say that I'm blessed but I'm failin' to see what the gift is (see it)
Drivin' by my lonely, ayy
Thinkin' about my family, ayy
Trippin' about they love, ayy
Don't give a fuck 'bout Grammy's, ayy (no, no)
Don't give a fuck 'bout money, ayy
Don't give a fuck 'bout bitches, ayy
Don't give a fuck 'bout none of that shit
None of it don't mean shit to me (let's go, let's go)
Take a look at my history (let's get it)
Wonderin' why trust hard to find
But that's just when we face-to-face
Hard to tell you what's on my mind
I want to, but I can't cry, ayy
Want to, but I can't lie, ayy (I can't)
I just gotta get high 'cause I'm too busy to die, ayy (die)
Take a look at what I become, wonderin' was it really worth it (really worth it)
Bro just sent me a text, maybe he's right, maybe I didn't earn it
Tell me what's my purpose and why do I, why do I deserve it? (Why do I?)
Crashin' out the road, show these pussies how to really swerve it (yeah)
Tellin' my dad it won't be long 'til I get home, but that's a lie (sorry)
Feelin' like Weezy in '07, I'm so high, I feel like dying
Been like twenty years since the last time that I felt alive
Preacher looked me in my eyes, said, "Damn boy, you dead inside" (okay, okay, okay, okay)

Ayy, they say that I died but I ain't seen no light (ain't seen no light)
All of this darkness, all these demons
Hope these percs gonna get me right (let's get it)
I keep reachin' my hand out
Hopin' the drank gon' hold me tight (hold me tight)
I keep gettin' my heart broke
Hopin' that she gon' love me, sike (let's go)
Black out on another flight (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Right back where I started, yeah
Spillin' my heart out on the mic (let's get it)
I can't figure this out, no
I don't see no end of sight (okay, okay)
Fillin' my veins up with that shit, took a trip to paradise
They could help me if they wanna, guess I'm throwin' tall advice (yeah)
