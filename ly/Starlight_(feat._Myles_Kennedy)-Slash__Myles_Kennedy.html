		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the distance
Light years from tomorrow
Far beyond yesterday
She is watching
Heart aching with sorrow
She is broken, as she waits

Hoping when all is said and done
We learn to love and be as one

Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna find a place where we belong
(Where we belong)
And so you know, you'll never shine alone

There are shadows sleeping on the horizon
Leave us scared and so afraid
As the fallout of a world divided
It brings her tears and so much pain

And so we take cover from the dark
Hoping to find where we can start

Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna find a place where we belong
(Where we belong)
And so you know, you'll never shine alone

Starlight, we'll find a place
Where we belong, we belong

You will see as the mountains fall and turn to dust
That there's one thing that won't change
I believe there is something within each of us
That always stays
That will always remain
As long as love never fades

Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna find a place where we belong
And so you know, you'll never shine alone

Starlight we'll find a place
Where we belong, we belong

She is watching
Heart aching with sorrow
She is broken, as she waits
