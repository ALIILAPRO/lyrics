		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I got room
In my fumes (yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (it's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (let's go)

She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon (soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (nah)
Now I got her in my room (ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard (uh)
Got the fastest car, it zoom (zoom)
Hope we make it outta here
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (yeah)

Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (it's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (let's go)

Su black Ferrari le doy gas
Caballos suenan con delay
Si quieres duro el quiere má'
Aquí siempre hay un beso de ley, uy
Si ahora de fiera no me fuera a conocer
Chaqueta al hombro y la cadena hasta el pie
Si ahora de fiera no me fuera a conocer
Lolli-lollipop viene cash
Ay, shine ya la' joya'
Balas que duelen por detrás
Broom broom, yo también acicalá ('cicalá)
Ojalá que me cojas confesá'

(Ah, this my life, I did not choose)
Uh, been on this since we was kids
(Ayy, gon' stay on top and break the rules)
Uh, I fill my mind up with ideas
Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit)
Hope I make it outta here

Baby, I just left from Vegas
Did 'em dirty on the table
Went and bought a new Bentayga
I paid cash, don't see no paper
Buy it, park it, tint it later
All my car's inside tomato
From Atlanta, not Decatur
I'm the one they say, "Don't play with"
Make them boys get on your table
High-five LeBron, floor seat the Lakers
Get more paper, get more haters
Standin' still, my diamonds skatin'
Fucked her once, she think we datin'
I can spend it, I've been savin'
I'ma spin ya, try to play me
I've been trappin' up them millions, used to trap it off a RAZR
Back when I was sellin' two-for-five plays, called in my RAZR
Niggas never had to give it to me, I want it and I'ma take it
Guaranteed to tell a hoe goodbye if she ain't tryna get naked

I'm like mm, mm-hm
Gotta get up out my room
Got some more bad vibes comin' through
Hm, she gon' bust a move
Make it do

I'm the highest, you might got the Midas touch
What the vibe is? And my bitch the vibiest, yeah
Everyone excited, everyone too excited, yeah now
Play with the giants, little bit too extravagant, yeah now
Night, everyone feel my vibe, yeah
In the broad day, everyone hypnotizing, yeah
I'm okay and I take the cake, yeah (yo también acicalá)
