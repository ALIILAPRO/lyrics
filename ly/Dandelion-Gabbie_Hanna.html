		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was a little girl, my mama said to me
"What's your favorite flower, darling? I'll get you the seed"
I said "Dandelion, Dandelion," that one's so pretty
She said, "Child, that one's not a flower, that one's just a weed"

Oh, what a shame
Now it don't look the same
Guess it don't look the same
Oh, what a shame

Call me what you want
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
You can't stop me multiplying
Pull me from the dirt
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
No you don't want me in your garden
Dandelion, Dandelion
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Dandelion, Dandelion
Dandelion, Dandelion

I still love those mellow yellow petals anyway
What's that thing they say about a rose by any other name?
Then my fragile flower turned into a ball of grey
So I took a breath and made a wish and blew them all away

Oh, what a shame
Now it don't look the same
Guess it don't look the same
Oh, what a shame

Call me what you want
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
You can't stop me multiplying
Pull me from the dirt
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
No you don't want me in your garden
Dandelion, Dandelion

Call me what you want
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
You can't stop me multiplying
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
Pull me from the dirt
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
No, you don't want me in your garden
Dandelion, Dandelion
(Dandelion, Dandelion)

So I took a breath and made a wish and blew them all away
