		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes on you, with your eyes on me
(Eyes on me)
With your eyes on me
Eyes on you, with your eyes on me
(Eyes on me)
I'm falling now, I only find the worst for myself
(The worst for myself)
Just pull me out, I fall into your curse, hold me down
But I need you now
And I'm all in tonight (Yeah)
You had me falling for lies (Yeah)
Just take control of my mind
This ain't the first time, it's you and I
And I want you for the night (Want you for the night)
You keep me guessing, got my attention
Want my affection, that's my intention (Yeah)
Eyes on you, with your eyes on me
(Eyes on me)
With your eyes on me
Eyes on you, with your eyes on me
(Eyes on me)
I'm falling now, I only find the worst for myself
(The worst for myself)
Just pull me out, I fall into your curse, hold me down
But I need you now
And I'm all in tonight (Yeah)
You had me falling for lies (Yeah)
Just take control of my mind
Eyes on you, with your eyes on me
(Eyes on me)
With your eyes on me
Eyes on you, with your eyes on me
(Eyes on me)
(Eyes on you, eyes on me)
