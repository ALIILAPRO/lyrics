		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We might've took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, "I bet
They'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

(Still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(Still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, "I bet
They'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

(Still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(Still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
Still the one

Still the one

Yeah (still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(Still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
