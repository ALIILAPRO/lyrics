		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We wanna dance 'till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, It's about to go
It's about to go, hey
'Bout to go, hey (down, down, down)
It's about to go

Down in the rough part of town
There's an epidemic going around
I get the fever when I hear that song
I can't help it, I gotta move right now
When I hit the drums start to play
I let my body run away
I wanna party, like, every day
If you're with me let me hear you say

Do we wanna stop it (no way)
Do we let the cops in (no way)
We about to rock this whole place, what do we want

We wanna dance 'till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go
It's about to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)
'Bout to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)
It's about to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)
'Bout to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)
It's about to go

Down in the rough part of town
There's an epidemic going around
I get the fever when I hear that sound
I can't help it, I gotta move right now
When I hit the drums start to play
I let my body run away
I wanna party, like, everyday
If you're with me let me hear you say
Do we wanna stop it (no way)
Do we let the cops in (no way)
We about to rock this whole place
What do we want

We wanna dance 'till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go
It's about to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)
'Bout to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)
It's about to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)
'Bout to go (down, down, down) hey (down, down, down)

They call me Afro baby
I see you be looking, daddy come get it
I'm with it, I'm ready, you better get busy
From city to city the girls are ready to get down, down, down, down
Primo, one, two, three to the four
Get mami movin' like you're tryina make it on the tour
But you're the one that got me on the trip
Feel like the world's in my hands but they're really on your hips
Ah, perdona, la drama se ve potencial
Per maximo leader del party mundial
High up on your block like we're end it
Heads up like you know I'm a bandit, jefe

Hey, 'bout to go
Hey, we wanna
Hey, 'bout to go

We wanna dance till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go
We wanna dance till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go
It's about to go
