		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mirror, mirror, pareidolia
Porcelain pillars bear my skull

'Til I'm falling in amphetamine
I'm spiraling in ecstasy
I'm drowning in my apogee
I'm draining from between my teeth
Don't wake up, don't wake up
Don't wake me while I'm dreaming
Don't wake up, don't wake up
I've seen things you could not believe

Don't try to break my fall, down this rabbit hole I (go)
Who are you? I hardly know, I should think that I would
Wake up
What a disaster to be late for my own ball
Wake up
Heart beating faster, hope the queen is rational

Do you wish I hadn't quite drank so much?
You critique my habits from inside your hutch
I don't think, ha-ha, then you shouldn't talk
No, you shouldn't talk, no, you shouldn't talk

Until I'm falling in amphetamine
I'm spiraling in ecstasy
I'm drowning in my apogee
I'm draining from between my teeth
Don't wake up, don't wake up
Don't wake me while I'm dreaming
Don't wake up, don't wake up
Don't wake me while I'm dreaming
Don't wake up, don't wake up
Don't wake me while I'm dreaming
Don't wake up, don't wake up
I've seen things you could not believe

Don't try to break my fall, down this rabbit hole I (go)
Who are you? I hardly know, I should think that I would
Wake up
What a disaster to be late for my own ball
Wake up
Heart beating faster, hope the queen is rational

How'd you wander so far from your home?
This is my wonderland, you don't have to fend
You can leave at any point that you wish to return
Don't try to comprehend what's inside my head
You could never

Don't try to break my fall, down this rabbit hole I (go)
Who are you? I hardly know, I should think that I would
Wake up
What a disaster to be late for my own ball
Wake up
Heart beating faster, hope the queen is rational
