		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we was lyin' down on the floor
You said I should smile more
I was killin' your vibe
Pretend I didn't hear your voice
But baby, I was takin' notes
Keep that in mind

Hey, you say you hate me
Ha-ha, I laugh it off
Your mind is made and I can't change it
Somehow

Haven't seen the sun in a month
But it's all sunshine, I forgot how to cry
It feels like pain, pain is a world away
Took my cigarettes and flushed them down the drain, ah
Okay, okay, I'm lyin'

Mm, hey, you say you hate me
Ha-ha, I laugh it off
Your mind is made and I can't change it
Somehow, I laugh it off

And if I learned anything at all
Smile

Talk to me, I know it's over
I'll listen like I did before

Hey, you say you hate me
Ha-ha, I laughed it off
When I fuck up like I have lately
Somehow, I laugh it off

And if I learned anything at all
Smile, smile
And if I learned anything at all
Smile, smile
