		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want nobody to get killed
I'll come and get you
I am always ready to fight

So don't take all of the blame we were all swept away
Don't take all of the weight, you always do
There will always be something you cannot control
We will overcome, your salvation has begun

No signs
No lights, such a mess all over
Don't kill your hopes
You make me realize who I need

I'll be there hold on
They'll change you somehow
So where are you now?
I'll reach you by dawn
Before you can be turned
Illusions are torn
The fallen angels you run with don't know
It is our pain that makes us all human after all
Warm old sepia photographs show
Our fragile precious world
Must protect it, respond to the call

Are they really deep inside your head?
Do they control you like a little marionette?
I'll cut the strings off you dead, come in with me
Let me free the wings of your soul, can make it fly
We've been waiting here just to make you whole again
No more hating see I have always been your friend

No signs
No lights, such a mess all over
Don't kill your hopes
You make me realize who I need

I'll be there hold on
They'll change you somehow
So where are you now?
I'll reach you by dawn
The shadows appear, Illusions are born
The fallen angels you run with don't know
It is our pain that makes us all human after all
Torn old sepia photographs show
Our fragile precious world
Must discard it, respond to the call

If you wanna fight with me
Then go ahead and fight with me
'Cause all I wanna do is help you man
You will be the death of me
The power of our army had been cut with a scythe
And if we lose you to them we may never survive
You can leave but you must first believe
Just one step at a time and keep your head up boy and
You'll be free
