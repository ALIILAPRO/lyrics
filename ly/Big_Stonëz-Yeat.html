		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fell asleep on the yacht
(Damn, Trgc made that?)
Hunners in the watch (Watch)
Called up Eliantte, said
"I need them baguettes to rock" (Brr, brr)
You be tripping, you be smoking the crack
You be smoking the rock
Yeah, I been shipping it out for months
I been shipping the Za' (Zaza, zaza)
Chane'-ne' on the tag of the bag
They figured it out (They figured out)
I done leveled up, I put pointers in my ring
(What?) i done leveled up, I'm at the store
I'm at Celine (God)
Your bitch be choosing behind your back
She said she wanted me (Uh, huh)
Three hundred sixty-five bands in a year
Took the, took the C63 Benz, I'm outta here
(Woo) busted a nut on her face
(Woo-woo) , and some got in her hair (Hair)
Mix the X with the Perc'
That's a perfect pair (yeah, yeah)
I be high
LV sunglass on my face so they don't stare
(That's a year)
What's the point of getting high (High) 
If you don't ever care? (Gettin' high)
I'm with your thottie from the back
I'm in her derriere (yeah)

Boot up (Woo, yeah) boot up (Woo, woo, woo)
Choose up (yeah, choose a song, woo)
I got my shoe off (Woo)

On the top (Woo, woo)
Her top the best, I told that bitch, "No
Please don't stop" (yeah, keep going)
I was out a year 'fore I signed a deal
I made a lot (On a route)
They be capping in they raps, they live a lie
(yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I had too many close calls, I almost died
They ask me
(Fuck ya said) , "Why do you live like that?"
Why would you ask me
(Why?) , if I would split the bag
You a carpet to me bitch, yeah, a drag
Yeah, I'm richer than all of y'all
And it's just a fact (Fact)
You and your baby mama, yeah
Done went out sad (Sad)
You so scared, the way you living, boy
You can't even step outside (Broke boy)
Yeah, all my diamonds flawless, all no SI
And my twizzy down the way
Gon' get you spilled, boy, if you

Fell asleep on the yacht
