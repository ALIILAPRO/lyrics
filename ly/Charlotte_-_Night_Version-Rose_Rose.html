		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A desire
Like a fire
And we know
How we'll play
Ain't ready
They see where I stand
And I know
There's no upper hand
Illusion
They turn it around
And see it
It's all underground
Ain't steady
They see where I stand
And I know
There's know upper hand
Illusion
They turn it around
And see it
It's all underground
Go with the move
To make it up
Clearing the way
And build it up
Go with the move
Go with the move and take the time
To make it up
Make it with everyone around
Clearing the way
Clearing the way is all we need
And build it up
To build it up and share the lead
Go with the move
To make it up
Clearing the way
And build it up
Go with the move
Go with the move and take the time
To make it up
Make it with everyone around
Clearing the way
Clearing the way is all we need
And build it up
To build it up and share the lead
Ain't ready
They see where I stand
And I know
There's no upper hand
Illusion
They turn it around
Ain't ready
They see where I stand
And I know
There's no upper hand
Illusion
They turn it around
Ain't ready
They see where I stand
And I know
There's no upper hand
Illusion
They turn it around
