		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, why she go lie straight to my face?
Tell me you want me then don't stay
If you gon' walk, then walk my way
But I can't watch from just one place

You don't make it easy to leave, baby
Playing when you got what you need, baby
You know I don't like when you tease, baby

You say you love me then
You wanna be my friend
I give you all my lovin', girl
And then you run away (ah-ooh)
Do you love me back?

Alright, if you gon' ask then, yeah, I'm fine
You didn't do nun, just waste my time
If anyone asks, I'll say I tried
When we both know you're still in my life

You don't make it easy to leave, baby (oh, baby)
Playing when you got what you need, baby
You know I don't like when you tease, baby

You say you love me then
You wanna be my friend
I give you all my lovin', girl
And then you run away (ah-ooh)
Do you love me back?

Alright, why she go lie straight to my face?
Tell me you want me then don't stay
If you gon' walk, then walk my way
But I can't watch from just one place

'Cause you don't make it easy to leave, baby (oh, baby)
Playing when you got what you need, baby
You know I don't like when you tease (tease)

You say you love me then
You wanna be my friend
I give you all my lovin', girl
And then you run away (ah-ooh)
Do you love me back?

Ooh, do you love me back?
