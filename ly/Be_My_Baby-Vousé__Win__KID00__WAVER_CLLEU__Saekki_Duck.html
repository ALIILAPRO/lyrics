		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want you be my baby
whenever u want just call me yea
and I'm thinkin' bout you lately
지금부터 can I comin' yea
coz I'm dyin to see ya
so baby bend down low
your the one for me ya
I'm gonna take it slow

I hit it just like a homerun
we makin' love under moonlight
ay imma turn the lights off
you will wake up on my pillow
givin' me head, it's alright
baby close your eyes
lemme start our ride yea
will you bend for me tonight
we don't need a guide
rock it out 'nother round yea
just forget 'bout your man
now we gon wet the bed
our body full of sweat
until there's nothin left

I just want you be my baby
whenever u want just call me yea
and I'm thinkin' bout you lately
지금부터can I comin' yea
cz i'm dyin to see ya
so baby bend down low
your the one for me ya
I'm gonna take it slow

you shoudn't  take it off, take it off your T
cz I don't want to be late lit 
i wanna drive away until you don't need any
lil bit sexy talk with fully stocked up, Henny
but then you tell me to hush
because you don't wanna rush
what a night, your lips so fine  
come baby put it on mine
no I don't wanna waste my time
we're gonna take another round
baby I'm feelin so high
and pull me close, hold it tight
right now, just turn off the lights
I wanna be a lover tonight

I just want you be my baby
whenever u want just call me yea
and I'm thinkin' bout you lately
지금부터can I comin' yea
cz I'm dyin to see ya
so baby bend down low
your the one for me ya
I'm gonna take it slow

don't make me wait
say that again
that you want
(gimme love)
show it all
(turn it on)
bite the neck
gimme no rest
shawty you wanna feel something from me uuuh
baby put it on me uuu
if u want love
yea we can make it
so hold me close
i know you want it
