		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day one you're locking the door
Baby the roof is on fire
Two hands are driving this car
Beasts all around you are closer

Day two is frightening and cold
Baby the car goes faster
How fun, how fun
If only the sky could say

Oh don't take your gun, we wanna have some fun
We wanna keep on dancing, we can't keep on running
Oh don't take your gun, we wanna have some fun
We wanna keep on dancing, we can't keep on running

Hold your fire, silence, I'm holding your hand
Silence, I'm whispering a prayer
Believing we're living for love

Night fall, wolves on the road
Baby the beast is darker
You too are frightening and cold
Baby the car goes deeper
How fun, how fun
If only the sky could say

Oh don't take your gun, we wanna have some fun
We wanna keep on dancing, we can't keep on running
Oh don't take your gun, we wanna have some fun
We wanna keep on dancing, we can't keep on running

Hold your fire, silence I'm holding your hand
Silence, I'm whispering a prayer
Believing we're living for love
For love

Hold your fire, silence, I'm holding your hand
Silence, I'm whispering a prayer
Believing we're living for love

Hold your fire, silence, I'm holding your hand
Silence, I'm whispering a prayer
Believing we're living for love

Hold your fire, silence, I'm holding your hand
Silence, I'm whispering a prayer
Believing we're living for love
For love
For love
