		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.

White hair
And a hopeful smile.
Your inside
Is on your outside.
I need
A pleasant surprise.

Good heart and desire to please.
I want a fatal disease.

When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.

You are,
Everything.
My most,
Demanding dream.

Good heart and desire to please.
I want a fatal disease.
When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
I don't want to be with you.
