		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you see
The space between us
How it's widening
How it's cold like our words
Oh don't you feel it love
We are hopeless broken doves
We've got more holes in our coats
Than a field after the war
Totemic love
You gave me birth
We walk
We run
We fall
We learn
Again, you tell me
What do we learn?
We walk
We run
We'll fall in love again
What will remain?
What if it was our faith?
We're tagged in boxes
We can't escape
The hour sets 2:22
All the roads lead back to you
Totemic love
You're killing me now
No matter how we've closed the file
We did write some pretty lines
My pretty war
My pretty broken wall
We walk
We run
We fall
We learn
Again, you tell me
What do we learn?
We walk
We run
We'll fall in love again
What will remain?
Come on hope in the mirror
I need you like a mother
I've been blinded by the power
No more home no more shelter now
