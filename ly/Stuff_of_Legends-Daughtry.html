		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I live days alone and afraid
With my devils, how I wrestle them
I spent hours staring out at the walls
I heard angels sing Hallelujah

I'm tired of waiting for the ship to come
And being told that it can't be done
Gonna go ahead and give me some
Gonna go ahead and give me some, oh oh
Won't let 'em get to me
Won't let 'em get to me
Won't let 'em get to me 
Get to me, get to me

I'm gonna fight with loss, said I'm gonna love in anger
They won't get to me, get to me 
'Cause that's the stuff of legends
All my power, I'm gonna live life louder
They won't get to me, get to me 
'Cause that's the stuff of legends

Walk that walk, feelin' like a boss
Flip that blue switch, turn them lights on 

I'm tired of waiting for the day to come
So make away without blocking the sun
Gon' go ahead and give me some, 
Gon' go ahead and give me some, oh oh
Won't let 'em get to me, won't let 'em get to me
Won't let 'em get to me, get to me, get to me

I'm gonna fight with loss, said I'm gonna love in anger
They won't get to me, get to me 
'Cause that's the stuff of legends
All my power, I'm gonna live life louder
They won't get to me, get to me 

'Cause that's the stuff of legends

I'm tired of waiting for the day to come
So make it rain without blocking the sun
Gonna go ahead and give me some, 
Gonna go ahead and give me some, oh oh

Won't let 'em get to me, won't let 'em get to me
Won't let 'em get to me, no
Won't let 'em get to me, won't let 'em get to me
Won't let 'em get to me, get to me, get to me

I'm gonna fight with loss
Said I'm gonna love in anger
They won't get to me, get to me 
'Cause that's the stuff of legends
All my power, I'm gonna live life louder
They won't get to me, get to me 
'Cause that's the stuff of legends

I'm tired of waiting for the day to come
So make away without blocking the sun
Gonna go ahead and give me some
Gonna go ahead and give me some, oh oh
I'm tired of waiting for the day to come
So make away without blocking the sun
Gonna go ahead and give me some
Gonna go ahead and give me some
I'm tired of waiting for the day to come
So make away without blocking the sun
Gonna go ahead and give me some, 
Gonna go ahead and give me some more
