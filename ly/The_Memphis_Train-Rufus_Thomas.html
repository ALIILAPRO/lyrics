		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo, woo, woo

Train number one is gone
Train number two is gone
Train number three is been gone
Now how long must I wait for you

Uh, all right

Time I laid my handkerchief on the floor
I'm getting ready to crawl, yeah
I'm getting down on my knees
I'm getting ready to crawl, yeah

I said, ooh, wee, the Memphis train
Hey, now, now, now, now
Ooh, wee, the Memphis train
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Train number one is gone
Train number two is gone
Train number three is been gone
Now how long must I wait for you, all right

Uh, oh, shucks, uh

Ooh, wee, the Memphis train
Hey, now, now, now, now
Ooh, wee, it's a Memphis train
Yeah, oh, got me going now

Oh, it's coming
It's coming down the track
It ain't, uh, it ain't, uh
It ain't coming back, no, it ain't

It's going
Going down the track
Yeah, it's moving on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's got me moving
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
It's got me moving
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Got me coming
Got me working
Got me moving now
Got me cooking now
Got me grooving, oww, yeah

Got me moving, uh
Keep on down the track
