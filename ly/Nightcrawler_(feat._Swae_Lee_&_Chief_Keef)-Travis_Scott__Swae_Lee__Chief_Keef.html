		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Did you have the time of your life?
Let's have the after party at my place, ayy
Do you have some spare change?
On me, I've got hundreds I'll throw in your face

Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free and wildin', order more kidneys

Dope, I'm sold dope
All these hunnies pilin' on the floor
And we're stuntin', know you see the GLO
Girl these hundreds, thought I'd let you know
Since LA, I've been puttin' on
Cirque De Soleil, goin' on and on
I got this money, tell me what you want
For this money, can you drop it low?

Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young free and wildin', order more kidneys
When the night calls, oh, oh, oh
When the night calls, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, order more bottles (order more bottles)
Order more models (order more models)
Order more hours (order more hours)
Shots on an island (shots on an island)
Hotter than the summer (hotter than the summer)
The winter couldn't chill me (the winter couldn't chill me)
Young, free and wildin' (young, free and wildin')
So order more kidneys (so order more kidneys)

Freaks come out at night
We bring our fantasy to life
Point me to the ice
And I don't need your drink, high off life
Uh, someone kill the lights
I brought the party favors, just get piped
All my bitches right
But I want you and you tonight

Yeah, order more bottles (order more bottles)
Order more models (order more models)
Order more hours (order more hours)
Shots on an island (shots on an island)
Hotter than the summer (hotter than the summer)
The winter couldn't chill me (the winter couldn't chill me)
Young, free and wildin' (young, free and wildin')
So order more kidneys (so order more kidneys)

When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls

Ayy, walked up in the bank (bank)
Ordered me some funds (beep)
Walked in the strip club, order me some ones (gang)
I walked up in the gun store (huh?)
Order me some guns (bang bang)
Your bitch walked up in the spot and she ordered me for lunch (gang, gang)
I just ordered me some brunch (ayy)
Korean spicy garlic (ayy)
Bitch, I come from eating McDonald's (uh huh)
Girl, you know I'm from the projects (ayy)
Like a G, I come through mobbin'
Like Wu-T-A-N-G, we come through wildin'
I eat chicken, Killa Caesar with a chopper (bang bang)
Boy, you don't blow no poles, I know, I know (no, no, no)
I got me some angles
I got me some money for
I got me some haters (ayy)
I got me some FedEx (ayy, ayy)
I got me some cake
I got me some UPS, I got me a freight, ayy (gang)
Order some more money (beep)
Order some more money (beep)
Order some more money (beep)
Order some more bottles (ayy)
Order some more bitches (ayy)
Order some more money (gang)
I know you wanna be rich, bitch (gang, gang)

When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls

When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
