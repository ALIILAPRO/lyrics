		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go ooh ooh, you go ah ah
La la la la, la la la la
I can la la la la la la
I wanna, wanna, wanna get, get, get what I want, don't stop
Gimme, gimme, gimme whatcha got, got
'Cause I can't wait, wait, wait any m-more, more, more

Don't even talk about the consequence
'Cause right now you're the only thing that's making any sense to me
And I don't give a damn what they say, or what they think, think
'Cause you're the only one who's on my mind

I'll never, ever let you leave me
I'll try to stop time forever
Never wanna hear you say goodbye

I feel so untouched and I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now, need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Goin' crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched, un-
And I need you so much
See you, breathe you
I want to be you
Ah la la la, ah la la la
You can take, take, t-take, take, time, time
To live, live the way you gotta, gotta live your life
Give me, give me, give me all of you, you
Don't be scared, of seeing through the loneliness
I want it more, more, more
Don't even think about what's right or wrong, or wrong or right
'Cause in the end it's only you and me
And no one else is going to be around
To answer all the questions left behind
And you and I are meant to be
So even if the world falls down today
You've still got me to hold you up, up
And I will never let you down, down

I feel so untouched and I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now, need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Goin' crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched, un-
Untouched
Untouched, un-
Untouched
Untouched, un-
Ah la la la
Ah la la la
Untouched, un-
Ah la la la
Ah la la la

I feel so untouched and I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now, need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Goin' crazy from the moment I met you

I feel so untouched and I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now, need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Been goin' crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched, un-
Untouched
Untouched, un-
