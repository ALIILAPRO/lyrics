		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Noose around my neck
Kick the fucking chair out from under me
Stab me in the back
But you're mad I got my blood on your new white tee

Woah, throw me in the cold
Toss me in the pit in with the wolves
Tear me to the bone, rip me out my skin
It's getting old
Always being told everything I did
Ain't enough
What the fuck is that shit? (What the fuck?)

Left me alone and starving
But now you wanna come and crash my party
Over my grave, over my grave, over my
Over my grave, over my dead body
Your heart's as black as coffee
So who the fuck are you to sit and judge me?
Over my grave, over my grave, over my
Over my grave, over my dead body

Drag me through the fire
Your favorite thing to do is to watch me scream
Baby, you're a liar
Tell me what I wanna hear to get me out my jeans

Woah, throw me in the cold
Toss me in the pit in with the wolves
Tear me to the bone, rip me out my skin
It's getting old
Always being told everything I did
Ain't enough
What the fuck is that shit? (What the fuck?)

Left me alone and starving
But now you wanna come and crash my party
Over my grave, over my grave, over my
Over my grave, over my dead body
Your heart's as black as coffee
So who the fuck are you to sit and judge me?
Over my grave, over my grave, over my
Over my grave, over my dead body

We have so much history
I can't take it with me
I'd rather be six feet buried with my six-string

Left me alone and starving
But now you wanna come and crash my party
Over my grave, over my grave, over my
Over my grave, over my dead body
Your heart's as black as coffee
So who the fuck are you to sit and judge me?
Over my grave, over my grave, over my
Over my grave, over my dead body
