		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy

It's a party on the weekend
Got a lil' shorty, we creepin'
Throw somethin' in my cup
But I still can't show no love
I got hoes for every season
Shawty wanna play, she leavin'
Don't try to say what's up
When you see a nigga in the club, girl

Probably shadier the last trick
But I ain't trippin' on this bitch
'Cause I know your type, girl, you on some clout shit (straight up)
I can't complain 'cause I have fun
It's just my luck when I get a girl, I always want another one
New coupe, it's a drop top, it's how we livin'
Chrome Hearts, diamond cross for my religion
You could be rollin' wit' a thug (thug)
Instead you want a IG, lookin' for a nigga who gone show you love
I see you watchin', know you want it
When shorty climb on top, throw that ass on me, show me how you get up on it
I'm still faded from last night
I know you bought a slim thick body on you but you keep it tight
You leavin' wit' me or baby, you fakin'?
All this envy enough, they see the money I'm makin'
Is it true what they tellin' me? (What they say)
Every hoe in LA want a nigga who can rap, dress like me
Don't call back 'cause I'm cool wit' it
Hit once, then I'm done, have fun, I need a new feelin'
Still love that lil' thing you do
When it's late you can slide through (ayy)
Bring a friend too

It's a party on the weekend
Got a lil' shorty, we creepin'
Throw somethin' in my cup
But I still can't show no love
I got hoes for every season
Shawty wanna play, she leavin'
Don't try to say what's up
When you see a nigga in the club, girl (4Hunnid)

Ass up, face down (down)
That pussy bustin', greyhound
Don't play with it, it's not a playground
Got that Meagan Good, make me stay brown (brown)
Shorty know I'm wifed up (wifed up)
But still tryna fuck, she be tryna fuck my life up (life up)
Shorty know I'm piped up (piped up)
Summertime, this shit don't milk, but I'm iced up (iced up)
Once upon a time, she fucked plenty dudes
Like once upon a time, I was a Henny dude
But now the tequila shots get me in the mood
So if you tryna hit the room, baby, give me two (two)
Get ratchet, stop actin'
I heard you was known for gettin' it crackin' (get ratchet)
She took clothes off and started laughin' (get ratchet)
After that, was all action
You can have your way (your way), just don't play
When I wanna fuck (wanna fuck), just say, "Okay"
You be pullin' up (pullin' up), but you be late
How you make a real nigga wait? (Ayy)

It's a party on the weekend (4Hunnid)
Got a lil' shorty, we creepin' (we creepin')
Throw somethin' in my cup (in my cup)
But I still can't show no love (no love)
I got hoes for every season (I got hoes for the season)
Shawty wanna play, she leavin' (shawty play, she leavin')
Don't try to say what's up (what's up)
When you see a nigga in the club, yeah

You know the vibe, baby
(You know the vibes)
I've been goin' live lately
(Sheesh)
This the fifth time I done seen you out
You've been outside crazy
But I don't judge
I know you wanna live a little
And it's just like that
You bounce right back
Fuck with me, let you decide that
No proceed, just a one night
