		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, the first time we went out
You said you'd never settle down
Without a doubt (doubt)
You said your ex still comes around
I found her things around your house
What's that about? ('Bout)

Don't take a genius, yeah, I see it
Even my friends hate that I'm with you (hate that I'm with you)
A million reasons, should be leaving
I need more hands to count all the issues

But I keep on running through these red flags
I'll blame myself 'cause I know it's bad
But I keep on running through these red flags
I'll see the signs, but I'll still come back
I keep on running through them when you're
Touching my body, I listen to nobody and
Nobody can stop me
I keep on running through these red flags
I'll see the signs, but I'll still come back
So I keep on running

Living at your parents' place
You said you'll never move away
Guess that's okay (okay)
The dinner bill I have to pay
'Cause with you, I like the taste
Just keep the change (change)

Don't take a genius, yeah, I see it
Even my friends hate that I'm with you (hate that I'm with you)
A million reasons, should be leaving
I need more hands to count all the issues

But I keep on running through these red flags
I'll blame myself 'cause I know it's bad
But I keep on running through these red flags
I'll see the signs, but I'll still come back
I keep on running through them when you're
Touching my body, I listen to nobody and
Nobody can stop me
I keep on running through these red flags
I'll see the signs, but I'll still come back
So I keep on running

Mm, mm (red flags)
So I keep on running through these red flags
Mm, mm (red flags)
So I keep on running
