		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You dress me up, I'm your puppet 
You buy me things, I love it 
You bring me food, I need it 
You give me love, I feed it 

And look at the two of us in sympathy 
With everything we see 
I never want anything, it's easy 
You buy whatever I need 

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

You phone me in the evening on hearsay 
And bought me caviar 
You took me to a restaurant off Broadway 
To tell me who you are 

We never-ever argue, we never calculate 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

I'm your puppet 
I love it 

And look at the two of us in sympathy 
And sometimes ecstasy 
Words mean so little, and money less 
When you're lying next to me 

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

Look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

Look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy) 
You pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy) 
You pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy) 
I love you (It's easy, it's so easy) 
(It's easy, it's so easy) 
(It's easy, it's so easy) 
(It's easy, it's so easy) 
(It's easy, it's so easy) 
(It's easy, it's so easy) 
(It's easy, it's so easy)
