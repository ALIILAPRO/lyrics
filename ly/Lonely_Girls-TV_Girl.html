		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the moment that he looked at
You and walked your way
Until the second when you knew
There'd be no second date
Maybe your heart felt fine
It was your head that ached
But still you kissed him in the
Sprinklers but it felt like rain

But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world

And from the moment when he said
Something and made you laugh
Until he was kind enough to let
You know that it wouldn't last
But still you laid there in his
Arms after you'd swore you'd leave
Hair blowing from the ceiling fan but
It felt like a breeze

But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world
But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world
