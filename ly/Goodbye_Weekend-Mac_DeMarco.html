		  Goodbye, weekend
So long, darling
Macky's been a bad, bad boy
And when they're preaching
Be sure to change me
Should rearrange me
Or so they thought

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking, I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

Sort me, place me
Give me a sign
Repeat the mantra
When you're stepping out of line
Give me a number
Something to be
May help out the country boy
But it won't work out on me

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine, just know that you're wasting your time

Don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine, just know that you're wasting your time

Ah, Gigi Bungsu
