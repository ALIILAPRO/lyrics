		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I could be at yours on Friday
Tonight's at the place we started
It's a long way back from "Sorry"
But here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Just tell me somethin'

I don't know what to tell ya
I don't know what to say
I got into my head, I'm sorry I threw it away
But I'm so glad you came back
Even through all the pain
Let me try mend it, I can promise
I swear that I have changed

Oh, let me give you all of me
Can we just start it out for real?

'Cause I could be at yours on Friday
Tonight's at the place we started
It's a long way back from "Sorry"
But here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Just tell me somethin'
Did you miss me?
I've been so messed up since you stopped calling
It's a long way back from "Sorry"
But here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Just tell me somethin'

I had some time to process
I'll take all of the blame
I wasn't thinking
I won't put you through all that again
If you take me back
Then I'ma take you through the facts
Just hold on tight 
'Cause I'm the type to make it right 
And take you all the way

Oh, let me give you all of me
Can we just start it out for real?

'Cause I could be at yours on Friday
Tonight's at the place we started
It's a long way back from "Sorry"
But here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Just tell me somethin'
Did you miss me?
I've been so messed up since you stopped calling
It's a long way back from "Sorry"
But here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Just tell me somethin'

How does it really feel?
We've both waited so long
You're still in my head
It's all I'll ever want
Let's not waste no time
Give it one more try
How does it feel? How does it feel?

'Cause I could be at yours on Friday
Tonight's at the place we started
It's a long way back from "Sorry"
But here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Just tell me somethin'
Did you miss me?
I've been so messed up since you stopped calling
It's a long way back from "Sorry"
But here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Just tell me somethin' 
(Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin')
