		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
And those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword

Stars in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season, returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be for so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

And stars in your multitudes
Lord, let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind wrong
I will never rest
And just to share
It's pleasures and belong
It's pleasures and belong
That's what I've been here for all along
Each day, till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars
By the stars
By the stars

Look down and see the beggars at your feet
Look down and show some mercy if you can
Look down and see the sweepings of the street
Look down, look down upon your fellow man
