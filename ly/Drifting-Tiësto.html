		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I'm drifting, say that you will be there
Hope you'll listen, say your name as my breath
In the deep end, head above to breathe air
If I'm drifting, say that you will be there
If I'm drifting, say that you will be there
Hope you'll listen, say your name as my breath
In the deep end, head above to breathe air
If I'm drifting, say that you will be there

If I'm drifting, say that you will be there
Hope you'll listen, say your name as my breath
In the deep end, head above to breathe air
If I'm drifting, say that you will be there
(Say that you will be there
Say that you will be there
Say that you will be there
Say that you will be there)

If I'm drifting, say that you will be there
Hope you'll listen, say your name as my breath
In the deep end, head above to breathe air
If I'm drifting, say that you will be there
(Say that you will be there
Say that you will be there)
