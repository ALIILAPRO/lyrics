		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found a little bita light, tryna find my heart
Funny when I'm bright gotta lifestyle dark
Hundy when I write get a tight flow spark
With a physco chart, playing dice go start
Oh who are you better know yourself
Know your soul gotta know your wealth
Slow your role getta ahold don't melt
And don't you fall when it feel like hell
Oh who am I M.I.M.E I'm not the one you wanna fuck with
Late nights messin' up my sleep so I'm flustered
Taking out aggression wit my pen because I trust it
Writing tryna get myself a lam colour custard
For the game
Leave 'em hanging by his chain
Click bang feel enraged
Feel it firin' my brain feel insane
Enda story feel the flame
45 to the brain praying lord please help No Glory
No glory I M.I.M.E I'm not the one you wanna fuck with
Late nights messin' up my sleep so I'm flustered
Taking out aggression wit my pen because I trust it
Writing tryna get myself a lam colour custard
Remember I used to be that kid that everyday would get
Rejected Yall got my story the glory was painted on a song
I'm mortified but feel immortal
This pen to this paper always open up different portals
Its me and I im by myself im down to ride
Taking on the tides size of tsunamis touchin' the sky
I get a quick skan it's time to move
Leavin' everything else behind I got something to prove
I'm just running away
No I ain't running away
I got memories saved oh Im just finding my place
Where I belong to
Barely glory in my soul
Eyy Im riding away yeah Im finding my place yeah
I gotta escape yeah. Its what I gotta do
See you on the other side
We all know
No I ain't running running running yeah
Im coming coming coming yeah
Knocking all these demons that been tryna run up on me yeah
Oh I keep on fighting they keep coming coming coming yeah
Ima keep keep on fighting till Im gone
I NEED THE GLORY
