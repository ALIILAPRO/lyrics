		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Afraid of my light now
Got no time for the dark in me
Afraid of my light now

Afraid of my deep hollow
And no time for the light in me
Afraid of my deep hollow

I'm calm but I talk like a waterfall
Taking more and more until I burst
And then I can't live with the aftermath
I'm cursed

Now you don't see me
Put the bottle to my chest
You won't see me

I will miss these streets how they made me feel.
Strong and weak
Now I breathe
Now I breathe

I'm calm but I talk like a waterfall
Taking more and more until I burst
And then I can't live with the aftermath
I'm cursed

Afraid of my light now
Got no time for the dark in me.
Afraid of my light now
Afraid my dark
