		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be your role model
Don't leave the house tomorrow
I gotta meet with Audemars
Tell me what you want
You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
Girl, it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
Flawless, lawless, baby, what you call this?
If this shit don't involve money, I'm off it
I can be your role model, Jimi Hendrix
Pop a pill with me before we end it

No more Ghosts, Wraiths or GT3s (no)
No more award shows, no MTV (no)
So you always double back after you leave? (Oh)
This where you gon' go after you came with me
I done seen it all 'fore I turned twenty-three
I could teach you how to ball if you just let a nigga be
We be so high, that's why we so low-key
She wanna fly with you, let's make three

I'll be your role model
Don't leave the house tomorrow
I gotta meet with Audemars
Tell me what you want
You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
Girl, it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
Flawless, lawless, baby, what you call this?
If this shit don't involve money, I'm off it
I can be your role model, Jimi Hendrix
Pop a pill with me before we end it

Uh, us against the globe
Don't let your attitude ruin what we got
Never stressing if you just lay low
I'll give you lessons, it's so much to know
Go full speed when I say go (go)
Don't push me when I say no
It don't look cheap 'cause it cost Os
And you can't book me less than ten for a show

I'll be your role model
Don't leave the house tomorrow
I gotta meet with Audemars
Tell me what you want
You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
And it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
Flawless, lawless, baby, what you call this?
If this shit don't involve money, I'm off it
I can be your role model, Jimi Hendrix
Pop a pill with me before we end it

You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
Man, it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
