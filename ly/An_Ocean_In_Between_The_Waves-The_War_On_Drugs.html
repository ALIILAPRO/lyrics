		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run away, I'm a traveling man
Been working every day
I watch you as you hesitate
Walking through the rain
I bet against the company, again
They try to redefine
Everything that I know and love
Gotta know you're mine
Yeah

Feel the way that the wild wind blows through the room
Like a nail down through the heart
That just don't beat the same anymore
That might as well be gone

I'm in my finest hour
Can I be more than just a fool?
It always gets so hard to see
Right before the moon

Far away, ma, there's a black sun rising overhead
There's a moon through the midnight rain
How can I surround myself in time and time again?
How can I be free?
Just wanna lay in the moonlight
And see the light shine in
See you in the outline
It never gets too dark to find
Anybody at any time

I'm at the darkened hillside
And there's a haze right between the trees
And I can barely see you
You're like an ocean in between the waves

(Waiting, waiting)
(Come on, storming)
(Got to rise)
(Got to rise as it gets to the hill)

(Breathe in)
(You've got to lean it up against)
(On my mind on this fast slide)
(And you can't go back again)
(I got to rise as it gets to the hill)
(Once more, oh, alright)

(I keep waiting)
(You've got to lean on my chest)
(Come on)
('Cause I can't go back again)
(You've got to rise as it gets to the hill)
(Once more, I lean, once more)

(I'm waiting)
(I'm leaning up against)
(One more)
(Yeah, I can't go back again)
(You've got to rise as it gets to the hill)
(Once more, woo)
(I'm waiting)
(I'm waiting)
