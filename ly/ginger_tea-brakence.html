		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow down, breathe slow down, breathe
What's in the ground beneath your feet?
Get off that screen and let it go
A blue check screams
I always whisper what you want
And it was right here all along
'Cause I found something with a
Taste you can't describe
You take it in and all
Your roots get intertwined and every time
I call you back, I know you're fine
I know you're fine

There's no cancer in the water
It's not an answer or a dream
Your mother and your father
Would rather blow it all on ginger tea

More to offer than a feed, breathe
And you're ready for it
I think it's for the best
You leave this town
You're ready for this, now

Breathe slow down, breathe

Terrified when I'm 'bouta be brave
Since Danny hit me
I've been killin' the game
Power to you if you're ridin' the wave
Couldn't give a fuck 'bout no money or fame
Take you and your girl right back to my place
'Cause man or woman, I'ma fuck you the same
Picking me up when she back in my state
A quick flight to NYC for some cake
Touchdown, 50 came in the clutch
My boy's bound for somethin' bigger than us
Cuts deep like a knife
That's the shit you can feel
My mama love me and her willpower steel
Anxious heart 'bouta beat out my chest
I'm sorry 'bout me and I wish you the best
I just wanna fuck
The marijuana get me scared of trauma
But I'm gon' be okay, good sex every day
Great sex like the greatest is fate
Load my plate with acid, salad, and breaks
I get drunk and she gets stupid high
I just chill 'cause I don't wanna try
When I don't know what the fuck to say
I don't know what the fuck to say
I don't know what the fuck to say
