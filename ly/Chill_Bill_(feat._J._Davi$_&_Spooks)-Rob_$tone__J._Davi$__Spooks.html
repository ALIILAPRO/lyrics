		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dun, dun, da-da-dun
Water, uh
Yeah
Mwah

Rob $tone, two damn phones
Babylons can't crack the code (no)
Used to sip out Styrofoam 
But figured I should stick to dro (weed)
Backwoods overload
Don't like to smoke them Swishers, ho (yup)
If you hit my liquor store 
It's fifty cents for single Ports

Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed (what?)
I said, "Baby, just buy Dutches 'cause you can't smoke for free (or them 'Woods)
I got some loud, but no money, bae, buy me a Fiji" (water)
She said, "You need a job", bitch, fuck a job I still get cheese

Two cell phones, Mr. Mothafuck-a-thot
Mr. I-Be-On-That-Block
12-07 fuck a opp
They hear my name, they see my squad
Rollin' dope up on the spot
I'm with your bitch, she on my jock
Ain't got no time to love a thot
Got niggas mad my flow so hot
Got niggas mad my squad won't stop
We in the game, won't take no loss
I'm sippin' water out the Voss
Got lean all in my fuckin' Sprite
Turnin' up on fuckin' sight
Mr. Kenny Powers 'bout to 
Take your girlfriend home tonight, bitch

And I'm smokin' on that Widow when you see it out the window (yeah)
Got a dusty old tee, lookin' bummy, leave it simple (ayy)
Growin' up I was always in the middle 
So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little
And my brothers besides me, so fuck it, we mobbin' deep
Always grimy, no findin' me, but I be in LG (bitch)
If your lil' fuck boy lame ass wanna creep (ho)
And I live by the lemon 'cause that fucker chose me (ayy)

Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed (what?)
I said, "Baby, just buy Dutches 'cause you can't smoke for free 
I got some loud, but no money, bae, buy me a Fiji"
She said, "You need a job", bitch, fuck a job I still get cheese (cheese, cheese)

Yeah, I got 12-07 in this bitch
Yeah, shout-out to that nigga Burgers
He don't be flippin' them burgers though
That nigga Andy
We don't know where the fuck Andy's at 
But that's my nigga (squad)
Yup, yup
12-07, bitch
Water (comin' up), water, water
