		<p>
		  I can't hold your hand this time

I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call, that's about me

Ask about me, ask about me (ooh)
She ain't got no boundaries
Don't be surprised, baby, look at where ya found me
I'm just as dirty as the shit you see around me
But you can bet they know about us
It's a circus, it's a show around us
Told me she ain't goin' out much
You don't wanna bring your ho around us 'cause trust

I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky (smoky)
Hit a couple spots where they know me (know me)
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call, that's about me

I apologize for making you feel special (ooh)
Eighty proof liquor inside of my blood vessels (ah)
Light beams hit off the side of my watch bezel
Twenty-two and poppin', I feel like I'm on schedule, hey
Don't be so naïve
Don't get in your feelings then try me (uh)
Nothin' wrong with a side piece, hey
Go ahead if you tryna leave
'Cause what's a nine to a dime piece?
What's a headache to a youngin tryna find peace?
What's one girl to a couple Siamese? (Ooh)
What's a chase when they down to come and find me? (Find me)
Never seen her 'round, said she went to Shawnee (huh)
Told me this ain't really my scene
Well, baby, this is my party and the drinks all free
So have a good time, it's on me (why?)

'Cause I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call, that's about me
