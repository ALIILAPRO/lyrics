		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aren't I supposed to be happy now?
There's nothing left for me to laugh about
Happy now, they're all so happy for me

So take a drive around town in my douchebag car
Like the superstar that I pretend to be
Nothing feels better than buying love
When push comes to shove, I'm lonely

With everybody talkin' 'bout you
You won't remember who you are
Everybody talkin' 'bout you
Doesn't get you far

I was supposed to be happy now
There's nothing left for me to laugh about
I was supposed to be happy now
They're all so happy for me

Always such an anxious child, never wild
Always worrying
Never any good with surprises, compromises
I wanted everything

They'd tell me
"Everything is not about you
It doesn't matter who you are
Everything is not about you
But if you work hard"

Are we supposed to be happy now?
There's nothing left for me to laugh about
I was supposed to be happy now
They're all so happy for me

Happy now?
There's nothing left for me to laugh about
I was supposed to be happy now
They're all so happy for me

And if I'm not I'll never be happy now
There's nothing left for me to laugh about
Maybe I'll never be happy now
They're all so happy for me
