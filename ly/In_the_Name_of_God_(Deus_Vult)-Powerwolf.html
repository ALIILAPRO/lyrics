		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the name of God in the name of God
In the name of God we go to Heaven

In the name of God in the name of God
In the name of God we go to Heaven

Martyrs in the name of God
We're knights in war and fire
Raise your sword for holy blood
We burn them on the pyre
To defend, to command, to the holy war
Mater Maria
To the end we will stand, we are fighting for
Deus in regnium!

In the name of God in the name of God
In the name of God we go to Heaven

In the name of God in the name of God
In the name of God we go to Heaven

Brothers in believe and sword
Through nights of blood and thunder
Strike for glory and reward
We came to kill and plunder

To your fate, your crusade, to the holy war
Mater Maria
To the end we will stand, we are fighting for
Deus in regnium!

In the name of God in the name of God
In the name of God we go to Heaven
In the name of God in the name of God
In the name of God we follow
In the name of God we follow

In the name of Mater Maria
In the Name of God
In the name of Mater Maria deus in regnium!

Sanctus Christus, Deus vult
In the name of God sanctus Iesus, Deus Vult
In the name of God
Sanctus Christus, Deus Vult
In the name of God

Cantus lupus, In the Name of God
Agnus Christus, In the Name of God
Sanctus lupus, In the Name of God
