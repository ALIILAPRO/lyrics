		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, bad man, what's the reason why? (What's the reason why?)
Oh, innocents always have to die
By your hand
No, I will never understand (never understand)
Why these cowards bow to your demands
They're at the mercy of another bad man
Another bad man
Another bad man

Bad man, such a sad man
Was it ever enough
Will you ever find a new obsession
What a bad man, like a blind man
So lost in the dark
Still searching for his own salvation
Bad man, you've been had, man
You can never return
And you're never gonna find redemption now
Bad man, a bad man
Another madman

Oh, bad man, what's the reason why? (What's the reason why?)
Oh, innocents always have to die
By your hand
No, I will never understand (never understand)
Why these cowards bow to your demands
They're at the mercy of another bad man
Another bad man
Another bad man

Bad man
No, you didn't think that we were ready for war
And you questioned our determination, take it back, man
'Cause we're not with dealing with your shit anymore
You're about to have an education
Damn, man, got a bad man
Need to settle the score
There's no way that you can be forgiven now
Bad man, a bad man
A fucking madman

Oh, bad man, what's the reason why? (What's the reason why?)
Oh, innocents always have to die
By your hand
No, I will never understand (never understand)
Why these cowards bow to your demands
They're at the mercy of another bad man

Bad man, what's the reason why? (What's the reason why?)
Oh, innocents always have to die
By your hand
No, I will never understand (never understand)
Why these cowards bow to your demands
They're at the mercy of another bad man

B-b-bad man
Another bad man
