		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please man, pretty please with a cherry on top, okay?

The weather cold
The weather so
Chill, chilly really penguin feather roll
Cause I'm sipping Pro'
Yeah that 'meth is pro'
Promethazine, yeah a stepping stone
Oh they acting up? Get your weapon drawn
They only killing time, another second gone
I heard your man ain't home
Now you melatone
But you acting young
And you hella drunk

I need you (I'ma wait for you my lil' momma come home)
I want you
(And I swear to God, you gon' miss me when I'm gone)
I need you
(I'm a lovesick fuck, and it's right but you wrong)

I need you
I want you, come on fuck me, babe
I need you
I want you
I need you
I want you, come on fuck me, babe
I need you
I want you

Okay she giving me love
But it fuck my energy up
Every time it's finna be summer, only got the memories of us
And now we industry lovers
They making enemies of us
I mean sometimes we in public they drain this energy from us
Visit Italia, be my se√±orita
La vida or I be there either way you need a reason
I ain't talking bout MasterCards, debit cards either
Credit charge, Kermit the frog, margaritas
Yeah, I heard she got a main homie (yeah)
Yeah, you wanna lay the hands on me (yeah)
But you should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishing I ain't had no pants on me

I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I want you
I'm lovesick fuck

I need you
I want you, come on fuck me, babe
I need you
I want you
I need you
I want you, come on fuck me, babe
I need you
I want you

I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
I need you
I'm a lovesick fuck
