		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Oh, heat it up

Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame"
Thou givest fever
When we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm a fire, fever, yeah, I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said, "daddy, oh, don't you dare"

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever I'm his Missus
Daddy won't you treat him right, go

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
