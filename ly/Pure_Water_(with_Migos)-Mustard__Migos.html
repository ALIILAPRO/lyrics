		<p>
		  Woo
Y'all already know who I am? Right?
(Mustard on the beat, ho)
Let's go

Uh (woo, woo), no Master P (ayy)
Ten bad bitches and they after me (bad)
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece (uh)
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete (uh)
Big drip, what you call it? (Big drip, yeah)
Ice chain, pure water (ice, ice, ice)
You got the cash, but can't afford 'em (cash, no)
You got the bag, but can't afford 'em (give me the bag)

Give me the beat, I ride it like a jetski (hey)
So many bad bitches they harassin' me (bad)
They like me 'cause I rap and be with the athletes (athletes)
Stop askin' me (uh), I know they mad at me (nah)
Hop in the coupe, then I slide like it's Vaseline (skrrt, skrrt)
West coast 6-4 jump like a trampoline (6-4)
Take a brick out, put it on a triple beam (brick out)
I'm not from Canada, but I see a lot of tings (Canada)
Dismantle her, I know how to handle her (woo, hey)
Light the candle up, make you put a banner up (up, up)
Toss a 50 up, make 'em tear the club up (tear the club up)
Took your bitch out the game, I had to sub her (swap, swap, here we go)

Uh (woo, woo), no Master P (ayy)
Ten bad bitches and they after me (bad)
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece (uh)
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete (uh, woo)
Big drip, what you call it? (Big drip, big drip, yeah)
Ice chain, pure water (ice, ice, ice)
You got the cash, but can't afford 'em (hey, cash)
You got the bag but can't afford 'em (woo, woo, woo)

Offset
Pimpin' ain't easy, make her open up and eat it (eat it)
Stars in the ceilin' and my seats, they Tempur-Pedic (hey, hey)
I see them niggas watchin' and they plottin', tryna sneak me (plot)
I can't hit a thot, can't trust a thot, they tellin' secrets (thot, no)
Big bank take lil' bank, lil' nigga (cash)
Catch him down bad, that nigga cry a whole river (hey)
Nawf on my back, I'm takin' care of the whole village (Nawf)
Somebody got shot, what you talkin' 'bout, Willis? (Who?)
In the lobby with a brick, I'm Ricky Bobby with your bitch
I go Lawrence with the fit, in the 'Rari with no tint ('Rari, drip, drip)
I'm from the trench, I got the dirty money rinsed (oh)
You was poppin' so I popped and prayed to God, repent (oh, oh, oh, let's go)

Uh (woo, woo), no Master P (ayy)
Ten bad bitches and they after me (bad) 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece (uh)
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete (uh, woo)
Big drip, what you call it? (Big drip, yeah)
Ice chain, pure water (ice, ice, ice)
You got the cash, but can't afford 'em (cash, no)
You got the bag but can't afford 'em

T-takeoff, no limit to the money (money, nah)
I picked the gang up, took a flight across the country ('cross the country, where?)
I tipped the waitress, told her, "Keep the ones comin'"
Hit the store to get some Backwoods and left the Wraith runnin', fuck it
Lookin' like they plottin', but we already on it (on it)
In the lab with Celine like that bag that she wanted (Celine)
A lot of tings, ass bustin' out them jeans, make you want it (ting)
Make you wanna spend a 50, hit the scene with her, don't it? (Scene)
Whole team full of queens, gotta keep their eyes on me (queen)
It's a snake in disguise, probably wanna slide on me (slide)
I bet they ride on 'em when I put that prize on 'em (prize)
Ten bad bitches, bro Quavo got five of 'em (five)

Uh (woo, woo), no Master P (ayy)
Ten bad bitches and they after me (bad)
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece (uh)
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete (uh)
Big drip, what you call it? (Big drip, yeah)
Ice chain, pure water (ice, ice, ice)
You got the cash, but can't afford 'em (cash, no)
You got the bag but can't afford 'em

Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Two-step (oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah)
Goodnight
