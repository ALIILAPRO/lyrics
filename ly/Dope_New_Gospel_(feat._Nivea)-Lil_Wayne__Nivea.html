		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me see like an eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

Hasta la vida, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro so my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that it's a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
These tattoos, they can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero
Man in the mirror my 'migo
Creme de la, creme de la creole
Couple a cracks in the mirror, he been through the cracks
I see no cracks in me, though

Daytime, start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God, Wheezy back, order is restored, all is right with the world
Last times become we lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind, but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road, but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the mothafuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
Yeah, it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
It's written all over my face
Tattoos that can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks
