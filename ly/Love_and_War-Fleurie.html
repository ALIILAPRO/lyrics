		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm next in line and my supply is running out
It's time to leave, the clouds are hanging low
The truth begins to show

Lover, hunter, friend and enemy
You will always be every one of these
Lover, hunter, friend and enemy
You will always be every one of these
Nothing's fair in love and war

In life, in love, this time I can't afford to lose
For one, for all, I'll do what I have to do
You can't understand, it's all part of the plan

Broken pieces of the night
Sing like hollow lullabies
You and I, always in disguises

Lover, hunter, friend and enemy
You will always be every one of these
Lover, hunter, friend and enemy
You will always be every one of these
Nothing's fair in love and war
