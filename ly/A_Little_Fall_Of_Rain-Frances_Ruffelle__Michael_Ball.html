		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
You're here, that's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow

But you will live, 'Ponine dear God above
If I could heal your wounds with words of love

Just hold me now, and let it be
Shelter me, comfort me

You would live a hundred years
If I could show you how
I won't desert you now

The rain can't hurt me now
This rain will wash away what's past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
I'll sleep in your embrace at last

The rain that brings you here
Is Heaven-blessed!
The skies begin to clear And I'm at rest
A breath away from where you are
I've come home from so far
So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius

I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now

I'm here
That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close

And rain (and rain)
Will make the flowers (will make the flowers grow)
