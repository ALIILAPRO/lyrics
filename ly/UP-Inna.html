		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time there 
Was a girl who made a wish
To find herself a love and 
finally make a switch
Then you came around, you 
healed another stitch
And I'm glad about that 
I can finally make a switch

And I know, yeah, I know
Many would like to be in my shoes
And I know, yeah, I know
With you I got nothing to lose

When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch

You can use that magic touch
You can use that magic touch

I was running all the time, babe
You came and slowed me down
It's me, myself and you now
Levitating off the ground
And when you came around, you 
Healed another stitch
I was lost, but now you found me
I can finally make the switch

And I know, yeah, I know
Many would like to be in my shoes
And I know, yeah, I know
With you I got nothing to lose

When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch

You can use that magic touch
You can use that magic touch
