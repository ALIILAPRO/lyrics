		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Traphouse, crazy titch
Trap, trap house, crazy titch
Yeah

I don't complain, I just get rich
Don't pick sides, so I don't switch
Trap house, crazy titch, old school Benzo, Money Mitch
Tennis bracelets hit an ace, you still worried 'bout my face
This shit is a brand, this shit ain't brand new
Still the same me but with two-hundred pairs of shoes (pairs of shoes)
Free my brudda Y, free KD, he's still inside
Try legitimize my life, it's too hard, I try
Still, every single show I have to make a call to go and get the fire
Go get it, my bitch is packin', she's a rider
Go get it, I buy her all that she desires
No kiddin', my life got two dates and a hyphen, I get it

I'm with bro and we got ten bricks (ten)
And we're changin' locations
Urus cost an arm and a leg (arm and a leg)
Patiently, I'm waitin' on success (waitin' on success)
Tell bae that I'm comin', please, start takin' off your dress (yeah, yeah)
PJ at the clear port, I ain't goin' airport
Bottega the Raincoat, still wet
Fuck the feds, it's always case closed
This shit ain't no fake gold
Diamonds always rainbow, splash

I don't complain, I just get rich
Don't pick sides, so I don't switch
Trap house crazy, titch, old school Benzo, money Mitch
Tennis bracelets hit an ace, you still worried 'bout my face
This shit is a brand, this shit ain't brand new
Still the same me but with two-hundred pairs of shoes
Free my brudda Y, free KD, he's still inside
Try legitimize my life, it's too hard, I try
Still, every single show I have to make a call to go and get the fire
Go get it, my bitch is packin', she's a rider
Go get it, I buy her all that she desires
No kiddin', my life got two dates and a hyphen, I get it

Ten, ten, ten
