		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Oh, shall I stay, would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help falling in love with you

Oh, like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things are meant to be

Oh, take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Oh, for I can't help falling in love with you
