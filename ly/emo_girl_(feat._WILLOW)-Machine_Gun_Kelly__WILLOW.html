		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I am a God)

Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Yeah, she's got

Makeup by the mirror in her bedroom
Thigh-high fishnets and some black boots
Nose pierced with the cigarette perfume
Half dead but she still looks so cute (yeah)
She is a monster in disguise
And she knows all the words to the trap songs
Takes pics with a cherry-red lipstick
Says she only dates guys with a big (mmm)

I fell in love with an emo girl
I'm in love with an emo girl
I fell in love with an emo girl
All I want is an emo girl

Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na

She puts eyeliner on her dark skin
She tells me lies but she knows all of my secrets
And when we drive in the car and I say, "Who is this band?"
She says, "You won't understand, it's some next shit"
Choke-choke-choker on her neck, kiss me
Holy fuck, I'm bleeding on your Blink tee
So, so, so many regrets, you tell me you're depressed
Baby girl, that makes two of us

I fell in love with an emo girl
I'm in love with an emo girl
I fell in love with an emo girl
All I want is an emo girl

I fell in love with an emo girl
I'm in love with an emo girl
I fell in love with an emo girl
All I want is an emo girl

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-uh-uh

I fell in love with an emo girl
I'm in love with an emo girl
I fell in love with an emo girl
All I want is an emo girl

I fell in love with an emo girl
I'm in love with an emo girl
I fell in love with an emo girl
All I want is an emo girl

She's in love, emo girl
Okay, I'm in love, hahaha

(Yo, oh my God, haha, ah)
