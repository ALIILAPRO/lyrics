		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that you're damned
You say that your life isnt fair
What's right and what's wrong
You've got your needs and you just dont care
On and on we drift, back to where we were before
You can welcome me in, I will not walk through that door
I may be blind but I'll find my way
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day
You can carry your courage, I've said, but these times, and I've cut you free
Keep your word to your self, I buried what was in my sympathy
On and on we drift, back to where we were before
You can welcome me in, I will not walk through that door
I may be blind but I'll find my way
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day
Oh stormy day
Stormy day
I may be blind but I'll find my way

I may be blind but I'll find my way
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day
I may be blind but I'll find my way
Like a Lost Prayer on a stormy day
Oh stormy day
