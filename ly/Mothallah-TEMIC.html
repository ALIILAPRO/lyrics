		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Follow me 
far away from here
from fear

I'll never leave 
I'll never disappear 
Believe 
in me 

Come with me 
far away from here
from fear 

I'll never leave 
never disappear
Believe 

In the times 
where our courage hides
and cries 

We will fight 
until the rays of light
stand high 

We'll fight through 
the darkest night 
Mothallah  
will be our only guide 
We'll sing this lullaby 
to the skies  
as our final cry 
We'll find our morning star 
deep inside 
buried in our spine 
These words are 
all we need 
to be free 
Follow me 

In the times 
where our courage hides
and cries 

We will fight 
until the rays of light
stand high 
  
We'll fight the darkest night  
We'll sing this lullaby  
We'll be the morning star 
We'll bless our battle scars  
Set us free 

We'll fight through 
the darkest night 
Mothallah  
will be our only guide 
We'll sing this lullaby 
to the skies  
as our final cry 
We'll find our morning star 
deep inside 
buried in our spine 
These words are 
all we need 
to be free 
Follow me 

Follow me down
