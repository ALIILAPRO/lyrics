		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had nine lives but I lost all of them
And I've been searching in the night and I've been searching in the rain
I tried to find them, but they disappeared
They walked away they dressed in black they left my side and all I say
Is that I wasted time when I looked for them
For now I know that things gone past are never to be found again
No never never again
I had nine lives, but lost all of them

I had a plan, but never finished it
And I've been searching for the thought and I've been searching in a haze
I try all days to remember it
But now the blueprint in my mind has gone, my mind forgot the color of direction
And my eyes they see the hands that could've built
That could've constructed the empire in my mind
The empire I'll never find
I had a plan, but that was where it ended, ended
