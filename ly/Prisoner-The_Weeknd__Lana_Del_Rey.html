		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You bring good to my lonely life, honestly (honestly)
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When, I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's amazing

Maybe I've been always destined 
To end up in this place (up in this place), yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish
But I want it all (want it all)
Love will always be a lesson
Let's get out of its way (out of its way)
'Cause I know, all I know, all I know (ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo, woo, woo

I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (for too long)
Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch (-out the touch)
I feel the rush and it's amazing, mhm

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place (oh)
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (out of its way)
'Cause I know, all I know, all I know (ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo, woo, woo (woah)

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold (empty and so cold)
I'm a prisoner to my decisions (prisoner)
Woo (yeah), woo (yeah), woo

I don't know
I get so wrapped up 
In a world 
Where nothing's as it seems
And real life i
Is stranger than my dreams
Mhm, mhm
Ooh
Ooh
