		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When stunted hammers place
With men my mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck I'm sure
I'm sure by sheer atrocity

A cure I know that soothes
The soul, the soul impossibly
A moment's silence when 
My baby puts her mouth on

Me and my babe relaxing
Catching manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God
Looks on in abject apathy

A swollen order means 
A prayer in perfect parody
A moment's silence when 
My baby puts her mouth on me

When the meaning's gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes
In the common tongue
In you lovin' me

And it's easy, darling
I don't need a remedy
And the reason comes
In the common tongue
In you lovin' me

What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the sin we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed is pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby
Puts her mouth on me

Since it's all been gone
To it's reckoning
Then the reason comes
In the common tongue
In you lovin' me

We begged for some
Now we lovingly
Let the reason come
In the common tongue
In you lovin' me (woo)

Like a heathen clung
To the harmony
Let the reason come
To the common tongue
Of you lovin' me

It's a silent night upon the rosary
Let the reason come
In the common tongue
In you lovin' me
