		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You give me hope
When all around was lost
And I could see no point in trying
For I saw love passing by me
You came into my life
You came into my life

I look around
And what I had is gone
Now, I've finally found
What I've been missing
The road I travel is so clear
Since you came into my life
You came into my life

You're the star
My shinin' light
The mornin' dawnin'
When the sun comes up so bright
And the closer I get
Yes, it's true
You're the star
Above the storm
I wanna wrap you in my arms
And keep you warm
No, I don't wanna live without you
No, I've never found nothin' like you

You give me faith
The kind I though had gone
Somewhere down the line
I think I lost it
Now, I've found changes in my heart
Your faith in me is strong
Your faith in me is strong

You're the star
My shinin' light
The mornin' dawnin'
When the sun comes up so bright
And the closer I get
Yes, it's true
You're the star
Above the storm
I wanna wrap you in my arms
And keep you warm
No, I don't wanna live without you
No, I've never found nothin' like you

You're the star
My shinin' light
The mornin' dawnin'
When the sun comes up so bright
And the closer I get
Yes, it's true
You're the star
Above the storm
I wanna wrap you in my arms
And keep you warm
No, I don't wanna live without you
No, I've never found nothin' like you

You're the star
You're the star
You're the star, oh yeah
I've never found nothin' like you
No, I've never found nothin' like you
