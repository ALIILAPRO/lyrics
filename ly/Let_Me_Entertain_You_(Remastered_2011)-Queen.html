		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey it's a sell out - hey
Let me welcome you Ladies and Gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment?
Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock you gonna roll you
Get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzmatazz you
With a little bit of style
C'mon let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and I'll pill you
I'll crueladeville you
And to thrill you I'll use any device

A ha ha ha haa

We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force of course

We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and the amplification listen
Hey if you need a fix if you want a high
Stickells I'll see to that
With Electra and EMI
We'll show you where it's at
So c'mon let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you

If you want to see some action
You get nothing but the best
The 'S' and 'M' attraction
We've got the pleasure chest
Chicago down to New Orleans
We get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son of a bitch of a time
C'mon
Let me entertain, let me entertain
Let me entertain you tonight

Hey where's my backstage pass ?
Hey that Brian May he's outta sight man
Hey that was a bit of alright wasn't it
Outrageous costumes
Not many not many
And I always wanted to be in opera
Oh man I could give you lessons if you like
