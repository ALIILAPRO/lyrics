		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't waste time with hamsterboys
Trying to chat me up
Talking bout cryptocurrencies
How do I shut you up
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
Staring at me like an NPCs
Somebody make it stop
Me I'm so executive
They love me at the bank
If you're standing next to me
You better understand
I'm an angelic entity
Milkshake with my fries
Protective of my energy
Picky with my vibes

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Want somebody to talk to me so sweet
That's what I need

Tell me can you be the one for me?

I don't waste time with hamsterboys
Tryna disturb my peace
I got superpowers boy
Manifesting dreams
I got clear skin, clairvoyant, clear vision
Q-tip your ears boy listen
I want a man, a man, a man
Who can easily understand
Strong is the man not afraid to cry
Show me your soul what you want from life
Simp for me give me all you got
Tender love and a big, big...heart?

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Want somebody to talk to me so sweet
That's what I need

Tell me can you be the one for me?

Wanted to be rich since I was six I told my daddy
I don't want a stupid pony I want a Ferrari
Boy I'm Santa Clausy tell me you been nice or naughty?
Closet all designer and my wheels are double Roddy
I just need a man washing dishes doing laundry
Keep him in my kitchen while I'm out doing pilates
Video's for me and I don't plan on making copies
Did I hurt your feelings baby boy? Go tell your mommy

Tell me can you be the one for me?
