		  La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

We both know that people talk
So let's give 'em what they want
Something to remember
(Da-da-da-da-da)
Got all eyes on me and you
Watching every single move
Turning up the pressure
(Da-da-da-da-da)

Baby, it's just us against the world, it's you and me
We don't need no negative, no negativity
Just keep dirty dancing on me, dancing through the pain
Turn them speakers up and tune it out
Like all that gossip, it just sound like

Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
In-in-in one ear and out the other
Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
A-a-all that gossip, gossip

When you moving in that light
Swear, you're all I need in life
All that shit don't matter 
(Da-da-da-da-da) (so)
Stop right over here
Both hands on our ears
As they get madder (as they get madder)

Baby, it's just us against the world, it's you and me
We don't need no negative, no negativity
Just keep dirty dancing on me, dancing through the pain
Turn them speakers up and tune it out
Like all that gossip, it just sound like

Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
In-in-in one ear and out the other
Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
A-a-all that gossip, gossip, gossip

Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
(In one ear and out the other)
Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
(All that gossip, gossip)

It's just us against the world, it's you and me
Don't need no negative, no negativity
(In one ear and out the other)
Keep dirty dancing on me, dancing through the pain
Turn them speakers up and tune it out
Like all that gossip, it just sound like

Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
In-in-in one ear and out the other
Blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah-blah-blah
Blah, blah, blah
A-a-all that gossip, gossip, gossip
