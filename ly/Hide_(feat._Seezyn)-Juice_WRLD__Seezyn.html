		  Need a drink?
(Hoo, ayy, ayy)
Found my home (Ooh, ooh)
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine

Really think I found my home
Shorty make me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home
And I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control
I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls
But we're fine with it

There's love at my front door, short notice
You're not like the same girls I notice
Think I met my soul mate
Yeah, I know it
When it gets dark outside
In you I confide
You help me face my demons
I won't hide, hide
Girls like you are hard to find
I hope you don't mind
If I give you the time of your life, life, life

Really think I found my home
Shorty make me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home
And I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control
I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls
But we're fine with it

Life is not the same
With your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here
I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down
I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Girl, is there something that you try to find?
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world, because you're worth it

Really think I found my home
Shorty make me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home
And I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control
I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls
But we're fine with it
