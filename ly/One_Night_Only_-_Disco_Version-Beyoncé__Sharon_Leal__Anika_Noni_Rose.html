		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haaaa (Come on baby)
Haaaa (One night)
Haaaa (One night only)
You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line
I had no doubt that I could love you forever
The only trouble is I really
Don't have the time i've got one night only
One night only that's all I have to spare
One night only let's not pretend you care
I've got one night only one night only
Come on, we better come on one night only
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn)
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn) one night only
One night only one night only (Oh)
One night only (yeah yeah)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
You and I will be running out of time!
Whoo yeah (Come on, come on)
Whoo, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, yeah (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on come on, come on
Come on, come on come on, come on
Come on!
