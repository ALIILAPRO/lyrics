		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What we do we never tell
My body is goin' crazy, wild thing
Riding like a carousel (carousel)
I let your body see it with a bang bang

Step by step, I got you breakin'
Walls up high but I'ma pull them down
Take that heart and make it vacant, baby
Gotta surrender yourself to the bounce

Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talkin' about the tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breakin' through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talkin' about the tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breakin' through

Hands up give it to the boom, hands up
Hands up give it to the boom, hands up, hands up

I know the places where you hide
No matter where you go, boy, you'll be mine
'Cause I believe in you and I
I let your body see with the bang bang

Step by step, I got you breakin'
Walls up high but I'ma pull them down
Take that heart and make it vacant, baby
Gotta surrender yourself to the bounce

Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talkin' about the tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breakin' through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talkin' about the tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breakin' through

Hands up give it to the boom, hands up
Hands up give it to the boom, hands up, hands up

No, we don't settle
We're raisin' the level up higher
No it ain't over
We givin' it all to the fire

Step by step, I got you breakin'
Walls up high but I'ma pull them down
Take that heart and make it vacant, baby
Gotta surrender yourself to the bounce

Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talkin' about the tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breakin' through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talkin' about the tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breakin' through

Hands up give it to the boom, hands up
Hands up give it to the boom, hands up, hands up
