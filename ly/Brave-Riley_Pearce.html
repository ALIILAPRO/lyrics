		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you scared, because I am too
This fear in my head has been there for too long
We sleep now with the light on
But shadows make shapes in the light and I don't know what they might be

Are you cold, because I am too
Cover your toes with a jacket and your bones with a blanket I will
She tells me that I'll be alright
For a second it feels like I believe her but I forgot the way that I felt
I'm trying, I'm just trying to be brave

I'm trying, I'm trying to be brave

It's the body of water that splits us right down the middle
But I'll be coming back for you

Are you lost, because I am too
Directions mean nothing in the dark when you don't know where you stand
The maps gone, so are our footprints too
To get home now will take something that I'm not sure that I have left
I'm trying, I'm just trying to be brave

I'm trying, I'm trying to be brave
It's the body of water that splits us right down the middle
But I'll be coming back for you

I'll be coming back for you 
I'll be coming back for you 
I'll be coming back for you
