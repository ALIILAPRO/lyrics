		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rose colored lenses
They’re tinting my senses
My altered memories
Changing how I think
Stuck in illusion
It turns to delusion
My life is like a screen
Framing what I see

Feels like i’m crawling
Underneath, the truth
I’m stalling
Put it off, I put it off
It’s daunting
It always leaves me wanting (more)

Maybe I’ll just resign 
Make a world in my mind
Maybe just bide my time
Till all of the stars align 
Maybe it’s fantasy
Maybe it’s just a dream
But in here I can see (with)

Rose colored lenses
They’re tinting my senses
My altered memories
Changing how I think
Stuck in illusion
It turns to delusion
My life is like a screen
Framing what I see

Failing me
My vision’s failing me
Light in my eye is dimmin
Colors running, dripping down under and
Change the image, to a permanent lie 

Maybe I’ll just resign 
Make a world in my mind
Maybe just bide my time
Till all of the stars align 
Maybe it’s fantasy
Maybe it’s just a dream
But in here I can see (with)

Display what you want me to see now

Rose colored lenses
They’re tinting my senses
My altered memories
Changing how I think
Stuck in illusion
It turns to delusion
My life is like a screen
Framing what I see
