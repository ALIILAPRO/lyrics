		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can anybody cure me from a broken heart?
And put it back together 'cause it fell apart
The blind leadin' the blind, we walkin' in the dark
(Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)
Go

Can anybody cure me from a broken heart?
And put it back together 'cause it broke apart (damn)
The blind leadin' the blind, we walkin' in the dark
I think that it's contagious, we forever scarred (scarred)
Put diamonds on our chests to ease our achin' heart (burr)
So I keep you close to me so we never apart
You know it comes to light what happens in the dark
No matter what, it still can't ease my broken heart (go)

I'm just sittin' here with my thoughts, thinkin' 'bout these wars I fought (wars)
And all the flights I caught and all this ice I bought (for what?)
We used to pray for sunny days to take the rain away (the rain)
Guess all the money and the fame can't take the pain away (damn)
Been one a hell of a year, lost two of my closest peers (fuck)
Still can't believe it's real or process they ain't here (it's real?)
The robbers on they job (for real?), the police got a job (for real?)
Man, rapping's a dangerous job, so I move like the mob (for real)
No, they can't beat me or defeat me 'less I catch a charge (no)
But I ain't gon' make it easy for 'em, I'ma make it hard (hard)
Say only God can judge (judge), but that's just a façade (façade) 
'Cause if you live by the sword, you get judged by the judge (judge)
'Cause these niggas crash dummies (crash dummies)
These niggas really flunkies (really flunkies)
Please don't try to run up, get done up just like that last dummy (grrah)
Hood full of walkin' zombies (zombies)
These niggas really junkies (junkies)
But it ain't just in me, it's on me, so I move like the army (it's Gucci)

Can anybody cure me from a broken heart?
And put it back together 'cause it broke apart (damn)
The blind leadin' the blind, we walkin' in the dark
I think that it's contagious, we forever scarred (scarred)
Put diamonds on our chests to ease our achin' heart (burr)
So I keep you close to me so we never apart
You know it comes to light what happens in the dark
No matter what, it still can't ease my broken heart

Spent Christmas in a cell
My birthday in a jail (fuck)
Couldn't even use the phone, folks had to send me mail (mail)
They all prayed that I fail (they prayed)
Somehow, I still prevail (stayed)
Guess only God can judge (God) and only time will tell (time)
Can't tell the good part of the story and leave out the bad part (huh?)
You out of sight, you out of mind and that's the really sad part (facts)
Didn't wanna listen, mama told him that his head was hard (mom)
Didn't have no vest on, heard they shot him, hit him in the heart
You know it always come to light what happens in the dark (true)
My life look pretty, but my past ugly as Bubba Sparxxx
R.I.P. Young Dolph, forever you'll be in my heart (in my heart)
R.I.P. to Take' and Scarr, that shit just broke my heart (Lord)

Can anybody cure me from a broken heart?
And put it back together 'cause it broke apart (damn)
The blind leadin' the blind, we walkin' in the dark
I think that it's contagious, we forever scarred (scarred)
Put diamonds on our chests to ease our achin' heart (burr)
So I keep you close to me so we never apart
You know it comes to light what happens in the dark
No matter what, it still can't ease my broken heart

First 2Pac died, then Biggie died and it greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself, repeated itself, repeated itself
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died and it greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself, repeated itself, repeated itself
Damn
