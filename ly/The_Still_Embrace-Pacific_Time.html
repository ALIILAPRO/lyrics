		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taking it slow
In a lone cyclone
Running his hand through his hair
c man about town in the foreground
Watching the tiles in the air
cnd so you handle with care
Yellow on the stairs
Watching every step as we go
It's a lone window, yeah I know
c spotlight
In the air
 
One of these days
You will walk in the doorway
The still embrace
Knew it was you when I saw your face

Tangled in gold 
Tumbles and folds
Lining the rails of the stairs
There's a crowded room 
Where they're walking in soon
Two eyes float through the air
Through the air

One of these days
You will walk in the doorway
The still embrace
Knew it was you when I saw your face
One of these days
You will walk in the doorway
The still embrace
Knew it was you when I saw your face
