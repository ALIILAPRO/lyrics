		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two)

Are you ready? Are you ready?
We gonna tear it up

Tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up, baby

Tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up as you go along

Tear it up
Square it up
Wake it up, baby

Tear it up
Stir it up
Stake it out and you can't go wrong
(Hey)

Give me your mind, baby give me your body
Give me some time, baby let's have a party
It ain't no time for sleepin' baby

Soon it's 'round your street I'm creeping
You better be ready, you gotta

Tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up, baby

Tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up as you go along

Tear it up
Square it up
Wake it up, baby

Tear it up
Stir it up
Stake it out and you can't go wrong
(Hey)

Love you 'cause you're sweet and I love you 'cause you're naughty
I love you for you mind, baby give me your body
I wanna be a toy at your birthday party
Wind me up, wind me up, wind me up, let me go

Tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up, baby

Tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up as you go along

Tear it up
Square it up (ayy, yeah)
Wake it up, baby

(Oh, yeah)
baby, baby are you ready for me? (Oh yeah)
Baby, baby, baby are you ready for love? (Oh yeah)
I love you so near, I love you so far
I gotta tell you you're driving me ga ga
