		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a dance ting!
Blow!
Boys and girls come sit down and ride 'pon this ridim
Oh oh oh oh oh blow!

He was looking, said he want to hook up
But she don't want to hook up
Told him just go
And then she looked up and said she want to hook up
I really want to hook up
Told her let's go

Baby, I can't believe everything
Your body makes me wanna do
And the way that you move on the floor
Now I think I'm in love with you (in love with you)
Grab my waist
Want to get with the rhythm and that move you do
Switch my hips on the floor
Baby, slow to keep up with you

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Watch out baby
I'm a drop a little somethin'
And ride it, baby
We can do a little somethin'
Let's hook up baby
Want to get a little somethin'
And you know baby
Let's hook up a little somethin'

Baby I can't believe everything
That I feel when I dance with you
From the small of my back to the breath on my neck
To the move you do (oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Put your body
Gotta get my body up right next to you (Yeo! Come closer now)
Move the party
Gotta rock the party until they're over you

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Boy I can't explain
What you do to me
My whole world has changed
I'm living a fantasy
Tonight I'm in the mood
Please take me by your hand
I want to get in your groove
Oh baby take me there

Yo! Everybody get up now!
If y'all sit down
Me wan' see ya pon the dance floor a move now
Yo! Everybody dance!

The bodies are shaking
Wanna make my body keep shaking
Better get your butt out here baby
Come on, let's go
So do how you do it
Jump around, bend over, get to it
Make it go back down to the ground
Pick it up let's go

The bodies are shaking
Wanna make my body keep shaking
Better get your butt out here baby
Come on, let's go
So do how you do it
Jump around, bend over, get to it
Make it go back down to the ground
Pick it up let's go

Don't stop
Just get, get on da floor
Butts drops
Hips pop, poppin' for sure
Who's got, got it
Get it some more
One time, two time, three time we go

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now

Watch out baby
I'm a drop a little somethin'
And ride it, baby
We can do a little somethin'
Let's hook up baby
Want to get a little somethin'
And you know baby
Let's hook up a little somethin'

Back it up now
Bump your rump now
Grab my waist now
Work it out now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up now
Take it lower
To the floor now
