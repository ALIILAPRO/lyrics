		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Behind 'The White'
Voices in the void
All-encompassing
Crimson and alive
A strange resonance
A depth unknown
A static motion
A state of being gone
I wasn't chosen
You let me right in
Through the door
To show me the reasons
We shift in reverse
And walk through the walls
A shrouded presence
An echo in my head
I have to find you
Before I reach the end
I can't see you in the dark
And I can't see you in the light
But I can feel you reaching out
Beyond the fading threshold
The fragments of truth you left me to find
Are all consumed by chaos
A strange resonance
A depth unknown
A static motion
A state of being gone
A shrouded presence
An echo in my head
I have to find you
Before I reach the end
