		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The hope, the dreams, you make the innocent believe
The greed, the lies, how do you fucking sleep at night?
The shame, the hate, apologies you've left to late
You try to take this crown, fuck off, you won't break me down

There's so many times, you've stepped in shit
You forged ahead & found yourself, stuck in this prison
I refuse, I refuse to follow your path, refuse to live my life by the lies you've masked
Refuse to give into the words you asked, fuck the words you've written

You won't break my down
Not with the back of your hand, I found the strength
To break, these chains
You know I wont be caged, I'll bite the hand that beats

You, you were my hope, you held my dreams
You make the innocent believe,
You were the greed, you told the lies
How do you sleep at night?
I'll stay away, keeping myself safe
I'll dance the night away, as you stand there out of place

I was told, show no trust in you, you'll only make me pay
If only I had knew, you'd tear away
The hope, the dreams, you make the innocent believe
The greed, the lies, how do you fucking sleep at night?
The shame, the hate, apologies you've left to late
You try to take this crown, fuck off
You won't break me, you won't break me

You, you were my hope, you held my dreams
You make the innocent believe,
You were the greed, you told the lies
How do you sleep at night?
I'll stay away, keeping myself safe
I'll dance the night away
As you stand there out of place

Take a look at me now
