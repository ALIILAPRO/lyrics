		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgis on the Lambo, we got cameras on the bando

Forgis on the Lambo, we got cameras on the bando
Backseat of the Phantom, this the mob just like Sopranos
Hot just like a candle, we had opps and I bought ammo
We got Glocks and you get popped, life a gamble
Bulletproof Maybach, chopper on the seat
Chopper like Ajax cleaning up the streets
If you smoke, get your payback and keep it in the streets
Hundred thousand needs, Virgil on the feet
Make out with the Draco, makin' love when you bleed
Diamonds big ol' karats, making Bugs Bunny freeze
Man go have his rest, I put my cuz on the team
RIP the pistol, we was thugs on the scene

Blood, sweat and tears, I been grinding shit for years
I done popped another pill, I'm tryna keep my temper chill
Put that money to my ear, 'cause only racks is what I hear
Only God is who I fear and I need equity and deals
Pj flying in the G5, thinkin' 'bout the shit I'ma do
With the money when I was knee high, shit get serious, T.I
Remember my nigga got killed 'cause he took a nigga .35
Investing all my bills, I was tryna get out the Northside
I ain't told no lie, I been having .45
Go look up my rap sheet, should proud of me, I slowed down
Bulletproof the president, you never know what go down
Living in the fast lane, mama told me need to slow down

Forgis on the Lambo, we got cameras on the bando
Backseat of the Phantom, this the mob just like Sopranos
Hot just like a candle, we had opps and I bought ammo
We got Glocks and you get popped, life a gamble
Bulletproof Maybach, chopper on the seat
Chopper like Ajax cleaning up the streets
If you smoke, get your payback and keep it in the streets
Hundred thousand needs, Virgil on the feet
Make out with the Draco, makin' love when you bleed
Diamonds big ol' karats, making Bugs Bunny freeze
Man go have his rest, I put my cuz on the team
RIP the pistol, we was thugs on the scene

Yeah, took a Tesla pill
I'm up like, fuck, I need to rest, for real
I know all these hoes wanna fuck, 'cause I got sex appeal
Gotta keep a pole in the truck in case I gotta kill
Different way home when I cut, you know I got a meal (skrrt, skrrt)
Catch me outside, I'm on my Dr. Phil
Heard you got a crib in your song, but what you got for real?
I sleep where I own, look, bruh, I got expensive bills

I be spending so damn much, that my accountant losin' count
I got bitches on my dick that's tryna fuck with me for clout
I need backin' 'fore I walk up in this club or bitch, I'm out
Too much jewelry in my room, I'm just gon' fuck her on my couch
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, yeah, I know
Why my ex keep speaking on me? 'Cause she know that I'm the GOAT
I be high but just off weed, these LA bitches be on coke
I be movin' with security, but still I wanna tote
I'ma benefit the people, that don't fuck with me for me
Tryna sneak into my circle, then they think that I don't peep
Bought Lamborghini, yerc', that bitch faster than that Jeep
I make plays that last forever, I make money in my sleep
Niggas think shit sweet, because the internet
Beefing over interviews for streams, can't get into that
Niggas really pussy when they see me, there ain't none of that
Niggas out here fiendin' for my bitch, but you ain't touchin' that
I just came from Vegas, I just lost another fifty
At Beyonce party, I just chopped it up with Drizzy
Niggas say you switched up but I didn't, I'm just busy
Lookin' at these diamonds way too long gon' make me dizzy
