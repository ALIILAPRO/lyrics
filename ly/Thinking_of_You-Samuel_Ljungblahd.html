		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've heard that life is tough and you're feeling down
That's when you need your friends to rally around
So I'm just sayin' I'm here, whatever you need
You can be sure that
I'mThinking of you, thinking of you

Smile even when you don't feel you want to
Smile even when it feels hard to do
Cos finally that smile, it will speak the truthY
ou're not alone, just know (we're)
Thinking of you, thinking of you

Take time to shed some tears, we're by your side
Don't stay there long my friend (let) love be your guide
You will come through the night and into the lightYou can be sure that 
I'mThinking of you thinking of you

A brighter day is close, it's heading your way
When morning comes and dawn brings a new day
When you can laugh again, no tears left to cry

Be sure that we will all (be)Dancin' with you, dancin' with you :
