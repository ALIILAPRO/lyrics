		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's always 3 AM when my demons come to the surface
No, I can't sleep again, promise that it isn't on purpose
Yeah, I know that it's late, way too late for me to be calling
But, darling, could you stay? Stay the night until the morning

Tell me would you hold me in my darkest hour?
Just console me when I'm feeling powerless and lonely
I can't be without ya
I gotta to be around ya
In my darkest hour would you?

Whenever I'm afraid, you take it all away in a second (away in a second)
Yeah, the hour dissipates showered with your love and affection, oh
Talking to the moon, calling out for you, hoping that you hear me (hoping that you hear me)
'Cause I'm lost in the night, running out of time, can you find me? Find me? Find me?

Tell me would you hold me in my darkest hour?
Just console me when I'm feeling powerless and lonely
I can't be without ya
I gotta to be around ya
In my darkest hour would you hold me?
I can't see the light, need you show me
When I'm feeling powerless and lonely
I can't be without ya
I gotta be around ya
In my darkest hour would you?

Oh, oh, hour
Oh, oh, hour
Oh, oh, hour
Oh, oh, hour
In my darkest hour would you?
Oh, oh, hour (would you?)
Oh, oh, hour (you)
Oh, oh, hour
In my darkest hour

Tell me would you hold me in my darkest hour?
Just console me when I'm feeling powerless and lonely
I can't be without ya
I gotta be around ya in my darkest hour would you?
