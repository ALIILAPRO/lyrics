		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling mother nature 'bout you and me

Well if the sunshine's so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?

As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, Hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling mother nature 'bout you and me

My, my la de la come on now it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle
Come on now well let me tell you
What you're missing, missing, 'round them brick walls

So of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around My dog is so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my nat'ral life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no old shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lanes
I'll sing the same old songs, hear me call your name
