		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, I've been feeling so alone
Can someone give the antidote to me so I can
Finally understand where I belong?
The world outside to me is like an ocean and I

Can't swim
I'm losin' my grip
Caught up in the current
Won't drown in this ship
I can't swim
I'm startin' to slip
I'm runnin' out of breath, I'm scared to death

I gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins (veins)
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
Up above the water, up above the water

If I hit the bottom will I break?
'Cause I've been there before a million times but I don't
Know how much more of this I can take
I'm at the surface, what is my purpose?
It's making me nervous, I

Can't swim
I'm losing my grip
Caught up in the current
Won't drown in this ship
I can't swim
I'm startin' to slip
I'm runnin' out of breath, I'm scared to death

I gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins (veins)
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
Up above the water, up above the water

Holding on, still holding on
How'd it get so deep? Yeah
Holding on, still holding on
How'd it get so deep? Yeah
Holding on, still holding on
I'm running out of breath, I'm scared to death

I gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins (veins)
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up, up, up, up
Up above the water, up above the water
