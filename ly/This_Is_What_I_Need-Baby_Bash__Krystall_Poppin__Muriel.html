		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is What I Need
Is a man that can match my energy
He know what I like and when he touches me he makes me weak
So promise that you'll stay next to me
Big Bad Poppin in your area code
Cruising through your city, yeah I'm hoggin' up the road
I been making rounds, now he hitting up my phone
He say baby come on over, leave your cash at home, damn
Top shelf face, expensive lace, gold grill shinnin'
He wanna taste it
I'm a boss ass bitch, never basic
Dripped in all black leather like the Matrix
And I don't like to post about him 'cause he famous
We on the couch taking pictures when we wasted
I need a man that can put me in the zone
Take me out and show me off, he gotta let his homies know
Always wanna see me, never leaving me alone
Now he calling me his Queen, wanna put me on a throne, yeah
He keep it player but he never play his baby girl
He got me shinnin' like some diamonds in this shady world
This is What I Need
Is a man that can match my energy
He know what I like and when he touches me he makes me weak
So promise that you'll stay next to me
Let me love you down, let me love you raw
Put a real muthafukka in the game, don't stall
No Stoppin, tops keep droppin
Fly around the world but your boy is Poppin
First class flights, presidential with the suites
Wiggling our toes while we laying on the beach
Smokin on fire, Peach and Papaya
Matching all your energy, I'm fillng your desire
This is What I Need
Is a man that can match my energy
He know what I like and when he touches me he makes me weak
So promise that you'll stay next to me
