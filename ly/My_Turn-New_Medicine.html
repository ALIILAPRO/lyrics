		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waited long enough, I’ve been stuck, like my neck in a noose
I ain’t nothing holy, you about to give the devil his due

If you wanna get fly like a kite
Hi! I am your pilot
My critics they don’t listen
Shhhh
You should be silent

Someone phone up Elon because I’m about to be on the moon
It’s true, it’s true, I do

All these cookie cutter little suckers are lame
You gone’ wanna put this shit on videotape
My turn
Coming up from under like I’m Citizen Kane
Once I get this started might get carried away
My turn

My shit be explicit I have vision I have telepathy 
You don’t wanna miss it when I lift it to 2000 degrees

If you wanna get fly like a kite
Hi! I am your pilot
My critics they don’t listen
Shhhh
You should be silent

It’s finally my time, get in line, call me G-O-A-T
That’s me, that’s me, you see

All these cookie cutter little suckers are lame
You gone’ wanna put this shit on videotape
My turn
Coming up from under like I’m Citizen Kane
Once I get this started might get carried away
My turn

My turn, my turn 
Now watch and learn
My turn, my turn
Now watch and learn

All these cookie cutter little suckers are lame
You gone’ wanna put this shit on videotape
My turn
Coming up from under like I’m Citizen Kane
Once I get this started might get carried away
My turn
