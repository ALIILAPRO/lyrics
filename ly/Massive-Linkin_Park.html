		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The best of you (the best of you)
Never did much for you (never did much for you)
I guess it's true (I guess it's true)
You can't really change the person you'll be
The least I can do is cut myself free, I

Heard the screaming in my dreaming every night
I awaken still mistaking you for right

The worst of me (the worst of me)
Won't get my best today (get my best today)
Don't laugh, you'll see (don't laugh, you'll see)
I'll carefully choose the words that I say
I'll try to pretend it all is okay, I

Heard the screaming in my dreaming every night
I awaken still mistaking you for right
Broke myself and hoped I still could save some face
Now I'm floating, I'm controlling in this state of grace

Heard the screaming in my dreaming every night
I awaken still mistaking you for right
Broke myself and hoped I still could save some face
Now I'm floating, I'm controlling in this state of grace
