		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holy one, holy water
Drink enough, 'til you're under
Take it slow, take it farther
If you want, to surrender

This won't take long
And soon you might feel numb
This won't take long you'll want another

Stay asleep and blame everyone for givin' up
Ache, repeat
A shame nothin's ever good enough
You can escape the weight of
Losin' everything you love
You have to break the chain and
Tell yourself you're good enough

So take me back to the start
When еverything was better
I don't wanna say that I'm lost
'Causе it gets worse, then it gets better

'Cause it gets worse, then it gets better

Holy one, holy water
Drink enough, 'til you're under
Take it slow, take it farther
If you want, to surrender

Or stay asleep and blame
Everyone for givin' up
You can't defeat the pain
If nothin's ever good enough

And it comes down to my heart
Where everything is settled
I don't wanna say that I'm lost
'Cause it gets worse then it gets better

'Cause it gets worse then it gets better

Holy one, holy water
Drink enough, 'til you're under
Take it slow, take it farther
If you want, to surrender

Holy one, holy water
Drink enough till you're under
Take it slow, take it further
If you want to surrender
Holy one, holy water
Drink enough 'til you're under
Take it slow, take it further
If you want to surrender
