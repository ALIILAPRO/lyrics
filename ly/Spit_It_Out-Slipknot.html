		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you never gave a damn in the first place?
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty

Man nearly killed me, steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll, you were dead from the git-go
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is, and never was, foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya, think I fear ya? Bullshit
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
Gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity hit me

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leaving when you realize
Step up fairy, I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome
Straight to the dome, you heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
And if you know what's good, just shut up and beg, brother
Backstab, don't you know who you're dissin'?
Side swipe, we know the ass that you're kissin'

Biggity-biggidy bitch boy, halfway houser
Don't hear shit, 'cause It keeps gettin' louder
Come on, and get a face full 'o tactic
Lipping off hard, goin' home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothin'
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that something
Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you, comin' up behind you

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needlenose punchin' is making me irate
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools, and all the politics
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out that good stuff
Bam, are you sick of me? Good enough, had enough

Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemas

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

Spit, spit, spit
Spit, spit it out
