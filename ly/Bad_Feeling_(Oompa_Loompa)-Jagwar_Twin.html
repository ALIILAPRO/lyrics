		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I got a bad feeling 'bout you)

When the moon hits the sky, I'm a little unwell
'Cause the truth is a lie that nobody can tell
Every kid on the block talks in riddles and prose
Then we dance 'til we drop, drop
Drop

(They say) everything's perfect here
And the sun is shining
(Hey, hey) everything's perfect here
There's nobody crying

Oompa Loompa, doompety doo
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Oompa Loompa, I don't know, dude
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Bad feeling, bad feeling
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Bad feeling, bad feeling
I got a bad feeling 'bout you

Animals, animals, all misunderstandable
Carnivores and cannibals
I want it on demand-able
Mandible, jaw split
Hit me with the gossip, gossip
(Are you fucking serious?)

(They say) everything's perfect here
And the sun is shining
(Hey, hey) everything's perfect here
There's nobody crying

Oompa Loompa, doompety doo
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Oompa Loompa, I don't know, dude
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Bad feeling, bad feeling
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Bad feeling, bad feeling
I got a bad feeling 'bout you

Everything's perfect here
And the sun is shining
Everything's perfect here
There's nobody crying

Oompa Loompa, doompety doo
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Oompa Loompa, I don't know, dude
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Bad feeling, bad feeling
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
Bad feeling, bad feeling
I got a bad feeling 'bout you
It's true
