		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should have seen by the look in my eyes
That there was something missing
You should have known by the tone of my voice
But you didn't listen

You play dead
But you never bled
Instead you lie still in the grass 
All coiled up and hissing

And I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us baby way before them
And we're still together

And I meant 
Every word I said
When I said that I love you 
I meant that I'll love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Because it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

And I meant 
Every word I said
When I said that I love you 
I meant that I loved you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Because it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you
