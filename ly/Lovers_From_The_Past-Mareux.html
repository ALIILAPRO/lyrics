		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's do
What great lovers do
I want to be
Just like you
But you give yourself away
To a lover from the past

But you give yourself away
To a lover from the past

It's simple
You're who I live for
Though you don't seem to think
We're good enough for you
For you
For you

But you give yourself away
To a lover from the past
But you give yourself away
To a lover from the past
