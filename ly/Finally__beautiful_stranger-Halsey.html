		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes, so crystal green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet

Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine
But both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar
Where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

Oh, we're dancing in my living room
And up come my fists
And I say, "I'm only playing"
But the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth
That I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
And I say

Beautiful stranger
Here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers
Only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger
Here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally
Finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks
And put me right in my place
Used to think that loving
Meant a painful chase
But you're right here now
And I think you'll stay

Oh, we're dancing in my living room
And up come my fists
And I say, "I'm only playing"
But the truth is this
I've never seen a mouth
That I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but the truth is this
I say

Beautiful stranger
Here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers
Only come along to do me wrong and I hope
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally
Finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah, I think it's finally
Finally, finally, finally
