		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will stand by you
Even when we fall
I will be the rock, that holds you up
and lifts you high so you stand tall

I won't let you go
No one can take your place
a couple fights & lonely nights
Don't make it right to let it go to waste

I won't let you fall
I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are, I'll be there

I will hold on to
Everything we've got
A quitter, a regretter, and forgetter is
Everything I'm not

I'll take care of you
and love you just because
You and I are better than forever
Nothing can stop us

I won't let you fall
I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are, I'll be there

We can be the generation
Who learns how to love
Mistakes & empty promises
Will never be enough
To tear apart the giant hearts
that beat inside us now
Let's conquer the percentages
and rise above the crowd

I won't let you fall
I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are, I'll be there

No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be [x2]

I'll be there I'll be there
