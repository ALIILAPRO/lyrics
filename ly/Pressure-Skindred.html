		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Buzzing up with a musical attack
Rip it up with a boom sound we no lack
Got the rhythms the dub plat killa tracks
Annihilate and destroy them we do that
Letting them know that ah we come fe
Rock and control again
Ho ho well
Setting the pace in the place
Volume up driving them insane
Oh that's right
Turn your system down
No weak heart can take it
Burn it to the ground
Watch how we shatters and we break it
Pressure
Stress it just drive them underground
Cannot take the music killa sound
Yeah we turn it up and never down
Pressure Pressure Pressure
Annoying neighbours are banging on your door
Saying that they can't take your noise no more
Your bass is right in there face sounds murder raw
But ain't turning it off so call the law
Let them all know that
The rockers is hard and is here to stay
Ho ho well
Tell to move from your step
And back off and just go away
Oh das right
Turn your system down
You know the weak can't take it
Burn it to the ground
Watch how we shatters and we break it
Pressure
Stress it just drive them underground
Cannot take the music killa sound
Yeah we turn it up but never down
Pressure Pressure Pressure
Pressure
Temperature rise turn it up the heat feel the pressure
Hold uno head an feel the pain from the pressure
Cannot take the noise coz ah we bring the pressure
No bodder tell we turn the music down hold the pressure
Uno got to got to got hold the pressure
Uno got to got to got hold the pressure
Uno got to got to got hold the pressure
Uno got to got to got hold it
Stress it just drive them underground
Cannot take the music killa sound
Yeah we will turn it up but never down
Pressure Pressure Pressure
