		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's some advice for the next one
Don't let him lead you to the dark
Don't tell him all your secrets
He'll leave you with a broken heart
He'll try and tell you that he wants you
Just to keep you on the line
And right when you're about to move on
He pulls you back in every time

Here's advice for the next one
Run
Run, run
Here's advice for the next one
Run
Run, run

Darling, I know that you're just like me
You give your love up way too fast
But once it's gone, it's gone forever
And there's no coming back from that
He's got this perfect way about him
He'll make you think that you come first
But you'll get lost in the challenge
Of trying not to get hurt

Here's advice for the next one
Run
Run, run
Here's advice for the next one
Run
Run, run

Don't even search for that four-letter word
He'll never get it out
You'll try and try and try
But he'll just shut you down
Don't wanna say I told you so
So please go now

Here's some advice for the next one
Run, run, run
Here's some advice for the next one
Run, run, run, run, run, run
Run
Run
