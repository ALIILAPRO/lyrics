		  ... my confession

Because eye'm diluted & perfectly flawed I shall live by passion & not by law and eye'm insecure ... I need aggression to feed the spiders of perception and eye'm supposed to be strong & have all the answers a cannibal in the new church of cancer but eye'm nothing special eye'm not unique I have many secrets & I eat the weak and eye'm at an end eye'm at an end ..... and there's ... NO WAY OUT!!

Eye need to find my sanctuary..... 
Someplace safe gotta get this outta me.....
This is my escape

II. and I think about it all the time eye'm volatile & afraid to cry but eye'm still not comfortable in my skin and the anesthetics slowly wearing thin & I need to talk to someone new I need a different latitude & eye'm in this void all alone! feeling needy ... hungry to grow but eye'm suffocating -- can't come down and .... no .... THERE'S NO WAY OUT!!!

Eye need to find my sanctuary .... someplace safe gotta get this outta me! .... THIS IS MY ESCAPE!!! --- all I see is sadness all I see is sadness .... what's left? -- this will teach them. this will teach them, ......you've got to...... push. Push. PUSH.... YOUR WAY OUT!!! FOLLOW ME! FOLLOW ME! THIS IS YOUR WAY OUT!! ........you are not alone

- this is where I hide my power - this is where I become free - this is where I take control - and slowly choke your fantasies - I want to know my day is coming - see my enemies be punished - shed my skin again - this will be my best revenge!!

SHED MY SKIN AGAIN THIS WILL BE MY BEST REVENGE!
