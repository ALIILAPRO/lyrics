		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me a treasure
Could not make it again, yeah, baby
Told me it was finished
I wonder could it be a friend

Knew you felt the hurt from me
Before this disappointed again
You paused, I asked
Why'd you disappoint me again?

Baby, got me going out of my mind, yeah, baby
You played me
Played me for the last, last time
No, no, no, no

Another time, another place
Well, I'm not there
So, who's in my space?
Pretending it's not what it is, yeah, yeah

I am so sorry (i am so sorry)
Will you tell that every time
Why must not worry (why must not worry)
Give true love is a bottom line

Baby, got me going out of my mind
Yeah, baby
You played me
Played me for the last, last time

Baby, got me going out of my mind
You got me going, you got me going crazy
You played me
Played me for the last, last time

Baby, got me going out of my mind
You got me going, you got me going out of my mind
You played me
Played me for the last, last time
