		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I hear that rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it's real rock and roll

When I hear that rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it's real rock and roll
Oh rock and roll

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You really think they like to rock in space
Well I don't know

What do you know
What do you hear
On the radio
Coming through the air
I said Momma
I ain't crazy
I'm all right, all right
Hey c'mon baby said it's all right
To rock'n'roll on a Saturday night
I said "Shoot and get your suit and come along with me"
I said "C'mon baby down come and rock with me"
I said "Yeah"

What do you do
To get to feel alive
You go downtown
And get some of that prime jive
I said Momma
I ain't crazy
I'm all right, all right
Hey c'mon baby said it's all right
To rock'n'roll on a Saturday night
I said "Shoot and get your suit and come along with me"
I said "C'mon baby down come and rock with me"
I said "Yeah"

We're gonna rock it

Hey c'mon baby said it's all right
To rock'n'roll on a Saturday night
I said "Shoot and get your suit and come along with me"
I said "C'mon baby down come and rock with me"
I said "Yeah"

We're gonna rock it... tonight

(We want some prime jive)
(We want some prime jive)...
We're gonna rock it tonight
(We want some prime jive)...
C'mon honey
(We want some prime jive)
We're rocking tonight
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
We're rocking tonight
C'mon honey we're rocking tonight

Get get get get get
Get some of that prime jive
Get some of that prime jive
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon honey
Get some of that prime jive
Get some of that get get down (Down)
C'mon honey, c'mon honey, we're gonna rock it tonight
