		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So long my lovesick youngsters
Goodbye my used to be friends
I remember each vacation
Each day we wasted
It felt so different then

So long my Casanova
Fair well to my long lost friends
I remember all the kisses
The hits and misses
I never knew a love like this

After all the boys that I thought I loved before
I didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
After all the boys that I wished had loved me more
I didn't know what love was
Never had this feeling before
Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Oh yeah you love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

So long my traveling soldiers
Reminisce about the boy cross town
Peace to the wide eyed genius
With Hollywood dreams
Said he never wanted to be tied down
So long my high school teacher
Damn I had a crush but I couldn't reach ya
Remember all the guys
They were never right
I'm so glad I found you this time

After all the boys that I thought I loved before
I didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

After all the boys that I wished had loved me more
I didn't know what love was
Never had this feeling before

Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Ooh you love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

Oh when I didn't know
I did not know
Til you let me know
And I didn't see
I could ever be
This happy
And I never loved
In a way that I do today
Oh I'll never be the same
Since your loving came my way

Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Ooh you love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Ooh you love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Ooh you love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
