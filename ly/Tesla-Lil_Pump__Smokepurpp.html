		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (My favorite type of weed was, uh, cocaine)

Butterfly doors go up on the Tesla (ooh)
Send that bitch back in that Greyhound, she's an extra (yeah, yeah)
Teach her ass a lesson, Lil Pump the professor (whoa)
Buddy wore a vest, but we shoot from the neck up (aye-aye), bitch
I sent him a bitch, he ain't know it was a setup (yeah)
White chalk, yellow tape, he went home on a stretcher (brrt, oh, yeah)
Wake up in the morning, got a Draco on my dresser (Draco on my, yeah)
She gon' eat the dick, deepthroat the dick, I'm in her neck, huh? (bih, bih, yeah, brrt, yeah)

Twelve bitches in my room like I'm Ja Morant
Fuck her once, send her back, we got guns like Iraq
This bitch trippin', this a 'Rari, not no Pontiac
These niggas trippin', this ain't Wockhardt, this a pint of Act'
My grandma just spilled my double cup, now she gettin' smacked
I took a bean in the morning, I don't know how to act
12 PM at night and I'm still doin' slatt (slatt, slatt)
I got junkies at my door, they askin' me for crack (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

On the binge, drank a pint before it was noon (bih, bih, on God)
Doin' donuts in the Scat, this is not a coupe (skrrt, awoo, yeah)
If I up it on a nigga, bitch, I'm finna shoot (brrt, brrt, brrt)
'Ventador in the driveway, fuck it, chop the roof (bih, fuck it)
I'm on a bean, yeah, I'm on a whole lotta lean, yeah (yeah)
Dirty money, blood money, gotta get clean, yeah (click, click, click)
XD's, SK, Draco's, AR's, and none of 'em clean, yeah (brrt, brrt, pop)
I told the bitch she done fell in love with a fiend, yeah (bih, yeah)

Yeah, ha, yeah
Deadstar, Gucci Gang
Bih, brrt, brrt, brrt

Butterfly doors go up on the Tesla (ooh)
Send that bitch back in that Greyhound, she's an extra (yeah, yeah)
Teach her ass a lesson, Lil Pump the professor (whoa)
Buddy wore a vest, but we shoot from the neck up (aye-aye), bitch
I sent him a bitch, he ain't know it was a setup (yeah)
White chalk, yellow tape, he went home on a stretcher (brrt, oh, yeah)
Wake up in the morning, got a Draco on my dresser (Draco on my, yeah)
She gon' eat the dick, deepthroat the dick, I'm in her neck, huh? (bih, bih, yeah, brrt, yeah)
