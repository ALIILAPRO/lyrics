		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The forge glows red
All of the words have been said
It's time to make history
We will bless this victory

One more shot
We've got one more shot at glory

We'll march on together
Our loyalty we'll not tether
My pride I'll retake
This spirit will never break

One more shot
One more shot at glory
One more shot
I've got one more shot at glory

Raise your voices, shout out loud
Death or glory, we'll be proud

Rest in peace, your time is done
Retreat with shame, this battle is won
Banners held high, point to the sky
We will live forever more
Time to rest, you've served so well
Banishing evil all to hell
This day will last for all eternity

One more shot
Just one more shot at glory
One more shot
I've got one more shot at glory

One more shot
One more shot
I've got one more shot at glory
One more shot (One more shot)
I've got one more shot at glory, glory
