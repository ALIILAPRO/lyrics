		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can do this, somehow I know it
I'll get Heaven behind my plans

Charlie, hold on

There's just no way I could blow it
Not this once-in-a-lifetime chance

It's just a meeting

To change their minds and touch their hearts
Or whatever angels have

This could be bad

Cheer up, Vaggie
This could be swell
Something tells me that today will be a happy day in Hell

Okay, but just don't sing to them

That bitch is halfway down the street

Is she-?

Oh, she's dancin'

Ugh, no

There's a warm, fuzzy feeling that wafts through the air
Every street so revealing, it's hard not to stare
It's a realm so appealing, it beats anywhere
If you don't mind the smell
It's a happy day in Hell

Hi, mister!

Go fuck yourself!

There's an endless trash fire that's burning my soul

Hello!

Got a ton of barbed wire to shove in his hole

Ah, excuse me!

Doing what is required, we all have our role

I'm not doing well

Another shitty day in Hell

If I can show them the dream I've dreamed
That any soul can change

Those angels' minds are hard to change

Then they will know everyone can be redeemed
From the evil to the strange

They're bloodthirsty and deranged!

I can hear all their stories, the lost and displaced
And I know that they're more of an acquired taste
But if I open the door and I give them a place
At my Hazbin Hotel
It'll be a happy day in Hell

From the porn studio, where the cinephiles go
To watch award-winning demon bukkake shows
To the Cannibal Town, where they don't wear a frown
'Cause holy shit, oh my gosh, why?!
And I don't give a crow that his brains got in my eye!
'Cause I know I can spare them from Heaven's genocide

I can do this, I just know it (there's an endless trash fire that's burning my soul)
I'll get Heaven behind my plans
There's just no way I could blow it (I kinda like the barbed wire that's shoved in my hole)
Not this once-in-a-lifetime chance to change their minds

And touch my parts

Uh, no thank you, I'm just gonna
Fulfill my destiny!

Your loss, bitch

I can already tell
Today is gonna be a fuckin' happy day in Hell
