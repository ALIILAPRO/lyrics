		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get by but I'm tired of myself 
And I doubt that I ever will find someone else
Lonely days fall like drops in the lake of our love
I just want it to be like it was 
And I want you to be as you were long ago

I go down to the edge of the lake 
Where I wait through the night for the dawn light to break
Memories of old crash like waves on the shore of my mind
And I pray that the stars will align
I just want us to be who we were long ago

I just want what was 
How I yearn for the years we were young and in love

I get by but it's hard to forget 
In the smoke of denial, in the fog of regret 
This moment, dark sunlight, clouds in the sky of my soul
Then I hear the thunder roll

I look up at the uncaring sky 
With a prayer on my lips 
And a tear in my eye
Oh how the heart burns like fire in the light of the moon
I just hope you'll be coming back soon
Oh

You're my long lost love
Can we turn back the wheel?
Simply wait and love
