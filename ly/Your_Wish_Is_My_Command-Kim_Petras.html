		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your wish is my command 
Baby, I can take it, baby, I can take it 
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it, baby, I can do it

Ooh, Daddy, yeah, pull my hair
Ooh, take control, take my soul
Ooh, fuck me up, take the top
Ooh, feel the pain, say my name
Ooh, do it again, do it again, and do it again
And do it again, and do it again

I don't want another baby
Want a man to take control all night
Can you push me to the limit?
Can you take me to the finish line?

Your wish is my command 
Baby, I can take it, baby, I can take it 
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it, baby, I can do it

Ooh, yeah, daddy, you got permission
Ooh, yeah, put me into position
Ooh, yeah, come on, teach me a lesson
Ooh, yeah, I can be your possession

I don't want another baby
Want a man to take control all night
Can you push me to the limit?
Can you take me to the finish line?

Your wish is my command 
Baby, I can take it, baby, I can take it 
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it, baby, I can do it

Your wish is my command 
Baby, I can take it, baby, I can take it 
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it baby, I can do it

I can take it
I can do it
