		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, everyone, shut the fuck
Oh, that doesn't sound good, okay
Let me try that one more time
One, two, one, two, three, f-
My lips are so chapped
I need something but I don't know what it is
There's something I can use
But I don't remember what it's called
Oh yeah I remember
I need some chapstick (Chapstick)
Chapstick (Chapstick)
I need some fucking chapstick (Chapstick)
Chapstick (Chapstick)
Hey, can I borrow some chapstick?
Sure, here you go
Ew, what the krill is this?
Oh, that's just a bomb
Oh, okay
Wait what?
My lips are so dry, they're about to fall off
My penis is so dry, it's about to shrivel up
Can I borrow some chapstick?
Sure, here you go
What the fuck is this?
What, you don't like it?
Hell no!
Well, fine, I'm not going to give you any fucking
Chapstick (Chapstick)
Chapstick (Chapstick)
Get your own fucking chapstick (Chapstick)
Chapstick (Chapstick)
My lips are so dry, they're about to fall off
My penis is so dry, it's about to shrivel up
I need some chapstick on my mouth
And some lotion for my dick
Can't wait for November to end
So I can jack my shit
I just want some fucking chapstick (Give me some fucking chapstick)
Give me some fucking chapstick (I just want some fucking chapstick)
