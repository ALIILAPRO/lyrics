		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aping my soul
You stole my overture
Trapped in Gods program
Oh I can't escape

Who are we?
Where are we?
When are we?
Why are we?
Who are we?
Where are we?
Why, why, why?

I can't forgive you
And I can't forget

Who are we?
Where are we?
When are we?
Why are we?
Who are we?
Where are we?
When are we?
Why are we in here?
