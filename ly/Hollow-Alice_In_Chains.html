		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean

Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

All of your colors turn to grey
Don't even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Can't really say how you lost your mind

Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence so loud, silence
I can't tell my up from down
Silence so loud, silence
I can't tell my uá¹— from down

All of the faces life can show
Withered and ugly the one you know

Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence so loud, silence
I can't tell my up from down
Silence so loud, silence
I can't tell my up from down
