		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn off all the news and videos
Let's find a solitary place to go
Where all my senses are just opened wide
Something's in the air tonight

I used to love the noise inside the crowd
I wonder did it ever feel so loud
Let me find the stillness by your side
Something's in the air tonight

Out of the rain
Now I'm waiting for the sun
Crimson skies say
Boy it won't be long
And I've never worry 
If it ever comes
I'm just waiting for the sun

I'll never get back 
Where I once began
I left the highway
Right before the dawn
Ain't no need to hurry
There's nothing to be done
I'm just waiting for the sun

Find me where the sky will start to burn
And stay until the colors will return
I know I had to sink before I rise
Something's in the air tonight

When the heart of every city is on fire
The light, the heat will always take me higher
But then I find the stillness by your side
Something's in the air tonight

Out of the rain
Now I'm waiting for the sun
Crimson skies say
Boy it won't be long
And I've never worry 
If it ever comes
I'm just waiting for the sun

I'll never get back 
Where I once began
I left the highway
Right before the dawn
Ain't no need to hurry
There's nothing to be done
I'm just waiting for the sun

Find me where the sky will start to burn
And stay until the colors will return
I'm just waiting for the sun
