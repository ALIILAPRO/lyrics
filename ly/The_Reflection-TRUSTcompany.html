		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel it
Suffocating from the last time before
But I can't see his face
Reaching forward as I rise off the floor

Cause I'm lost in this place
I can feel it surround me
It's breaking the skin
I'm letting it in now I can feel

It surround me
It's all that I see
The reflection is me
Falling faster than the first time before

As I look at you now
Losing focus on my out the door
Cuase I can't make you out
I can feel it surround me

It's breaking the skin
I'm letting it in now I can feel
It surround me
It's all that I see

The reflection is me
It's always right here
It follows me still
The faceless looking back at me

The darkest views
Come focusing through
To see looking back at me
Looking at me

Looking at me
