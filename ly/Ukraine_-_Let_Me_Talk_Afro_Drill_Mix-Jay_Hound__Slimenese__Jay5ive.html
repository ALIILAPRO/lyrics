		  Ayo, Double, you killed that, on foenem grave
Bro, hold on, let me talk, like

Bro, hold on, let me talk
Like, bro movin' stiff when he walk
I'm too tact, got the G on my-
Like, I'm too tact, got the G, I'm in court
On the E-way, put it in sport
Bro press the gas and get low from the law
Wizard on court, I be ballin' like-
I'm a wizard on court, I be ballin' like Wall
Totin' on Stacy, she a lil' small
But I bet if I shoot, hollows break through the-
Hollows break through the door
Turnt shit that I do that you cannot afford

I'm killin' niggas, No Klu Klux K'
Bro caught a tag and watch him do the-
Cashed out in The Webster 
So many blues in my pocket they think that I be workin' at Chase
Flock somethin', might fly to Ukraine
Chase down, bro keep tellin' me wait
I saw a groupie, gave her a number
She said it was wrong, I think I made a mistake

Heartbroken, I'm not in pain
I threw a hit, and then I'm right out to Maine
Too deady, done off the Caine
I keep smokin' Notti, might fuck with my brain
She askin', "5ive, you okay?"
Like, I do not get what you is tryna say
Are you done, or is you my bae?
Manipulated, guess I'm who to blame
I don't get this picture that you tryna to paint
Now you with your friends and you start acting strange
I don't want to tell you I love you 
When you fuck me over, and send me back right to the rain
She a baddie, that's what I gain
I can't see your tats through these Cartier frames
I'm in Cali', I'm with the gang
I wish I could go back way before you changed

Bro, hold on, let me talk
Like, bro movin' stiff when he walk
I'm too tact, got the G on my-
Like, I'm too tact, got the G, I'm in court
On the E-way, put it in sport
Bro press the gas and get low from the law
Wizard on court, I be ballin' like-
I'm a wizard on court, I be ballin' like Wall
Totin' on Stacy, she a lil' small
But I bet if I shoot hollows break through the-
Hollows break through the door
Turnt shit that I do that you cannot afford
