		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Im late to the sunrise
Im workin my ass off
I feel like im broken 
Like when is my cast off
I feel like im spalding 
I feel like im passed off
Do i play for the rockets
Like when is my blast off
Independent shouldnt feel independent 
No cosign  I dont have no dependents 
The neighbors is knockin  im loudest of tenants 
With all of this racket  they think i play tennis 
Til 4 in the morning  they know i mean business
The lab is my gym  and these words are my fitness
Two hours a song  i do this with quickness 
I wanna be better  dont care for a witness 
Improvin my craftsmen 
Fuck all the patience  fuck all the atctin 
I gotta go back in  i need me the backend
I back in the whip  start my day movin pass em 
Believe i got traction  i do my own tracking 
A poet to some  so i do my own snappin 


i may stumble  i may fall
but i bounce right back 
i may dip  i may trip 
but i bounce right back 
i may slide  i may hide 
but i bounce right back 
im deflated  i been faded
but i bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 


Watch me bounce right back
Amon why you snap like that
Watch me bounce right back
Amon why you snap like that


go off king go off king 
dem my niggas and they all kings 
they all winners and they got rings
erbody grind this an independent thing 
no help or assitance is present 
cant go to my mom or my pops  for some questions 
this industry full of frauds   so im constantly guessin
bout  who i can seek for direction.
Lost in the sauce but im not gucci 
I dont rap for some clout i am not goofy
Ill pop like a pill but this not a rufy 
Ill be up so high that you can call me roofy 
But the sky aint limit its a milestone
Outerspace never had r a time zone
Im a shooting star thats what im on 
Or a commet thats never coming home 
See im down like four flats  slept on the floor mats
Cant go below that  aint no ball cap
I live where the floor at 
I live where the floor at


i may stumble  i may fall
but i bounce right back 
i may dip  i may trip 
but i bounce right back 
i may slide  i may hide 
but i bounce right back 
im deflated  i been faded
but i bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 
Watch me bounce right back
Watch me bounce right back 


Watch me bounce right back
Amon why you snap like that
Watch me bounce right back
Amon why you snap like that
