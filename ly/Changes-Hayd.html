		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been going through the motions
Learning how to pretend
That everything is perfect

And I've been sinking in an ocean
Drowning but I'm silent
Yet everyone thinks I'm afloat

I'm running through mazes, mazes
Maybe it's just a phase but regardless
I'm flipping the pages, pages

I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some patience
Along the way?

I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some mercy
If I start to stray?

I've been chasing after feelings
Most of which are fleeting
I still feel empty

And I've been trying hard to fit in
But how come I'm so different
From everyone I see?

I'm running through mazes, mazes
Maybe it's just a phase but regardless
I'm flipping the pages, pages

I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some patience
Along the way?

I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some mercy
If I start to stray?

Trying to fight the seasons
Trying to find my meaning
Maybe there's a reason
Why I'm going through these changes
