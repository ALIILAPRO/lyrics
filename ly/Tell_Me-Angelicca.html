		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah yeah yeah
Come ride with me
I'll go slow baby
What you've got from me
I know it's enough, oh oh oh
Know I'm all that you've got yeah
I can't keep losing my mind
Can't keep treating me like I am yours
Yet alone, cause it makes me want more
So lonely
We're on our own yeah
Come join here oh
Tell me, tell me just what you need oh
Tell me, tell me just what you fear
I'm all ears and
I still owe you
I still want you here
Don't lie to me
I know what need
I know that it's me
Let me please you, oh yeah
Know I'm all that you've got yeah
I can't keep losing control
Can't keep needing you like this
It's ruining me
Because you still ain't here
Oh yeah
Tell me, tell me just what you need oh
Tell me, tell me just what you fear
I'm all ears and
I still owe you
I still want you here
Oh yeah
