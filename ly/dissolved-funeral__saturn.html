		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yeah, yeah ayy, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah, yeah ayy, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah, yeah

I like how that bitch make me sick
Riding around with a Glock, yeah
I ride with a dick yeah, I'm in a whip
With some fiends and they
Tweaking, they tweaking
They tweaking like shit
Yeah, I got a drum and I'm loaded
I'm ready i'm floating, that pussy boy
Getting dissolved
I don't talk to cops, don't get me involved
I do it my way, I don't fuck with the law

That little pussy broke
He ain't got it like us
That dick on my side make me act a lil' sus
Yeah, I'm cocking it back, yеah
I'm making it bust
And I got a lil' Drac' and
It came with some nuts

Yeah, it camе with some nuts and
I bust in their house
Start to defend but I'm shooting 'em down
Like lil' bro calm down, he moving around
We shooting his ass 'til he
Don't make a sound

Empty pockets, please, I'm
Moppin' counters, breaking teeth
He wanna flow like me, yeah
We can teach you for some green
All of your bros inside the pack right now
Losing the track
I hit the part of the brain that react
And it ain't coming back that's a fact
I'm in a big white tee
Got designer jeans to match
Like a SRT, ain't going nowhere fast
It's time I slow down

I like how that bitch make me sick
Riding around with a Glock, yeah
I ride with a dick yeah, I'm in a whip
With some fiends and they
Tweaking, they tweaking
They tweaking like shit
Yeah, I got a drum and I'm loaded
I'm ready i'm floating, that pussy boy
Getting dissolved
I don't talk to cops, don't get me involved
I do it my way, I don't fuck with the law
Yeah, it came with some nuts and
I bust in their house
Start to defend but I'm shooting 'em down
Like lil' bro calm down, he moving around
We shooting his ass 'til he
Don't make a sound

I like how that bitch make me sick
Riding around with a Glock, yeah
I ride with a dick yeah, I'm in a whip
With some fiends and they
Tweaking, they tweaking
They tweaking like shit
Yeah, I got a drum and I'm loaded
I'm ready i'm floating, that pussy boy
Getting dissolved
I don't talk to cops, don't get me involved
I do it my way, I don't fuck with the law
