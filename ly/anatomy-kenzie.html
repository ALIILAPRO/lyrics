		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You called me today, on a random Tuesday
Don't ask me why I still have your number saved
Hello, stranger, it's been forever
You're acting normal, but nothing's normal about

Trust issues and soaking tissues
Lyin' to my sister and sayin' I don't miss you
With no closure, just getting older
But you still see me as a kid on your shoulders

It's just anatomy, you're only half of me
Still, you don't know me at all
You've been my missing piece, so why aren't you missing me?
Guess I meant less than I thought
It's just anatomy
Hate that you're half of me

Hate when people say that our noses are the same
So I went and got a change, like three-quarters of L.A
And I've dated shitty people 'cause of how you treated mom
Now I'm with somebody good, but I'm still feeling numb 'cause of

Trust issues, I'm soaking tissues
Lyin' to my sister like I never miss you
Say you'll visit, empty promise
God, I wish that for once you'd be honest

It's just anatomy, you're only half of me
Still, you don't know me at all
You've been my missing piece, so why aren't you missing me?
Guess I meant less than I thought
It's just anatomy
Hate that you're half of me

It's just anatomy, you make up half of me
But still, you don't know me at all
You've been my missing piece, so why aren't you missing me?
Guess I meant less than I thought
It's just anatomy
Hate that you're half of me
