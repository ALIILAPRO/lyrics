		  Glorilla
Real hot girl shit (AceC, turn that heat up, nigga)
On the gang, gang, on the gang, gang
Ah

He in love wit' Glo never got the cookie but got my name tatted
Killer where? Don't know who he killed, I heard that man ratted (damn)
Never full, when it's time to eat I be his main platter
NYC, New York Fashion Week, Tommy Hill jacket
Tell these hoes to stay dangerous 'cause nan one of they niggas safe (nah)
My nigga say he faithful, I still got a few hoes just in case (got too)
I can't lie, I used to simp so hard but them my old ways
It's three hundred sixty-five days in a year
Couldn't play with me on none of them days (woo)
Fuckin' ass freaky nigga (ugh)
Don't even wear no condoms (freaky-ass)
Don't know how to treat a lady (the fuck?)
I oughta smack your mama (bitch)
Pussy wet, good-ass neck (that's me), so I talk how I wanna
Save a nigga, who? Bitch, do I look like fuckin' Superwoman? (On the gang)

He don't wanna be saved, don't save him
That is not my nigga, don't claim him
'Bout twenty missed calls, he faded
White boy wasted, Channing Tatum
He don't wanna be kept, don't keep him
He don't want the baby, then, bitch, don't keep it, ho
I don't get left, I'm a leaver (real hot girl shit)
Hoes love me like Justin Bieber (ayy)

I'm the B-A-D-D-E-S-T (ah)
Same hoes hatin' used to wanna be besties (besties)
You can get your wig turned like Effie (like Effie)
I don't need insurance 'cause a bitch can't wreck me (baow, baow)
Ready, whole night I'm comin' like Freddy (like Freddy)
I'm mother, and you know my trick is your daddy (your daddy)
Clock that tea, bitch, catch it
You look like a discount me on Etsy (ayy)
I'm the female titan, I'm steppin' on bitches
I'm showin' my titties, I tore up the city
A P-I-M-P, I be hoein' these niggas
He run back to me 'cause you borin' a nigga (borin' a nigga)
Fuck is a layover? I ain't waitin' (I ain't waitin')
I get the bag then I change destinations (yeah)
These niggas be crazy, I don't blame 'em
I'm a dog too, I don't wanna change him

He don't wanna be saved, don't save him (save him)
That is not my nigga, don't claim him (yeah)
'Bout twenty missed calls, he faded (yeah, yeah)
White boy wasted, Channing Tatum (Channing Tatum)
I don't wanna be saved, don't save me (save me)
You for everybody, nigga, don't claim me (don't claim me)
Hate a nigga tryna tell me what to do
You ain't my daddy, I'm not your baby (not your baby)

He don't wanna be saved, don't save him
That is not my nigga, don't claim him
'Bout twenty missed calls, he faded
White boy wasted, Channing Tatum
He don't wanna be kept, don't keep him
He don't want the baby, then bitch, don't keep it, ho
I don't get left, I'm a leaver
Hoes love me like Justin Bieber (ah)

Go Meg, go Meg (baow)
Go Meg (baow), go Meg (baow)
Go Meg (baow), go Meg (baow)
Go Meg (ah)
Get 'em Glo (ayy), get 'em Glo (huh)
Get 'em Glo (woo), get 'em Glo (hey)
Get 'em Glo (huh), get 'em Glo (woo)
Get 'em Glo (yeah), get 'em Glo (on the gang, gang)
Fuck you mean? Y'all know what the fuck goin' on, huh, huh
On the gang, gang, on the gang, gang
