		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had a hot, hot summer 
Wish it would last forever
Laying in bed together with you 
 
But I’m single in September when I didn’t want to be 
Kinda thought that when I left you would come running after me 

So why wait 
When we could have forever 
Yeah we could have forever 
That’s what you’d say 
Why wait 
When we could have forever 
Yeah we could forever 
I wish that’s what you’d say 

You said we shouldn’t rush it 
Meet up again after
we kiss some girls 
And we live some life
We’ll know if this thing is really right 

But I’m single in September when I didn’t want to be 
Kinda thought that when I left you would come running after me 
You would make this shit official 
Rom com girl with a bouquet 
Its would be just like 90s 
Kissing you in the pouring rain 

Saying 

I can’t put my heart on hold 
I can’t wait until we’re old 
Cause you are the love the love the love 
You are the love of my life 
Can you stop pretending like you don’t 
Wanna be mine 

so Why wait 
When we could have forever 
Yeah we could have forever 
That’s what you’d say 
Why wait 
When we could last forever 
Yeah we last forever, forever

You are the love the love the love 
You are the love of my life 
I wish that’s what you’d say
