		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, yeah
Open up your heart, what do you feel?
Open up your heart, what do you feel? Is real, yeah

The Big Bang may be a million years away, oh
But I can't think of a better time to say 

World, hold on 
Instead of messing with our future, open up inside 
World, hold on 
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Oh, oh
Children of the sky

Look inside, you'll find a deeper love 
The kind that only comes from high above 

If you ever meet your inner child, don't cry
No, no, oh
Tell them everything is gonna be alright 

World, hold on 
Come on, everybody in the universe
World, hold on 
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Children of the sky, alright 
Love don't take no for an answer, no, no

Alright, right here, spread love
Everybody join together now
One voice, one heart, love and unity
Everybody say

World, hold on

World, hold on 
Come on, everybody in the universe
World, hold on 
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

World, hold on 
Come on, everybody in the universe
World, hold on 
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
