		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh lately
I'll think of you lots
'Cause my mind's in circles for you
Please connect the dots

And bring me, bring me to you
'Cause you bring out the freak in me
It's only for you, ooh ooh
Just you

So kiss me 
There's something in the air
And whether it's love or lust, should we care?

And bring me, bring me to you
'Cause you bring out the freak in me
It's only for you, ooh ooh
Just you

'Cause you
You bring out the freak in me
A side that only you could see
'Cause you 
You bring out the freak in me
A side that only you could see
