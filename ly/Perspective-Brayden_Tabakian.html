		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see my life
Flashing by so fast
Try to slow down
If I swerve I'll crash

Two hands on the wheel
Try to keep it still
Blew a tire out
Guess it's over now

You can think whatever you want to
Doesn't mean I have it together
You don't see what's under the surface
It's not clean but it's part of my purpose

Try to see it from my perspective
All I want to give is redirection

Look at me
Look at me
And I'll show you

What I mean
What I mean
I know you never

See how it can make a bad impression
Only listen at your own discretion

Look at me
Look at me
And I'll show you

What I mean
What I mean
I know you never

Perspective
Perspective

Got the pin and pad
I'm planning out another day
Keep a copy of it
So it doesn't go to waste

If you only knew
What I had to choose
Maybe you would truly understand

You can think whatever you want to
Doesn't mean I have it together
You don't see what's under the surface
It's not clean but it's part of my purpose

Try to see it from my perspective
All I want to give is redirection

Look at me
Look at me
And I'll show you

What I mean
What I mean
I know you never

See how it can make a bad impression
Only listen at your own discretion

Look at me
Look at me
And I'll show you

What I mean
What I mean
I know you never

I know you never
I know you never
I know you never
I know you never
I know you never
I know you ever
Oh
