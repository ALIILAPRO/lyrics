		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll remember it
In Dublin in a rainstorm
And sitting in the long grass in summer
Keeping warm
I'll remember it
Every restless night
We were so young then
We thought that everything we could possibly do was right
Then we moved stolen from our very eyes
And I wondered where you went to
Tell me, when did the light die?

You will rise
You'll return
The Phoenix from the flame
You will learn
You will rise
You'll return
Being what you are
There is no other Troy
For you to burn

And I never meant to hurt you
I swear I didn't mean those things I said
I never meant to do that to you
Next time I'll keep my hands to myself instead
Oh, does she love you?
What do you want to do?
Does she need you like I do?
Do you love her?
Is she good for you?
Does she hold you like I do?

Do you want me?
Should I leave?
I know you're always telling me that you love me
But just sometimes I wonder if I should believe
Oh, I love you
God, I love you
I'd kill a dragon for you, I'll die

But I will rise
And I will return
The Phoenix from the flame
I have learned
I will rise
And you'll see me return
Being what I am
There is no other Troy
For me to burn

And you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on
Then I wouldn't have tried and you'd never have known
And I wouldn't have pulled you tighter
No, I wouldn't have pulled you close
I wouldn't have screamed, "No, I can't let you go"
If the door wasn't closed
No, I wouldn't have pulled you to me
No, I wouldn't have kissed your face
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
If we hadn't been there in the first place
Oh, but I know you wanted me to be there, oh, oh, oh
Every look that you threw told me so
But you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on

When the flames burn away
But you're still spitting fire
Make no difference what you say
You're still a liar
You're still a liar
You're still a liar
