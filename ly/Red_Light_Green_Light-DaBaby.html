		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby
Probably in a fast car, ridin' with the cap off (zoom)
Pull off with a bad broad (bad broad, ooh-ooh)
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
I'm back on that big homie, park it (big)
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me (okay) (d.a. got that dope)
Pull my dick out, sit me down, then she sit on it (ooh, shit)
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it 
Red light, green light (boom, boom)

I'm fuckin' a bitch in my G Nikes (let's go)
I hop out with that stick, what that be like
My partner wan' see somethin' killed
That's what he like (see someone die)
So the first nigga try gon' tell G "Hi"
I been 'bout that motherfuckin' sack since a knee-high (since a knee)
Since a nappy haired, black ass lil' peon (let's go)
Have emotion, I'm primetime like Deion
How she throw it, I smash from the behind
Hold up, look at the fit on me (look at the fit)
Go get the tissue, that shit on me (shit)
Lie for me, die for me, kill for me (shit)
Dick and the balls when she lick on me (okay, okay)
I told her, "Bae show me you love me" (okay, show me, bae)
Let 'em know out in public (let em' know)
Uh-huh, let 'em know why we fuckin'
They try me, it go down, they know how I'm comin' (doot, doot, doot)
Yeah, rich ass stepper (the biggest)
White seats
Bitch, that's leather (white seats)
I wanna fuck her and her friend
I heard birds of the same feather
They flock together (let's go)
I'm dangerous, they probably tell you (what they say?)
Don't play with him, they 'bout whatever (don't play)
Uh, I get in there, she say I'm pressure (get in there)
Anywhere, any time, bitch, whoever
But hold up

Baby
Probably in a fast car, ridin' with the cap off (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Pull off with a bad broad 
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
I'm back on that big homie, park it
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me 
Pull my dick out, sit me down and she sit on it (okay)
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it
Red light, green light (let's go)

Nigga touch one of yours he gon' see right (you gon' see)
I'ma spend every dollar 'til he die
I make 'em slide, three-sixty-five, he don't think right (doot, doot, doot, doot)
That's eleven months straight, nigga, sleep tight
I tried to be patient with niggas, that ain't right (nigga try)
Give 'em game they couldn't take, niggas ain't it (uh-uh)
Rate me one out of ten, they gon' say ten (say ten)
Who that bad bitch on camera? Let bae in (okay)
Who that is back to back? Ho, that's Baby dem
Can't do no shows, he fill stadiums (yeah)
I like my Lamborghinis 'cause they drive fast (yeah, okay)
But the Maybach, that's probably my favorite whip
I'm in the back seat with my feet up, reclined (back, back)
Get my dick rolled like a Mercedes Benz
And I pop big shit so I don't check when they talkin' (big)
If you dish shit out, you gotta take it in (okay, okay)
I be like hold up

Baby
Probably in a fast car, ridin' with the cap off 
Pull off with a bad broad (okay, let's go)
Think a nigga got here cappin'
I am not these rappers
You gon' have to cap ya ass off
I'm back on that big homie, park it (big)
Hop out that bitch with that shit on me (let's go)
Pull my dick out, sit me down and she sit on it (okay)
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it
Red light, green light

Bitch, okay, uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay

I'm back on that big homie, park it 
Hop out the whip with that shit on me 
Give them niggas a green light they gon' get on it
Pull my dick out, sit me down and she sit on it 
Red light, green light
