		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  HOOK:
Cuz I don’t give a fuck what you say
Yeah imma do shit my way 
So you can go kick rocks
Imma stack bricks up
Build what I want to make

VERSE 1
I gotta lot of shit to say
So imma do this every day
I’ll be writing things until I’m fucking buried in my grave
6 feet deep under
But my body won’t decay
Cuz my messages are timeless, so they’ll put ‘em on display 
Oh yeah I rap with a certainty
I have a sense of urgency
A message for eternity 
For everyone internally
I had some people burning me
But now they fucking learning see
I ain’t the one to fuck with, now they lookin on nervously 

And I don’t really care what you think of me
Respectfully
You can kick rocks if you think youre fucking better see
I will out work you, turn you to an enemy
Hurt you so bad that you gonna need some therapy
That's right! 
I got the mother fucking recipe
I been cooking up hits, imma leave a legacy
You’ll be looking small when you standing right next to me
I’m 5’ 10” bitch, but I’m 10 feet mentally  

HOOK:
Cuz I don’t give a fuck what you say
Yeah imma do shit my way 
So you can go kick rocks
Imma stack bricks up
Build what I want to make
Cuz I don’t give a fuck what you say
Yeah imma do shit my way 
So you can go kick rocks
Imma stack bricks up
Build what I want to make

Yeah imma do it MY WAY! (2x)

VERSE 2
I can’t contain it 
I’m coming out with a statement
“You’ve really changed man all your music and arrangement”
You don’t know shit, shut your mouth you can save it
I’m the same dude that got his come up from the basement….
100 songs 100 weeks didnt change it
Experiments, development, intelligence, and patience
I’ll do it all again cuz I never feel complacent
Let’s keep the good vibes, positivity’s contagious
I’m never looking back cuz I made a life that’s passionate…
A college graduate suppressing all his talents yet
He found a way to go and change, become an advocate
For taking control of your life go out and battle and-
You think you have a dream then act on it
Get after it
Get out your head and fucking capture it
You got one life to master it
Don’t give up on your future
We all start losers
We’re all late bloomers 
Gotta struggle through the sewers 

HOOK:
Cuz I don’t give a fuck what you say
Yeah imma do shit my way 
So you can go kick rocks
Imma stack bricks up
Build what I want to make
Cuz I don’t give a fuck what you say
Yeah imma do shit my way 
So you can go kick rocks
Imma stack bricks up
Build what I want to make

Yeah imma do it MY WAY! (2x)
