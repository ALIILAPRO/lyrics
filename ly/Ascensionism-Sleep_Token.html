		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I know what you want from me
You want someone to be
Your reflection, your bitter deception
Setting you free
So you take what you want and leave

Who made you like this?
Who encrypted your dark gospel in body language?
Synapses snap back in blissful anguish
Tell me you met me in past lives, past life
Past what might be eating me from the inside, darling
Half algorithm, half deity
Glitches in the code or gaps in a strange dream
Tell me you guessed my future and it mapped onto your fantasy
Turn me into your mannequin and I'll turn you into my puppet queen

Won't you come and dance in the dark with me?
Show me what you are, I am desperate to know
Nobody better than the perfect enemy
Digital demons make the night feel heavenly

Make it real
'Cause anything's better than the way I feel right now
I can offer you a blacklit paradise
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky

Lipstick, chemtrails, red flags, pink nails
With one eye on the door, other eye on a rail
Other, other eye following a scarlet trail
And the last few drops from the Holy Grail, now
Rose gold chains, ripped lace, cut glass
Blood stains on the collar, please, just don't ask
Be the first to the feast, let's choke on the past
And take to the broken skies at last

Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky

Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
You cannot watch me ascend

And I know what you want from me
You want the same as me
My redemption, eternal ascension
Setting me free
So I'll take what I want then leave

You make me wish I could disappear, oh
You make me wish I could disappear
