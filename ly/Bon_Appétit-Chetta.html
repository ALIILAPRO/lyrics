		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Niggas better see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on 84's
Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Pop-pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Pop-pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Pop-pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip

Pop my shit when I walk in
Dropped two in a cup, now I'm saucing
Never do give a fuck when they talking
Might throw you off the deep hoe tossing
All they wanna do is hate when I'm flossing
I'm just tryna get the cake
Fuck the frosting
Let me glo' up baby been bossing
You ain't did shit now you tryna waltz in
I'ma be draped up, baby dripped out
I've done been too far for a handout
Fuckboys stand round with they hands out
When I see 'em gotta show
What these hands bout
It's just me and myself fuck a friend now
Sip goop lemonade wash the xans down
Toot two milligrams, I ain't playing round
Gotta know if he straight pat ya man down
Let me pour this eight in a two foam
I don't need no love I need benzos
Think I fiend for the money like crystal
Bring it back lil woadie got his own
If I don't know you you can get pissed on
Pistol whip for the gang on ten fold
They just tell me where to
Aim and that's ten four
New TEC-9, put it to my temple, brah

Niggas better see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on 84's

Bon appétit on a bitchboy
Tote two limousines, I'mma rich, boy
Never too rich I ain’t got shit, boy
Think I need it right now another hit, boy
Woah

Pop-pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip pop-
