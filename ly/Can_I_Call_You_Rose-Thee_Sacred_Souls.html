		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
'Cause you're sweet like a flower in bloom
(Can I call you Rose?)
Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
'Cause your fragrance takes over the room, darling
(Can I call you Rose?)

I wanna plant you in my heart, oh
So love can grow

Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
'Cause your thorns won't let love in too soon
(Can I call you Rose?)
Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
'Cause your roots have the power to consume me
(Can I call you Rose?)

I wanna plant you in my heart, oh-oh
So love can grow

I was meditating on love and you and roses
And the universe told me, "Put it in a love song"

(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Oh, Rose
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Oh, Rose
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Won't you let me in your heart?
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Your heart
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Oh, your heart
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
