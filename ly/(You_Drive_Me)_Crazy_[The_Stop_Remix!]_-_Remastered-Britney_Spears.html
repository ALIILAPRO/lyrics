		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crazy
Oh
Oh

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa-oh-oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
Every time I look at you
My heart is jumping, what can I do?

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa-oh-oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

Ohh, yea-yea-yeah
You drive me crazy, oh
Sing it (ohh-oh-ohh, crazy) 
Yeah
Yea-yea-yeah
Stop
Ooh-oh-ohh, yeah

You drive me crazy, baby
Excited, I'm in too deep, oh-oh-oh
Oh, but, it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy (you drive me)
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep (deep, baby)
Oh-oh-oh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

Sing it (crazy) 
Oh
Oh, (crazy) ooh-oh-ohh, yeah
You drive me crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
