		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the night moves in
Love takes on a new meaning
If you were here
You would know what I mean to say

The circumstance leaves me only waiting
For the chance
I only want to love you more, more

Can't you understand it
Girl you know how much I care
It's not the way I planned it, no
If you could only know my feelings
You would know how much I do believe

If you were here tonight
By my side
If you were with me now

When the lights go out
I can not pretend
This bed's too big for me
To be in alone, all alone
Slow burn light a candle for our love, love

So we'll always be one to one in love, oh love
Can't you understand it
Girl you know how much I care
It's not the way I planned it, no

If you could only know my feelings
You would know how much I do believe
If you were here tonight, all night
By my side
If you were with me now

Every night alone I just wait here anticipating
For the day I won't feel this pain baby
Please don't keep me waiting
Come to me
If you were here tonight
Oh oh girl

Be by my side
If you were with me now
Girl this bed's too big 
For me, for me to be in all alone
All alone

Don't keep me waiting baby
If you were with me now
Oh hold me girl all night, want you for myself

Girl, do me right
Got nobody else
All by myself
Got nobody else 

Girl, this love is strong
Please take me home
Be with you tonight
Make our love our light

Do just what you feel
Please don't be a tease
Girl I love you more
You're the one that I adore, oh girl don't leave me lonely, cold by myself, all alone tonight
