		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come with me, and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Reach out, touch what was once
Just in your imagination

Don't be shy, it's alright
If you feel a little trepidation
Sometimes these things don't need
Explanation

If you want to view paradise
Simply look at them and view it
Somebody to hold on to, it's
All we really need
Nothing else to it

Come with me, and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look, and you'll see
Into your imagination

We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy
Explanation

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world?
There's nothing to it

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be
