		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Messy room around me 
Depression dressed the room I sleep in 
something feels special             
when I dance to heavy metal       

My emotions have been locked away for so long 
Don’t know how to let them out
im so lost yeah
Im so lost yeah 
Yeah (bend)
 
Would you wake up next to me 
And let me be your everything 
Or not?
Or am I nothing 

Belladonna of ecstasy
we’re never more than history
It Kills me
I feel like nothing 

Tell my heart to rewind 
You can’t relive or re-write 
Scary moments in time
Depends what's in your mind 
 
My emotions have been locked away for so long 
Don’t know how to let them out
im so lost yeah
Im so lost yeah 
Yeah (bend)
 
Would you wake up next to me 
And let me be your everything 
Or not?
Or am I nothing

Belladonna of ecstasy
we’re never more than history
It Kills me
I feel like nothing 

Love is such a blur 
a lens that bends and curves
A picture that allures, you in
Re-enter the cure 
confidence to procure 
A love that stings and burns, within

Would you wake up next to me 
And let me be your everything 
Or not?
Or am I nothing

Belladonna of ecstasy
we’re never more than history
It Kills me
I feel like nothing
