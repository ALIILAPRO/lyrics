		<p>
		  (Just let 'em know)
(Just let 'em know)
(Yeah, just let 'em know, uh)

I wish I could just walk on the sunset
Instead of being down bad on my bed
I think I'm going batshit and braindead
Up inside my head
I'm stuck up in a different dimension
Throwin' out opinions and two cents
When I can't even tie up the loose ends
Up inside my head (uh)

This shit right here done cemented it (cemented it)
Little English element I bended it (I bended it)
Been up on my Bojack horse uh, I been a dick (yeah)
Let me complile my rhetoric, yuh (uh)
Head just be spinnin' in when I sit up
No equilibrium I be fucked up (yeah)
Memory half corrupt, no backup
My frontal lobe is openin' up, MIDI waves
I'm a esophagus
Sitting in the back of the bus like what (what)

Smokin' with the ghost riders (riders)
Clinically insane when this shit light up (light up)
Red up in your eye, but you got no buzz (no buzz)
Knocked unconscious, livin' concussed

Why oh why
Can't I just see eye to eye (yeah)
With my third eye in the sky
Just starin' at me 'til I cry

I wish I could just walk on the sunset (yeah)
Instead of being down bad on my bed
I think I'm going batshit and braindead (uh, yeah)
Up inside my head (uh)
I'm stuck up in a different dimension (uh, yeah)
Throwin' out opinions and two cents
When I can't even tie up the loose ends
Up inside my head (yeah, uh)

Up inside my head, up inside my head (yeah, uh, yeah)
Up inside my head, up inside my head (up inside my head)
Up inside my head, up inside my head (yeah)
Up inside my head, up inside my head (yeah)

Talk is cheap, talk is rich, talk is poor (talk is poor)
Call me babe, say my name, call me yours (call me yours)
Lookin' back on all fours, on the porch, on the floor (yeah)
Call me every night when I'm out on tour
You unsure when it's black and white
What I do it for, the allure
When you know it's right
When you know it's pure (yeah)
Can't afford losing you tonight
Hear it from the source (yeah)
Runnin' around the world and I'm way off course (uh)
Only voice left in my head is a Porsche (skrrt)
And it's ridin' round with the suicide doors up (with the doors up)
Going 200 and it's rippin' all of the floors up (yeah)
Burnin' every fire then flippin' all of the drawers up (yeah)

Why oh why
Can't I just see eye to eye (yeah)
With my third eye in the sky (with my third eye, With my third eye)
Just starin' at me 'til I cry

I wish I could just walk on the sunset (yeah)
Instead of being down bad on my bed
I think I'm going batshit and braindead (batshit)
Up inside my head (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm stuck up in a different dimension
Throwin' out opinions and two cents
When I can't even tie up the loose ends
Up inside my head (up inside my head, up inside my head)

Up inside my head, up inside my head, yeah
(Up inside my head, up inside my head) yeah
Up inside my head, up inside my head
Up inside it, up inside it
