		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I check yo bitch, that's head to toe
That's why I keep my head with foes
ZOTiYAC that's my big bro
You step on mine, don't hit me phone
Don't take a hit, get back, ayy
Bitch Betty, ready got packs, ayy
Fuck around, got smacked, ayy
Don't put your hand on my sack
In a second, don't talk 'bout my presence
Fuck around and still ain't carry no weapon
Fifty seconds and I leave you like peasant
Snitchin', dissin' boy your head
In a second
Snuck in yo house, we don't need the key
These people be deep like the infantry
Fuck what you do, don't play wit me
Pussy be deep like the ocean sea

I came to fuck some shit up, yuh
I might just shoot up the club, yuh
Whoever said she want fuck, yuh
Goddamn the lightning just struck
I never give 'em my trust, yuh
Try to finesse me, I bust, yuh
Claim my music for yo bitch, woah
Lil nigga you got some guts
'Cause I'm too attractive
Yo girl too ecstatic
The word is impacting, I'm over my head
The call me the Magnus, I feel like a magnet
I whip out the Magnum if we never met
But I think it's wonderful
Yo bitch too comfortable
I give her Lunchables, she give me head
And after I clapping, if I'm not relaxing
I think I'm relapsing
Collapse and I'm dead
These niggas should know what the fuck it is
I might cop a dawg but can't cuff a bitch
I'm holdin' that heat like an oven mitt
These niggas want beef they can suck a dick
No more cannot bleed from my fucking wrist
Bitch gimme the shot I'll be bussin' it
Lowkey, I think I'm way above this shit
Pas-pish, the choppa be stutterin'
Nothing to say, I might shoot it, ayy
Keeping my cool I might lose it, ayy
I show up to school but don't do shit, ayy
But everyone know I'm not stupid, ayy
I'm way ahead of these students, ayy
I give a fuck 'bout your movements, ayy
If it ain't the Crow, then it's useless
Ayy
So you keep on droppin' that bullshit, ayy
Niggas be smoking on boof shit, ayy
The headache, that muhfuckin' tumor, ayy
I do not listen to rumors, ayy
I clean that lil bitch like a broomer, ayy

Nigga catch a fade if he duck, we can play
Pistol tucked, hit the pave
Pretty shit, meet yo grave
Totin' that 40 and he can get sprayed
I am not offended bitch are you afraid
Pull the extended clip, gun is like short
I wanna remember this, put it on tape
