		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swingin' through the kingdom in the night
I only see you in the city light

I'm fresher than fresh
I step out the steps
We're all runnin' for the flex
Pete told me I was next
I'm comin' for next
There really isn't no question
Only superheroes in this section
Only big bangers on the setlist
On top of buildings where I eat breakfast
And I shine like a new necklace

I'm ready to go, she callin' my phone
Girl, I'm comin' over
I got somethin' to prove to show to the world
Can't hold it no longer
They think I'm way too young
To stand up for the ones I love
But let me tell you somethin'

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready (I'm ready)
To take on the world, I'm ready (I'm ready)
You can't stop me now
Ah
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready (I'm ready)
To take on the world, I'm ready (I'm ready)
You can't stop me now
Ah

Yeah (yeah)
Girl, I'm the one, gotta tell 'em (what?)
Young with the vision, man, they couldn't see it
Man, just had the picture developed (flash)
I got it, yeah (yeah)
Fly as a whip with propellers (fly)
All of these fellas are jealous (jealous)
Just 'cause I'm young and I'm calloused
Swing through the window what I entrance

I'm ready to go, she callin' my phone
Girl, I'm comin' over (on the way)
I got somethin' to prove to show to the world
Can't hold it no longer (let's)
They think I'm way too young
To stand up for the ones I love
But let me tell you somethin'

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready (I'm ready) (let's go)
To take on the world, I'm ready (I'm ready) (let's go)
You can't stop me now (yeah)
Ah (yeah, let's go)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready (I'm ready) (yeah)
To take on the world, I'm ready (I'm ready) (I'm ready)
You can't stop me now (now)
Ah

You know who you are
They trip on the rooftops
Gotta fight for the truth and it's war (war)
Don't let this city go dark
(You know who you are)

The swag, they feelin' the shoes
I kill 'em while meanwhile I'm fightin' the villain
She know what the deal is, the clip full of heroes
She made me moonwalk on the ceilin'
Just ask, they know we the illest
Spidey-sense, I feel the vision
They really think they can get us?
They checkin' the drip when I flip off the buildin'
I'm ready

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready (I'm ready) (let's go)
To take on the world, I'm ready (I'm ready) (let's go)
You can't stop me now (yeah)
Ah (yeah, let's go)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready (I'm ready) (yeah)
To take on the world, I'm ready (I'm ready) (I'm ready)
You can't stop me now (now)
Ah (let's go)
