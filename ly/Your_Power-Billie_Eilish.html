		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange

She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back, would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange

I thought that I was special, you made me feel
Like it was my fault you were the devil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out 
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

Mmm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hmm
