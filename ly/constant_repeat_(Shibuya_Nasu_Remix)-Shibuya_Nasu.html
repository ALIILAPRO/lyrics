		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're lonely
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat
Is it me that you want
Do you realize I could've been the one to change your life
You could've had a bad girl by your side
A bad girl by your side
A bad girl by your side
A bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl by your side
A bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl by your side
Do you even know the reasons why you had to let me go
You could've had a bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl
You could've had a bad girl
When you're lonely
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat
Is it me that you want
Do you realize I could've been the one to change your life
You could've had a bad girl by your side
A bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl by your side
