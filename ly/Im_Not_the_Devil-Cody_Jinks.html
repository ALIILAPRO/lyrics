		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not the devil you think that I am 
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man 
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand 
But I'm not the devil you think that I am 

It wasn't no gun, they held to my head 
I got caught up believin' in lies that were said 
And in a moment of weakness I stumbled and I made my bed 

I'm not the devil you think that I am 
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man 
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand 
But I'm not the devil you think that I am 

There's ten thousand reasons for you not to stay 
And no one would blame you if you want it that way 
It might take some time 
But I'll show you that I'm worth the wait 

I'm not the devil you think that I am 
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man 
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand 
But I'm not the devil you think that I am 

And I'll spend forever, do all that I can 
To prove I'm not the devil you think that I am 
And I'm not the devil
