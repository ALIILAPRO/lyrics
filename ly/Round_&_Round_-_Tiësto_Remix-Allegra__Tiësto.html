		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do do do-do dah-dah, do do do-do dah-dah-dah
‘Cause thoughts of me go round and round your head
Do do do-do dah-dah, do do do-do dah-dah-dah
‘Cause thoughts of me go round

You said, you just need a little time away
My head, tellin’ me it’s time to walk away

I don’t want your likes and follows
Changed my number, blocking all your texts
Keep your diamonds and your flowers
Moving on boy what did you expect?

Poor you, still don’t understand that boy it’s over
Jokes on you, ‘cause now you’re on my phone asking for closure
‘Cause thoughts of me go round and round your head
Do do do-do dah-dah, do do do-do dah-dah-dah
‘Cause thoughts of me go round and round your head
Do do do-do dah-dah, do do do-do dah-dah-dah
‘Cause thoughts of me go round and round your head

Keep on popping bottles trying to get me out your head
Keep on (*beeping*) models ‘cause you lost me instead
Bet you’re feeling lonely wishing you could hold me
I’m that kinda girl that’ll push you to the edge

I don’t want your likes and follows
Changed my number, blocking all your texts
Keep your diamonds and your flowers
Moving on boy what did you expect?

Poor you, still don’t understand that boy it’s over
Jokes on you, ‘cause now you’re on my phone asking for closure
‘Cause thoughts of me go round and round your head
Do do do-do dah-dah, do do do-do dah-dah-dah
Do do do-do dah-dah, do do do-do dah-dah-dah
‘Cause thoughts of me go round and round your head
