		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lets keep it simple, babe
Don't make it complicated
Don't tell me to be glad when I'm sad
I really hate that
I try not to be bad
He's interested, he's holding me back
If I could be more like you, I would
But I can't and I'm glad about that

What if someone had asked
Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was
Or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves
Let me do what I'll do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful like you

Let's keep it simple, babe
We can't afford to change it
Don't turn me into something I'm not
There's no way to sustain it
I try not to hold back
It seems either way it makes you mad
So I'll be who I'll be
If you think that that's cool then I'll take you back

What if someone had asked
Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was
Or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves
Let me do what I'll do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful like you

Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful like you
