		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Starin' at the water
Looking like a bunch of satin
Look into my eyes and all
You see is motherfuckin' static
Toe tagging, bitch, I'm bagging up the dope
No ratting to the po' actin' like you shy
Readin' the Latin quote across
My fucking throat ho's go, "Oh no
Heard this motherfucker likes to give burials
And I don't know if I want to go with him
He invited me into his home" Gave
Her the number to my phone
Told her dial-up 666 if she need
To get a hold of me and hopefully
She'll give me a call when she
Is home and free and lonely
Phone rang twice, but I missed both calls
I was hanging in the hall, toll-free

Hello?

Got a pocket fulla' stones
Watchin' Game of Thrones
Bitches on the phone
Tellin' me she home alone (Lone)
Motherfuck a future
Countin' down 'till I die (Die)
Days roll by, I just wanna get high (High)
Never-ever sober, need drugs for my composure
Lookin' like I'm dyin'
Laying back on the sofa six feet deep (Deep)
Three gold teeth (Teeth)
Zero fucking hopes for this young tragedy
(dy) days of our lives (Lives)
Watch 'em roll by (By)
Whole fucking family got bloodshot eyes
(Eyes) scripts in the kitchen right
Next to the dishes (Dishes)
Finger fuckin' bitches listening to No Limit
(Limit)
Westbank Soulja, straight up out the NOLA
When it come to this shit
Ain't a motherfucker colder
