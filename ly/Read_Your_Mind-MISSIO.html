		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Simple case of good imagination
I don't need your crystal ball
Tell your fortune look what I predicted
Nothing's going right at all
I don't need to read your mind now
I can see the pain in your eyes
Take a tab, relax, hallucinate
& tell me where it all went wrong
Blame your dad but you should blame your mother
She wouldn't let you hear this song
I don't need to read your mind now
I can see the pain in your eyes
I don't need to read your mind now
I can see the pain in your eyes
Still a lack of self-appreciation
Nothing's going right at all
