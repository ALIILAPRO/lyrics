		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can turn the city upside down if you want to but it won't keep you dry
You can turn the city upside down like an umbrella but it won't keep you dry...keep you dry
When you wrap yourself in a highway strip, don't expect anyone from it

All it is is cold cement
You can turn the city upside down like an umbrella, but who knows what you'll find?

[Repeat: x2]

Be careful
If you try
You can turn the city upside down if you want to but it won't keep you dry
(Faintly)Won't keep you dry..it won't...
