		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now hold on honey where did you come from
I never been so made about anyone
Smile lights up like a radio dial
You got no fashion but you sure got style

Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's stay out late
I won't tell let's break the rules tonight
Let's stay out late
I won't tell 1et's break the rules tonight

I wanna hover you honey in a one way trap
Get you cornered in a cul-de-sac
My resistance just left the room
It's cold outside and there's a big ol' moon

Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's stay out late
I won't tell let's break the rules tonight
I won't tell 1et's break the rules tonight

When you love somebody that you can't have
It's hell boy it's hell
When ya need somebody and you feel so bad
'Cause he's so good and he's so damn bad
Let's stay out late I won't tell
Let's break the rules tonight

I say yes when I should say no
And everybody says I told you so
But I don't care
'Cause it's too late
Here you come
And I can wait

Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's break the rules tonight
Let's stay out late
I won't tell let's break the rules tonight
Let's stay out late
I won't tell 1et's break the rules tonight
