		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're gonna be okay
You're, you're gonna be okay
Oh, the sun will keep on risin' in that old familiar way
And every little thing is gonna be okay

You're gonna be alright
Darlin', you're, you're gonna be alright
'Cause the stars'll keep on shinin' through the darkest night
And you can know you're gonna be alright

Lift your eyes to the hills
Remember where your help comes from
Lift your eyes to the hills
You'll never face a valley alone
'Cause even when your heart is breakin'
And you've gone and lost your way
You're, you're gonna be okay

You're gonna be okay
I know that you're, you're gonna be okay
Not a care in this whole world can take that truth away
You're, you're gonna be okay

You're gonna be alright
Darlin', you're, you're gonna be alright
At the end of all our breath, when we're beckoned on to the light
Love'll meet you there, you're gonna be alright

Oh, the end of all our breath is the beginning of new life
You're, you're gonna be alright
