		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To the dark dark seas
Comes the only whale
Watching ships go by
It's the day we try

It doesn't know

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's a Styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio

If they hold you, whale
On a really hot day
When the call got made
You've gone away

It doesn't know

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's a Styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's a Styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio
