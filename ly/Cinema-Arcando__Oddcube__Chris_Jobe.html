		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could watch you for a lifetime 
You're my favorite movie
c thousand endings
You mean everything to me

I never know what's coming 
Forever fascinating
Hope you don't stop running
To me, cause I'll always be waiting

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever 
cction, thriller
I could watch you forever

You are my cinema
c Hollywood treasure
Love you, just the way you are 
My cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
My cinema, my cinema

Stars spell out your name
Like in a science-fiction drama 
Romance growing
Like a flower in the summer

You always keep me guessing 
Forever my wonderful
Hope you start undressing
cll my dreams and take me under

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever 
cction, thriller
I could watch you forever

You are my cinema
c Hollywood treasure
Love you, just the way you are 
My cinema, my cinema

My cinema, my cinema
I could watch you forever

You are my cinema
I could watch you forever
My cinema My cinema
You are my cinema
