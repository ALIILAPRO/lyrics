		  Blueface baby
Yeah aight
Callate, Mike Crook
I'm her daddy, I don't even know her mama
Ooh

She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (ooh)
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, designer
With no strings attached, like Balenciaga (yeah aight)
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (ooh)
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, designer
With no strings attached, like Balenciaga (yeah aight, ooh)

Look at all these hoes I'm attractin'
She blew me, so I blew a bag on her fashion
Sexual relations, with no strings attached (no strings attached)
I just got her new Fendi's, with no strings attached (bap, bap)
Baby gave me mad face, without the attitude (no attitude)
She gon' do it all for Chanel and Jimmy Choo (Jimmy Choo)
I'm the type to spend a bag on a handbag (on a handbag)
Doesn't mean that we're involved, she just gotta brag
You can't make me cum, then you can't come back (no come back)
I can crack a bitch, and I ain't got no fucking crack
I just want some mouth, without the conversation (yeah aight)
This ain't no waitin' room, baby ain't no room for waitin'
I can't even tell the time, this AP decoration
Baby make it clap like a celebration

She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (ooh)
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, designer
With no strings attached, like Balenciaga (yeah aight)
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (ooh)
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, designer
With no strings attached, like Balenciaga (yeah aight)

She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (what?)
She wanna fuck, but I ain't even got a condom
Yeah aight, gimme top 'til the end of night (yeah aight)
You might get Chanel, you gon' be aight
Louis, Fendi (Fendi), Balenciaga (Balenciaga)
If the head trash, I can't give a bitch a dolla
How the fuck she call me daddy, I ain' t met her mama (met her mama)
How the fuck I got the Bentley, I ain't had a Honda (ooh)
Bust down for the gang, Eliantte bust down on the chain
For that Dolce Gabbana, she clappin'
The pussy too wet, get a napkin (rich)

She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (ooh)
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, designer
With no strings attached, like Balenciaga (yeah aight)
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (ooh)
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, designer
With no strings attached, like Balenciaga (yeah aight, ooh)
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama (ooh)
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, designer
With no strings attached, like Balenciaga (yeah aight)
