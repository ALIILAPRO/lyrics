		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you

I know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go"
Hold on till the end
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
