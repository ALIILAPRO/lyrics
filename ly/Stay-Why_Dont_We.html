		  Stay one more night
Oh my dear
Why do all the seasons change?
Over time
Now we're here
Thinkin' 'bout those days

I just wish things could be like they used to
But they never will, now I see right through you
Wish you could tell me all the ways that I miss you
Baby, I'd be lyin' if I didn't say I wish you'd

Stay, baby
I don't know, know you anymore
Tried my best to forget you
But I know that I still miss you
Dancing all alone
But I can't let you go
Gave you all I can give you
Now all that's left is, "I still miss you"

You don't love me like you used to, I can tell
You don't need me when I'm with you, you don't need help
You was lyin' while I'm lyin' here by myself
But who was there when you were cryin' on the ground
Oh, I should probably go
I should hit the road, drop you and go, damn
I am alone in the world, but I'm tired of feeling down
I think it's time I leave you now, yeah, yeah

I just wish things could be like they used to
But they never will, now I see right through you
Wish you could tell me all the ways that I miss you
Baby, I'd be lyin' if I didn't say I wish you'd

Stay, baby
I don't know, know you anymore
Tried my best to forget you
But I know that I still miss you
Dancing all alone
But I can't let you go
Gave you all I can give you
Now all that's left is, "I still miss you"

(Tried my best to forget you)
(Now all that's left is, "I still miss you")

(I just wish things could be like they used to)
(But they never will, now I see right through you)
(Wish you could tell me all the ways that I miss you)
