		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna go
But baby, we both know
This is not our time
It's time to say goodbye
Until we meet again
'Cause this is not the end
It will come a day
When we will find our way

Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I'll be there

No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
No, I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo

I'm letting my hair down
I'm taking it cool
You got my heart in your hand
Don't lose it, my friend
It's all that I got

Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I'll be there

No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
No, I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo

No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo

All I care about is love
Oh, oh, oh
All I care about is love
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
