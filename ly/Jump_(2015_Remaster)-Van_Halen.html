		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get up and nothin' gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches to get to what's real

Ah, can't you see me standin' here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (jump)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump

Hello, hey you
Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until you begin

So can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Jump

Might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Get it and jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump

Jump
Jump
Jump
Jump
