		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patience is a fuckin' virtue
Okay, and grandad always told me that
Patience is a virtue
You, you stay silent and then you come later

Fifty grand for the club appearance
Remember they ain't let us inside clubs
Just put a lot of work in, now I deserve a break, I'm takin' some time off
My girl no birth control, if I nut inside, she'll be preggers for nine months
I ain't got the vaccine, still on the street like I don't mind gettin' the virus
We been through worse, bitches third, money second, family first
Think before you speak, say how you feel, stand on it firm
I created a lane, runnin' the game
One hundred a day, no calories burned
Mum, you ain't gotta work no more
One show's two times what you annually earn
Bro, you ain't gotta trap no more
It's 'bout time that we think outside of the box
Tried workin' and I applied for a job
They ain't hirin', so I made ties with the boss
I'm workin', right outside mumzy's house I'm servin' 
Same way my bro got locked, I'm nervous (I'm nervous)
If the jakes roll on the block, it's curtains
We ain't got nothin' in common
Came in the game, the bag my objective
All of the fame just came as an extra
My young boy wanna play with the presser (presser)
He don't wanna stay in his lecture
The new world order's amongst us
Look at the ads on the phone that are poppin' up
Really and truly I should've done fraud
But back in the day the trap was popular
She said a trap boy's her type (her type)
But she don't know what it consist of
I ain't your type if when I got clients
Bellin' the line you're pissed off
Patience, gotta have patience
Sittin' in traffic all day give me road rage
I saw a rack, it was love at first sight
Me and the lizzy are soulmates
Man of the moment, I stick to the program
Put down her phone if she talkin' 'bout romance
Although I'm grown, I'm still makin' a snowman (burr)
I got a cold heart, I can't hold hands
My life in the hood soon come to an end
Bitch, it's the end of the beginning
A lot of man pretendin' with the image
Said she didn't wanna let me hit, I wouldn't hit it though
Ain't nobody get me to a milli', uh
If I'm with the guys, we don't need a bodyguard
Cah ain't nobody gonna act silly
The darg gon' bark like a XL bully
I don't beef anybody, if I did, it'd beat the taxman
I don't dress for Halloween, but if I did, I'd be the Batman
Lay her on her belly when I hit her with the backstrokes
See the way I chop it, would've thought I had a black belt
I don't even need practice, I'm a natural
I wanna hit Tennessee, and I don't mean Nashville
When you go through the things we've seen
You'll grow a lil' faster and look at life different
Sometimes I feel like throwin' away my phone and just goin' missin'
Fourteen years old, kicked out of the crib when I went Danielle's for Christmas
Lost time with my mum that I can't get back
And that's why I been rekindlin'
When I was in school just fiddlin'
My teacher never would've thought I'd been here
Apartment block with the gym in it
Neighbors lookin' like, "How does he live here?"
Takin' it slow, I'm on cruise control
But watch when I put it in sixth gear
2021 had 'em all spun
But next year I do a lot more than this year

Like warnings
Mmh
"Warnin' me now 'bout you
'Cause I can't get you out my head
I really feel, yeah
Something's tellin' me that you need to get away now
Away from everyone
And you need to move away
You need to buy a house in the country
Mmh
Yeah, and just have your fuckin' life that you deserve
Mmh
