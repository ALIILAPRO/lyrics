		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the fight against infantile paralysis
The National Foundation is happy to muster into its army
Ms. Connie Boswell, Bing Crosby, Victor Young and his Orchestra
And to you who purchased this record
Eddie Canter says thanks for the ammunition

Come on and hear, come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on and hear, come on and hear, it's the best band in the land
He can play a bugle call like you never heard before

It's just the bestest band what am, oh honey lamb
Come on along, come on along, let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, up to the man who's the leader of the band
And if you wanna hear that Swanee River played in ragtime
Why don't you come right and hear
Well, I am coming up to hear
Alexander's Ragtime Band

Come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band

Come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band
