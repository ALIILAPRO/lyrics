		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper
I fucked her one time, then my homie fucked right after
Always keep it real, I ain't never been an actor
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt

Big bowl of money, I look like big bowl of money
Got a tommy on the Kawasaki, blowing out an onion
Takeoff Frank Lucas, I got 'em itching
They addicted to Bobby and Mr. Whitneys
And they drinking on Actavis what a feeling
Momma told me drink water, flush out my kidney
I'm a lucky bastard, dab, ooh, dagger
Your bitch a happy camper, got an iPhone she a snapper
I know some rappers but know some more trappers
They got more money than you rappers
Talk like that actor you smoking tobacco
My Louboutins stomp you out like I'm a capper
I'm gonna do my dab like the Heisman
I'm gonna coach I'm Quavo O'Ryan
Look at the feds I know that they spying
I'm gonna disappear like I'm the Mayans
Hop in my rocket I bet they can't find me
Fuck all that bullshit and stop with this nonsense
These Benjamins and Jacksons got something in common
All of my niggas about money and violence
For real, for real, for real, this territory shit is real
Fuck how a nigga gon' feel, I'm just gripping on the steel
Think I might go in Beverly Hills
Get a mansion about 28 M's
No Jack and Jill but I done been on the hill
Turn it then I popped a seal

I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper
I fucked her one time, then my homie fucked right after
Always keep it real, I ain't never been an actor
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt

I've been spending every penny
Monday up in Magic City
Sucking on them tig old bitties
Diamonds dancing on me like they Diddy
I've been feeling gritty but I'm looking pretty
I been popping bitches like I'm Pretty Ricky
Got a bad bitch and her name is Nicki
She be with the m√©nage and come from Philly
Yeah, swear that my father's killing me
All of these racks breaking my back
These dollars signs is crippling me
Yeah, I look in her eyes I'm an enemy
I come from the trap, my niggas attack
You won't recognize your family

I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper
I fucked her one time, then my homie fucked right after
Always keep it real, I ain't never been an actor
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
