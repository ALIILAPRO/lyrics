		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fate, despair and light
Stuck in my pocket and I ran
Hunting the shadow of
the future so hard
I shred the sorrows and the joys
Some farewells
and some betrayals
I lost something I believe
Even so I kept running
And even if I bled,
the distance was all I could see
I don't care if it's raining
or about the snow
Don't see the flowers
in bloom or the cherry trees
Don't care about what anyone
is feeling or your tenderness
I overcame all the doubts
and the sufferings
And now I'm standing alone
I have nothing left now
The days that I lost will never
come back Ah
Run away, run away,
run away,run away yeah
The pain and the nightmares
and doubting come back
like a wave of a sea
running and run
and running and running and run
Even if I fall so many times,
I crawl up like the sunrise

A wall suddenly rises up
in front of me
Faith and vision covered
in darkness
But I don't have
the time to stop
'Cause we get closer
to the end everyday
So break down the wall,
if you can't get over it
And that will make you run
like the lightning
Run away,run away,
run away, run away yeah
The pain and the nightmares
and doubting come back
like a wave
Run like the lightning
Running and running
and run all of your life
run until the day
when the world is over
Live in the now
Don't look back
