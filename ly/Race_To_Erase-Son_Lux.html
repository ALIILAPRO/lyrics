		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, the vacant night
Speaking silence, you wrote
I would follow you

Scattered pieces of you
Filling spaces, you were

Silence followed you speaking out my name
Come again, come again, come again

And we race to erase and we race to erase

Absent glimpses of you story lost with time

Shadows followed me calling out my name
Come again, come again, come again

And we race to erase and we race to erase

Oh, the hallowed night
Cries of silence, we wrought
How they followed us

Scattered pieces of us
Filling spaces, we were silence followed us
Crying out our names
Come again, come again, come again

And we race to erase and we race to erase
Crying out our names
Come again, come again, come again
And we race to erase
