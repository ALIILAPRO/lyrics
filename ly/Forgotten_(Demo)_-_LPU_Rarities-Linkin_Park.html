		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why did I try?

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why do I try?

From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes tightly shut
Looking through the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
Pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten!
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why did I try?

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why do I try?

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round
The sunset creeps past
The street lamps, cars, chain-links and concrete
A window then grows and captures the eye
It cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothing stops in this land of the pain
The sane loose not knowing they where part of the game
But then the inside changes, the box stays the same in shame
Shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in this world of pretend
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why do I try?

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why do I try?

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

Now I've got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Now I've got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Now I've got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling you that I'm seeing right through you
Now I've got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling you that I'm seeing right through you

Now I've got you caught in the act (are you afraid I'll meet you?)
You better step back
Telling you that I'm seeing right through you
Now I've got you caught in the act (are you afraid I'll meet you?)
You better step back
Telling you that I'm seeing right through you
Now I've got you caught in the act (are you afraid I'll meet you?)
You better step back
Telling you that I'm seeing right through you
Now I've got you caught in the act (are you afraid I'll meet you?)
You better step back
Telling you that I'm seeing right through you

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

(In a minute you'll find me)
(Eyes burn me up)
(You say you'll never forget me)
(But the lies have piled up)
