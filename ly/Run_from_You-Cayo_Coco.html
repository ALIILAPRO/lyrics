		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't care about anything
Keeps me awake sometimes
Keeps me up all night
I just care about everything
Just to see you cry wouldn't feel so right
Yeah
And most of it won't change
Forced to move on, find a new place called home
Yeah
I work on it every day
Faces come by but they don't say goodbye so

I run, I run, I just run
Run from you, run from you
I run, run, I just run
From you, yeah

Got a weight on my mind, right
And I wait so damn long just to figure what's wrong
But the past was a weird time
I feel disconnected from those who I've slept with
And I hate when they act like
I am the same kid, bitch you do not know me
It'll just take some time, right
But I need it now, yeah
I need it now, yeah
I need it now, yeah
But I toke a lot then I settle down
Saint Laurent on the button down
Could've stayed up at Marymount
Could've stayed here to ride around
Write a hook when I'm feeling low
Coco never get attached to dope
Plus I never get attached to hoes
Big as Jerry, I'ma run the show
I need everyone here put your lighter in the sky
Say I'll never stop smokin til the day that I die
Yeah

I run, I run, I just run
Run from you, run from you
I run, run, I just run
From you, yeah
