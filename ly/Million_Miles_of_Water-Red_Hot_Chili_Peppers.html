		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broke down, I found
Even when you think you need a rest
You will live to fight another round
I know its too bad, so sad
All the things that we could've been and could've had

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water

You were my muse
Just because you happen to have a bomb doesn't mean you light the fuse
I know that, my girl, big lie
Four years in and you never even said goodbye

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water dear

Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without
Now I found it right here
I want you to remember dear

We were two of a funny kind
So damn blind but now we got to nevermind
I know that this is the end, we tried
So hard, but now I got to lose a friend

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water dear

Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without
Now I found it right here
I want you to remember dear
