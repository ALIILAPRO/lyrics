		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You try to hold me down so I became a soldier
Built up all theses walls and now I'm climbing over
Those nasty bees are tempting me
Oh Lord! But I ain't going back

You take me for a fool (fool), that doesn't make me foolish
Told me I was wrong (wrong), passion made you ruthless
Manipulate, it's just too late
Oh Lord! 'Cause I ain't going back no more
Your fueling of the flames gonna show you what I'm made of

Breakin' every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn't change but I grew on you
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire (this fire), this fire
Is keeping me alive

Making me believe I couldn't do without you
Make it hard to leave you think it's all about you
You know I'll never be what you wanted
This fire (this fire), this fire

I tried to get this weight off of my shoulders
Built up all my strength I'm finally taking over
Complicate, I don't appreciate
Oh Lord, 'cause I ain't going back no more
Your fueling of the flames gonna show you what I'm made of

Breakin' every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn't change but I grew on you
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire (this fire), this fire
Is keeping me alive

Making me believe I couldn't do without you
Make it hard to leave you think it's all about you
You know I'll never be what you wanted
This fire (this fire), this fire
Is keeping me alive

Keeping me alive, keeping me alive
This fire (this fire), this fire (is keeping me alive)

Breakin' me, shakin' me, shapin' me
Into what I never wanted, oh
Breakin' me, shakin' me
Makin' my beatin' heart a little stronger
(Stronger)
(Strong baby)

Breakin' every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn't change but I grew on you
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire
Is keeping me alive

Breakin' every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn't change but I grew on you
'Cause I would never be what you wanted
This fire (this fire), this fire
Is keeping me alive

Making me believe I couldn't do without you
Make it hard to leave you think it's all about you
You know I'll never be what you wanted
This fire (this fire), this fire
Is keeping me alive

Keeping me alive, keeping me alive
This fire (this fire), this fire
Is keeping me alive
