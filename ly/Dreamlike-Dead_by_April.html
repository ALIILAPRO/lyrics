		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been 20 long years
I've cried, but not enough tears
I've become the sum of all my fears
I feel scared, so scared
You gave me a strength unparalleled
But nothing compared to how much I've bled
I feel scared, so scared

I wanna know what it feels like
Is it nothing but dreamlike?
I wanna touch you now
How can it feel so right?
It is nothing but dreamlike
I'm gonna touch you now

What are we allowed to do
What are we allowed to be
I wanna cross the line with you
Let's pass the point of no return
Is this wrong?
I don't wanna know
A big mistake?
I don't wanna know
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be me

I'm in a dreamlike state
