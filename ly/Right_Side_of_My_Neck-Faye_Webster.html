		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who said you can't change your haircut
But it looks good anyway
I kinda wonder where you got it
And I doubt you even paid

The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

I wonder if you got home
But we just said goodbye
You looked back at me once
But I looked back two times

The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
