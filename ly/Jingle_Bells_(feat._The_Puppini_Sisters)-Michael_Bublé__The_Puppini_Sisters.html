		  Merry Christmas ladies
Merry Christmas Mr. Buble
Are you ready to sing a little Jingle bells?
Yes

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, j-j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
O' what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, j-j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
O' what a lot fun, what a lot fun to ride and sing in a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow (we are dashing)
In a one-horse open sleigh (one-horse sleigh)
Over the fields we go (over the fields we go, we go)
They are laughing all the way (all the way)
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song till night

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
O' what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
O' what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
O' what fun it will in a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
O' what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
(Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!)
