		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Help me escape this feeling of insecurity,
Ah ah
I need you so much but I don't think you really need me ah ah
And if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I've got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew oh, oh oh oh

Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire
Relight my fire
'Cause I need your love

Ooh!
When I say

Turn back the time 'till the days when
Our love was new, do you remember?
No matter what was happenin' 
I was there with you, aha
Well if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away
Listen to what I got to say oh, oh oh oh oh

Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire
Relight my fire
'Cause I need oh need your love

Yeah, you gotta be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah!)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah!)
You gotta have hope in your soul (yeah!)
Just keep on walkin' yeah yeah yeah, oh
Just keep on walkin' yeah yeah yeah, oh
Just keep, oh keep on
Oh oh oh oh oh

Strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah!)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah!)
I got hope in my soul
So I'll keep on walkin' yeah
Keep on walkin' yeah

Relight the fire
Your love is my only desire
Relight the fire
Just say ah!

Relight the fire (well well well!)
