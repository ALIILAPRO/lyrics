		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was standing in the edge
Looking down at myself as a child
And he looked back at me
Crying tears of defeat
From his eyes
He said I know all the lies
That you hide behind every fake smile
Am I gonna be lonely like you

For all my life
I've been living in yesterday
All my life
A dollar short and a day too late

I was standing in the edge
Looking down at the drink in my hand
And it looked back at me
Saying how in the hell
Have you been
I've been dryer than dirt
Dragging all of my thoughts through the quick sand
Now I'm quenching my thirst and I'm running like

All my life
I've been living in yesterday
All my life
A dollar short and a day too late
All my life

Heaven can take me
But no one can save me from hell again
You'll never erase me
I'm back on the road again

All my life
I've been living in yesterday
All my life
A dollar short and a day too late
All my life

All my life
