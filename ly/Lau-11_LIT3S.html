		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I mean what I say
Monday nights in the suite it's a mess
Searching for a little freedom in my chest
Feeling numb, feeling cravings for the sex
This bitch left me for the bread
The DMs gone and getting to her head
You really think these people care about your hair
Queen of your little town

Getting to your head
It's getting to your head
Leave me in the grey
Hanging all night with two ticks in the grey

You better watch your fuckin mouth
Next time I step foot in this town
I promise you right fuckin now
I'm gonna be in front the crowds
Bitch I'm getting Lau

Bitch I'm getting Lau
Bitch I'm getting Lau
You're gonna see me from the crowd
You're gonna see me from the crowd
Middle finger to you now
Bitch I'm getting Lau
Bitch I'm getting Lau
You're gonna see me from the crowd
You're gonna see me from the crowd
Middle finger to you now

I mean what I say
Your new man look like a clown it's a mess
You're falling for a diva in a dress
Cowboy jackets and adidas it's a mess
Getting to your head
It's getting to your head
Leave me in the grey
Hanging all night with two ticks in the grey

Better watch your fucking mouth
Next time I step foot in this town
I promise you right fuckin now
I'm gonna be in front of crowds
Bitch I'm getting Lau

Bitch I'm getting Lau
Bitch I'm getting Lau
You're gonna see me from the crowd
You're gonna see me from the crowd
Middle finger to you now
Bitch I'm getting Lau
Bitch I'm getting Lau
You're gonna see me from the crowd
You're gonna see me from the crowd
Middle finger to you now
