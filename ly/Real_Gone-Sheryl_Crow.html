		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm American made, Bud Light, Chevrolet
My mama taught me wrong from right
I was born in the south
Sometimes I have a big mouth
When I see something that I don't like
I gotta say it

We been driving this road
For a mightily long time
Payin' no mind to the signs
Well, this neighborhood's changed
It's all been rearranged
We left that change somewhere behind

Slow down, you're gonna crash
Baby you were screamin'
It's a blast, blast, blast
Look out babe you got your blinders on
Everybody's lookin' for a way
To get real gone, real gone
Real gone

There's a new cat in town
He's got high paid friends
Thinks he's gonna change history
You think you know him so well
Yeah you think he's so swell
But he's just perpetuatin' prophecy

Come on now

Slow down, you're gonna crash
Baby you were screamin'
It's a blast, blast, blast
Look out, you got your blinders on
Everybody's lookin' for a way
To get real gone
Real gone
Real gone
Real gone

Well, you can say what you want
But you can't say it 'round here
'Cause they'll catch you and give you a whippin'
Well, I believe I was right
When I said you were wrong
You didn't like the sound of that
Now did ya?

Slow down, you're gonna crash
Baby you were screamin'
It's a blast, blast, blast
Look out, you got your blinders on
Everybody's lookin' for a way
To get real gone

Well, here I come, and I'm so not scared
Got my pedal to the metal
Got my hands in the air
Well, look out, you take your blinders off
Everybody's lookin' for a way
To get real gone, real gone

Real gone

Real gone

Real gone
