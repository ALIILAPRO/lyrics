		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions (dimensions)

Feed me your vibrations
Your spirit over me
You're filled with the sensation
As you revive me
Intercept my darkness
Make my weakness fade away
With you I sense perfection again

Your beautiful deeds
I cannot be deceived

Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions (dimensions)
Faster and faster you're bringing me the key to salvation (salvation)
I wanna fly by your side, to the outer dimensions

As the misery draws closer
You're there to save me from delusion and deception
I walk beside you
Wrap yourself around me and the tremors will abandon me
I'm feeling the sensation again

Your beautiful deeds
I cannot be deceived

Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions (dimensions)
Faster and faster you're bringing me the key to salvation (salvation)
I wanna fly by your side, to the outer dimensions

You're taking me places, I just want to be where you are
One thousand reasons, dimensions can't keep us apart

Your beautiful deeds
I cannot be deceived

Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions (dimensions)
Faster and faster you're bringing me the key to salvation (salvation)
I wanna fly by your side, to the outer dimensions
