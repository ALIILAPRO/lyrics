		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ll scream all the words
But I’m not sure if you’ll listen
I guess it’s now my turn
To learn to cope with the distance
And I had mighty pride
Till you put your feet on my chest
I was raised to fight the storms
But this time, I think I’ll hold onto what’s left
I’m still thinking of all the ways
I can get through to you
No, I don’t want to feel
Something that ain’t real
Build our house, so paper thin
The walls are breaking
Are You Listening?
The walls are falling
Are You Listening?
Stuck in overdrive
For you, I thought it was worth it
Plagued with our memories
I’m still tryna give us some purpose
I’m on a one-way home
But I feel further than ever
And yes it feels like all your fault
I guess I thought you’d do better
I’m still thinking of all the ways
I can get through to you (to you)
Till then I’m shaking
Whilst I’m erasing all of you
No, I don’t want to feel
Something that ain’t real
Build our house, so paper thin
The walls are breaking
Are You Listening?
The walls are falling
Are You Listening?
