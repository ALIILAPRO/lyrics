		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something on my mind, on my mind
I just can't get it right, can't get it right
It doesn't go away, it doesn't go away 
Even though I try to ignore it

I just want peace of mind, I want peace of mind
I feel like breaking down time after time 
And it keeps coming back, always coming back

All my life doubting was a part of me
Day and night I fight my insecurities
Asking why, why am I, who am I
I just want some peace of mind

Antassalam
Wa minkassalam
Tabarakta ya
Ya Thal Jalali wal Ikram

Antassalam
Wa minkassalam
Tabarakta ya
Ya Thal Jalali wal Ikram

O God I need Your peace, I need Your peace
I still believe with hardship comes ease 
Make this stress go away, go away

All my life I know You've been guiding me
You're the One, the One who knows my destiny
I'll be alright, I'm sure that You'll look after me
You know what's inside of me

Antassalam
Wa minkassalam
Tabarakta ya
Ya Thal Jalali wal Ikram

Antassalam
Wa minkassalam
Tabarakta ya
Ya Thal Jalali wal Ikram

All my life I know You've been guiding me
You're the One, the One who knows my destiny
I'll be alright, I'm sure that You'll look after me
You know what's inside of me

All my life I know You've been blessing me
You're the only One, the One who knows my destiny
I'll be alright, I'm sure that You'll look after me
You know what's inside of me

Antassalam
Wa minkassalam
Tabarakta ya
Ya Thal Jalali wal Ikram

Antassalam
Wa minkassalam
Tabarakta ya
Ya Thal Jalali wal Ikram
