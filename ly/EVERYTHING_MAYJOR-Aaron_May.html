		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything I do Major
Yeah, if I tell you anything it's money
17 I had flipped me a 20
Said what play I'ma take I'ma run it
And I put it on everything I can't fumble
Know I know how to step out, I don't stumble
Bitch I know how to flex, I'm just humble
And I came up, now what comes next
Niggas they know I'm the one
They probably just wait til I'm
Done to pay their respects
I don't do issues or none
Get worked out clean
I don't gotta rep no set
Double my green like I won a bet
Take care of the team we gone all get a chеck
Got something out of none we
Ain't did nonе yet

Since a young nigga had to
Move Iike I'm grown
Pockets empty ain't even have stones
Take a lil longer when you on your own
I remember them visit's and
Calls on the phone
Used to think I be trappin
And stealin' or some
But now I get paid off the song
I need some more I'ma take up bank
Break your bread how you feed your hood
Step in dior this ain't what you think
Bow her head now she look good
Can't throw a scene bout a
Bitch you gon' lose she said I'm mean
I'm just drippin' in rhude
Niggas a feed they lil boo
And give her some blues
They momma house ain't got no food fucked up
You ain't part of the vision
I can't even see you I lost all sight
Say I lucked up
I can't even believe in that shit
When I put in this work all night
Now I'm stuck up and I'm still on a mission
If you ain't a member ain't tryna hear none
Knowin we come from the slums
Weight of the world on my shoulder
This shit weigh a ton still not done
