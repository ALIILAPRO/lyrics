		  (Hey)
(Hey) (let's go, Mario)

Jumped out the window and I fled on the cops (woo)
Nigga had to run 'cause I had meds in my socks (slatt)
Hit the rocky road, then I led 'em to the projects (whoa)
Whole hood outdoors in the street, they tryna stop 'em (no cap)
Fuck a callin' coppa, fuck a fuckin' cock block (yeah)
Fucked her one time, iced baguettes in my socks (yeah)
All them bitches 'round, tryna trick me out my cock (yeah)
Trappin' out a four door, old Carrera with the drop

I been in the trenches with three niggas called pork and beans
Chillin' with the Zoes, that's my family, they my ahks
Cook it watch it roll 'round the pot, then they come shop (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Playin' with the Spider, they pull up and then they chop (rrr)
Niggas 'round here funny, we cook up the bunnies (woo, woo)
I done showed my chest, bitches say they want me
I don't know the rest (yeah), niggas ain't no slimy (hey)
Show you the finesse, everybody 'round me (slatt)
Everywhere I go, I keep that strap like I'm horny (yeah)
Yellow diamonds on me, uh-uh-uh, but I'm not corny (yeah)
I am so not sorry, so don't tell me 'bout your story (uh-uh)
Black and white seats, Ore' (Ore'), five rings, Horry (Horry)
MAC-10 hungry (hungry), you pussies are baloneys (yeah)
I been with your mummy 'cause your daddy a jabroni (ha)
I been in the top room at Tootsie's, they ain't stop me
They know I got money, and I don't want nothing (Uh-uh)

Jumped out the window and I fled on the cops (woo)
Nigga had to run 'cause I had meds in my socks (ayy)
Hit the rocky road, then I led them to the projects (on God)
Whole hood outdoors in the streets, they tryna stop 'em (yeah)
Fuck a callin' coppa, fuck a fuckin' cock block (fuck 'em)
Fucked her one time, iced baguettes in my socks (yeah)
All them bitches 'round, tryna trick me out my cock
Trappin' out a four door, old Carrera with the drop (skrr)

Big baguettes on niggas, it make lil' mama come and pamper me (yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah)
I be with my brodie 'cause he won't let nothing happen to me
I don't want your baby girl, you're nothing but a scam to me
I been ballin' on niggas like D Wade and they can't handle me (woo)
Broke niggas scam to me (yeah-yeah), don't put out my candle leaf
I just hit my groove and now we growin' none but Hercules
I just hit my dawg up, he said he went to church for me (to church)
Ran into the opps, kill 'em 'cause they tryna murder me
My niggas look like Starburst, make 'em all squirt (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Let me shop hoe, I can't buss you in the mall, jerk (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Shoot a nigga hands up like I'm Lil Durk (on God)
I got semi-automatics on the tour bus (woo)

Jumped out the window and I fled on the cops (skrt)
Nigga had to run 'cause I had meds in my socks (ayy)
Hit the rocky road, then I led them to the projects (on God)
Whole hood outdoors in the street, they tryna stop 'em (yeah)
Fuck a callin' coppa, fuck a fuckin' cock block (fuck 'em)
Fucked her one time, iced baguettes in my socks (yeah)
All them bitches 'round, tryna trick me out my cock
Trappin' out a four door, old Carrera with the drop (hey)
