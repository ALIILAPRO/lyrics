		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we were far away
Life in a different place
Might not have met
With you so dear

If we lived in the age
Unlike the modern days
Might not have loved
The timing had to be right

This puzzle I'd been looking for
The final piece was you

I am here with you
To stand by your side
It's a lovely view
You are here with me
To stand by my side
Is it lovely too?
Do you feel at peace with me beside your heart?
Do you like the scene unfolding in our eyes?

If you had turned away
The day I pled you to stay
Might not have worked
The feeling had to be right

This puzzle I'd been looking for
The final piece was you

I am here with you
To stand by your side
It's a lovely view
You are here with me
To stand by my side
Is it lovely too?
Do you feel at peace with me beside your heart?

I am here with you
To stand by your side
It's a lovely view
You are here with me
To stand by my side
Is it lovely too?
Do you feel at peace with me beside your heart?
Do you like the scene unfolding in our eyes?
