		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job, then the son of the boss
Gets the spot that was yours
Or tryna stay for the kids when keepin' it how it is
Will only break their hearts worse

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Sometimes givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Beggin' 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Prayin' to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

Sometimes givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When it's time to go

And you know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go
