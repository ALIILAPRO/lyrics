		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn’t want to recognize 
the part you play
But i don’t need to exercise
My heart today

And I need someone 
to need me
I swear
But too frequently
All the frequencies 
Are unfair
For you my darling

I think I liked you better
Before I loved you
And I don’t know where
We thought
This plane was landing

Because I liked you better
Before I loved you
We went to paradise
And then i left you stranded

Time don’t tick
The same without you
(No it don’t)
But when you get close
I need some time to 
Woah

Rest my case 
and sleep with my eyes closed
And when I dream 
You run in circles
(Try to come down)

And I need someone to need me
I swear
But too frequently
All the frequencies 
Are unfair
For you my darling

I think I liked you better
Before I loved you
And I don’t know where
We thought
This plane was landing

Because I liked you better
Before I loved you
We went to paradise 
And then I left you stranded
For you my darling
For you my darling
But it’s always been you my darling
