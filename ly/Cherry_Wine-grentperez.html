		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you standing all by yourself?
Those shoes were made for dancing with someone else
Why don't we move over to that empty space?
I'll bet you twenty bucks I'll put a smile on your face
I know a place where we can

Dance the night away
Baby, we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time and
Get to know each other over cherry wine, ha

Well, it's too soon to give up on tonight, uh
I haven't had the chance to show you my moves, and I
I think you'd like to see why they would call me Mr. Dynamite

I can show you while we dance the night away
But baby, we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time and
Get to know each other over cherry wine

I've been waiting on this dance floor
Made for two, baby
Won't you show me just what you can do?
I don't wanna waste your time
So please just have me for tonight
Ha, dance

Yeah, I said let's dance the night away
Baby, we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time and
Get to know each other over cherry wine
Oh, I dance the night away
Baby, we could try to
Make the world spin slower
We could take our time, uh
Know it's too soon to say you're mine
Let's have a little drink tonight
Get to know each other over cherry wine
