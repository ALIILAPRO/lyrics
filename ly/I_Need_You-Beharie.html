		  I NEED YOU

Fire passing by
I could have it all
With a weathered eye
I heard you call

Slipping through my hands
What I thought I should withstand 
I believed in that
What did I do

If you've seen me lately
You may wonder why
So called illusions has caught my eye

I still hear you 
Thou I've never seen it all
Hiding secrets
Telling lies

I need you
I, I need you
I need you
I, I need you 

I need you
I, I need you
I need you
I, I need you 

Take me home 
To the land of the unknown
Catching fire
Never awake until you go
Let me go
Into the land of the unknown
We caught fire, fire

I need you
I, I need you
I need you
I, I need you 

I need you
I, I need you
I need you
I, I need you
