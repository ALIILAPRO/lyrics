		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep a lot of secrets to myself
My parents think I'm honest, not like everyone else
Like they could catch me in a lie, they say they're able to tell
But I'm partying with my friends at some random hotel
And sneaking out the window on a Sunday night
I'd do it on a Friday, but that's obvious, I
Don't wanna lose my trust, but I do it so well
'Cause I'm partying with my friends at some random hotel

Dow-na-na-na-ba-na-now

Yeah, it's a little fun, stupid, and like really dumb
Pop six pieces of gum before I get home
'Cause we do it so well, yeah
No, they'll never tell
And we're driving a little fast, P.C.H. wastin' my gas
Eating pasta in the back, spilling our minds out
Wish our secrets farewell
They stay in this random hotel

Screaming out songs like there's nobody there
We're seventeen and idiots who play truth or dare
One day I'll write a story that'll sit on a shelf
About me partying with my friends at some random hotel
And sneaking out the window on a Sunday night
I'd do it on a Friday, but that's obvious, I
Don't wanna lose my trust, but I do it so well
'Cause I'm partying with my friends at some random hotel

Dow-na-na-na-ba-na-now

Yeah, it's a little fun, stupid, and like really dumb
Pop six pieces of gum before I get home
'Cause we do it so well, yeah
No, they'll never tell
And we're driving a little fast, P.C.H. wastin' my gas
Eating pasta in the back, spilling our minds out
Wish our secrets farewell
They stay in this random hotel

'Cause we do it so well, yeah
No, they'll never tell
Wish our secrets farewell
They stay in this random hotel
