		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never meant to make her cry
Now I'm seeing tears in her eyes
Half and half, make believe
'Cause so she thought, well, my heart was on my sleeve

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating

Never thought some silly songs 
Could ever go and hurt someone
I never meant to sing my tune
For anybody else out there but you

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating
