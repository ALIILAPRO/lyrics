		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could've been the real one
You could've been the one enough for me
You could've been the free one, the broken down and sick one
Had enough of vacant life

You come around when you find me faithless
You come around when you find me faceless!

Fuck me like you hate me [dig it up and tear it down]
Dig it up and hold me out
Fuck me like you hate me [dig it up, tear it down]
I love the sound when you come undone

You could've been the next one [god only knows]
You could've been the one to comprehend me
You could've been the only one, the broken down and sick one
You could've been the one who I lie with

You come around when you finally face this
You come around when you find me faceless!

Fuck me like you hate me [dig it up and tear it down]
Dig it up and hold me out
Fuck me like you hate me [dig it up, tear it down]

Don't make a sound till I come undone

You'll never break me
You'll never break me
You'll never break me

You could've been the real one
You could've been the last one I lie with
You could've been the owned one
I should've been the one who died

You come around when you finally face this
You come around when you find me faceless!

Fuck me like you hate me [dig it up and tear it down]
Dig it up and hold me out
Fuck me like you hate me [dig it up, tear it down]
I love the sound when you come undone

Fuck me like you hate me [fuck me like you hate me]
Fuck me like you hate me [you'll never break me]
Fuck me like you hate me [dig it up, tear it down]
You'll come around when you find me faceless
