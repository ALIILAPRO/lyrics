		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From what I've gathered you grew up nice and sheltered
With mama's pretty stories and your own made up furies
And mama gave me a magic clicker
Well yes, I think it's true and fair to say

C'mon in and listen, lost words you've been missing
Of the fire you're bearing, the eye of the darkness, your light

So you were drawn to stories early on
My dreams would light up my imagination
And you had nightmares night and day
Yeah, but with the clicker I chased those frights away
Who knew?
So true

So here is a clue of hope to remember
Visions they come true obeying the light switch too

Show me the Champion of Light
I'll show you the Herald of Darkness
Lost in a never ending night
Diving deep to the surface

And all your stories of crime and chilling thrillers
of hardboiled killers became bestsellers
It was all too much, I had to get away

The story's the end all, a piece of true fiction
Made meaningless in the face of creation

But there is more to it than meets the eye
I never meant for it to ruin my life that way

Would you say you lived a jaded lie
Dark shades could never save the day
So sad,
But true

Fighting the nightmares, torch and a light switch
A gift or a curse, a reality made of dreams

Show me the Champion of Light...

He could write a new story like Tom Zane before him
And maybe they'd be happy once again
Just one shot, one more chance for him to save their marriage
Away from the city, a romantic getaway

Still he's the torch bearer and it couldn't be much clearer
A war needs its warrior, true and right
But the darkness within him held her hostage
Had he seen her drowning, would have save her from the darkness of the lake

Show me the Champion of Light...

Such a Dark Place? Am I trapped in here
Is this real? I cannot remember
There was a manuscript it held a key
A vicious cycle I must not surrender to

Echo scenes to seek out
Again and again
Until I figure it out
To bring this song to its end

Show me the Champion of Light...
