		  Probably demons
Who's the present
Cold is going through the veins
Hurting sharp oh my god
God just have killed the brain

Probably demons
Who's the present
Cold is going through the veins
Hurting sharp oh my god
God just have killed the brain

Hold trip hold trip
People watch around
Just a go (trip) go (trip)
People watch around
Hold trip hold trip
People watch around
Just a go (trip) go (trip)
People watch around

Probably demons
Who's the present
Cold is going through the veins
Hurting sharp oh my god
God just have killed the brain

Probably demons
Who's the present
Cold is going through the veins
Hurting sharp oh my god
God just have killed the brain

Hold trip hold trip
People watch around
Just a go (trip) go (trip)
People watch around
Hold trip hold trip
People watch around
Just a go (trip) go (trip)
People watch around
