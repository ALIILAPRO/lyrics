		  Come on, girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I've got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast, you know they never last, no, no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart, but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not
Express yourself
Express himself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not
Express yourself
