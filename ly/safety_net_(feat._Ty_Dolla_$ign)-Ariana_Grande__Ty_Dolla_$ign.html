		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you're really something, yeah
How we get here so damn fast?
Only you could tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I'd feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track

I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind

Tripping, falling with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net

Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl
It's time for you to play your part now
You know, we hit that jewelry store and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fall outs
Get some ice on you girl, let it thaw out
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day

I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind

Tripping, falling with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net

Every time you feel some way, feel the way
Never let me run away, run away
Baby, every time you feel some way, feel the way
Never let me run away, run away

Girl you got me tripping, falling with no safety net (baby)
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head? (Is it all in my head)
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net
