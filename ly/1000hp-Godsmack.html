		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time to rewind
Back to 1995 when we were nothing
Walking through the streets of Boston no one listening
No one caring about the empty rooms we played
Until they all showed up one for one day
Then we turned our stage and everything changed

Turn that shit out louder
Make it all go faster
Playing through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower

Under lights now
Playing to the masses everything feels right
Taking state by state by country over night
Living in a shelter and every fight
Seeing millions of people Rage
When we take our stage, everybody scream

Turn that shit out louder
Make it all go faster
Playing through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower, yeah

Turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up feel the alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up feel the alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up feel the alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up feel the alive, yeah

Turn that shit out louder
Make it all go faster
Playing through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower

Turn that shit out louder
Make it all go faster
Playing through the witching hour
Take it to one thousand horsepower
