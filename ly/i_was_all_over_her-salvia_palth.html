		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know what I wanted, I have a memory
Back at that party, I was all over her
We didn't make out or do anything
I just remember I was lonely

I guess I am always, it's not a problem
It's just something, I got used to it
Every stranger makes me feel safer
And every person seems more beautiful
