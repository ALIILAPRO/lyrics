		  Grrah
Gang-gang-gang
I'm not a cop, I'm not a cop
Grrah
Mabu
Yeah, I woke up this morning and put on my fit
On some typical white boy shit
Khakis and white socks, black kicks
I ain't sleepin' 14-hundred bands
Tan, cos, it's a sin, I was up all night studyin' trig'
Took my exam, and said bye to my clique
I wonder if Mr. Smith knows I'm lit
I wonder if Mr. T knows that I keep a stick
In my pencil case, I got a grip
Keep it on me even when I piss
Head on a swivel like moms with they kids
Yes, I keep it on me when I'm pissin'
One in the head in case my opps dissin'
If I have a bad day, and I'm missin', got some extra ammunition
Got a Carti' on my wrist, got a Rollie on my left
I got friends that'll switch, I'm just waitin' 'til they step, step
I got a TEC in a tech, haha, so don't make me upset
You're just losin' money in the street
Dice, cards, you can't bet on yourself
I just want the money, give a- about the fame
Wasn't with me in the rain, then she cannot be my main
I don't like her attitude, she do it for her gang
I'm married to the game, only hundreds on my-, grrah
They like, "Mabu, you cappin' in your rap?"
How you know what I did?
Slide through the T's, and I'm yellin' out, "Poop Gz, " I really rap what I did
If he cap about buyin' a feature, I load up his balance, and switch out his SIM
Yes, I know I'm a kid, yes
But tell me I'm cappin', I'm poppin' your lid
They say Mabu's a industry plant, haha, are you dumb, or you high?
3.14159265 guns, be ready to die
I just bodied a beat while recitin' pi, huh, your life is a lie
Try to set me up on a hit with a chick, huh, I'm cuttin' that line
Goodbye
Grrah-grrah
I'm not a cop, I'm not a cop-cop-cop
Was about time they know who runnin' this shit, grrah
Gang-gang-gang
