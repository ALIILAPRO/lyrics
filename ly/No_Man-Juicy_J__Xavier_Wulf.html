		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you crossed me, mane (I keep a lot heat, lot of heat)
It's like (I keep a lot heat, lot of heat)
You know (I keep a lot heat, lot of heat)
Fuck you for life (I keep a lot heat, lot of heat)
Yeah (Hitkidd, what it do, man?)

You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your ho
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your bro
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust the door man
You can't put your trust in no man
No man, no man, no man
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your ho
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your bro
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust the door man
You can't put your trust in no man
No man, no man, no man

I'm a hitter by myself, I don't need nobody else
I been killin' shit forever, I got bodies on my belt
You were swimmin' in the women, I was sinnin' in the women
Made a killin' with this pimpin', I was sinnin' for my wealth (yes, sir)
If you ain't from my hood, get the fuck from 'round here
Don't nobody from 'round here trust nobody from 'round here
Don't be askin' for no help, she not fuckin' with the help (no, sir)
I'm not hustlin' for my health
Money talk loud and clear, look here

You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your ho
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your bro
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust the door man
You can't put your trust in no man
No man, no man, no man
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your ho
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your bro
You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust the door man
You can't put your trust in no man
No man, no man, no man

I pull up just to see what's up
Whip came without the guts
Texas in my triple cup
I'm trippin' on a trip with her
See me how I live it up
I'm tangled up in diamond cuts
You see they lil' bubble butts
Jiggle when they walk with us (move, nigga)
Memphis nigga steppin', bitch, you never catch 'em punkin' us
They know they know better, boy, get killed in front your only son
Catch me out here smoking on some beef, I'll get you well done
Fuck nigga, I don't trust no bitch, I trust this dirty gun

You can't put your trust in no man (yeah)
You can't even trust your ho (trust your ho)
