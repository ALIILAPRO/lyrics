		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath I take
You're every step I make

And I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You'll always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And I
I'd play the fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
(No, you know I don't mind)
And yes
You mean the world to me
I know I've found in you
My endless love

And love
I'd play the fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
(Whoa, you know I don't mind)
Oh, yes
You'd be the only one
'Cause no, I can't deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love (my love, my love)
