		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You such a fucking ho, I love it
I know you like it more, I love it
I fuck her when I'm bored
Like Riley, she's a whore
I know you like it more, I love it
Like Riley, she's a whore, I love it

I know she like it furry, I'ma fly her like Aladdin
On her pussy, golden piercing, why she did it? 'Cause she Latin
What we do here is all discreet, if you ask me, I know nothing
She just jumping on my dick, I know she like it 'cause she Latin

You such a fucking ho, I love it
I know you like it more, I love it
I fuck her when I'm bored
Like Riley, she's a whore
I know you like it more, I love it
You such a fucking ho, oh
You such a fucking ho, oh

I know she like it furry, I'ma fly her like Aladdin
On her pussy, golden piercing, why she did it? 'Cause she Latin
What we do here is all discreet, if you ask me, I know nothing
She just jumping on my dick, I know she like it 'cause she Latin

You such a fucking ho, I love it
I know you like it more, I love it
I fuck her when I'm bored
Like Riley, she's a whore
I know you like it more, I love it
Like Riley, she's a whore, I love it

You such a fucking ho, I love it
I know you like it more, I love it
I fuck her when I'm bored
Like Riley, she's a whore
I know you like it more, I love it
You suck a fu-

I know she like it furry, I'ma fly her like Aladdin
On her pussy, golden piercing, why she did it? 'Cause she Latin
What we do here is all discreet, if you ask me, I know nothing
She just jumping on my dick, I know she like it 'cause she Latin
