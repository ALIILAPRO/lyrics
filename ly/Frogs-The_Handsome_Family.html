		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever seen a fish leap up from a quiet stream
Shine a moment in the light then fall away again?
Have you seen it, sister, will you come outside and see?
Have you ever seen the rain turn the earth to mud
And watched the mud turn gold in the rising sun?
Have you seen it, brother, will you come outside and see?
Will you go with me tonight down to the lowland fields
To hear the frogs singing, the air so hot and still?
Will you go, sister, will you go with me tonight?

Down in the flooded fields the earth is wet and dark
Down in the flooded fields beneath the falling stars
Lie down in the dirt, brother, be a mirror to the night
Lie down in the dirt, sister, we are mirrors of the night
