		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm trying to go forward
I'm trying to forget
Our time inside the bubble
The hours that we spent

But, lover
You made me feel like no other
Touching me deeper than others
Making me feel I was wanted

Like elongated shadows
The days will never end
I'm looking at your number
I wonder, should I dare?

Oh, my lover
You made me feel like no other
Touching me deeper than others
Making me feel I was wanted

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm looking at your number
I wonder, should I dare?
I know I shouldn't bother
I know it isn't fair

Oh, my lover
You made me feel like no other
Touching me deeper than others
Making me feel I was wanted

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm looking at your number
I wonder, should I dare?
I know I shouldn't bother
I know it isn't fair

Oh, my lover
Oh, my lover
