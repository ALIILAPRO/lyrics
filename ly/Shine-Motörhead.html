		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard time getting to ya babe,
Double take, figure real rough trade,
But you know I'm a real good lover,
Can't judge a book by its cover,
I know and you know I know,
Can't trust your intuition no more

Look good and I make you smile,
Bet you thought I wouldn't have no style,
I'm gonna turn your head around,
Won't know 'til you hit the ground,
Gonna change the way you feel,
I'm gonna roll you like a wheel

High life, I'm a fool for you,
Low life, I like to break the rules,
First bite, you know I got a taste for you,
I'm gonna make you shine

Be a switch to say the least,
My beauty gonna meet your beast,
Comin' over and shake your tree,
My body's gonna set you free,
I know and you know it's true,
Move over I'm coming through

It's all over and I got you down,
Gonna chase you round and round,
Mess around with the way I feel,
Gonna offer you a whole new deal,
Gonna lay it on ya just for kicks,
Down on ya like a ton of bricks
