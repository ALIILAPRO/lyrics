		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I begin to understand you
I feel lost and out of air to breathe
And if I could comprehend what you've been through
I'd see the world through eyes adept in deceit

It's you and me now
On the rebound out
And you say
You love me now
You won't leave out loud
I know you're only
Trying to spare me the pain somehow
It's you and me now
On the rebound out

You say I'm a mess, you say I'm selfish
But all I ever wanted was your love
And still we try when all feels helpless
I guess that I was never enough

It's you and me now
On the rebound out
And you say
You love me now
You won't leave out loud
I know you're only
Trying to spare me the pain somehow
It's you and me now
On the rebound out

Another moment
Another moment
Another moment
All I've asked of you
Another moment
Another moment
Another moment
There's nothing left to do

It's you and me now
On the rebound out
(on the rebound, on the rebound out)
And you say
You love me now
You won't leave out loud
(You wont leave)
I know you're only
Trying to spare me the pain somehow
It's you and me now
On the rebound out

Rebound out
