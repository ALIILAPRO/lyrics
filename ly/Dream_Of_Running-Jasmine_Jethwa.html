		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't believe you, 
Not anymore, 
Cause whenever I believed you it hurt me more, 

I got no questions, 
For you now, 
Your answer's like an arrow that shoots me down,

I turn the radio up when you're getting me down,
Oh if I could escape I'd be out of this town, 
Before you'd even, knew I'd gone 

But it's easy to say, 
And it's harder to do,
Like a bird in a cage with a beautiful view, 
I can't tell your lies from truth 

And oh what have I done, 
Falling in love with somebody like you,
If I drive 105 maybe by morning I'll be good, 

You say a little too late, 
You're ready to change but it's nothing new, 
So I, dream of running 

Your sweet illusion, 
Is fading away,
And the shadows just remind me of better days, 

I turn the radio up when you play on my mind, 
Oh if I could escape I'd be leaving tonight, 
Before you'd even, knew I'd gone 

But it's easy to say, 
And it's harder to do,
Like a bird in a cage with a beautiful view, 
I can't tell your lies from truth 

And oh what have I done, 
Falling in love with somebody like you,
If I drive 105 maybe by morning I'll be good, 

You say, a little too late, 
You're ready to change but it's nothing new, 
So I, dream of running, 

Dream of running
Dream of running
Ooo oooo I know I'm dreaming of, I'm dreaming of
Dream of running
