		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

I've been through a lot in life
I lived, I loved
Distanced from it all
I view myself from above
Roaming in the fields of hope
Will it make or break me?
'Cause my dreams are heavy
They outweigh you and me

Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

You're, you're, you're not alone
You're, you're, you're not alone
(Will it make or break me?)
You're, you're, you're not alone
You're, you're, you're not alone

Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to hell

Oh my God, who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil

(Oh my God)

I've been through a lot in life
I lived, I loved
Distanced from it all
I view myself from above
Roaming in the fields of hope
Will it make or break me?
'Cause my dreams are heavy
They outweigh you and me

(Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God)
