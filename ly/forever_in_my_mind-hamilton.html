		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moonlight
The moon has never been so bright
In my feelings every night
Fuck any vibe that don't feel right
Say I
Don't mind
You could get cause you're pretty fine
But it don't mean that I won't have you crying 
I'm tired of you hitting my line

Young boy I'll put you in your place
I am not no player in this game
Stupid girl be giving stupid brain
If I'm bugging it's Mary Jane
Stay longer you might become my main
I could be a saint but i ain't 
Nah

Running like the blood is in my veins right now 
I got too many gold chains on my neck I lost count
Speaking with the demons in my head and made a vow 
Feeling alone even though I'm in a crowd 

Running like the blood is in my veins right now 
I got too many gold chains on my neck I lost count
Speaking with the demons in my head and made a vow 
Feeling alone even though I'm in a crowd 
Yeah
Feeling alone even though I'm in a crowd
Ah mm mm mm mm
Mm mm

Blue skies
The clouds become on what you fantasies 
You can be whatever you'd like
Just don't get too deceived by your mind
Like I
Know that it hurts inside girl
Trust me I've been through it all in my world
Cause when your heart freezing up too cold
Out came the smo-o-oke (Yeah)

You know I read you like a page 
Try to make my soul just sail away 
If you're reading this it's too late 
I got more shit on my plate 
Me and you was just another day
Same new me but you will never change 

Running like the blood is in my veins right now 
I got too many gold chains on my neck I lost count
Speaking with the demons in my head and made a vow 
Feeling alone even though I'm in a crowd
