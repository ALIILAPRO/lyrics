Champion

I'm a savage, I'm a fighter
Making noise in these streets
Haymakers like a fire
Throwing hooks to a beat

Got my finger on my pulse, it's steady
I was built for the speed
Automatic, shift gears, I'm ready
Headstrong I believe

When I close my eyes and count to ten
All I feel's the adrenaline
And when the pain begins to set
All I hear is

Long live the champion
Long live the champion

Call me names, call me reckless
Crash through like a storm
Filled with fury, I'm relentless
Like a soldier at war

Doesn't matter if the world is shaking
I don't flinch, not a sound
And when everyone around is breaking
I'm a stone in the ground

When I close my eyes and count to ten
All I feel's the adrenaline
And when the pain begins to set
All I hear is

Long live the champion
Long live the champion
Long live the champion
Long live the champion

When I close my eyes and count to ten
All I feel's the adrenaline
And when the pain begins to set
All I hear is
(All I hear is, all I hear is, all I hear is)

Long live the champion
Long live the champion
Long live the champion
Long live the champion
