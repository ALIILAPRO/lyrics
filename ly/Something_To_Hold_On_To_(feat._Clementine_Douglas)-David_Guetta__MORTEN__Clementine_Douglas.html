		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Throw me a line, feel like I'm drownin'
Summertime never felt so cold
Tryna survive in this ocean without you, oh

Give me somethin' to hold on to
Can't be in this love without you
Come and save me like you used to
Give me somethin', give me somethin'

Oh, I need you
Give me somethin', give me somethin'
Oh, I need you
Give me somethin' to hold on to

Give me somethin' to hold on to

Oh, I need you
Give me somethin', give me somethin'
Oh, I need you
Give me somethin' to hold on to

Don't say goodbye now that I found you
Love in your eyes, never seen you so cold
Tryna survive in this moment without you, oh

Give me somethin' to hold on to (hold on)
Can't be in this love without you
Come and save me like you used to (oh, like you used to)
Give me somethin', give me somethin' (oh)

Give me somethin', give me somethin'
Give me somethin' to hold on to

Oh, I need you
Give me somethin', give me somethin'
Oh, I need you
Give me somethin' to hold on to
