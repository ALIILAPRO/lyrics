		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody knows
Everybody knows that I'm coming for you tough
I'm coming for you tough

Everybody knows
Everybody knows that I'm coming for you tough
I'm coming for you tough

Are you scared?
Don't you run now, welcome to the fun house
Tossed my emotions so here's the commotion
It feels good to hold the knife, cut me out just right
Revenge and a kiss, 'cause baby I'm a snitch

Hush hush hush
You know I'm coming for you tough tough tough
I need your word in a rush rush rush
You better take cover, there's a quiet storm
Hush hush hush
You know I'm coming for you tough tough tough
I need your love in a rush rush rush
You better take cover, there's a quiet storm

Everybody knows
Everybody knows that I'm coming for you tough
I'm coming for you tough

Everybody knows
Everybody knows that I'm coming for you tough
I'm coming for you tough

You won't get saved, hold your breath it's okay
'Cause your drowning in the days, I'm gonna shake you up
It's gonna be fun, I got a little something
Sure there be some pain, I'll be happy again

Hush hush hush
You know I'm coming for you tough tough tough
I need your word in a rush rush rush
You better take cover, there's a quiet storm
Hush hush hush
You know I'm coming for you tough tough tough
I need your love in a rush rush rush
You better take cover, there's a quiet storm

Don't you say one more thing to me
Won't you shut it up, you can't explain

Hush hush hush
You know I'm coming for you tough tough tough
I need your word in a rush rush rush
You better take cover, there's a quiet storm
Hush hush hush
You know I'm coming for you tough tough tough
I need your love in a rush rush rush
You better take cover, there's a quiet storm
