		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To be lost in the forest
To be cut adrift
You've been trying to reach me
You bought me a book
To be lost in the forest
To be cut adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid

To be lost in the forest
To be cut adrift
You've been trying to reach me
You bought me a book
To be lost in the forest
To be cut adrift
I've been paid, I've been weighed, I've been

Don't get offended if I seem absent minded
Just keep telling me facts and keep making me smile
And don't get offended if I seem absent minded
I get tongue-tied
Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never know what's good for me
Baby, you've got to be more demanding
I will be yours

I'll pay for you
Anytime

I'll pay for you
Anytime

And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
We'll jump right on, surely, and gorge away
And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness (jump right)

Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never know what's good for me and
Baby, you've got to be more demanding (jump left)

What are you holding out for?
What's always (in the way?)
Why so damn absent minded?
Why so scared (of romance?)

This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me

This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me

Do you want to come over and kill some time?
Do you want to come over and kill some time?
Do you want to come over and kill some time?

Throw your arms around me
