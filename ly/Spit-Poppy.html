		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coward

Spit
I think I'll spit
Spit

For all those girls who speak contradictions
The guy who crept through the shadows every day
To clutch his own conclusion
To watch all the blood as it drips from your veins
You coward, godspeed
May your death come quickly
(May your death come quickly)

I think I'll 
Take this hate and spit
Spit
Spit

Now as it's passed on to the next one
I feel the bloodrush come right over me
You know you will never be right
In the eyes of the ones who know
You trusted the devil
She will betray you

Why do I get shit all the time from you men? 
You are swine
You think dick is the answer
But it's not
Why do I get shit all the time from you men? 
You are swine
You think dick is the answer
But it's not

Spit
Spit
Spit
