		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (CÃ¡ssio) Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh (yeah)

This is your time
Don't get that much time with me (get that much time)
This is your time (uh-huh), come speak your mind to me
Don't wa-wa-waste it (waste it, waste it)
Don't wa-wa-waste it (waste it, ohh-oh)

This is your time (yeah), don't get that much time with me
This is your time, come speak your mind to me
Don't wa-wa-waste it 
But you wanna wa-wa-waste it (oh)

It's the truth, ain't nothin' new
You lying on me, you think that I am foolish
Made a right to the hills (hills)
And I ain't comin' down 'til it's Monday (yeah)
You roll it tight, smoker's delight (yeah)
And I won't let the drama kill my vibe, yeah (no)
When it's real, don't need no fix
It's always complicated when you here

Just got over it (oh-oh)
It's that obvious (it's that obvious)
You're sorry that you missed these words, yeah we take that (yeah)
But you wanna waste my time like you made that

Girl, this is your time
Don't get that much time with me (get that much time)
This is your time (uh-huh), come speak your mind to me
Don't wa-wa-waste it (waste it)
Don't wa-wa-waste it (waste it, ohh-oh)

This is your time (yeah)
Don't get that much time with me (get that much time)
This is your time, come speak your mind to me
Don't wa-wa-waste it 
But you wanna wa-wa-waste it

I had to do a shimmy-shimmy-yeah-dy (shimmy-shimmy)
You like it when I pull up in that Audi (skrrt)
I got wax on top of wax, Mr. Miyagi ('Yagi)
I might pull up in that Porsche, it's looking froggy (froggy)
I got Eliantte ice and now I'm glidin' (Eliantte)
I got two hoes in my Jeep, they doin' powdy (yessir)
I got two big racks on me
High as I can be

Just got over it
It's that obvious (it's that obvious)
You're sorry that you missed these words, yeah we take that (yeah)
But you wanna waste my time like you made that

Girl, this is your time
Don't get that much time with me (get that much time)
This is your time (uh-huh), come speak your mind to me
Don't wa-wa-waste it (waste it)
Don't wa-wa-waste it (waste it, ohh-oh)

This is your time (yeah)
Don't get that much time with me (get that much time)
This is your time, come speak your mind to me
Don't wa-wa-waste it 
But you wanna wa-wa-waste it
