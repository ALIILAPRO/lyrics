		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah they tried to stop me
Imma roll a fronto up in this brown leaf

Yeah they tried to stop me
Imma roll a fronto up in this brown leaf
Smokedope, imma smoke till im dying
White hoes snorting coke, and they trying
Trying new drugs new pills
Green mud they can't get enough
Yeah they can't get enough
Yeah they can't get enough
Yeah they tried to stop me
Imma roll a fronto up in this brown leaf
White hoes in my condo movin so slow
Pink lines of the molly in her nose nose
Bluе pills and them 30 bangs
For the fuckin gang we bе tweakin all night
Yeah we not the same yeah we not the same
Yeah we not the same

Faygo red bottom like my shoes is
I don't care if my conscience is
Clear if the vew is in this cup
It can make me pause like i'm music
30 hanging out that grahh
This Glock got a pool stick
With the high ceilings i just bought a high
Its just me and my bitch we
Gon stay in for the night
When i was 16 i would die for this life
Now i'd trade it in a moment just
To get a peace of mind
I was shoppin in the Saks left
A piece of me behind
This little pink pill take the
Pain from my spine
Gotta pay me for the photo
Lobster steak shrimp in the
In the rearview you were drivin so slow

You can barely catch up

Yeah they tried to stop me
Imma roll a fronto up in this brown leaf
White hoes in my condo movin so slow
Pink lines of the molly in her nose nose
Blue pills and them 30 bangs
For the fuckin gang we be tweakin all night
Yeah we not the same
