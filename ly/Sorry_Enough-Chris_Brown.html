		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, sorry, I wanna love you
Don't want too many bad decisions
No
Sorry, I wanna love you
It wasn't my intentions, girl, to hurt you
No way

Said you need space from me
I never felt love but it feels like I'm falling (falling, falling, huh, yeah)
I know you got niggas on your line callin' (callin', callin')
Them niggas never gon' put their all in (all in, all in)

I can't say sorry enough, enough
I can't go back in time, for you
I know it when we lovin' (ooh, love)
Believe in me again like I believe in you

I can't say sorry enough
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
I can't say sorry enough
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)

Shawty, I wanna fix it
Anything and everything
Whatever you tell me, baby, I'll be with it
Name somebody else who got you
Say their names and I'm up in it (uh)
And tell them girls that's with you
"Go ahead and mind your business"
Yeah (yeah)

Said you need space from me
I never felt love but it feels like I'm falling (falling, falling, huh, yeah)
I know you got niggas on your line callin' (callin', callin')
Them niggas never gon' put they all in (all in, all in)

I can't say sorry enough, enough (sorry, baby)
I can't go back in time, for you (ooh, for you)
I know it when we lovin' (when we lovin', ooh, love, ooh)
Believe in me again like I believe in you

So I can't say sorry enough, enough (I'm sorry, baby)
(Sorry, I wanna love you) huh, ooh
(Sorry, I wanna love you) ooh
I can't say sorry enough ooh, baby
(Sorry, I wanna love you) oh
(Sorry, I wanna love you) ooh, ooh

Ooh, baby, tell me what you want
I done done 'bout everything
Buried all those parts of me
Ooh, let me find the remedy
It's clear that you're not over me
It's clear that I'm not over you
How many times will it take for me to say, "I'm sorry" to you, baby?

I can't say sorry enough, enough
I can't go back in time, for you
I know it, when we lovin', who knows
Believe in me again like I believe in you

I can't say sorry enough
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
I can't say sorry enough
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)

(Love)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
